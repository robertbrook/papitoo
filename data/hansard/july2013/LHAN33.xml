that 18,940 learners participating on an apprenticeship programme
self-declared that they had dyslexia. They had a success rate of 72.6%
compared to 76.4% overall. All apprenticeships are stretching and
prepare individuals for sustained employment. Dyslexia should not
present an insuperable barrier to those candidates who demonstrate
competence and commitment in their chosen field. Access to Work and
additional learning support are two possible sources of funding to help
provide equipment or other assistance for apprentices with

Addington:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for that Answer. The
fact remains that dyslexia is a problem that affects people
in reading and writing, that a written assessment is made at the end of
an apprenticeship, and assistive technology, which is made available to
those in the university sector, is not allowed to be used. Bearing that
in mind, will my noble friend give me an assurance that this situation
will be changed and reviewed in the immediate
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T15:07:47"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071071000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0001.htm#13071071000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Garden of Frognal" PimsId="5266" UID="13071071000337" xid="1973" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0001.htm#13071071000337">Baroness
Garden of Frognal:</Member></B> As my noble friend knows very well, new
assistive technology is advancing at a very rapid rate, with apps and
packages such as Prismo, Livescribe, Dragon and others. Dyslexia
affects different people in different ways. Some solutions will suit
some people, while other solutions will suit others. If it would be
helpful, I will ask officials to set up a meeting with stakeholders,
which would include the British Dyslexia Association and the Adult
Dyslexia Organisation, to help to ensure that compatibility with
assistive technology is considered when tests and other assessments are
developed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T15:08:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071071000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0001.htm#13071071000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Whitaker" PimsId="4578" UID="13071071000338" xid="1494" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0001.htm#13071071000338">Baroness

developmental dyslexia is the commonest and best known of the specific

learning difficulties such as developmental dyspraxia—serious

in calculating and the use of numbers? Is it not the case that people

of disabilities which can provide hurdles to young people embarking on
apprenticeships. The National Apprenticeship Service looks at different
ways of supporting diversity within apprenticeships and we recently
commissioned a study from Peter Little to look at accessibility. We are
implementing an action plan as a result of his report and he himself
will help us to implement

the United Kingdom encourage young boys and girls to take up

apprenticeships as a career path for people while they are at school,

was developing very fast and offered to get the interested
parties together to see whether we can find a way forward with that. On
the subject of dyslexic apprentices, I point out that the apprentice
of the year is a dyslexic woman called Emma Rogers, who

dyslexia and other forms of disability, it is becoming part of the
teacher training programme, and teachers are very much more aware of
trying to recognise the signs at an early point, when more help can be
given to children, rather than, as so often happened in the past and
can still happen, leaving it undiagnosed until pupils are quite
advanced in the educational process. Schools have different ways of
dealing with it, and by and large we get very good reports of good

valid point. The apprenticeships we have been focusing on particularly
are the ones for the younger age group. However, apprenticeships are
certainly available for adults, and are being taken up in rather larger
numbers by adults than they are by younger people. The possibilities

a successful outcome at the forthcoming Geneva conference. A negotiated
political settlement remains the best way in which to end the current
bloodshed. The US, Russia and the UN are working intensively on the
details of the conference; it is inevitable that there will be

Given the failure of the G8 summit to agree a date for the start of the
Geneva 2 talks, does the Minister think on reflection that it was a
mistake for the Government to spend the run-up to the G8 raising the
volume on the possibility of the UK arming the Syrian rebels? Does she
agree that it would be damaging for the prospects of an international
peace conference if the Government were to repeat the mistake in the

matter by responding to the situation on the ground. I do not think
that they can be criticised for actually responding to it and
encouraging agreement when we think that it is possible. The countries
that we are trying to get agreement between—the US and Russia,
with the UN of course playing a facilitating role—are all
committed to Geneva 2 and to a transitional executive authority that
would be in accordance with the wishes of the Syrian people. It was
right, in the run-up to the G8, to get as much agreement as possible,
and it continues to be right to continue to push Russia and the US to
come to an agreement to bring the coalition and the regime around the

it will also be critical to the success of the conference to have

alignment with Iran, is actually rather independent. Lebanon is a

more arms and waiting until then to strengthen its negotiating

humanitarian appeal ever has been launched as a result of the situation
in Syria. The United Kingdom has made the largest
contribution it has ever made to a single humanitarian
appeal—£350 million. Indeed, the Secretary of State for
International Development 
<?notus-xml column=272?>was in Lebanon earlier this week pledging further support for Syrian
refugees in Lebanon. The long-term solution is to resolve the political
situation on the ground so that these people are allowed to return.
There are more than 4 million people displaced within Syria and 1.7
million displaced outside it. There is no conceivable way, even as an
international community, that we could meet the housing needs of that
many people. The solution has to be to create the climate for them to

Syria or anyone else in the long run, but we need to be realistic about
it. There is a reluctance to set a date because the regime wants to

underestimates what has been achieved. The late-night levy has been
introduced. The early morning alcohol restriction order, which was
created under the previous Government but not commenced, has been
commenced by us and we have sought to rebalance the licensing
arrangements so that the ability of individuals in the vicinity to

disappointing Answer and point out that President-elect Rouhani was not
only elected by a clear majority on the first ballot of the Iranian
people but had a majority of more than 12 million people over his
nearest rival, the mayor of Tehran. In the past week, he has not only
called for the clergy to cease to interfere in the private lives of
Iranians and called upon Iranian state television and radio to address
Iran’s problems much more honestly and fairly, but has also said

One of those was only 15 at the time of their arrest and some of these
executions were mass ones, with as many as 21 being executed at the

Leader Khamenei still has a huge amount of influence in many spheres of
life in Iran. She is right to say that the human rights situation in
Iran is dire. In 2012 there were reports of over 350
executions and 162 executions as of May this year. It has more
journalists in prison than almost any other country. Opposition leaders
remain detained in prison after two years. We have real human rights
and other concerns in Iran. We are open to improving this relationship,
and there have been opportunities when officials have met, such as

the one thing that I and most of us who have been involved in foreign
policy realise is that the situation is never black or white. There are
always many grey areas, as is the case here. The new president has made
some positive remarks, but it is important that they are translated
into action. However, I can assure my noble friend and other noble
Lords that we have contact with the Iranians. For example, last year at
the Heart of Asia conference, as part of the discussions on
Afghanistan, the Foreign Secretary met Foreign Minister Salehi in the
margins of the meeting. There are therefore opportunities for
discussions to take place, even at the highest level. However, in terms
of restarting diplomatic relations and having an embassy—which,
let us not forget, was ransacked in 2011 and where our officials and
staff came under attack—it is important that we do so

the face of it, about pensions, but it is also about equal treatment of
the ones we love. This is the only point in the Bill where we treat
same-sex couples who get married prejudicially when compared with
opposite-sex couples. All married couples should be treated equally. It
is a principle that we have fought throughout the Bill to maintain. I
know that it is a principle that the noble Baronesses, Lady Stowell of
Beeston and Lady Northover, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Wallace of Tankerness, have defended. It is something that the majority
of this House, regardless of party affiliation, has defended. If we let
this clause go through as it is, it will be the first and only time
that we breach that principle. Let me explain why.</hs_para>

woman and was a member of an occupational pension scheme and died, my
wife would be entitled to a survivor’s pension from my

and died, my partner’s survivor’s pension benefit would
be backdated only to 2005, the date on which we introduced civil
partnerships.</hs_para>

inequality in the Civil Partnership Act and applies it to same-sex
marriages, instead of taking the position of opposite-sex couples and
equalising the pension arrangements. In effect, that means that 
<?notus-xml column=279?>same-sex couples are treated as civil partners for those schemes. That
might be necessary if there was a huge cost to the public purse, given
that we are in difficult economic times. However, let me make it clear
in absolute terms that no public money is required to make
this change. I will repeat that, because the Government may
try to imply that there would be: no public money is
required to make this change. If I am wrong, I am more than happy for
the Minister to explain why. The cost is to private occupational
pension schemes; that is in Bill. The Government’s estimate puts
the maximum additional cost at approximately £80 million for
those private schemes. By their own admission, that is a
drop in the ocean, given the size of those pension funds.</hs_para>

that this is wrong. In 2005 the Government changed the rules of their
own pension scheme for civil partnership survivor benefits, because it
felt wrong to them to apply this principle to public service pensions.
Equally, two-thirds of the private occupational pension schemes in this
country believe that it is wrong and have changed their policy. We
heard from the spiritual Benches that the Church of England has changed
its pension scheme arrangements to reflect this. Why, therefore, let
one-third of occupational pension schemes discriminate against married
couples in the future only on the basis of sexual orientation? It is
worth mentioning that, in order to qualify, the scheme member will have
to have fully paid up towards the scheme. That requires a private
occupational pension fund to disregard the contributions made prior to
2005 to stop the survivor’s benefit coming through.</hs_para>

unforeseen implications,”; or, secondly, “Even though

that someone could take a case that might lead to the possibility that
we might at some time have to equalise pensions for men and

£2 billion, £3 billion or £4 billion—the

do with gender equalisation of pensions, not occupational pension
schemes—but noble Lords Lordships will be so bored and confused

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> My Lords, as in Committee, I am pleased
to support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Alli.
As he has pointed out, the amendment represents a crucial opportunity
to ensure that the introduction of same-sex marriage in this country is
achieved with exactly the same basic benefits and insurance rights for
male/male and female/female as for male/female. If we do not address
this final discriminatory hurdle now, it will be several decades before
all gay couples achieve equality. For gay men and women, it will mean
decades of waiting as they continue to live with the reality that their
loved ones may not be provided for when they die; decades in which
individuals who have worked and contributed to their pensions, planned
and been prudent, are subject to the whim of employers and pension
providers, who may choose to pay a pittance in survivor benefits for no
other reason than the gender of their spouses. If we do not remove this
last remnant of historical injustice, the “second tier”
of marriage will continue in contradiction of all the calls for exactly
equal treatment that we have heard again and again over the past few
days in your Lordships’ Chamber.</hs_para>

Atlantic may help to illustrate the point. Two weeks ago, in the
landmark case of United States v Windsor, the Supreme Court considered
the case of Edith Windsor and her spouse and partner of 44 years, Thea.
They lived together in New York, a state which recognises same-sex
marriages, and when Thea died in 2009 she left her entire estate to
Edith. Had they been a heterosexual couple, Edith would have inherited
the entire estate tax free. However, US federal law prevents their
marriage being recognised for the purpose of inheritance tax and Edith
was hit with a bill for $363,053. The Supreme Court found the law to be
unconstitutional. A key plank in its reasoning was that the treatment
of Edith and others like her had the effect of creating a separate
sub-set of legal marriages that were treated less favourably. To use
the words of Justice
Kennedy,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13071071000298" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0001.htm#13071071000298">“it

this amendment. After two such full speeches by the noble Lord, Lord
Alli, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, it would be a
waste of your Lordships’ time for me to say anything more than
that I agree with both of them, but I also believe in the art of the

or some form of it, will be agreed by the Government, because in that

Noakes:</Member></B> My Lords, my heart is completely with Amendment 84
in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Alli, but I have trouble in my head
to completely agree with the amendment, mainly because we are opposing
a retrospective burden without any evidence of what that impact might
be. I completely understand the case for the individuals who are
affected. We do not know where the cost will actually be borne. The
cost is low overall, but it is not correct to compare it to the amount
of assets under management, as was done in Committee, because the
instance might be in very small pension schemes. It might be the
instance of a relatively small scheme with a relative small number of
members, one highly paid member with a civil partner—or married
in a same-sex couple—who is very much younger. That would have a
very disproportionate impact on the actuarial valuation of the
liabilities in that small scheme, which could be a charity or a small
business. I would be much more comfortable if we knew what the impact
was. We may still, knowing the impact, go ahead, and that is why I
strongly support Amendment 84A but have a little difficulty with
Amendment 84.</hs_para>

Higgins:</Member></B> My Lords, like my noble friend who has just
spoken, I, too, have serious reservations about this amendment. Indeed,
I am opposed to it. I take that view in the light of
experience—some eight or nine years on the Front Bench on work
and pensions and as a former chairman of a pretty large company pension
scheme. This amendment would effectively remove the discretion of the
trustees to exercise their powers in a way that is favourable or
unfavourable to a particular group of people in the pension scheme. We
do not know the exact cost, although the noble Lord, Lord Alli, put it
at £80 million. I leave it to my noble friend on the Front Bench
to say what the effect would be on public finances but the reality is
that this would affect a number of pension
funds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071071000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0001.htm#13071071000089">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T15:55:28"></hs_TimeCode>
have to look at this in context. If there was one individual disaster,
more than any other of Gordon Brown’s time as Chancellor of the
Exchequer, it was the change that he made to the taxation of company
pensions towards the beginning of the Labour Government. The result
has, undoubtedly, been the decimation of final salary pension schemes
and a transfer to defined contribution schemes. Either way, we have
seen the finances of pension funds seriously deteriorating and, in many
cases, funds giving up the final salary scheme or giving it up as far
as new members are
concerned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071071000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0001.htm#13071071000090">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T15:59:29"></hs_TimeCode>
the noble Lord pointed out, a number of trustees have gone along with
what the amendment does. However, some have not, and we must leave them
the discretion. There may be good reasons why they have not, not least
financial ones. It may be that some scheme is tottering—as many
have been over the past 10 or 15 years—to the point
where it needs to be decided whether the scheme should be closed or
changed from a final salary to a defined benefit scheme and so on. It
is wrong retrospectively to put a charge on the funds in such a scheme,
to which the existing members are contributing but not the people
coming into the scheme.<I> </I>Indeed, if we were to accept the
amendment, we may find people in a same-sex marriage are brought into
the final salary part of the company scheme when others, in the defined
contribution part of the scheme, have not been allowed the same
benefits. That would, I think, be

should leave it to the overall discretion of the trustees. No doubt,
over time, it is likely that many more will create the

the trustees of the scheme—it is their responsibility—and
not retrospectively impose a cost on those schemes. That, I think,

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, throughout this debate, we have had to
say to groups and individuals who are very unhappy about this
legislation that, in the cause of equal marriage, they will have to
contain their unhappiness. We have said, for example, to
registrars—I use the example because I voted the other way in
that case—that they will have to accept the change in the
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071071000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0001.htm#13071071000093">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T15:59:29"></hs_TimeCode>

people who have been perfectly happy up to now start being concerned. I
hope that the right reverend Prelate will not be upset when I say 
<?notus-xml column=283?>that I remember, in the debates in the Synod of the Church of England,
that everybody was very happy until you started talking about money.
Once you talked about money, it was surprising how all kinds of other
issues were brought in. One of the things about pensions is that it can
be more expensive for people if they get married than if they do not.
Nobody goes around saying, “That is a pretty mean thing to do.
That means less for the rest of us”. That is not how a pension

perfectly acceptable for the Government to have the

thought through and it would be wrong to exclude that
possibility. However, I do not think that this House can say that, for
the time going forward, one sort of marriage will work in one way and
another will work in another way. After all, we opposed an amendment
that delicately pointed towards that by a majority of more than 200. It
seems to me that Mammon is getting into this, and Mammon should always
be very carefully considered before Mammon is allowed to win. I hope
that the Minister accepts at the very least that every effort will be
made to ensure that this Bill means what it says, which is equal

advised to make friends of both God and Mammon. In this context, we are
under the shadow of an enormous majority in the Second Reading debate,
in which the House accepted the principle of equality. In Committee, I
sought to apply that principle to the process of converting a civil
partnership into a marriage by requiring those undergoing that process
to swear an oath similar to that sworn by those getting married. I
withdrew it partly at the request of my noble friend on the Front Bench
and partly out of prudence in order to consider it before the next
stage, which is the current stage. My noble friend was ahead of me at
the Dispatch Box with an arrangement which comes just about to the same
place with regard to my marriage—or, rather, to my

cannot follow him so far. However, I am a man of principle, and I think
that we need to have equality through this Bill. Amendment 84A gives
the Government the power to pull out of this if necessary. I remind
them that, during the time that they are considering, reviewing and
consulting, they might go through the same reviews and consultations
with the insurers as they have done over, for instance, flooding. The
Government are used to talking to insurance companies and can at least
find out where the shoe pinches, and this amendment would allow them to
do so. I do not support the first amendment in this group, which locks

being forced to equalise the entitlements of widowers with widows, thus
levelling everyone back to 1978. But why they believe this to be a

1978/1988 distinction between widowers and widows was based on the
historic position of women as being largely dependent on their husbands
for income. Indeed, the courts have only recently upheld this
distinction in the case of R v Iain Cockburn and Secretary of State for
Health, where the judge ruled that there was an “objective and
reasonable justification” for this because there had been, as
the Government argued, a progressive realisation of gender equality and
the initial rules had been set up to recognise the weaker economic

distinction that the courts have so recently upheld. To argue against
this on the basis of retrospectivity is also flawed as the Government
violated this principle themselves when levelling civil partners back

one thing I am not in charge of is flooding. I would rather not add
that to my portfolio for now. Before I respond in detail to the debate,
I need to make a correction to the figures previously used by the
Government in debates on this issue, about the number of schemes using
the Equality Act exception relating to civil partners. The Government
had stated that two-thirds of private occupational pension schemes
already go further than the 2005 
<?notus-xml column=286?>exception. This is incorrect. The correct figure is one-third. However,
this does not change the estimated £18 million increase in

approach means that pension schemes take time to catch up with societal
changes, but over time the anomalies reduce and eventually disappear.
Making any change to the position set out in the Bill would mean
placing retrospective costs on the schemes. The Government understand

go through it properly. The two amendments in this group have different
effects, as we have already established. Amendment 84, moved by the
noble Lord, Lord Alli, would mean employers having to pay survivor
benefits to civil partners in respect of their deceased spouse’s
service prior to 2005, when civil partnerships first became possible.
This amendment does not meet what I believe the noble Lord is trying to
achieve, which is to give parity in provision of survivor benefits

equalisation of survivor benefits at a significant cost to schemes and

addition to its impact on private sector schemes, the amendment would
also impose a direct cost on public service schemes which would, at
least, have to pay survivor benefits to surviving female civil partners
based on pre-1988 service. This is because if the amendment were
passed, not paying benefits to surviving female civil partners based on
pre-1988 service would be discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:14:21"></hs_TimeCode>To
remove any such discrimination, public sector schemes would have to
equalise pension benefits for surviving female civil partners and
same-six married couples with those for widows which are based on
accruals from 1978. At the moment, benefits for those female survivors
are currently based on accruals from 1988. Therefore, there is an
immediate cost to the
taxpayer.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071071000319" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0001.htm#13071071000319">4.15

amendment would remove statutory provisions that mean it is not
discriminatory for occupational schemes to pay survivor benefits only
to civil partners based on the service of a deceased partner since
2005. It would also remove the provision in the Bill that extends this
exception to same-sex married couples. If the intention is not to alter
the existing arrangements that apply to civil partners but instead
ensure there is no discrimination between same-sex married people and
opposite-sex married people, Amendment 84 will not achieve that. It
would impact immediately on those occupational schemes that currently
make no provision for civil partners based on service prior to 2005. An
alternative approach—which may be what the noble Lord, Lord
Alli, would like to achieve—would be to equalise the position of
same-sex married couples with that of opposite-sex married couples.
However, there is significant uncertainty as to whether a change of
that kind would in fact have that result, given that the Government
would need to consider carefully whether different treatment of civil
partners and married same-sex couples in this regard would be capable
of
justification.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071071000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0001.htm#13071071000118">Further,
instances of inequality between men and women run through the pensions
system because—as I have explained—rights built up in the
past reflect the different social attitudes of those times. This means
there are pre-existing differences in treatment between men and women.
These differences mean that any change short of full equalisation would
deliver only partial equalisation; anything less could lead to new
gender discrimination arising in the schemes. Removal of the current
exception in the Equality Act would potentially lead to a much wider
range of discrimination claims against pension schemes. As I said,
there would be a significant risk of a domino effect leading to full
equalisation between widows and widowers across the public service
schemes, at a significant cost to the taxpayer. We do not know for
certain what the full costs of that domino effect would be but in 2011
the Government Actuary’s Department estimated the cost of
equalising survivor benefits for widows and widowers in the public
service schemes at between £3 billion and 
<?notus-xml column=288?>£4 billion. That gives an idea of the potential costs
to the taxpayer of full equalisation. It also indicates
why Governments—including the Government of the noble

I understand the concern that as regards pension benefits same-sex
married couples will be placed in a different position from

very carefully whether any departure from the established approach is
appropriate and what the costs and legal implications of any change
would be. It would be irresponsible of any Government to commit
themselves to potentially imposing significant costs on businesses and
the taxpayer without undertaking an assessment of the full scale of

Before I move on, I will add a few things. It took eight minutes before
all five of my responses were used. I mention that because this is a
very complex area—I accept that. However, there is a lot of
smoke here. The issue that most concerns me, and the reason why I
intervened, is that there is no public money. I say that having looked
very deeply into this issue. To those in Committee, I said that I had
the honour at the beginning of my career to be the publisher of
<I>Pensions</I> magazine, <I>Savings Market</I> and <I>Insurance
Age</I>. Therefore, I have spent time understanding the pensions
market. The £2 billion to £3 billion to which the
Government refer is about taking out the gender discrimination between
widows and widowers. Recent judgments have upheld that principle. It
has nothing to do with occupational pension
schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:25:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071071000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0001.htm#13071071000133">The
second correction that I wanted to make was on the issue about the
Civil Partnership Act and why it was put in place. Under the Civil
Partnership Act, 
<?notus-xml column=290?>there is no corresponding civil partnership for
straight people, so the read-across between opposite-sex couples and
same-sex couples did not apply with civil partnerships. In this
instance there is a read-across of a prejudicial treatment of two types
of married spouses. That is my concern.</hs_para>

final issue is that the cost is so minimal—£18
million at the low end and £80 million at the high end. The
actuarial assumptions are so hard to make. Actuaries, in my experience,
do not build the cost of gay people into their schemes. They do not
look at whether someone is straight or gay and discount the rate.
Historically, they do not go back and say, “Some gay people will
have married because history allowed them to do so or society forced
them to do so”. I am fairly sure that the actuarial calculations
will remain pretty static. Those are the issues

attacked—not attacked, but charmingly referred to—by the

really was not being jokey about adultery. I think that I am coming
back to my mother again on this. What is being proposed here is another
version of the amendments that we have had all along. This one says:
“We cannot find anything at the moment, but we might find
something in the future. So in case we do find something in the future,
we will put something in at the moment—and by the way, that
means that we can point to the thing that we put in at the moment,
which shows that there is a difference, and that is what we meant in
the first place”.

that this is one of the most ingenious attempts that we have had so
far. I do not think that they can do it again, but it is another go.
Even if it has been charmingly presented by the noble Lord with such
elegance and beautiful English, for which we all honour him, the fact

supporters of this amendment who did not speak but are distinguished
Members of your Lordships’ House, to see whether there are new
arguments to justify passing an amendment that would—like the

important to explain why this consent is needed, because some people
have questioned why the consent of a non-trans spouse is needed in
these circumstances. The reason is this: a party to a marriage
obtaining gender recognition is a life-changing decision for the

between a husband and a wife of the opposite legal gender, which is why
it is right that both spouses have the right to agree to a proposal to

spouse to commence proceedings to end the marriage before the full
gender recognition certificate is issued. I am very pleased to table
these amendments, which I hope will put it beyond any doubt that a

Gould of Potternewton:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by thanking the
Minister for her tolerance and forbearance throughout our discussions
on this very complex issue and for taking the time to meet me and the
noble Baronesses, Lady Thornton and Lady Barker, to see if it was
possible to arrive at a common view. Before looking at how successful
our talks were, I want to say, on behalf of the trans community, how
much we appreciate the inclusion in the Bill of the clauses that remove
anomalies in respect of married transpeople who wish to apply for
recognition by removing the requirement for them to be single at the
point of gender recognition and so removing the obligation to dissolve
their existing marriage or civil
partnership<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:53:42"></hs_TimeCode>.
Equally important to the community is the concession on spouses’
survivor pensions, ensuring that no ongoing financial penalties will be
incurred should a transperson in an existing marriage gain gender
recognition. The Minister has just referred to the fast-track
procedure, which is also very much appreciated.</hs_para>

there came a little disappointment because we have been unable to
resolve the concerns over spousal consent. We appreciate that the
amendments that the Minister has outlined clarify the position in
respect of married couples and the definition of a statutory
declaration of consent. However, in reality, it makes little difference
in terms of that consent; the divorced would probably not be en route
to registering a civil partnership. It makes little difference for the
transperson. It does not really matter if the spouse is going to
consent to the marriage or give consent for recognition. The principle
thrust of opposition to the schedule remains
unchanged<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:55:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to try to arrive at a further amendment that might resolve the
differences between us, but that would have required a lot of detailed
discussion and deliberation. Although I am not wholly happy with what
we have in front of us, I suppose that it is, in some ways, a step in
the right direction, which I acknowledge. I hope that there
may be another opportunity for that discussion to take place and, when
it does, I hope that the Minister will again be co-operative, as she
has been, in trying to resolve our

certainly the unfinished business of the Bill. There is no doubt that
the transgender community is angry and will continue to be angry until
we manage to achieve some resolution of the problem because its members
remain concerned that the Bill provides a spousal veto. Therefore, at
this stage, I seek the Minister’s assurance that after the Bill
becomes law this issue will be considered in post-legislative
scrutiny.</hs_para>

come across anything more complex until we came to this legislation.
This is not necessarily a complex issue, but when the Minister talks

through the process of acquiring a full gender recognition certificate
because they would have had to divorce their spouse to do
so—will be extremely pleased. I am pleased to be accompanied by
a number of Bishops today, and I think it is apt to say that one of the
couples who I know will be directly affected are active members of
their church. Their marriage was very important to them and they did
not wish it to be broken up in these circumstances. We have enabled a

Amendments 86, 87, 88, 89 and 133 will provide a fast-track procedure
for gender recognition where individuals have been living in the
acquired gender for a long period and clarify that the consent of a
spouse means consent to the marriage continuing, not consent to gender

Barker mentioned the fast-track procedure and the length of time. The
fast-track procedure reduces the amount of evidence that a transperson
must submit to the gender recognition panel. Therefore it saves them
from having to obtain new, additional evidence, which may be difficult
and time-consuming. It does not affect the length of time from
application to the issue of the gender recognition certificate; it is
about the process prior to that point.</hs_para>

to say how grateful I am for the generous remarks that have been made
and to remind all noble Lords that the Bill is about allowing same-sex
couples to marry. We have allowed transpeople who are already married
to stay married. That is an enormously positive step forward, and we
should not lose sight of that. However, it is worth pointing out also
that because those transpeople are already married, it is essential
that both spouses confirm that they want to remain married because
their marriage is a legal contract that will change. When we get
married—although, as we all know, I am not married. I have been
to weddings, even if I have not had one of my own—on our wedding
day we take somebody to be either our lawfully wedded wife or our
lawfully wedded husband. That is a legal contract between two people.
This Bill has enabled us to ensure that if one of those people is
transgender and wants to have transgender recognition, they are able to
do that and to remain married to the person who they fell in love with
and married some years before. That is an important thing that we have
been able to make happen.

Lords, government Amendments 93 and 128 to 132 amend provisions in the
Bill relating to marriage in consulates and on Armed Forces
bases overseas to exclude their effect in relation to Northern Ireland.
Clause 13 repeals the Foreign Marriage Act 1892 which applies UK-wide.
Schedule 6 
<?notus-xml column=303?>makes provision to replace that regime of consular
and Armed Forces marriages overseas with a new regime
providing for marriages of both opposite-sex and same-sex couples in
consulates and on Armed Forces bases.</hs_para>

Ireland Assembly agreed on 24 June does not cover Clause 13
or Schedule 6. In light of the terms of that legislative
consent Motion, these amendments amend the extent provisions of the
Bill so that the relevant provisions which would fall under the
Northern Ireland Assembly’s legislative competence do not extend
to Northern Ireland. The effect of these amendments is that
opposite-sex and same-sex couples marrying under the law of England and
Wales in consulates and on Armed Forces bases overseas will be married
under new procedures to be introduced by an Order in Council to be made
under Schedule 6. These new procedures will also apply to opposite-sex
couples marrying under the law of Scotland, and in due course to
same-sex couples as and when the law in Scotland is changed to allow
them to marry.</hs_para>

marrying under the law of Northern Ireland will marry under the
existing legislative framework; namely, the Foreign Marriage Act 1892.
This will mean that those officiating in marriages overseas will have
to operate two distinct systems when conducting marriages depending on
whether they are marriages under the law of England, Wales or Scotland
on the one hand, or the law of Northern Ireland on the other. While
this will add to the complexity of the system, it is a consequence of
the Northern Ireland Assembly not having given legislative consent to
the relevant provisions in the Bill, and so to be consistent with the
convention we must make amendments to reflect that.</hs_para>

I may turn to government Amendment 106 in this group. It is a technical
amendment which provides for the definition of “England and

government Amendment 125 is minor and technical. It adds the definition

anyone hard-hearted enough to block this, although I gather that the

objections to this amendment were voiced at Second Reading and in
Committee. The opponents of same-sex marriage argued a while ago that
its existence would undermine traditional marriage. This was stoutly
denied by, inter alia, the noble Baronesses, Lady Royall and Lady
Barker, and the noble Lords, Lord Marks and Lord Alli. Why, they said,
should recognising the existence of one union have any impact, let
alone an adverse one, on another, causing the older union to be less
respected or more fragile? Their arguments were, and are, persuasive.
If recognising same-sex marriage has no impact on heterosexual
marriage, then recognising a union, contract or arrangement of some
sort for siblings and carers likewise can have absolutely no impact on
same-sex

not arguing for an exact same union—far from it. The amendment
suggests that a formal contract or union could be established which in
no way detracts from civil partnerships as they exist now and has no
religious connotation or connection. For example, in France, a pacte
civil de solidarité—known as
“PACS”—exists for some heterosexual couples and
same-sex couples; it has most of the advantages and status
of marriage, but can be terminated very readily by a letter from one to
the other or by a marriage entered into by one of the two. It is
popular. It presents a model for

understand the fears and what seems like protectionism of those able to
succeed in achieving a same-sex marriage, I cannot understand the
logic. There are no limitations on equality; it is not rationed. We can
all have it. There is enough to go round. It is not a situation
where equality for some means nothing whatever left for
others. On the contrary, those who make the case for equality in
unions, even with the very small differences that we have
debated in the past few days, ought to be generous to others. This is
simply a study, and to deny to others what they seek for themselves
sets an unfortunate precedent.</hs_para>

cannot be seriously suggested that two sisters, or a father and
daughter, who are already living together in a co-dependent household
and taking care of each other, are guilty of incest—a punishable
crime. The length of cohabitation referred to in my amendment also
answers the argument that family members might be forced by others to
enter a union. It will be their free choice, because what I am

gave this undertaking in another place and, if the Government are to
have this review of civil partnerships and attendant matters, then it
is surely right, as the noble Baroness has argued so forcefully, that
these other relationships should be taken into account. In the name of
equity and in the name of decency it is right that your
Lordships’ House should say, “Please include these
relationships in the review”. That is all that we are asking. We

start with a sexual component. That must be broadly

have two principal objections to the proposition of the noble Baroness.
The first is about the nature of the relationship in a civil
partnership. The noble Baroness seeks to use the civil partnership to
review the Government’s tax and inheritance law. That does not
deal with the nature of civil partnerships as I understand it. They
were devised and brought into being to recognise a loving and—I
accept this point—in most cases, a sexual relationship, between
two individuals of the same sex. It was devised to give those sexual
relationships a status in law, but not exclusively sexual. In many
cases, it gave them the same benefits as married couples. It
specifically excluded relationships that were exempted from marriage,
such as mothers, daughters, fathers and sons, brothers and
sisters.</hs_para>

may come to the conclusion that they should not be included, but why

Alli:</Member></B> I thought I was giving three
reasons. My first was about trying to get the churches to take
a step and view civil partnerships as part of that
transition, where they can recognise the stunning relationships
between a man and a man and a woman and a woman
without having to cross the line into marriage. The 
<?notus-xml column=310?>second, which I believe the noble Lord seeks,
already exists for unpaid carers. They can enter a civil partnership in
which they are the same sex. They can enter civil marriage and get
those benefits. The third is

Alli:</Member></B> The third component is the one I was coming to,
about the nature of the relationships in civil partnerships. I do not
view civil partnerships as a financial transaction between two people.
As I said, they are based, initially but not exclusively, on a sexual
relationship between two same-sex people. That sexual relationship,
which often mirrors marriage, forms the basis of it. I
know—actually I do not know—that your Lordships do not
like talking about sex but sex is part of the foundation of marriage as
it is the foundation of civil partnerships. For that reason, for me,
civil partnerships are akin to marriage. The thought that a father
could marry a son, a mother marry a daughter or two sisters or two
brothers marry—substitute the phrase “civil
partner”—is what makes it feel wrong. Civil partnerships
make it feel like a relationship that should not be allowed. I do not
question the sincerity of the noble Baroness, Lady Deech. I believe she
sees this as a piece of paper that brings a financial
benefit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071081000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0001.htm#13071081000005">This
amendment is one part of a process. It should be up to the Government
of the day to decide on their inheritance tax policy. The Chancellor
and the Treasury set out and have a well-documented process for
consultation. I said in Committee—and in 2004 to the noble
Baroness, Lady O’Cathain—that I, like many, think the
current inheritance tax is unfair, particularly when it comes to family
homes. I would be in favour of inheritance tax being paid on the death
of the second or third survivor so the Treasury would suffer only a
deferral of inheritance tax. But that is not a discussion for this
Bill. It is a conversation to be had with government. I assure the
noble Baroness that I will write to the leader of my party and advocate
a change in policy to reflect that. I hope the noble Baroness
understands why I do not support the amendment. We debated it in 2004
and the arguments have not much changed. However, the experience of
civil partnerships might have helped the noble Baroness understand why
this amendment could be seen as hurtful to those people who value their
civil partnerships in a different
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071081000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0001.htm#13071081000006">Finally,
I risk the groans of the House by saying that in the intervening years
since 2004 I have not noticed a single amendment tabled to another Bill
to push this very point. Plenty of other Bills going through the House
could have addressed it, including the Care Bill going through the
House as I speak. I hope the noble Baroness and those who support this
amendment will forgive me if I see it and the intervening nine years
and ask: why now and not at any time over the past nine years? Whatever
the reason, this is neither the time nor the place for civil
partnerships to be used as a means of inheritance tax. I
hope that the noble Baroness can recognise that and will

have enjoyed his contributions and deeply appreciate his commitment and
share many of the things that he wants to achieve. However,
just as he sometimes disagrees with me, I am going to have to slightly
disagree with him over this. I do not know what the Church of England
will do about services of dedication or blessing in relation to
same-sex marriages. It is not entirely clear to me that
extending civil partnerships to other dependent relationships might not
actually increase the likelihood that the church would be able to move
in this area. It is arguable both ways. Indeed, if you have two people
whose lives are intertwined in a sort of covenantal way, as
the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, indicates,
they may well want some sort of blessing or dedication upon that
interdependence, without the sexual
relationship<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:41:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

partly that when civil partnerships were introduced, they mirrored
marriage too much. Many people on these Benches were in favour of legal
arrangements to support and protect in every way people whose lives
were interdependent. We had a problem precisely because it was all
narrowed down too much, to same-sex couples. There has, however, always
been support from these Benches for a proper legal arrangement to
support people whose lives, for one reason and another, are

parents now. Maybe a single mother is bringing up one child, and that

the circumstances in which people find themselves. Personally, I would
like to debate and look in particular at the role of carers—the
relationships they form with other members of the family or, in the
example given by the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Lloyd<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:44:39"></hs_TimeCode>, someone
for whom they assume a responsibility because of the way they feel
about that person. I would be delighted to debate that issue, not even

That was best exhibited by the exchange just now between the noble and

marriage is understood to be a sexual relationship because it can be
ended by annulment and by divorce on the grounds of adultery with a
member of the opposite sex. Civil partnerships are same-sex and, for
the reason I outlined, treated as sexual, but there is no annulment.
Platonic friends can marry if they are of opposite sexes or of the same
sex, but the lack of annulment for same-sex marriage may lead the
institution to develop very differently. I agree with the right
reverend Prelate, who stated what the position is in modern Britain.
The demographics of our country are changing rapidly. In the 2011
census, 29% of UK households were single-person—not
single-parent—households. The fact that two people can live more
cheaply than one is becoming increasingly important with rising living
costs, poor returns on private pensions, and high housing
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071081000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071081000023">We

suggestion that that should even be considered in the review is that we
know that it will continue the debate that has taken place in this
House over the past weeks, and because it is intended to undermine the
Bill, the purpose of which is to end discrimination against gay people.
The Bill is about civil rights. The right reverend Prelate on the
Bishops’ Benches suggested that this would all be about
recognising important relationships that are somehow on a par 
<?notus-xml column=315?>with a couple who choose to be with each other because of their sexual
attraction to each other, their love for each other and their desire to
stay together. I cannot imagine that the church would think that that

cannot imagine it because we know that this is about choosing a partner
whom you intend to be with. It is about the yearning among human beings
to choose someone as your love, to be with your beloved and to share
your life with them. That is very different from the relationships
between brothers and sisters, and fathers and daughters. We should
think of the implications of a civil partnership being extended to a
father and daughter. Are we going to put an age limit on it? Is the
father going to be able to enter into such a civil partnership with his
22 year-old daughter, or his 18 year-old daughter? We have to be
conscious that this is yet another way of trying to scupper the Bill.
The intention is to continue the debate and the argument long after the
Bill has passed. Therefore, I urge everybody who cares about making
sure that there is an end to discrimination towards gay people in this

Anderson of Swansea:</Member></B> My noble friend is coming to the view
that a review will come to a certain conclusion. We do not know what
conclusion that review will come to. The question is surely that we
know that under Clause 13—and this was a fairly late addition by
the Government—there will be a review of civil partnership. We
also know, under Clause 2, that it 
<?notus-xml column=316?>does not prevent the review also dealing with other matters relating to
civil partnership. Are those who are against the amendment suggesting
that the review should be stopped from dealing with those
matters?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000002">Part<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:00:36"></hs_TimeCode>
of our problem as politicians—or Members of this House, who may
not consider themselves politicians —is that we face this
disconnect between what we are doing here and public opinion. In my own
judgment, having served 30 years in the other place, public opinion
would consider this an important matter. When faced with the sort of
examples given by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Hooper, they would say that there is a certain injustice
in this matter. We remove ourselves from this view of justice coming
from public opinion if we say that it cannot be included in the review,
which, if it was able to look at this, might say that it was not
properly within its terms. I do not know what the Government consider
to be the specific terms of the review, or whether they will define
what the review can or cannot do. On the face of it, the review will be
able to deal with such matters, and may reject them. But public opinion
and most of us would say that these are important matters, which
deserve to be dealt with and may be dealt with by the review, which may
say that it is not properly within its purview or that it is not
something that should be dealt with at all.</hs_para>

whether the Government recognise that this is a problem. Do the
Government recognise that the examples given by the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Lloyd, and others refer to something that is considered
unjust by a great number of people in this country? If so, even if the

of a family could find themselves under an obligation to a family
member to enter into a relationship, in particular to preserve the

we had in Committee on this issue have actually caused me to change my

is a very real injustice done to the people for whom the noble

an appropriate vehicle by which this injustice should be addressed. The
noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, says, sotto voce,
“Why not”—and I will tell him. The purpose of the

partnership regime, which is part of the law of the land, continues to
serve a useful purpose now that we will have same-sex marriage. That is
a very narrow purpose, and I do not think that it is appropriate that a
review should consider whether a civil partnership should be used as a
means to address a very real injustice which, if it is to be addressed,
should be addressed through the taxation system and other means. That

issue of the nature and purpose of civil partnerships. They were
designed to provide rights and responsibilities akin, to use the word
of the noble Lord, Lord Alli, to those of marriage for same-sex
couples. I note that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop
of Chester thought that they possibly mirrored marriage too much. I
think he said that was the view when they were brought in. These rights
and responsibilities were provided because under the Civil
Partnership Act 
<?notus-xml column=319?>people were unable to marry because they were
the same sex. As civil partnerships are akin to marriage
they have a formal means of entry and exit. They have
imported the prohibited degrees of affinity parallel to those in
marriage law. They have similar rules governing deathbed civil
partnerships and financial and property
arrangements.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071094000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071094000044">6.15

that seeking the extension of civil partnerships to family members is
tantamount to seeking to allow marriage between close family members
within the prohibited degrees of affinity. We have decided as a society
that it is undesirable for close family members, such as siblings or a
parent and child, to marry. I accept, as the noble and learned
Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said, that the issue of procreation does
not always arise, such as in a marriage between a man and a woman who
are both pensioners. Nevertheless, they can still bring great
companionship to each other. No one questions that that devalues that
marriage or the concept of marriage in any way. However, we would not
think it right for even a brother and sister over the age of 60 to
marry as over generations our society has said that is not appropriate
and not right. Even where procreation is impossible, that is not
something that should
happen.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_10_PT_1/56E02DEF778AD1ED1635824088EFE4576B08146E" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 July 2013">Wednesday,

noble friend Lady Berridge said that she had heard of situations where
couples had been separated and questioned about a possible sexual
relationship. I suspect that couples being separated before they can
marry is in certain cases intended for the prevention of sham civil
partnerships. A couple have to have a face-to-face meeting with a
registrar where the registrar takes notice of the marriage and needs to
assure him or herself that they are indeed a genuine couple who
actually know each other and that it is not a sham civil partnership
for immigration purposes. It is not to ensure that there is
a sexual relationship between
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:14:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

those they care for, there is, as the noble Lord, Lord Alli, pointed
out, nothing in general to prevent them marrying or entering into a
civil partnership at present. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of
Berwick, referred again to the man who was paralysed after a riding
accident and his younger carer. I am sure that, in personal terms, that
is a very real relationship. As I understand it—I think that it
was said in an earlier debate—the younger carer was male as
well. There is nothing in the law as it stands at
present as to why they cannot enter into a civil partnership. It would
be wholly wrong and inappropriate to speculate why they have not. There
may be many cases of carers up and down the country where a civil
partnership has not proceeded because they do not feel that that is
right because of the way in which civil partnerships have developed or
the origins of
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:15:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071090000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071090000003">As was discussed in
Committee, the change would mean that couples would have to dissolve
the civil partnership if either party wanted to marry or enter into a
civil partnership with someone else from outwith their family whom they
loved, with all the financial implications and legal and practical
difficulties involved in a dissolution. That is why I believe that
shoehorning such relationships into the existing regime of civil
partnerships will not work. I listened carefully to the noble Baroness,
Lady Deech, and she said that perhaps 
<?notus-xml column=320?>it could be ended by a letter or simply by someone
going off and marrying someone else. That fails to
understand what Parliament legislated for when it established the
institution of civil partnership. It was an institution with a very
formal means of entering into it and a very formal means of leaving it.
I understand where the noble Baroness was coming from and why she was
arguing that case, but what she was actually arguing for was not a
civil partnership at all. Again, that is why we do not believe that
this should take place in the review of the nature that we
propose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:16:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

as much has been said in this debate about the financial benefits of
inheritance tax. I salute those who argued the case for the extension
of the review in Committee and quite openly and frankly talked about
inheritance tax. It was commendable frankness. However, I do not think
that treating civil partnerships as a vehicle for gaining tax or
property benefits is appropriate. Indeed, it is disrespectful for those
who enter into civil partnerships because of a mutual love, be it
sexual or a desire for companionship. The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy
of The Shaws, put it very starkly about fathers and daughters, but as
the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, pointed out in terms of this
amendment, that would indeed be possible in civil partnerships.
However, there are other possible situations which could arise that
underline that civil partnerships are not really intended for families.
What do you do with two siblings caring for a mother—which of
the two would form a civil partnership with the mother? What about two
sisters and a brother living together? Who would form a civil
partnership with whom? Imagine the contentiousness of the choice and
the sense of rejection if one sibling were preferred to the other. Who
would an elderly father living with two sons choose to form a civil
partnership with? These examples illustrate that it is not
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:18:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

whether benefits equivalent to those enjoyed by civil partnerships
should be made available to carers and other family members. The noble
Lord, Lord Anderson, asked whether there was a clamour for this. There
is no correspondence filling up the in-trays of my ministerial
colleagues on this issue, and I rather suspect from the comments made
by the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, that the same was true for those
who were in ministerial office before the present Administration. Since
2004, as far as we are aware, this issue has been raised only once
during debates on the Finance Bill in the other place. I appreciate
that in this House we cannot raise amendments to the Finance Bill.
However, my information is that there has been only one such amendment,
to the 2008-09 Finance Bill, tabled by the right honourable Member for
Birkenhead, Mr Frank Field. Other than that, the issue has not been
raised in an
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:19:02"></hs_TimeCode>.

my noble friend Lady Barker said, there are a host of other issues with

issue is whether these matters should properly be included in the civil
partnership review. The argument was made—I say, prima facie,
with some logic—that if we are going to have a review, this
matter should be included. However, as I have said before, what is
proposed is a fundamental change which is very different from civil
partnerships as they were established and as they have developed. That
point was well made by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, who said that the
review will examine the consequences of the Bill for the existing civil
partnership regime—indeed, whether there is a need for the
institution of civil partnerships following this Bill or whether they
should be extended to opposite-sex couples. That is the proper remit of
the review. I accept that other issues arise which have been very
properly aired and which can be followed up in other pieces of
legislation with regard to specific rights and responsibilities.
However, it is not the purpose of the review to seek to transform civil
partnerships from a legal union of a committed and loving
couple into something which is very different in nature and has been
described as simply a contract which you can get out of by writing a
letter or marrying someone else. Therefore, although it was important
to have this debate, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw

Deech:</Member></B> My Lords, the comments made by some noble Lords
have revealed misunderstandings on their part. I did not have the
privilege of being a Member of this House in 2004, but at
that time the House passed an amendment that would have included
siblings and carers within civil partnership. Having checked my iPad, I
see that I raised the matter in 2008, 2009 and 2012, and in some of
those years more than once. However, having studied the Care Bill, I
did not see a hook on which to hang it. The
amendment that your Lordships passed in 2004 was rejected in the
other place and complications arose at that time. That is
why an inquiry would be so apt. Civil partnerships were
invented in 2004 and another form of union could be invented
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:26:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071090000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071090000009">It
is not right to jump to the conclusion, as some noble Lords have, that
this means that family members will marry each other or have a civil
partnership. That is not the case at all. I seek an inquiry. There is,
of course, no question of incest and, anyway, there is no prohibition
now on siblings living together. I do not believe that the police go
knocking on their door to see whether incest is taking place. Some
carers do get married. We have all read of elderly gentlemen marrying
much younger ladies who care for them, often to the dismay of family
members who are worried about inheritance. Inventing a new covenant or
contract would probably be much more acceptable. However, it would, of
course, be a question of choice. We are not talking about marriage,
civil partnership or incest but about an inquiry given that civil
partnership is to be examined. The wording is broad enough to allow for
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:23:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

matter what hopes may be expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Alli, on
religious marriage in the future or on the future of civil
partnerships, I cannot find it in my heart to stand in the way of a
study of equality. Just because something else may happen in the
future, how can we stand in the way of an inquiry into equality? As the
noble Lord, Lord Pannick, knows, as he was counsel in the relevant
case, the Strasbourg court said that the treatment of the sisters was
discriminatory but could be accepted because in this country there was
this rigid division between marriage and all other unions, which no
longer exists. Therefore, the review is discriminatory. How can we say
that this is not the right vehicle in which to examine the issue? That
is not the way that this House normally treats questions of equality
and
justice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:24:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071090000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071090000011">It
is not just an issue of finance or of money-grubbing; I listed many of
the other advantages of marriage and civil partnership, only a few of
which are financial. Moreover, same-sex marriage is likely to come
about long before the proposed inquiry reaches any sort of conclusion.
Therefore, the two will not impact on each other. We need a debate on
this, as the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, said, and here is the
very vehicle for
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:25:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071090000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071090000012">The
noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, assumed that there would be no
choice in the matter and that people would be forced into these unions.
That is not the case at all. I keep repeating this because it seems to
be misunderstood: I seek an inquiry into an existing discriminatory
situation. That is all the amendment calls for. The people I am
discussing do not all have to be treated in the same way. One is not
suggesting that an inquiry, even if it went the way that I would hope,
would end up saying that sisters, fathers and children should be
treated as if they were civil partners. That is something to be decided
in the future. Although, as I say, this is not just about finance or
property, let us not overlook the fact that many a marriage, certainly
in the past, was most definitely about property, but I am not
suggesting that that is the case today, or that this is about money. As
learned Members of this House well know, various other statutes deal
with tax and inheritance for people who live

do not think that a matter of justice is ever inappropriate. We have

a chance to do something for them in an inquiry. I am getting letters

rejects this opportunity, which may not come up again for years. How
can I write to them and say, “The House was presented with your
situation but decided that it was not appropriate even to look into
it”? If this House sees discrimination, it should allow it to be
looked at in an inquiry. That is all I am asking for. Therefore, I wish

Innovation and Skills (Viscount Younger of Leckie):</Member></B> With
your Lordships’ permission, I propose to repeat a Statement made
in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State
for Business, Innovation and Skills. The Statement is as
follows<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:43:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000022">“Today,
I have laid a report in Parliament announcing that the Government have
decided to proceed with a flotation of Royal Mail shares on the London
Stock Exchange via an initial public
offering.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000023">A
sale will initiate the final stage of the Government’s postal
sector reforms. The overarching objective of these is to
secure the universal postal service—the six-days-a-week service,
at uniform and affordable prices to all 29 million address in the UK,
which is vital to the UK economy.</hs_para>

the independent review of the postal sector led by Richard Hooper
concluded that the universal service was under threat. The previous
Government accepted the review’s package of three main
recommendations but the Bill to implement them, which would have
permitted a minority sale of Royal Mail shares, was withdrawn. In 2010,
Richard Hooper’s 
<?notus-xml column=326?>updated report confirmed his initial findings and that a package of
measures was needed to secure the universal service. Through the Postal
Services Act 2011, we have implemented two elements of that
package by establishing Ofcom as the postal regulator and taking on
Royal Mail’s historic pension deficit.</hs_para>

today’s report, we will now implement the third and final
element of the Hooper recommendations by selling shares through an IPO
in this financial year. We will retain flexibility around the size of
stake to be sold, as this will be influenced by market conditions,
investor demand and our objective to ensure overall value for money for
the taxpayer. It is our intention to dispose of a majority stake,
taking into account shares sold and those allocated to employees. The
IPO will include a retail offer to enable members of the public to buy
shares on the same terms as the big institutional investors.</hs_para>

the Government will allocate 10% of the shares to an employee share
scheme. These shares will be free to eligible employees, recognising
that many might otherwise find them unaffordable, and I want to
strengthen employee engagement by ensuring that employees own a real
stake in the business. Employees must retain their shares for at least
three years, giving longevity to the scheme. Our scheme will be the
biggest employee share scheme of any major privatisation for nearly 30
years. Eligible employees will also receive priority in allocation if
they purchase shares in the retail offer. I would like to
reassure employees that ownership change does not trigger
any change in their terms and conditions. The CWU will continue to be
their recognised representative, and employees’ pensions will
continue to be governed by the trustees.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:46:34"></hs_TimeCode> part of a
three-year agreement, Royal Mail is also prepared to give assurances on
the continuation of a predominantly full-time workforce, a commitment
to provide and enhance existing services to customers using the current
workforce with no change to the current structure of the company in
relation to these services, and no additional outsourcing of
services</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000027">Royal
Mail is now profitable and its overall financial position has improved.
This is partly due to the Government’s action so far. But
considerable credit is due to the management and the workforce who have
implemented a modernisation plan. The challenge now is to maintain this
positive momentum. In recent history, Royal Mail’s core UK mail
business has swung between profit and loss. In the 12 years since 2001,
it suffered losses in five of those years and over 50,000 jobs have
been lost. Resting on the current level of progress is not
enough.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000028">Under
public ownership, there is simply not the freedom to raise capital in
the markets. A share sale will not only give Royal Mail commercial
disciplines, it will also give Royal Mail future access to private
capital, enabling the company to continue modernising and to take
advantage of market opportunities such as the growth in online
shopping, building on its success in parcels and logistics. Recent
estimates indicate that this market is worth £76 billion in the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000029">There are
various myths that need to be rebutted. Contrary to what is being
claimed, Royal Mail, after a sale, will still be the UK’s
universal service provider. 
<?notus-xml column=327?>This includes services to urban and rural areas and free services for
the blind. Only an affirmative resolution in Parliament can change
these minimum requirements. Free services for the Armed Forces are
entirely independent of ownership, and Royal Mail is fully reimbursed
for these services by the Ministry of
Defence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000030">Ofcom’s
primary duty is to secure the provision of the universal service. It
also has duties to promote competition where that benefits consumers.
However—and let me make this absolutely clear—should the
two duties be in conflict, it is the universal service that takes
precedence. In March, Ofcom published a statement on its approach to
end-to-end competition, making clear that should a threat to the
universal service arise from such competition it has the powers to take
any necessary action. While Ofcom is clearly the most appropriate body
to assess and react to such threats to the universal service, the
Government, as a safeguard, have retained powers to direct Ofcom with
respect to certain regulatory levers such as reviewing the
financial burden of the universal service and taking
mitigating action to ensure that the universal service is
maintained.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000031">I
confirm also that Post Office Limited will remain publicly owned,
although we will continue to explore mutualisation. This Government
have made a commitment that there will be no further closure programme.
Royal Mail and Post Office Limited signed a 10-year commercial
agreement in 2012 to ensure that they continue to be strong business
partners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000032">The
Government's decision on a sale is the practical, logical and
commercial decision, that is designed to put Royal Mail's future onto a
long-term sustainable basis. It is consistent with European
developments, where privatised operators in Austria, Germany and
Belgium have profit margins far higher than Royal
Mail, and have continued to provide high-quality
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000033">Now

opposed the Government’s privatisation of Royal Mail during the
passage of the Postal Services Act 2011, and we oppose it
today. Maintaining Royal Mail in public ownership gives the taxpayer an
ongoing direct interest in the maintenance of universal postal services
in this country; helps to safeguard Royal Mail’s vital link with
the Post Office; and ensures that the taxpayer can share in the upside
of modernisation and the 
<?notus-xml column=328?>increased profits that Royal Mail delivers. Despite that, the Government
have pressed on regardless with this sale and they have failed
adequately to justify why they must sell now.</hs_para>

an unusual coalition against this move: the Opposition; the
Conservative-supporting Bow Group, which described this move as
“poisonous”; the Royal Mail's employees, who are
represented by the CWU; and the National Federation of
SubPostmasters. The right honourable Michael Fallon, Member for
Sevenoaks and Minister for Business and Enterprise, wrote to a

there is the Government, which now includes the Minister of State. The
Government are ignoring the huge changes that they acknowledge have
taken place since the passage of the Act. Chief among them is the more
than doubling of Royal Mail's profits to £403 million and the
significant progress on the modernisation programme, which calls into
question the assertions that there is no prospect of Royal Mail being
self-financing in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000039">I
noted carefully the Minister’s reference to the package that

privatisation, but an injection of private capital.</hs_para>

concerns<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:57:06"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government are rushing to sell the business without making the case as
to why the sale of shares in Royal Mail, through an initial public
offering, must be carried out now; nor have they illustrated how a sale
will deliver maximum value for the taxpayer. They have failed to show
that the climate for an IPO now is a good one or how much capital would
be injected into the Royal Mail business as a result. Instead, they are
pressing ahead with a fire sale this financial year in a desperate
attempt to cover the gaping hole in George Osborne’s failed
economic
plans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000041">There
are further points that the Government have failed to address. First,
there is the timing of the sale. No evidence has been provided to
demonstrate that the Government will secure best value for money for
the taxpayer from a sale at this point in the Parliament. Additional
years of profitability may well increase the sale value in future
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000042">Secondly,
there are unresolved competition issues. Legitimate questions regarding
the fairness of competition posed to Royal Mail by other postal
operators—given that other postal service operators are not
subject by the regulator to the same high performance and service
quality standards as the Royal Mail—have not been resolved. The
different services required of Royal Mail by the regulator arguably put
Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared to its competitors.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071087000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000043">Thirdly, there are the
funding needs of the business. To what extent will Royal Mail be able
to raise capital from other sources to meet its funding needs if it
enters into private
ownership?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000044">Fourthly,
there is the impact on the Post Office network. In January 2012, a
10-year deal was entered into between Royal Mail and the Post Office
under which Royal Mail would continue to use the Post 
<?notus-xml column=329?>Office to deliver a range of Royal Mail services. However, there are no
guarantees that this arrangement will continue on expiry of the
agreement.</hs_para>

there is the impact on consumers and businesses. Royal Mail assets
could be sold off, generating large, short-term profits for the private
company: for example, high-value urban centres could be sold off to be
replaced by distant depots, making it worse for the consumer. What
assurances can be given that regulation will be sufficient to protect
consumers from being ripped off in the same way that they were after
transport and energy
privatisations?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000046">Sixthly,
there is the issue of postcode access for businesses. As part of the
proposed sale, it has been reported that the Royal Mail maintenance of
post-office codes is up for sale, with a wider negative impact on
business. I would welcome the Minister’s response on that
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000047">Finally,
in relation to employee ownership, we welcome the giving of 10% of the
shares in the business to its employees. However, if that is such a
good idea, and given that the Government are proposing fully to
mutualise the Post Office, why is the share being given to Royal Mail
employees not
larger?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000048">In
conclusion, I have the following questions for the Minister. First,
Royal Mail faces competition from other postal service operators which
are not, as I have said, subject to the same high performance and
service quality standards as Royal Mail, putting it at a competitive
disadvantage. How will that not depress the sale price, and what will
the Minister do about it?</hs_para>

be allowed to put the Post Office at risk. What guarantees can the
Minister give that a privately owned Royal Mail will renew
the agreement under which the Post Office provides Royal Mail products,
which is essential to the Post Office’s future?</hs_para>

rationale for the sale, I reiterate that the Government’s
overarching objective is to protect the universal postal service; that
is one of the key aims of this privatisation. To do that Royal Mail
needs future access to private capital and commercial disciplines to be
able to continue its modernisation programme and seize the
opportunities for growth. It is important, as I mentioned earlier, to
focus on the market for online shopping. For example, it is vital that
the Royal Mail is able to upgrade its sorting technology, improve the
way in which the tracking of parcels gets through 
<?notus-xml column=330?>the system and update its methods of delivery—there
are 40,000 Royal Mail vehicles, for instance. There are many good
reasons, therefore, why it is necessary to raise this particular
money.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071087000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000054">In
terms of doing that through a private sale, as opposed to finding funds
from public money, if Royal Mail remained in public ownership, there
would be competition with the education and health services in fighting
for limited resources. There is a good reason for the move to private
funds.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071087000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000055">On the

being the biggest employee share scheme following privatisation for
almost 30 years. The last one was that of the National Freight
Corporation, which I handled myself. Perhaps I may remind my noble

exactly the same on the NFC as it is today to the Post Office, although

post office to take that advantage? It is an enormous lesson for us, so
perhaps I urge my noble friend that privatisation should come back on
to the Government’s agenda. A number of other companies could be
privatised—here I am thinking in particular of BBC Worldwide.

that comment. In harking back 25 years, he makes an extremely good
point; hindsight is very nice. I cannot
remember exactly where we were with Royal Mail
25 years ago, but I am delighted that we are where we are at
the moment. I believe that the conditions are right to privatise. The
chief executive of Royal Mail has done an excellent job in turning the
business around, with profits of over £400 million. The climate
and the time are right, and I believe that there is an appetite, but

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> My Lords, some of us on this side
of the House who supported a minority shareholding did so because we
wanted an improvement in the quality of the management. Frankly, we had
despaired of that ever happening. That is because it takes particular
skill for a manager to run a monopoly in a capitalist system at a loss,
but that is what the managers of the Post Office succeeded in doing for
a number of years. Circumstances have changed because the nettle of
parcels has been grasped by the Post Office in a quite spectacular way.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T19:04:32"></hs_TimeCode>, at the
same time we now have day-by-day diminution in the volume of postal
mail that requires to be delivered. The fact is that the length of the
walk, the final mile that postmen have to go, is exactly the same
regardless of the number of letters they have to carry. That is the
most vulnerable part of the operation. It is not the parcels that will
be the problem; it will be the cost of delivering letters. Frankly, the
assurance that the Minister has given us this evening does not in any
way give us comfort. All we can see is a weakening of the universal
postal service when it becomes too expensive to subsidise under the
economics of this flawed
scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T19:04:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

hear that I do not agree with his assessment. It is true, however, that
since 2006, the fall in letter volumes has been as much as 25%. The
market is changing and we need to keep ahead of it. I would remind the
House again that Germany and Belgium are ahead of the game. The
injection of private capital into Royal Mail will help with the change,
but there is a double benefit in that, through legislation, the

Razzall:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Viscount will be aware, we
on the Liberal Democrat Benches are very much in support of this.
Indeed, the Liberal Democrat element in the coalition, starting with Ed
Davey who was the responsible Minister in the early days of the
coalition, are absolutely delighted to see this culmination now. As the
noble Viscount rightly said, it is very nice to see the noble Lord,
Lord Mandelson, in his place because it was he who started this process
many years ago despite considerable opposition from his own side, which
appears to

questions to the Minister. The noble Lord, Lord Young, raised a
perfectly valid point when he asked whether the Government are
satisfied—have they had advice from whoever is running the IPO
for them, who presumably will have been taking soundings from the
institutional shareholders who they are expecting to invest—that
those shareholders 
<?notus-xml column=332?>will be prepared to put up the necessary capital to invest in Royal
Mail, which was the whole purpose of the privatisation exercise in the
first place? Are the Government satisfied that this
structure will provide the necessary capital to continue the
modernisation process in Royal Mail that we all know lies behind the
whole privatisation
drive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T19:07:17"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

an important point—the Government have chosen to take the IPO
route, which I must say was slightly surprising to some of us. We had
assumed that the more likely result would be either some form of trade
sale or a private sale. Can the Minister confirm that if the
IPO was to fail for whatever reason—particularly listening to
the noises that are coming from the trade union movement at the
moment—the Government will continue the process of selling
off shares in Royal Mail? If that happens, it is probable
that the buyers would be a private equity group, who are less likely to
be sympathetic to the interests of the trade union movement
than would be the case under an
IPO<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T19:08:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

reflect for a moment on the 10% of shares that are going to the
employees. As the noble Viscount will know, the Liberal Democrat
element of the coalition has pressed for this strongly right from the
start. Can he confirm the numbers that have appeared in the
newspapers recently of the value of this to the employees of Royal
Mail? The numbers that I have seen show that the average Royal Mail
employee is being paid approximately £19,500 per annum, and on
the likely price of an IPO, every employee will receive shares worth
about £1,900 to £2,000. If those numbers are correct,
that is clearly a significant sum to be put into the hands of the well
deserving employees of Royal
Mail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T19:09:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> In answer to my noble friend’s
first question about the appetite of shareholders, the indications are
that there is clear interest in purchasing shares in Royal Mail. I
would not want to go further, because it is not my role to speak on
behalf of investors, but my noble friend makes a very good point. The
most important thing for Royal Mail is to have flexible access to
capital to allow it to innovate and capture market opportunities, such
as the strong growth in the parcel market driven by online shopping, as
I mentioned earlier. That is what an IPO will deliver for Royal Mail.
It should not have to come cap in hand to Government and compete with
schools and hospitals when it needs to innovate or commit to future
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T19:10:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000069">The
second question concerns the IPO route as opposed to other methods. It
is true to say that, having got to this point over a good number of
years, the IPO route was clearly the preferred route. I am certain that
other options were looked at. My noble friend’s question was, if
the IPO route were to fail, would other methods be used? I do not wish
to be drawn on that or to speculate, only to say that it is our firm
belief that the IPO route is the right route and that is the route that
we will be

final question concerned employees. I am delighted to hear that my
noble friend is very much in favour of giving 10% of shares free to

prospectus will be produced in due course, which will set out the
terms of the IPO. The valuation will, of course,
depend

Martin of Springburn:</Member></B> My Lords, I think that the Minister
will agree that many of those who retired from the Royal Mail worked
very hard to get it into the very good shape that it is in just now.
Has any consideration been given to allowing those who are in receipt
of a Royal Mail pension—in other words, former
sorting staff and postmen and postwomen—to buy shares? My
thoughts go to the fact that in my previous
constituency—although it is known as Glasgow North East, it was
known as Springburn at one time—we have a lovely sorting office,
which I pass every week when I come to the House of Lords. It is known
as the St Rollox sorting facility. Several hundred people work there.
They have changed their hours, adjusted to the new situation and worked
very hard. I would be deeply saddened if any organisation took over and
vacated the site at St Rollox and went somewhere else, which would mean
that the loyal men and women—some of whom I am related
to—who perhaps get up at four or five in the morning and walk to
their work in the Springburn area, would lose their jobs. Some of the
newer delivery companies, such as TNT and FedEx, tend to go
into great industrial estates, but the only way to get to these
facilities is by private transport and not public transport.
Has any consideration been given to securing jobs in the communities in
which they already
exist?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071087000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000072"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13071087000110" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071087000110">Viscount
Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for those two
points. His first question was whether it might be considered that
shares be given to those who have worked for a long time for Royal Mail
and that their hard work might be rewarded. It is fair to say that the
employee share scheme is designed to secure the future success of Royal
Mail and the universal service and we therefore consider it appropriate
to include only the current workforce, who deliver the universal
service and can influence and benefit from the future success of the
company. Share awards will be made only to those employees who have
been in employment for the relevant qualifying period, which happens to
be a number of months. I listened carefully to the noble Lord’s
second point; I know Springburn, so it is familiar to me. I am sorry to
hear that there has clearly been some disruption to individual lives
regarding the transfer of the sorting office. My only response to that
is that it is very much up to the Royal Mail management

from the noble Lord. In that case, my point is still the same. It is
very much up to the Royal Mail management to look very sensitively at
those personnel issues. I have no doubt that they will do that if there
is a particular move in that way. Change, as we know, is always
difficult and it affects individuals. The noble Lord makes a very good

twice—that the Royal Mail will still be the
UK’s universal service provider and that this will include
services to urban and rural areas alike. However, may we be assured
that not only will there be universal coverage but there will continue
to be uniform pricing? Too often the residents of rural areas,
especially remote and sparsely populated areas, face higher costs for
public services. Can the Minister affirm unequivocally that a

Prelate, through the Postal Services Act, Ofcom has the primary duty of
securing the provision of a universal service. I can confirm that this
will be secure in the hands of the privatised Royal Mail. What is
protected is not only the six-days-a-week letter service to every
address in the UK and free services to the blind, which I mentioned
earlier, but also affordable prices, which are monitored by Ofcom. On
the specific question, Royal Mail stamp prices for the universal postal
service will continue to be regulated by Ofcom, which has a duty to
ensure that they remain affordable. For example, Ofcom has put in place
a safeguard cap on second-class letters and parcels to ensure that the
service remains affordable for all users. I hope that that reassures

that the chief executive has brought about with the rest of the board
of Royal Mail, there is extremely good progress to report. I am glad
that my noble friend has endorsed that. As to the market itself, we
know that there is a tremendous opportunity in terms of future online
shopping opportunities, but it will be up to the Royal Mail board
following privatisation to use the flexibility of private capital to
look at the market and to take even greater advantage of the

privatisation is the increasing competition and the threats from

operation of this kind cannot face those challenges in the nimble way
that is required in business today seems to be unarguable and I
absolutely applaud the decision. However, I have two quick questions. I
am not asking the Minister to name it, but is there a price at which
the Government would not sell? Secondly, are there any considerations

Rodgers of Quarry Bank:</Member></B> My Lords, as noble Lords will have
recognised, the title, or description, of this debate is a reprise. In
a short debate on 5 February 2008, I expressed my concern about two
separate but related issues. One was the way in which ministerial and
other papers are kept when they leave departments but are not destroyed
or sent to the National Archives at Kew. The other was the need to
continue the long-standing series of official histories and how best to
choose, organise and publish the
books.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071094000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071094000003">As I
explained in my debate in 2008, my interest in the first issue arose
from the fate of government papers when I was seeking documents from my
time as Secretary of State for Transport. After six months of 
<?notus-xml column=336?>fruitless exchanges between me and the department, I finally abandoned
hope of anything substantial. The departmental records officer where
the papers were stored in Hastings apologised for—in his
words—“an unsatisfactory situation”. He recognised
quite openly how this had arisen. The essential discipline—these
are my words—had been lacking to ensure that they were properly
catalogued, remained in the correct files or changed their names
appropriately and to ensure that they were returned when they had been
borrowed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071094000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071094000004">In
the end, I wrote to the then Cabinet Secretary on the general question
of government records and their condition. I said that some departments
took great care of their archives but others did not, especially when
departments were chopped and changed. I understood that his
predecessors had reminded Permanent Secretaries that they were obliged
to keep accurate records and to keep them in good condition. I received
a helpful reply. Eventually, he said that within a year or so he would
again remind Permanent Secretaries of their duty in this
respect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071094000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071094000005">Since
the previous debate, most, if not all, Permanent Secretaries have
retired or gone elsewhere. Some departments have adopted new names and
policy areas have been changed. So where are the papers now and has
today’s Cabinet Secretary reminded new Permanent Secretaries of
their responsibilities in keeping records? Or is it now the head of the
Civil Service, Sir Bob Kerslake, who keeps Permanent Secretaries up to
the mark? Put simply, can the Minister reassure me that government
papers as I have described them are now in good
order?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071094000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071094000006">I turn
to official histories. On the previous occasion, five years ago, I
mentioned <I>Problems of Social Policy</I> by RM Titmuss, published in
1950—a seminal study of poverty and deprivation in
wartime—as the first official history I had read. Another I
mentioned was <I>SOE in France</I> by MRD Foot, which I was required to
read out of ministerial interest at that time. I then referred to
<I>Churchill’s Man of Mystery: Desmond Morton and the World of
Intelligence</I>, an unusual choice even among the eclectic selection
of titles in the current series. It was this book about Desmond Morton
that focused my mind on some wider policy questions about the official
history programme: the timetable, the shape of the programme, the
publisher, the contracts with authors and the marketing of the books.
The Desmond Morton book seemed to be a one-off, as it had a well
designed jacket and told a fascinating story. It should have sold well,
been serialised in newspapers and been considered for a television
programme. I asked how many copies had been sold—at £49,
about twice the usual price—and whether the book had been
reviewed in magazines and journals. In replying to the debate, the
Minister was full of good will but no figures or substantial
response.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071094000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071094000007">However,
after the debate, things began to move. Before the end of that year the
Cabinet Office said that it was commissioning “a fundamental
review” and that Sir Joe Pilling, a retired civil servant, would
undertake it. He took evidence quickly and widely, and his report was
completed by April 2009. A second, associated report was written by
Bill Hamilton, a literary agent, about the publishing arrangements.
These 
<?notus-xml column=337?>were internal classified reports but, two years later, when the noble
Lord, Lord Hennessy, intervened with the Cabinet Secretary, it was
decided to make them publicly available on the Cabinet Office website.
I welcomed this step although I was bothered that some key paragraphs
in the Hamilton report had been removed as they were
“commercially
sensitive”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071094000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071094000008">The

should say that in 1997, the Prime Minister nominated three Privy
Counsellors—the noble Lord, Lord Healey, the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, and me—to be asked whether they
were content with the subject and the author for each proposed book in
advance of the Prime Minister’s formal approval. This led to my
interest in the whole official histories programme and how it was put
together and published. In this respect, I have much exceeded my proper
and limited
role.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13071094000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071094000009">However,
I have kept in touch with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, from
time to time. At the beginning of my inquiries he shared my view that
the programme appeared to fall “not short of chaos”.
Later, he wrote directly to the Cabinet Secretary expressing his
concern. Then, in a letter to me on 25 August 2010, copied to the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Healey, Sir Gus

am grateful to members of the official histories team at the Cabinet

If a new programme either marks time or goes ahead, what are the
financial consequences? Is stopping official histories because of the
“challenging economic climate” really justified? As I
said earlier, given the deletions in the Hamilton report, there are no
relevant figures and costs, but they must be peanuts against public

Prescott:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord
Rodgers, on raising the matter of government archives and records. I
was a bit unsure whether my experience, which I wish to relate to the
House, fitted into this, but in his first few words he made clear the
kind of chaos that is associated with records and archives. That has
been exactly my experience in the past two years, although it does not

need to set the background as to why I needed access to the records.
The background came from the dirty tricks department in the
Department for Communities and Local Government led by the Secretary of
State, Mr Pickles, who decided to go back to my record of expenditures
in the department in 2004-06. There was clearly a political reason. He
spelt out all the expenditures that were done with government
procurement cards in my name. That meant, of course, that the
information was given to the press. There were PQs here and in the
Commons. There were stories of me running around everywhere, eating in
the best restaurants and so on. They were just not true but they were
put out, and they were politically inspired. My concern was how to get
access to the information and challenge it.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071094000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071094000015">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T19:34:37"></hs_TimeCode>
2011, I wrote to the then Cabinet Secretary, Sir Gus
O’Donnell—now the noble Lord, Lord
O’Donnell—saying that I was very concerned about the
allegations because they were not true. He wrote two letters to me,
which I have here, and I spoke to him about these. In his first letter,
dated 18 November, he said that there had been some fraudulent
expenditures, that the person had been caught and disciplined and that
I should have been told before this information was
released—that is supposed to be the normal courtesy, although it
normally does not apply to me. Five days later, I received another
letter from him contradicting his earlier letter. This one had his name
stamped on it but was without a signature. I ended up with two letters
from the Cabinet Secretary. The essential difference between the two
letters was that both the information about finding the criminal, the
person responsible, and the comment about my not being told had been
deleted from the second letter. Clearly, I got a little concerned about
who signed what where. I then asked Sir Gus O’Donnell, who said
that he had signed only one letter and knew nothing about the second
one. He was still in that early stage before his retirement. I clearly
wanted to know, so I asked the department, but it would not give me the
information.</hs_para>

then applied to the Information Commissioner under the Freedom of
Information Act. He looked at the matter and said that he backed the
Secretary of State. I went to another appeal but again he backed the
Secretary of State. What was he backing? He was 
<?notus-xml column=339?>backing the view, under Section 36 of the Freedom of Information Act,
that if it is in the public interest not to tell you, he can deny you
access to that information. The Cabinet Secretary and the Information
Commissioner made it clear that they knew who the person who gave the
instruction. Since they will not give me the information, I suspect
that we are back to the old SPADs—Mr Shapps was the
Minister at the time, and Mr Pickles was Secretary of State. Somebody
directed the Cabinet Office over the weekend to change the letter. They
did not say to Sir Gus O’Donnell, “We’re changing
your letter. Is that all right?”. It was a political
intervention to take out two important bits of information and
therefore certainly relevant to what I was concerned about.</hs_para>

Information Commissioner confirmed that the information was available
but said that it was not in the public interest to tell me because it
was a high-profile public case. I am not sure that is a sufficient
answer. Why is it a high-profile case? It is because they released the
information to the press about my expenditures. That is what has made
it high-profile. That then becomes the justification for the
Information Commissioner not to tell me why it is not in the public
interest. Telling you what is happening could have a “chilling
effect” on civil servants. We are talking about political
intervention here, not civil servants. One civil servant does not do
this. This is a direct intervention on essential information by
somebody in the Department for Communities and Local Government and
with the Cabinet Office over the
weekend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T19:36:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071094000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071094000018">My
concern, therefore, is how do I get that information? I cannot get it
through the Information Commission, who confirms the decision by the
Secretary of State, Mr Pickles. What can you do about that? I know that
it is difficult when you are up against the Information Commissioner
who takes that view, but I am still concerned about this political
intervention. There are many expenditures in that department and they
are all listed. According to the department, I must have eaten myself
around the ruddy world, and in all the best restaurants, of course.
Therefore, I wonder whether I can get access to my diaries. One
expenditure of more than £1,000 was spent in a hotel on
Christmas Eve. Your Lordships will not be surprised to learn that I was
not in London having a do; I was at home. I need the diary to be able
to prove that these allegations against me are just
wrong<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T19:37:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071094000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071094000019">I
then went to the Cabinet Office to ask for the information, but
remember that the Information Commissioner says that I must appeal if I
want to go to the final body for appeal, and I have to do it within 28
days. So I wrote to the Cabinet Office and I rang them there. I said
that I wanted the information from my diaries. They told me that they
were very difficult to find. In the end, I got a letter this morning
telling me that they had found them—this is weeks later. The
trouble is that the appeal has gone. Is that the normal service that
one can expect? I know that if you are a privy counsellor you are
supposed to get some privilege. I am not one now, but I was one then,
so I should still have access to the information on the fast
track—I expect the slow track from now on. However, the
circumstances are such that I could not get the
diaries.  
<?notus-xml column=340?>I needed the diaries to show where I was on what dates and perhaps throw
doubt on all the expenditures involved. To that extent, I am
frustrated. I did not think that I could bring the matter up until I
heard the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, talk about delay in access to
information, which Ministers have passed. If the Government can get
it—and they have, in my case—and so can the Ministers,
why not I, the man whom they are attacking? That is what I call
political dirty tricks. I hope that they will read this speech. I just
felt there was frustration and there was a chance in the debate of the
noble Lord, Lord Rodgers, to put my point of view before the eminent
people who will follow and who have direct experience of what happens

non-fictional form. It is here in that strange, twilit terrain between
the facts of Professor Andrew and Professor Jeffery and the
imaginations of the spy novelists that one finds the real utility of
intelligence history. Spying and counterspying are activities that
uniquely lend themselves to fantasy and conspiracy theory. The
meticulous, careful reconstructions and assessments filtered through
the minds and pens of Chris Andrew and Keith Jeffery are the best
antidote we have to what one astute critic called the “snobbery
with violence” practised by Commander Bond on both page and
screen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071094000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071094000023">Part
of the special utility of secret service official histories and

Foreign Office, the Cabinet Office and the National Archives mounted
what can only be called a cornucopian release, drawing on two of the
most secret collections the British state has ever created. The FCO
batch covered the Foreign Office’s dealings with the
SIS—the province of what the FCO euphemistically calls the
Permanent Under-Secretary’s Department—covering the years
1903 to 1951 and shedding much new light on how the secret state coped
with successive threats from the Kaiser, Hitler and Stalin. The second
tranche flowed from what I call the Cabinet Secretaries’
“too hot to handle” cupboard, formally known as the
Cabinet Secretary’s Miscellaneous Papers. This batch covered the
years 1936 to 1951 and contained material which, in my judgment, is of
continuing value to today’s guardians of national security in

just for the benefit of academic historians but because of their

decisions when they are not fully aware of the history of the subjects

impossibly expensive to employ enough historians in government to cover

not too expensive for each department to have a historical adviser who

who would have sufficient tendrils into the academic world to know

the complexities of both Iraq and Afghanistan when policy decisions

heard by the decision-makers. In this respect, I admired the practice
of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister, whose first step when taking a
major decision was to hold a seminar of experts.
The seminar she held when facing the unification of Germany has become
well known. It did not necessarily overcome her prejudices but it was
certainly a counterweight to them. It said that under the pressure of

Liddle:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, welcome the debate initiated
tonight by the noble Lord, Lord Rodgers. I want to make one simple
point very strongly in favour of official history and about wanting to
make official history more contemporary, not less. I believe that
history is vital to people when facing difficult decisions. In the
years that I spent as an adviser in government, one thing that struck
me a great deal was the lack of institutional memory in government
departments. Even in a long-serving Government such as the Labour
Government from 1997 to 2010, Ministers changed jobs frequently and,
except in one or two cases, it was very unusual to have Ministers who
had a long period of office in one department.</hs_para>

ministerial merry-go-round, there were frequent changes in the Civil
Service. For instance, one of the most striking things in the book by
my noble friend Lord Adonis on education is that, in the case of the
academy programme, eight different people were in charge of it in the
Department for Education in nine years when he was the relevant person
at No. 10 and a junior Minister in the department. There is
far too much changing around and as a result there is a lack of
institutional memory. I remember when my noble friend Lord Mandelson
came back from Brussels and went to BERR, I think it was called, and
started to think about industrial policy, there was very little
available that one could turn to that analysed the strengths and
weaknesses, from the perspective of government records, of government
policies in the
past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071096000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071096000003">More
history and more contemporary history would be good for us. The most
recent official history that I have read is Sir Stephen Wall’s
excellent book on Britain and the European Community from 1963 to 1975.
It made me reassess what was probably a rather too jaundiced view of
Harold Wilson. Stephen has given us the benefit of the minute books of
the Cabinet Secretaries, so you know what each Minister said in Cabinet
meetings, and you come to admire Wilson’s skill in handling
questions such as the Common Market 
<?notus-xml column=344?>at Cabinet. The lessons for what we are currently going
through—the renegotiation that the current Prime Minister
proposes—come out of that book extremely strongly.</hs_para>

the Europe example again, the reason why I would like some more
contemporary examination of the records is that many of the issues that
will be raised if there is a renegotiation in the next Parliament were
raised during the European convention in the period from 2000 to 2003.
Many of these issues about competences, repatriation of powers and the
legitimacy and accountability of European institutions were thoroughly
gone through then, yet I suspect that there has been no proper
examination of the lessons of that experience by officials internally
and certainly none by historians externally. So let us have more
official history, and let us make it more
contemporary.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071096000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071096000145">7.55

of Quarry Bank, for securing this debate and, indeed, for opening up
this whole question with his debate five years ago. I must declare an
interest, as secretary to the All-Party Group on Archives
and History and, like my noble friend Lord Hennessy, as a
working professor of history in Queen’s University Belfast. One
of the effects of the important debate introduced by the noble Lord,
Lord Rodgers, five years ago was the production of the Pilling report.
The noble Lord referred to it tonight. There is a striking sentence by
Sir Joe Pilling at the heart of his report endorsing the project of
official histories. He said that he had come to see the work of
publishing official histories
as,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13071096000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071096000131">“the

improvement and an increase in the production of official

recall that five years ago I referred to the history of
MI6—which my noble friend Lord Hennessy mentioned
tonight—by my colleague Keith Jeffery. It was then basically
something that existed on Keith’s desk, but now it shows how
these things can sell. One of the many points that are so important
about that book is that it has sold hundreds of thousands of copies
across the world. It may be because the Chinese copy actually has a gun
smoking on the cover, but none the less it is an indication that no
definite economic death follows the production of official histories.
It is important to understand that the work of producing official
histories is of great
significance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071096000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071096000007">However,
there is a darker side to Sir Joe Pilling’s report. If you read
between the lines, he was aware as a member of the Dacre committee with
Sir David Cannadine that it was likely that we would move
from a 30-year rule. Actually, the Dacre committee
recommended moving to 15 years, but in practice it is now a 20-year
rule. Sir Joe is also clearly aware that this will become an argument
for the state to say that it does not need these official histories any
longer. He clearly tacitly acknowledges that that argument is just
around the corner. It is the argument that is related to the hiatus
that has been announced in the context of austerity. I can completely
understand it, there is a 
<?notus-xml column=345?>forceful logic to it, but there is another hiatus, if I might put it
like this. It would be forcefully true when the
20-year rule comes into effect and will be much truer in five, seven or
eight years from now insofar as it has truth today. We still have a
pressing need in public areas for a certain type of work in an official
history programme.</hs_para>

mean and take the case of the history of the Northern Ireland Office.
If you want to look at the volume of official publications on Northern
Ireland on the shelf of our library, you will find a shelf of official
publications including the report on Bloody Sunday and the Finucane
report. There are hundreds of thousands of pages, mostly dealing with
matters of that sort, occasions when the state has been seen to behave
not very well. I have no objection to that; I was the historical
adviser to the Bloody Sunday tribunal report. However, it is somewhat
ridiculous that there is no account of the work of those officials on
the British side who struggled to bring about a peace process. It is
astonishing that we are silent on the more creative, positive, though
no doubt deeply flawed aspects of the work of our state officials while
we are so loud in announcing some of the rather bad things that went
on. That seems an astonishing way to proceed.</hs_para>

made about how aspects of Foreign and Commonwealth Office history in
the 1940s and 1950s have been dealt with in recent times. We now seem
to think that the way to educate the public about what happened in the
past is to apologise or to have a large and expensive inquiry about
something very bad. That may well be necessary, but this is the case
for a proper, official history programme. With the hiatus that still
now exists, particularly in the Northern Ireland Office, the many
arguments there have been about legacy in Northern Ireland, the sense
there that the past has not been properly dealt with and the small sums
involved, there is a case for the Government to reconsider their
approach of
austerity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071096000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071096000010">There
is a further point made in Sir Joe Pilling’s report that is
worth drawing attention to. He says that the internet now allows you to
publish a lengthy set of footnotes and a lengthier text—the full
scholarly history—but a 200-page shorter version as the book.
That seems another way for government to avoid unnecessary expense. In
other words, I am arguing that this can be done quite cheaply. I would
like to see the Government reconsider the force of the Pilling report
of 2009.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071096000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071096000146">8

Thomas of Swynnerton:</Member></B> Forgive me for speaking in the gap.
I agree very strongly with the arguments of my noble friend Lord Butler
for a historical adviser to many government departments. I had the
privilege of accompanying the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, on a visit
he made in 1981 to South America. It was not at all clear what I was
doing, but I accompanied him as a historian of the Spanish world. When
we got to Brazil, an official of the Brazilian Foreign Minister asked
me what my mission was. I said, “I am Lord Carrington’s
historical adviser”. He had not appointed me; I appointed
myself. The Brazilian official said, “What a good idea

he comes to reply. I certainly find them fascinating. They are
important, and we ignore them at our peril. Secondly, there was the

Mr Brown’s Administration was the first that was almost entirely
digital. Papers, minutes, notes and messages were all exchanged
electronically, and the key evidence of meetings and
events—which I notice is one of the main foci of the National
Archives’ work—were in electronic form, as were the
diaries. Of course, there are some traditional papers in the manila
files which characterise the way Whitehall keeps its data on
Administrations, but they are mostly simply print-outs from the
electronic system. I know to my cost, because I spent many hours
looking at them, that the paper files contain some very substantial
gaps. My main concern is that the e-mails that support and exemplify
how policy was decided are not generally incorporated into the paper
files. Indeed, the e-mail files are kept separate and no work seems to
have been done on them since the end of Mr Brown’s
Administration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071096000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071096000016">Can
the Minister explain what the government policy is here? I am
assured—and have some evidence to back this up—that
e-mails are being kept and that technology is being looked at so that
they are progressively kept alive. However, keeping records is not the
same as keeping records permanently. If you keep records permanently,
it means that somebody has assessed the records and found them to have
enduring long-term value, selected them, made them safe and secure and 
<?notus-xml column=347?>can find them when they are required. Keeping records indefinitely means
we cannot find a basis to set a retention rule on them.</hs_para>

staff in No. 10 were encouraged to file material, we need a lot more
than that. The current standard seems to be that e-mail accounts get
removed after the Government change or a member of staff leaves. Surely
that should happen only after a pre-exit process in which an archivist
and an employee go through the e-mail account together and decide how
to deal with the e-mails or in a post-exit process where an archivist
looks for e-mails that need to be kept and ensures that they are
catalogued and tagged for future access. That approach would at least
recognise that, in the real world, people cannot be relied on
comprehensively and routinely to deal with their individual e-mails by
filing or deleting as they go along. E-mail communications are
exchanged with such frequency that backlogs quickly scale up to a size
that makes patient sifting and sorting virtually
impossible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071096000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071096000018">We
also need to recognise that the electronic way of working is
intrinsically different from earlier, paper-based systems and our
archiving needs to reflect that. E-mails typically deal with several
different topics in one chain. How are they to be broken up and filed
across those various aspects? Even if an individual never used their
work e-mail account for non-work correspondence, their account is still
likely to contain personal information of a sensitive nature exchanged
with colleagues. That needs to be addressed. E-mails within a
ministerial context are often political in nature: issues that perhaps
should not reach the permanent archive but should be made available to
those parties involved. Also, within e-mails it is hard to establish
electronic document management systems that work. Access to e-mail
archives is problematic because the information contained in the
totality of the archive—virtually accessible if you go straight
into an e-mail archive—is so sensitive that the National
Archives might well have difficulty in imposing a rule that does not
exclude very large amounts of information. That point was made
earlier.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071096000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071096000019">Of

need an approach to e-mail that results in staff leaving behind an
e-mail account that their colleagues and successors can routinely
access and use, without unduly harming either the account holder or
people mentioned in their correspondence. We also need defensible
access rules and, importantly, retention rules. I suspect it is beyond
the ability of a single organisation to develop such an approach
because it involves changes to available tools in the technology, to
the way we think of an e-mail account and to how we ask colleagues to
treat e-mails. I look forward to hearing from the Minister about what

first to official histories, my noble friend Lord Rodgers and the noble
Lord, Lord Bew, referred to the reviews commissioned by the then
Cabinet Secretary, the noble Lord, Lord O’Donnell, and conducted
by Sir Joe Pilling and Mr Bill Hamilton. They recommended that the
official history programme should be continued under the auspices of
the Cabinet Office under the name “the public history
programme”. They proposed substantial changes to raise the
profile and relevance of the programme, including an increase in the
involvement of sponsor departments and outside bodies, a revamping of
the publishing arrangements and an enhancement to its governance
procedures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071096000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071096000023">Several
noble Lords referred to the fact that, given the current economic
constraints, the Government do not plan to implement the proposed
changes at the current time, and I will return to this. However, we are
moving forward with the completion of the existing programme, which
will conclude with the publication of <I>The</I> <I>Official History of
the Joint Intelligence Committee: Volume 2</I> in 2016. Work on this

Rodgers referred to expense. Without incurring disproportionate
expense, it is not possible to determine the overall cost of the
current series of official histories. However, for the last year for
which published costs are available, 2006-07, the net cost was
£176,000. This cost includes fees and expenses of
historians and research assistants and costs associated with
publication, but excludes staff costs of Cabinet Office administrative
support and accommodation-related overheads. Noble Lords will
understand that until the future shape of any programme has been
determined it will not be possible to estimate the likely future costs.

noble Lord, Lord Hennessy, in his excellent contribution to
today’s debate, referred with his usual aplomb to the histories
of MI5 and the Secret Intelligence Service written, respectively, by
Professor Christopher Andrew and Professor Keith
Jeffery. I should clarify for the House that these were authorised
histories, more akin to departmental histories, and were not
commissioned under the official history programme. The noble Lord also
suggested that an authorised or official history of GCHQ would be a
valuable addition to those recent intelligence histories. In fact,
nearly all of GCHQ’s records of the period roughly corresponding
to that covered by Professor Jeffery’s history of SIS have
already been released at the National Archives. I agree with the noble
Lord that it is therefore open to any historian—indeed, we have
historians in the Chamber—to write their own history of GCHQ. I

to the arrangements for preserving government archives, we have grounds
to be optimistic given the progress made in a number of areas since
2008. First, on the responsibility for public record keeping, in
line with the Public Records Act 1958, government
departments are responsible for their records up to the point that they
are transferred to the care of the National Archives. The National
Archives provides departments with guidance and supervision, but
decisions on which records to select for permanent preservation remain
the departments’
own.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071096000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0002.htm#13071096000027">On
guidance, in June 2009 the Cabinet Office and the National Archives
revised the guidance on the management of private office papers.
November 2010 saw the revision of the Civil Service Code, which
now emphasises the importance of keeping accurate official
records and handling information as openly as possible within the legal
framework. In December 2010, the <I>Cabinet Manual</I> was issued, and
this includes a section on official information
and maintaining official records for departments. A question

Secretaries about their accountability for record keeping in

January this year central government began its 10-year transition from

transition, the National Archives has, with the active participation of
departments across government, comprehensively revised its guidance and
processes for the selection and transfer of records. The National
Archives has been tasked to collect and publish regular reports on
departments’ progress in reviewing and selecting records for
permanent preservation during the transition period. The most recent
report, with returns from 84 departments and agencies, was published on
the National Archives’ website on 1 July. This level of
transparency around government’s records management is, I
suggest, unprecedented. With these reports and the transition itself,

the much discussed black hole in our history wrought by obsolete
digital formats is unlikely to materialise on the scale that had once

programme new technology is fully embraced. Digital continuity is also
now taken much more seriously across government than it was five years
ago. The programme of training instigated by the noble Lord, Lord
O’Donnell, during his time as Cabinet Secretary has certainly
aided a better understanding of our digital records and improved
usability and accessibility. Of course, there remains the challenge of

is important to stress what this amendment is not about. It is not
about seeking opt-outs for teachers, pupils or schools of a religious
character from teaching about marriage as the Bill defines it. I,
personally, would have no part in proposing that. Nor is it about
seeking so-called protections for schools or teachers from the need to
promote same-sex marriage. Many in this Chamber and outside, as I know
from many conversations, still remain haunted by the ghosts of Section
28. To anyone who is feeling so haunted this evening, I offer the rites
of exorcism. Let me be crystal clear: this amendment is categorically
not about turning back the clock to those regrettable times. It is
about reconciling two principles that have been the cause of many
heated debates in this House: the principles of equality in marriage
and respect for religious freedom. The focus of the amendment is on
schools of a religious character, and how teaching on marriage will and
should take place once the Bill becomes

ask your Lordships not to be distracted by matters that have already

<?notus-xml column=353?>The substance of my case for the amendment is that without it, governing

a situation arise in which schools of a religious character are left in

shall not repeat in detail the points made in Committee by the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds. The situation can be
summarised as follows. All schools of a religious character, whether
Church of England, Roman Catholic, Methodist, Jewish or other faiths,
of which there are several in my own diocese of Leicester, are legally
required to ensure that teaching takes place in the school according to
the tenets of the respective faith. Church of England schools, for
example, are established on trusts that require them to provide
education in accordance with the tenets of the Church of England. They
are legally obliged to comply with that requirement in their trust
deeds, and a failure to do so would result in the governors acting

403 then builds on that general requirement by requiring the Secretary
of State of State to issue guidance on the nature of marriage, and so
on, and requiring heads and governing bodies to have regard to it. We
are not talking here about teaching the tenets of the religion in a
general sense but in this very specific area of sex and relationships
education and moral considerations on the value of family life. That is
why this particular area impinges on the tenets of the religion in a
way that education generally does not. That is the reason to address

law, the references in the guidance will of course be taken to mean
marriage as the Bill defines it, which as anyone observing these
debates will surely know by now, is not exactly how the tenets of the
great majority of the world faiths define it. This leaves schools of a
religious character with two competing legal duties. One says that the
teaching has to be according to the tenets of the faith, while the

problem? Some may wonder why schools cannot just teach both alongside
each other in a sensible way. That, of course, is certainly the
approach we want to see in Church of England schools. However, the
crucial point is that there are strong legal grounds to conclude that
the obligation to comply with the terms of the trust deeds of a school
of a religious character outweighs the duty to have regard to the
Secretary of State’s guidance. One is a duty to comply and the
other is a duty to have regard. Unless Members of the House accept the
amendment and resolve the conflict in the Bill, there is nothing to
stop some schools of a religious character making a decision on legal
grounds to set aside the guidance altogether. I am sure that noble
Lords are aware of the diversification of provision being pursued by
the Department for Education and the potential for a wider range of
providers to enter the system. I contend that this makes it
more necessary than ever to ensure that governing bodies are not
tempted to set aside the guidance in this
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T20:29:15"></hs_TimeCode>. The

make Section 403 of the Education Act 1996 compliant with that Act,

reasons. Section 403, which the amendment addresses, is
concerned with sex education. There are many contexts in
which sex education raises religious issues, including homosexuality,
contraception, and no doubt many more. I cannot understand why there is
a need for a specific statutory provision in Section 403 to address the
impact of same-sex marriage on sex education when there is no need for
a statutory provision to address other issues that may have a religious

right reverend Prelate referred to Section 403(1A), which, as the noble

requires sex education to be put in the context of family life and
marriage. That is because sex education should not be taught simply on
the basis of physicality; it should be presented, as I am sure that all
noble Lords would agree, in the context of responsibility and the
development of relationships. Surely, if and when sex education
addresses homosexuality, it should equally be taught in that same
context of responsibility and other relationships and, as a result of
this Bill, that will include same-sex marriage. For this amendment to

it is right—and the right reverend Prelate stressed
this —for guidance given by the Secretary of State to be not
only received but followed. Of course it is necessary that
my grandchildren—and many of your Lordships have
grandchildren—should be brought up to understand that Parliament
has, in its wisdom, decided to effect a major change to the
social fabric of our land. But if that change is to come about with a
degree of mutual tolerance and understanding —and, yes, good
humour—it is important that the second requirement to which
parents look should be fulfilled. Their children should be taught the
basic tenets of the faith.</hs_para>

that tonight is one of them. The acceptance of this amendment will show
sensitivity and understanding on the part of the Government. It will do
nothing to damage the cause of those who believe
passionately—and I respect their beliefs—in the essential

are many who believe that it is utterly necessary. I do not share that
view, but I hope that when we have finished our deliberations on this

sent back from another place, in all parts of this House there will be
a spirit of mutual tolerance and acceptance of what we have enacted.
That will call for a degree of charity on the part of us all, whichever
side we have taken in this debate. If we can assist in laying the

issue. The right reverend Prelate referred to the
difficult balance that faith schools have to strike between
complying with the tenets of their trust deeds and having due regard to
the directions of the Secretary of State. I absolutely understand that.
It may be helpful to quote an Oral Question of Monday 8 July on the new
sex and relationships curriculum. I asked about academies, 
<?notus-xml column=359?>but the answer that I was given refers to all schools. I asked about
academies not having to provide sex and relationships education. The

that point because I see a distinct parallel for faith schools with the
way that religious education is taught, whereby the schemes of work
that the Church of England has for covering a range of other faiths are
sensitive and educational but do not promote those faiths. I absolutely
see that parallel here, in that faith schools are not required to
promote same-sex marriage but merely to educate pupils about it. Often
we get bound up in the idea that SRE is taught only in sex and
relationship education classes. However, young pupils will ask about
this at peculiar times. Therefore, a school needs a policy. I have seen
many faith schools’ policies on SRE that recognise that fact and
all staff are empowered in that regard. Therefore, I hope that the
right reverend Prelate does not press the amendment because I believe
that schools of a religious character can find the protections that
they need in the existing Education

perspective to be honoured. The Human Rights Act, Articles 9 and 10 of
the European Convention on Human Rights and Section 403 of the
Education Act 1996 may seem to preserve religious freedom or the
exercise of discretion in selecting materials for SRE

mentioned this once before in Committee in a brief interjection,
because it is something that will not go away. A child is naturally
going to say, “Who is my mum and who is my dad?” In
same-sex marriages, that is something that will have to be overcome.
People who are teaching need to be clear as to what advice is being
given to them on that topic. We have talked a lot about the theory and
well-being of the move towards same-sex marriages, but many of my

from these Benches. I believe that one point has not yet been as fully
made as it might have been. I was prompted to these remarks by
listening to the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington. I agreed with most of
what she had to say, but I was led to a very different conclusion. I
fully agree with her understanding of church schools and what they
exist for. For that reason, I have always refused to fall in with
lumping church schools in that easy category of faith schools. The
Church of England schools—this is particularly true of the
primary sector—exist as part of our mission to the whole
community. We are there to serve the community as a whole. To that
end—I speak as a former teacher, governor and chair of boards of
education—our schools have always sought to hold to an integrity
which involves being true to the church’s teaching and to trust
law, and true to the law of the land. That is absolutely at the heart
of the dual system, which has underpinned much of the education of this

important. I am not a lawyer, but I know that there is a recognised
branch of jurisprudence which goes under the heading “conflict
of law”. I also know that the study of that subject teaches that
where the conflict between different laws has to be resolved, it always
raises questions of jurisdiction and normally raises questions of
supra-jurisdiction—a jurisdiction greater than the two parties

way, without any prejudice, and that they will naturally also teach

issue at hand, we have said throughout our deliberations on the Bill

are not necessary. Teachers are already able to teach according to
their religious tenets. That will not change, nor will the ability of
faith schools to operate within the tenets of their faith. Some people,
while generally accepting that point, say, “Why not give comfort
to those who are concerned by putting something in the Bill?”. I
understand that the right reverend Prelate is making a legal point.
Others, including those on the Bishops’ Bench, want to ensure
that the legal and religious definitions of marriage can be taught

statutory framework and to reduce the risk of them declining to teach
about the changed legal nature of marriage at all. I warmly welcome the
fact that the Church of England is clearly determined to pursue this
inclusive approach for its own schools and to commend it to others.

distinction, they already interpret their duties under Section 403 of
the Education Act

was made clear in the decision of the Privy Council in
Barber v Minister of the Environment in 1997. Faith schools
must take the guidance into account when developing their policy on sex

into account the requirements placed on them by their trust deeds when
determining their policy on sex and relationship education. The
requirement on schools to have regard to the guidance ensures that they
can take other relevant factors into account, including their trust
deeds. They are required not to follow every element of the guidance

marriage of same-sex couples. We are clear that no school is under any
duty to promote or endorse any particular view about marriage. I
recognise what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester said
about the ghosts of the past, but we have heard in our debates about
the real concern that gay people still have when it seems that a duty

noble friend Lady Byford referred to concessions and I am sorry that
this is not an amendment that we can accept. We have made several
amendments to the Bill and accepted concessions. Changing the Public
Order Act was one and the other, which we talked about on Monday, was
around clarifying the word “compel”. We felt able to make
those changes because we thought that it was possible to clarify and
give people the greater confidence that they wanted that the
protections in the Bill are robust. However, as I said at Second
Reading, we would make such changes only where we were confident that
by clarifying we did not introduce something else that would then call
into question what we are trying to
achieve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307112000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307112000015">It is
on that basis and after much careful consideration within government

expressing gratitude for the tributes that have been paid to his
leadership, particularly at the General Synod, and in so many other
ways. It is a leadership for which we are growing more and more
appreciative, both in the church and in the nation. I thank the
Minister for the care, attention, accessibility and understanding that
she has unfailingly shown in the conversations that we have had leading

think that it was Paul Newman in “Cool Hand Luke” who
said: “What we have here is a failure to communicate”. At
times in this debate it has felt a bit like that because, as those who
listened carefully to what was said in support of the amendment know,
what I am trying to do is to ensure that the Bill prevents
faith schools from opting out of teaching about same-sex marriage. We
really are on the same side of the argument and it seems at times that
this message has not been heard.</hs_para>

specific responses to certain noble Lords. To the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, I would say that Section 403 is the only education
provision that refers to marriage and it is the meaning of that word
that is being altered by this Bill. We do not need to amend other
legislation, as he has suggested, because other education legislation
does not deal with marriage. Therefore, the amendment does not run
counter to the Bill. It says that there is room for both religious and
legal understandings of marriage and that they can live alongside each
other in religious
schools.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307112000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307112000019">I
would just clarify the question that the noble Lord, Lord
Elystan-Morgan, put to us. The position is that there is a difference
between a requirement to have regard to statutory guidance and an
obligation to comply with the terms of a trust deed. The latter is an
unqualified legal obligation. The former is a duty to have regard and
is therefore weaker, hence the danger of some religious groups going
their own way if the potential conflict is not resolved. That is the
point that I tried to
make.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307112000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307112000020">On the
point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, the concern is not
that the Bill is changing what goes on in homes and communities but
that it changes the law. We need to ensure that the new law and
teaching about marriage in church schools can happily coexist. I do not
believe that this amendment in any way erodes, undermines or attacks
the central purpose of the Bill; rather, it strengthens
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307112000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307112000021">Having said
all that, I know that it is late and that we have much more work to do.

comes to a conflict, the Government recognise that the trust

guidance. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw this amendment. I
reserve the right to consider the implications of this debate further

assessment of the impact of same-sex parenting on child development. I
would appreciate a careful and thorough assessment from the Government,
perhaps with the aid of an appropriate mental health professional and a
statistician, to look across the research that we have currently on
this issue and produce a report. In the first place, a letter to me and
placed in the Library would be very welcome. Perhaps that might be the

will try to be brief, given the hour. I thank the Minister for meeting

twofold challenge makes me ask these questions. First—I know
that this is debatable—the Bill might give a significant,
inadvertent nudge to same-sex couples and to teachers, doctors and
child and family social workers. Many of us agree that marriage has
traditionally been seen as the last and very important step before one
starts a family. For many professionals, the Bill might seem to
encourage them to think that same-sex parenting is just as good as or
even better than heterosexual parenting and nudge them towards, for
example, giving IVF, making placements with same-sex foster carers or
adoptive parents, or teaching children that same-sex parenting is no
longer problematic or debatable. For context in this, your Lordships
might recall debates on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act a
few years back, where the duty was removed for clinicians to ensure
that those taking part kept in mind the interests of the child of
having contact with the father. I fear a gradual erosion of that
traditional norm that the best situation for every child is to have a
mother and a
father.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307116000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307116000004">The
second difficulty concerns research. The phenomenon of same-sex
parenting is relatively new, and research only stretches back about 30
years. Typical problems are that the samples are of small numbers and
too narrow, and that the duration of study was 
<?notus-xml column=371?>too short. Another problem is that the science is
undertaken under pressure of polemic from both sides. There are people
here who desperately want this to be proven to be absolutely
unproblematic, and others who desperately want this to be shown to be
the wrong thing to do entirely. The truth lies somewhere in between and
is sometimes hard to
find<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T21:45:10"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T21:54:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Baroness has in the past alluded to research from Melbourne, Australia,
the largest cohort study so far, of about 400 families with perhaps
750 children, which is now considering them at the age
of 17. It is encouraging that such large cohort studies are
taking place. Again, however, we need to look at these very critically,
and look at the samples that they are taking. I will come to the

Lord, Lord Winston, pointed to the research of Professor Susan Golombok
at the University of Oxford, pointing to positive outcomes for children

am sure that we are all grateful to the professor for perhaps the most
important piece of research in this country. However, from memory
—I have not looked at it for a couple of years—it is of a
small sample, about 60 families, and, again, only to the age of 18. We
do not know what happens to the adult children of same-sex
families<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T21:46:31"></hs_TimeCode>. The

matters because we are dealing with a phenomenon which our past

course, there is the “common sense” argument. Many of us
would think that it is just common sense to expect that children will
do best if they have a mother and father. I listened with great
interest to the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, quoting a child in the
earlier debate. I met some foster carers yesterday who gave me an

academic, Loren Marks of Louisiana State University, who has written a

Parenting and Children’s Outcomes: A Closer Examination of the
American Psychological Association’s Brief on Lesbian and Gay
Parenting</I>, published in the journal of <I>Social Science
Research</I> in July 2012. In her conclusion, she writes: “We
now turn to the overarching question of the paper. Are we witnessing
the emergence of a new family form that, unlike cohabiting, divorced or
single-parent families, provides a context for children that is
equivalent to the intact family?
Even<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T21:48:34"></hs_TimeCode> after an
extensive reading of the same-sex parenting literature, the author
cannot offer a high-confidence data-based ‘yes or no’
response to this question. The data are
insufficient to 
<?notus-xml column=372?>support a strong claim either way, and thus
insufficient to produce a definitive, binary statement. Such a
statement would not be grounded in science. Representative,
large-sample studies are needed—many of them, including
high-quality longitudinal studies. Although some same-sex opponents
have made some egregious overstatements and, conversely, some same-sex
parenting researchers seem to have implicitly contended for an
exceptionally clear verdict of no difference at all between same-sex
and heterosexual parents since 1992, a closer examination leads to the
conclusion that strong assertions, including those made by the American
Psychological Association were not empirically
warranted”.</hs_para>

conclusion, I repeat that same-sex parenting is a new
phenomenon with potentially important consequences for children. I
recognise that the Minister disagrees with my concern that the Bill is
perhaps a cue for people to promote or encourage the notion that
same-sex parenting is no longer a matter which people feel has some
issues around it. I understand that. However, I would be grateful if
the Minister could write to me with an analysis of the current
evidence, perhaps with the aid of a statistician and a relevant mental
health professional. My noble friend Lady Hollins is a former president
of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and is currently the president of

in terms of a joke, but often in pretty horrible terms. Nobody in their

people of

lead, we had to go away. Lots of us went off and lived in other places.
That will not be an option for many young gay people in future. That is

those who take a more cautious approach. Professor Golombok’s
work is peer-reviewed research of the highest level. She may be

The noble Earl believes that children brought up in same-sex
relationships will do much less well than those brought up by
heterosexual parents. That is the noble Earl’s central premise,
and every argument he puts forward is about proving it. On
Amendment 1, he supported two classes of marriage. On
Amendment 46, he contended that there was no definitive
research on the subject of children in same-sex relationships, and that
the arguments were finely balanced. Given that the noble Earl believes
that there is no definitive research, how can he then ask the Secretary
of State to provide evidence-based research as part of the guidelines
on what to teach? If there is no evidence-based research, how can the
Secretary of State use it to inform teaching
guidelines?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307116000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307116000018">It

the Government during their initial inquiries before they drafted the
Bill which was very seriously challenged by apparently well qualified
people. The challenge was never answered or rebutted. I will happily
write to the Minister about this because it should be looked into
further. Where advocates of a cause commission or present research, it
is as well to test it very carefully before taking it at face
value.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307116000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307116000020"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T21:59:35"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Singh of Wimbledon" PimsId="5990" UID="1307116000100" xid="2159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307116000100">Lord

I can see no reason whatever for thinking that it could be any less
favourable to the interests of a child to be brought up by parents in a
same-sex marriage than to those of a child being brought up by parents
in a civil partnership. I would have thought that the stability and

across daily in schools that they know from their own experience that
their friends come from single-parent families, whether through
bereavement, divorce, separation, kinship carers, foster parents and,
yes, children of civil partnerships. Some children know that they were
born by IVF and have more than two parents. The father of one child I
know married the woman who had first been his mother-in-law, and later
she became his step-sister-in-law before becoming his wife. That is
something to do with family values in the 21st

answering the debate, I wanted to make some specific points to assist
all noble Lords and the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, in particular. I
wanted to emphasise that the Bill does not change the position for
children in families of same-sex couples. The Government believe that
the principles of long-term commitment and responsibility, which
underpin marriage, are a good basis for providing children with the
support and protection that they need throughout their childhood. As
the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has said—and we very much agree
with him—extending marriage to same-sex couples will mean that
children of those couples will be able to benefit from the stability of
a family founded on marriage in the way in which other children
benefit. We think that that is a good
thing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:04:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307116000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307116000027">The
noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and other noble Lords referred to comments
that the noble Lord, Lord Winston, made in the debate on Monday on
concerns about the ability of same-sex parents to bring up children.
Those concerns are effectively not supported by the available evidence;
the noble Lord made the point that there was no evidence to support the
concern that some might
have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:04:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:03:11"></hs_TimeCode>.
Research has shown that there is no negative impact on
children’s self-esteem, psychological well-being or social
adjustment if they are brought up by same-sex parents. This includes
lesbian couples—the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, raised the point
about there being no father figure in the
family<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:04:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

but important none the less, that when gay couples decide to have a
child or children the decision has to be a conscious one. Therefore, it
is safe to assume that, having made that decision, they will be very
conscious of the needs of that child and would address of all of them.
No doubt two lesbian women would ensure there were male role models to
play a part in the children’s
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:05:51"></hs_TimeCode>. The noble
Earl and I discussed this when we met privately. As I said in the
previous debate, I am aware that some people respond to change in
different ways. However, it is important to be clear that same-sex
couples will approach their decision to become parents as seriously as
any other couple; perhaps more so because they have had to make that
decision very consciously. The Golombok report, <I>Growing up in a
L</I><I>esbian Family</I>, which has been referred to, supports this
view. There are other reports—all of which seem to have very
interesting names—and I am sure if I start trying to say them I

gay parents. Perhaps that is so, but why ignore a much larger and more
extensive survey of 3,000 people conducted by the University of Texas
over a number of years on a random population which included interviews
with children who had grown to become adult? It showed that the
children who flourish best, measured in categories such as education,
employment status, depression, crime, welfare dependency and drug
misuse, are those who spend their entire childhood with their
biological mother and father. All other family
arrangements did significantly less well. The worst

has not. However, we now have the opportunity, at long last, of
producing legislation to try to and put right the discrimination which
gays and lesbians have suffered for many years. We are aiming to do
that, and we are doing it. We have voted in favour of the Bill, in this
House and in the other place, with an overwhelming majority. The law is
now absolutely clear: it says that the marriage of same-sex couples is
lawful—I repeat, is lawful. Yet this amendment suggests that a
referendum be held on 24 October 2013 and that there should
be a statement on the ballot paper which
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1307116000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307116000086">“At

Second Reading debate, when I looked at my computer, I had messages

to the noble Lord, Lord Singh: a December 2012 MORI poll showed that
73% of people agree that gay people should be allowed to marry. On 5
February, at Second Reading in the House of Commons, it was 400 to 175
on a free vote. On 21 May, at Third Reading in the House of Commons, it
was 366 to 161 on a free vote. On 4 June, at Second Reading in the

119 on Amendment 1, followed by votes of 278 to 103, 163 to 32 and 84

The subsidiary argument is the speed of the passage of this Bill. Not
only was it not mentioned in the manifestos, not only did a number of
the relevant pressure groups not come to this view in respect of gay
marriage until a year or two ago, but there has been an unholy haste
about this Bill which is difficult to understand. It is rather as if

suggested that there have been occasions in the past when legislative
changes have been made without a mandate. That is true, of course, but
none has been as fundamental as that set out in the Bill before us
today. Although laws defining marriage have changed incrementally over
the years—the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, gave a whole
series of those—nothing has been as fundamental as this one:
changing the basic definition of marriage. I suppose that a case could
be made for an exception to the electoral mandate principle if it were

the need for a referendum set out in my speech in Committee was

<?notus-xml column=383?>One argument advanced in our earlier debate was that it would not be
appropriate to have a referendum when the Bill was passed with such a
clear majority in another place. That, however, as the noble Lord, Lord
Singh, has properly pointed out, misses the point. No one questions the
majorities, the facts are there. If the referendum is opposed in order
to make good the lack of any mandate, the votes of MPs on this issue
are not relevant because there was no electoral mandate at the time for
an issue which is manifestly a fundamental

noble Lords objected to the idea of having a referendum simply because
they considered the redefinition promoted by this Bill to be a
self-evidently good thing and recoiled at the idea that it should be
subject to a vote. If it was, of course, such a manifestly good thing,
why have so many colleagues come to this realisation so speedily and at
such a late stage? Had this vote been taken three years ago, it would
not have had those majorities—perhaps not even one or two years
ago, so it is not such a manifestly good

argument advanced by the Minister, and advanced earlier in this
evening’s debate, was that referenda should be preserved for
constitutional questions. Apart from the fact that Parliament is
completely free to apply referenda whenever it sees fit, the key point
is that the marriage Bill raises important constitutional questions. I
refer to the implications for the establishment of the Church of
England, as explained by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Chester in his important Second Reading speech. Moreover, Aidan
O’Neill QC in his legal opinion on the Bill suggests that it
risks partial
disestablishment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:38:34"></hs_TimeCode>.

anything other than unhappy consequences. Rather than this being a law

Martin of Springburn:</Member></B> My Lords, I have always looked
forward to the wisdom of the noble Lord and of the noble Lord, Lord
Waddington, and it is nice to see them disagree with one another and
disagree so well. It is often the case that the Minister gets to the
Dispatch Box and says, “Well, this amendment is not suitable but
perhaps we can get something else”. I think that there should be
some consultation with the people. For everyone arguing that this is a
democratic process, which should therefore be good enough for the
people, we should remember the problems that this generation
and generations before us have had. In Northern Ireland, we had a
Government who kept saying, “The majority rule and forget about
the minority or about consulting with the people. We are the ones who
will push through the legislation and that will be the end of
it”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307118000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307118000002">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:44:33"></hs_TimeCode>
just point to several such matters.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:44:33"></hs_TimeCode> noble Lord,
Lord Fowler, will recall that the Scottish people were the first in the
British Isles to get the poll tax. That was because of a democratic
decision in the other place, even though some MPs, including me, said
at the time, “You’re creating a rod for your own
back”. However, it was not until the poll tax came to the rest
of the United Kingdom that people readily acknowledged that we were
wrong. The argument that it goes through both Houses and that is the
end of it and people have to accept it, is nonsense. We could be
creating very serious problems. Noble Lords should bear in mind that it
is normally the case that the Opposition question the Government, if
that is what they want to do. However, the Opposition are supporting,
not questioning, the Government on this legislation. That is where I
feel that there should be some
consultation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307118000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307118000003">Noble<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:44:33"></hs_TimeCode>
Lords will recall that the last time that the Labour Party and the
Conservative Party got together, it was when the Conservative Party
supported the then Labour Government in going into Iraq and seeking to
remove Saddam Hussein. At the time, the Liberals said that there was a
feeling out there in the country that this was wrong. Ever since then,
we have been asking ourselves whether or not it was the right thing to
do. I am on my feet not because there needs to be a referendum but
because we need to find some way of consulting the people about the
difficulties that we have got here. We are not passing a complete piece
of marriage legislation. The Government have been shrewd enough to
exclude the Church of England and the Catholic Church and to say,
“We are not forcing you to do this”. Therefore we are not
getting a piece of marriage legislation in the normal sense of the
word. Of course the dates are down here in the amendment, but
amendments can be changed or replaced by something more suitable to the
Government and ultimately to the House. Let us find a way of consulting
the people about what we are putting through both

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise briefly to thank my
noble friend for alluding to the research that he did and for his
support on my previous amendment. 
<?notus-xml column=385?>I will look with great interest at the research to
which he refers. He also gives me the opportunity to reflect on the
Minister’s reply with regard to research in this area. I perhaps
should have pointed out that the Loren Marks research was initially a
criticism of a conclusion produced by the American Psychological
Association two or three years previously. She wrote that particular
paper from a critical point of view on its conclusion that all the
research so far pointed to there being no problems with same-sex
parenting. That was why she wrote that paper. It is hardly surprising,
therefore, that the American Psychological Association should come back
and be very critical of her research, so I would not take the
association’s damning criticism too much to heart. I think that
Loren Marks is well worth reading and listening

offer my sincerest congratulations to my noble friend on bringing
forward this amendment at this late point in the Bill. From a man of
faith representing one of the great religions, it is absolutely right
that we should be hearing a very conservative point of view
regarding the family. It is very important that there are these strong,
conservative voices, deeply steeped in religion, to stand up against us
modern people, who are much less rooted in tradition and more flexible.
It is very important that people such as him stand up on these
occasions and put a strongly conservative point of view,
even at this late stage in the Bill. I wish that he
had been here when we were discussing the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act and that we had heard his
comments then on the removal of the assumption that it is in the best
interests of children for fathers to be involved in their lives. Again,
I recall the Good Childhood Inquiry report, produced by the
Children’s Society and the Church of England a few
years ago. It highlighted that, with increased rights and freedom of
choice for adults in the 20th century, which so many of us
welcome, the downside for children has often been that parents’
greater choice has meant that many more children grow up
with their father no longer in their family. I think it is very helpful
to have my noble friend’s voice

Norton of Louth:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may deal briefly with
this in bullet form. The point that has just been made about parenting
is totally irrelevant to what this Bill seeks to achieve,
and it is certainly irrelevant in terms of the amendment before us,
to which the noble Lord, Lord Singh, did not really speak.
When he does, I think we would be interested to hear why, under
subsection (9), on those who would vote in the referendum, he would

terms of holding a referendum anyway, as the noble Lord, Lord Pannick,
pointed out, at the end of the previous Parliament the Constitution
Committee produced a very thorough report on referendums, weighing the
arguments for and against, and concluded that if they were going to be
held, they should be not only on constitutional issues but
fundamental constitutional issues. Not only is this not really a
constitutional issue; it certainly does not qualify as a fundamental
constitutional matter.</hs_para>

matter of social policy. Parliament has legislated on significant
social policy before. This would be on a par with abortion and divorce,

So if we are going to start saying that we should have referendums on
social issues, there are wider implications. We would need to consider
it very thoroughly before we went down that route. There is absolutely

situations where there are disagreements. Nevertheless, it has been the
case that efforts were made to engage with not just the Sikh community
but with other communities. It is a fundamental part of the Bill that
the Government readily recognise—indeed the official Opposition
readily recognise too—that there are religious organisations and
faith communities which do not believe in same-sex marriage. That is
why an important part of the architecture of this Bill is to give
protection to these faiths. That is an important part that has come out
of the discussions and the process that have brought us to where we are
today with this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307118000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307118000027">It was
also suggested that the Government had somehow been impervious to
argument. It is worth reminding the House that, as part of the whole
process, the Government listened to what the Church in Wales said and
produced an opt-in procedure. There has been additional protection for
chaplains employed as members of staff. We added ecclesiastical law to
the measures not affected by the Bill. We have clarified that marriages
of same-sex couples are void when the couple are aware that their
religion has not opted in. We have ensured that the consent of a
governing authority to opt in to same-sex marriage does not
automatically fall if the governing authority changes.</hs_para>

for example on humanist weddings, the Government have been prepared to
listen. There were amendments earlier today on fast-track procedure for
gender recognition, and a technical, though important, amendment to
reflect the absence of a legislative consent Motion from Northern
Ireland for overseas marriages in consulates or Armed Forces bases. On
a number of these issues the Government have listened and made

also been said that the use of referendums in the United Kingdom

Committee when we looked at the issue of referendums. I do not think
that I am betraying any secrets—it comes through in the
report—that we thought 
<?notus-xml column=389?>referendums should be the exception. However, the genie was out of the
bottle and therefore if referendums was going to be used the report
clearly stated that they should be on matters of substantial
constitutional significance. It gave some examples: to abolish the
Monarchy; to leave the European Union—the subject of the debate
in the House of Commons last Friday; for any of the nations of the
United Kingdom to secede from the UK; to change the electoral system
for the House of Commons; and to change the UK’s system of
currency. While I recognise that what we have been debating in your
Lordships’ House on this Bill is a matter of profound social
policy, I do not think that by any stretch of the imagination it could

little background, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
reported on this Bill in its fourth report of the Session. We are most
grateful to the committee for its comments and recommendations, to
which we responded in a series of amendments that the House debated on
Monday. One of the recommendations of the committee was that
regulations made under Clause 9, which deals with the conversion of
civil partnerships, should be made by the Secretary of State rather
than the Registrar-General and should be subject to the affirmative
procedure on first use because it was not clear that all such
provisions would be purely administrative in
nature.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307118000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307118000040">We were
happy to accede to this recommendation but were also conscious that, in
the future, the Registrar-General may need to update her administrative
procedures. To require regulations to be made by the Secretary of State
regarding such matters would be overly bureaucratic and break with the
convention that the Registrar-General makes regulations relating to her
functions that are purely administrative. For example, the
Registrar-General already makes regulations, without any parliamentary
procedure, prescribing the detail of marriage and civil partnership
registration, the duties of those responsible for registration and the
forms to be used.</hs_para>

through Amendment 123, which has now been withdrawn, that the Secretary
of State or the Lord Chancellor could make enabling provision for the
Registrar-General to make regulations relating to administrative
matters. We continue to believe that such sub-delegation is the
appropriate way of dealing with these administrative details. However,
as the chairman of the committee, my noble friend Lady Thomas of
Winchester, helpfully highlighted to us before Monday’s debate,
the amendment had been drafted in a way that would allow the Secretary
of State or the Lord Chancellor to sub-delegate in respect of any of
their order-making or regulation-making powers in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307118000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307118000042">While it
was never the Government’s intention to use the proposed power
in such a far-reaching way, and the use of the power was limited in any
event only to where it was in connection with administrative matters
relating to functions of the Registrar-General, superintendent
registrars or registrars, we accept that it would not have been
appropriate to move the amendment with such concerns outstanding. That
is why we have tabled Amendment 123A, which is more restrictive as to
the circumstances in which the Secretary of State may sub-delegate
regulation-making powers to the Registrar-General. Its effect is that
there are just two provisions where the Secretary of State can now
exercise such a power.</hs_para>

explicitly that sub-delegation may occur only where the Secretary of

civil partnerships to marriages, and Amendment 90, concerning marriage
by belief 
<?notus-xml column=393?>organisations—if the Government in future decide to allow such
marriage. We consider that the sub-delegation of regulation-making
powers to the Registrar-General is necessary and appropriate in these
two contexts, but it must be subject to clear restrictions. In

sub-delegate provision as to
fees.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307118000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-0003.htm#1307118000044">Amendment
123A also makes it clear that the default position is that any
delegated regulations made by the Registrar-General would attract the
negative procedure, unless varied by the Secretary of State in the
event that she felt that this was justified because of the nature of
the particular regulations. I can assure noble Lords that any

Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, on 5 June we announced an increase to
the financial levels of fixed-penalty notices for most motoring and
road transport offences, including making careless driving a
fixed-penalty notice offence, following consultation last year. These
changes are being made under the negative resolution procedure, and
both the Fixed Penalty (Amendment) Order and the Fixed Penalty Offences
Order were laid before Parliament on 28 June. Today is about a parallel
scheme—fixed penalty deposits—which are for those alleged
offenders without a satisfactory UK address. The draft Road Safety
(Financial Penalty Deposit) (Appropriate Amount) (Amendment) Order
before us today will enable the levels of fixed-penalty deposits to be
increased by the same amount as fixed penalties for motoring and other
road transport offences, and will include careless driving as a
fixed-penalty deposit.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071079000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071079000004">Fixed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T15:46:16"></hs_TimeCode>-penalty
notices are issued by police and Vehicle and Operator Services
Agency—VOSA—officers. Regardless of whether an alleged
offender has a valid UK address, they are issued with a fixed-penalty
notice. Those alleged offenders without a satisfactory UK address are
then required to pay a fixed-penalty deposit. The Road Safety
(Financial Penalty Deposit) (Appropriate Amount) Order 2009 prescribes
the amount of financial penalty deposit that may be requested by an
officer. To mirror the increases that are being made to most motoring
and road transport fixed penalties, deposit levels will be increased as
follows: £30 will rise to £50, £60 will rise to
£100, £120 will rise to £200 and £200 will
rise to £300.</hs_para>

are considered too severe or too numerous for the offer of a fixed
penalty, the offender will be summonsed to appear before a court but
will 
<?notus-xml column=84?>be required to pay a financial penalty deposit against any court-imposed
fine. The order before us today increases the minimum court penalty
deposit amount from £300 to £500. It also increases the
maximum appropriate amount in respect of any single occasion on which
more than one financial penalty deposit requirement has been imposed
from £900 to £1,500. VOSA statistics show that in 2012-13
more than 10,500 deposit notices were issued, with a payment rate of
almost
100<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T15:48:17"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071079000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071079000006">The
intention of the policy behind the order was that parking offences
would not be covered, as these are not road safety-related. The
Committee will be aware that legislation is often complex. It has
become apparent today that the order before us may capture some
parking-related offences for those alleged offenders without a
satisfactory UK address only, and therefore increase the deposits
payable for parking offences. Departmental lawyers are currently
rechecking the draft order to determine whether there is anything else
that may be outside the policy’s
scope<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T15:48:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

aware that the graduated deposit scheme is aimed mainly at foreign
HGVs, which were more difficult to deal with before the previous
Administration introduced a deposit scheme. The vast majority of HGVs
are maximum-weight articulated vehicles moving between large depots.
Parking offences are not often a problem. In the main, offences relate
to road-worthiness, driver hours and overloading. Therefore, it is
unlikely that any serious adverse effects will arise from this problem.
If necessary, we will lay an amending order to correct the
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071079000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071079000008">I would
also point out that, for foreign cars that make an alleged parking
offence, normal procedure is to attach a fixed-penalty notice to the
vehicle, irrespective of where it comes from. I will write to update
the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, the opposition Front-Bench spokesman, and
all noble Lords who speak in this debate before moving any approval
Motion in the
Chamber.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071079000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071079000009">The
changes to fixed penalties follow up key commitments in the
Government’s <I>Strategic Framework for Road
Safety</I>—referred to hereafter as the framework—which
was published in May 2011. The framework sets out a package of measures
that would continue to reduce deaths and injuries on our roads. It also
recognises the importance of targeted enforcement to tackle behaviour
that represent a risk to road safety. The measures announced focus on
making the enforcement process more efficient, ensuring that penalties
are set at the right levels to avoid offences being perceived as
trivial and inconsequential, and making educational training more
widely available for low-level
offending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071079000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071079000010">Today’s
order supports the framework’s objectives by introducing
careless or inconsiderate driving as a fixed-penalty deposit and
increasing the amount an alleged road traffic offender must pay as a
result. We know that careless drivers put lives at risk and are a major
source of concern and irritation for law-abiding motorists. The police
will now have the power to issue fixed-penalty notices for careless
driving. This will allow them greater flexibility when dealing with
less serious careless driving offences, such as driving too close or
lane discipline—for example, staying in the 
<?notus-xml column=85?>wrong lane—as well as freeing them from resource-intensive court
processes. Drivers will still be able to appeal any decision in
court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071079000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071079000011">Fixed
penalty levels have not increased since 2000. Therefore, their real
value has fallen substantially, by about 25%. For example, if the
£60 fixed-penalty notice level set in 2000 had increased in line
with inflation, it would now be £80. Penalty levels are now
lower than other penalty notice offences of a similar severity. For
example, lower and higher-tier penalty notices for disorder offences,
which were recently increased, are now £60 for leaving litter
and £90 for being drunk and disorderly. Increasing fixed-penalty
deposit levels will not only ensure broader consistency with other,
similar penalty notices, it will also reflect the seriousness of these
offences. In addition, setting the penalty at these levels will remove
the need to review penalties in the longer term. I therefore commend
the order to the Committee. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071079000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071079000012"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T15:52:53"></hs_TimeCode></I><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Rosser" PimsId="462" UID="13071079000106" xid="1693" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071079000106">Lord

officer at the roadside on an alleged road traffic offender who does
not have a satisfactory address in the UK. The purpose of this is to
provide a guarantee of payment of a fixed-penalty notice or conditional
offer in respect of an alleged offence.</hs_para>

that Vehicle and Operator Services Agency statistics show that more
than 10,500 deposit notices were issued in 2012-13, with a payment rate
of almost 100%. That suggests that if the individual who cannot give an
acceptable address says that he or she cannot pay immediately, the
vehicle is immediately impounded pending payment. However, perhaps the

that most of the fixed-penalty deposits are, or will be, imposed by
police officers rather than an officer of the Vehicle and Operator
Services Agency. I say that in the context of the statement by the
Minister in the Commons when this order was discussed there on 2 July,
who said that the more than 10,500 deposit notices issued in 2012-13
were issued by VOSA officers with apparently none by police officers,
which suggests that these notices related to commercial

perhaps I may make a point about the extension of fixed penalties to
careless driving cases. The Explanatory Memorandum shows the really
quite dramatic fall that there has been in the number of careless
driving proceedings in court over the past 10 years or so. I
am not sure to what the decline can be attributed, although the
Explanatory Memorandum suggests some possible explanations. However, I
just hope that, with fixed penalties being introduced in relation to
careless driving, a check will be kept to ensure that they are being
used in only the least serious of such offences. There must be a
temptation to use them in more serious cases in the light of the time
savings involved and the paperwork that does not need to be completed
and prepared, as it would have to be for a case going to court. I
hope—indeed, I am sure—that the Minister will confirm
that the necessary effective checks are in place. After all, the
difference between careless driving causing a collision and injury and
it not doing so can often be a matter of luck rather than the degree of
carelessness in the driving. Certainly, from the Opposition, we have no
objection to this

Rosser, talked about careless driving. Of course, careless driving is
not necessarily a less serious offence. Some of the offences that we
are already capturing under the graduated fixed penalty are less
serious than careless driving. The issue is that 
<?notus-xml column=87?>we have brought careless driving into the fixed-penalty regime. I
understand the noble Lord’s point about dealing with a more
serious careless driving offence by means of a fixed penalty when it
would be appropriate to take it to court. It is a matter for the police
which way they go and I am sure that they will make the judgment
correctly. However, I have details here about which would come out as
less serious offences, able to be dealt with by means of a fixed
penalty. I have no doubt that the more serious offences will continue
to be taken to court. For instance, if a driver emerges from a junction
incorrectly, he may pick up a fixed penalty but if he causes another
motorist to take emergency avoiding action, his chances are that he
will find himself in court.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Rosser, drew attention to the fact that the successful
payment rate for these graduated fixed penalties is about 100%. He is
quite right. Most of them are issued by VOSA because the target is the
foreign heavy goods vehicle, which is going nowhere until the driver
has paid the graduated fixed-penalty deposit against either the
fixed-penalty notice or the possible court action. The noble Lord also
asked what happens where this scheme is used for private motorists. The
answer is basically the same. The vehicle is not going anywhere until
the penalty has been paid. It can be immobilised with the so-called
Denver boot. Payment is usually made by a credit card but there are
provisions in the legislation to deal with the problem of someone
mucking about by coming out with a very complicated payment system,
such as asking several times for £5 to be taken off several
cards. There are limits on how you can pay but the system is fair and I
am confident that it works.</hs_para>

British national might be deemed to be giving an unsatisfactory
address, other than their having no fixed abode. However, let us
suppose that it is a foreign driver. In a situation where that foreign
driver is unable to give a satisfactory address, presumably at the
moment they are given the fixed-penalty deposit because of that. Is
there, equally, a successful payment rate of or near to 100%, as there

overseas or are from the UK but cannot give a decent address, which for
various reasons some people cannot—there is a vulnerability that
they may not pay. So they would come into scope and that vehicle will
be immobilised until the graduated fixed-penalty deposit is paid. I

amendments to the Planning Act 2008 are being proposed to ensure that
only genuinely nationally significant infrastructure projects fall
within the DCO regime. Currently, the Planning Act does not set any
thresholds for nationally significant infrastructure highway or rail

genuinely nationally significant, must comply with the DCO regime laid

DCO regime is designed to speed up and improve the planning process for
large or complex schemes that are of national significance. The process
has already been used to good effect in delivering schemes that, due to
their scale or complexity, may have become bogged down in the
alternative planning systems. In these cases, the DCO is the most
appropriate regime to use. However, some schemes—for example, a
500-metre sidings extension, the widening of a slip road or a small
safety improvement scheme—are of only local importance and could
not be considered to be nationally significant, yet are required to use
the DCO regime. The necessary level of pre-application work and the
requirement for an examination under the DCO regime, which is right for
genuinely nationally significant schemes, would be disproportionate,
and in some cases unnecessary, for smaller, less complex or more
discrete
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071079000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071079000087">We
have also identified that small schemes which would not have been
nationally significant are being delayed or not taken forward. This is
because the cost and time it takes to promote a DCO—in the order
of 18 months—acts as a disincentive when looking to deliver
schemes as part of an in-year based programme. Consequently, we
sometimes have little choice but to adopt solutions which do not yield
maximum benefit to road users, but which are far more readily

national and local pinch point fund rounds, several schemes which would
have benefited from using this funding to support growth were not
considered because they would have been required to follow the DCO
regime and the time taken to gain the order would have put them out of
time for the fund. The proposed thresholds would allow the most
proportionate regime to be used, and this would increase certainty that
the most optimal schemes are being delivered, which would have a
greater benefit for growth. The Planning Act, as currently worded, has
also led to confusion about whether certain local schemes, because they
have a purpose connected to the strategic road network, should be
within the DCO regime. This has led to serious delays and added costs
to developers while the wording in the Act is clarified. In a few cases
the planning process had to be restarted leading to abortive work and
cost<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:11:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

clear terms that only those highway schemes for which the Secretary of
State for Transport is or will be the highway authority, this confusion
and potential avenues for delays to much needed growth are removed.
Currently, in schemes that provide a development with access to the
strategic road network, to mitigate the impacts of the development they
are also required to use the DCO regime, even when those works already
benefit from planning permission as part of the overall development
consent. Under the DCO regime, promoters must submit full consultation
and assessment documentation and undergo an examination even when they
are uncontested. This can take up to 18 months for the whole process
and can be undertaken only after the full development site application
has been granted. Under the Highways Act, uncontested schemes that are
part of the planning permission for a site and the required side road
orders can be made without a hearing and without a charge, therefore
making this regime quicker and less expensive. These mitigation works
are needed to deliver new developments and, as such, any delay or cost
increase affects delivery of new
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:12:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

major schemes and schemes that are developer-funded would usually have
already gone through public scrutiny via the examination in public of
the local plan or through a full planning application process. Under
the DCO regime, they would be required to undertake them again, adding
further costs and delays to the scheme delivery. The proposed amendment
would remove all local major schemes from the DCO regime and allow
developers certainty to proceed through one regime under the Highways
Act. There is still the option of using the DCO regime for a scheme
that will now fall outside the development consent regime but which is
none the less considered to be of national significance by the
Secretary of State on application making a direction that the scheme is
of national significance. This will then bring the scheme within the
development consent regime. The position for railway developments under
Section 25 of the 2008 Act has similarly resulted in schemes that would
not ordinarily be considered nationally significant being required to
obtain a DCO pursuant to the 2008 Act, and with similar consequences.
As there is currently no threshold, any scheme for the construction or
alteration of a railway that cannot progress using 
<?notus-xml column=91?>permitted development rights under the Town and Country Planning Act
1990 regime becomes a nationally significant infrastructure project and

developments that can be considered to be nationally significant

circumstances in which projects are considered to be nationally
significant, resulting in more projects proceeding instead under the

less than ideal solutions in order to avoid the DCO process. This is
because when the 2008 Act was going through Parliament, to be honest,
it was not fully appreciated what the adverse effects of the

created that will transfer property rights and liabilities to the
Secretary State for Transport, Network Rail, London and Continental
Railways and the Rail Safety and Standards Board, and will come into
effect at the same time as this order. I commend BRBR on the sterling
job that it has done since it was created in 2001 to manage the rump of

disposed of 90% of those properties, generating in excess of

as a wholly owned subsidiary of the British Railways Board to hold and
manage the residual property rights and liabilities of the board

wound up at the appropriate time and its ongoing functions, properties,

Bodies Act 2011 is the only efficient and cost-effective
means of divesting BRBR of its statutory functions, including the
statutory liabilities that arose in the original  19th-century
Acts authorising the construction of the railways. The draft order

Faulkner of Worcester:</Member></B> My Lords, I intend to speak very
briefly about this order. I agree completely with the Minister in his
tribute to the work of the board of BRBR and its staff over the 12
years or so of its existence. The Minister may remember that I spoke
about the inclusion of BRBR in the Committee stage of the Public Bodies
Bill on 14 December 2010. The Minister has referred to how the British
Railways Board (Residuary) has gone about fulfilling its
responsibilities since 2001, and I agree with him that its record has
been excellent in many respects. I have been particularly impressed by
how it has dealt with the 6,400 or so industrial injury and other
health claims from former BR employees, to which the Minister referred

also done really well in discharging its railway heritage
responsibilities, and I thank the Minister for his reference to this
issue in his speech. I speak as a former chairman of the Railway
Heritage Committee and the current chair of its successor body, the
Railway Heritage Designation Advisory Board, which as part of the
Science Museum Group has taken on the RHC’s statutory powers of
designation. This is partly thanks to the efforts of the Minister, who
supported us in resisting its abolition under the Public Bodies Act
2011.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071079000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071079000071">Very
many significant railway artefacts have found their way to BRBR stores.
The Minister referred to the drawings, which are literally priceless,
but there are also some wonderful paintings from the railways’
art collection. Many of those are now on public display in
museums and galleries all over the country as a result of, first, the
statutory designation, and then the disposal procedures of the RHC and
the co-operation of

other great contribution that BRBR has made in this area is in
supporting the Railway Heritage Trust which, under the chairmanship of
Sir William McAlpine, plays a huge part in restoring and preserving
historic railway buildings. BRBR has been instrumental in securing
third-party funding for the Railway Heritage Trust, particularly from
Network Rail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:35:00"></hs_TimeCode>. In
this context —I hope that the Minister will allow me to
do this—I should like to put on record my own tribute to one of
the unsung heroes of Britain’s railways, Peter Trewin, who is
the legal and secretariat director of BRBR. He was also the secretary
of the British Railways Board. He is a lifetime career railwayman, whom
I knew first when he worked with Sir Peter Parker
more than 30 years ago. He has played a crucial
role in ensuring that the railway takes its heritage responsibilities
seriously. I should like to thank him on the record for that

matter that I wish to raise with the Minister. He talked about
burdensome estate— the structures that were once part of
the operational 
<?notus-xml column=97?>railway—and that in the main these will be transferred to the
Highways Agency. Can he give an assurance that this will not lead to
roads being built on these remaining railway track beds? He will know
from reading my recently published book that once the infrastructure
has been built on, the opportunity to reopen railways on it is lost for
ever. There are a number of heritage railways—I declare an
interest as president of the HRA—that are looking at
long-disused lines as future potential routes. We may also wish one day
to restore some lines to the national network, as the demand for rail
travel grows. That will not be possible if the infrastructure is
converted into a road and we must not close down those options. I hope

3.94% across those years, short by just 0.1%, but within the margin of

of our total demand. We are aiming for this to increase to 12%. In

regulations form part of an ambitious and busy schedule for renewable
heating policy. The importance of low carbon and renewable heat in the
long-term energy mix for the UK, and the “world first”
nature of RHI, necessitates an ongoing programme of improvements,
expansions and enhancements. For instance, the Government expect to be
announcing the details of a domestic RHI very soon. We have also just
concluded, on 28 June, an early tariff review consultation for the
non-domestic scheme, proposing revised tariff levels for technologies

metering requirements involved a number of proposals. These were aimed
at reducing the number of heat meters required and driving down the
cost of participating in the RHI, while protecting the public purse by
ensuring that only eligible heat is paid for. More than 90% of
respondents were in support of our proposed changes. Following this
high level of support, we have moved to revise the RHI metering
requirements, with the resulting requirements being very similar to our
original
proposals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071084000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071084000015">In
addition to these headline changes, four smaller scheme improvements
are included in these regulations and have been made with the intention
of increasing uptake to the scheme. Two improvements were included in
the July consultation: relocation of an installation and allowing
certain processes to occur outside. Both 
<?notus-xml column=102?>were supported by those respondents who commented on them. These
regulations will make it possible for an RHI accredited installation to
be relocated and to continue to receive tariff payments for the
remainder of the 20 years, provided that, on relocation, the system
meets the necessary requirements. It will also be possible to receive
RHI payments for commercial cleaning and drying processes that occur
outside. Both these changes were supported by those respondents who
commented on the proposed
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071084000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071084000016">Finally,
two further amendments to the scheme were included to provide clarity
to the regulations. The first is the addition of ground water as an
eligible heat source for ground source heat pumps. The second is a
minor word change to allow renewable installations that are used as the
assessment installation—for an installer to join the
microgeneration certification scheme —to be eligible for
the RHI.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071084000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071084000017">As
these amendments show, the performance of the RHI is constantly under

Committee will agree, good air quality is vital to our health, and it
is essential that the RHI scheme does not have a negative impact on our
environment. Since the announcement of the scheme in March 2011, we
have made it clear that we are committed to introducing air-quality
emissions limits for solid biomass boilers. The main pollutants which
can be increased through increased combustion of biomass are
particulate matter and oxides of
nitrogen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071084000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071084000019">Currently,
combustion of biomass contributes only a very small proportion of these
harmful emissions. However, to date, biomass has made up a significant
proportion of RHI accredited installations, and we expect this to
continue. Where biomass replaces either heating oil or coal, there is
no increase in the emissions levels of key air-quality pollutants.
However, when replacing gas or electricity, the emissions are higher,
meaning that it is important to limit the air-quality implications of
burning biomass. The emissions levels to be introduced for biomass
boilers producing heat from solid biomass are set at 30 grams per
gigajoule of thermal heat input for particulate matter and at
150 grams per gigajoule for oxides of nitrogen.</hs_para>

be required to demonstrate that they meet the emissions limits by
providing emissions certificates to Ofgem. These certificates will be
provided to participants by the manufacturers of biomass boilers. When
producing the certificates, manufacturers will be required to test
their boilers and to show clearly through the certificate what types of
biomass fuel their boiler can combust without exceeding the emissions
limits. Participants will not be permitted to use types of biomass fuel
that are not listed as being compatible with their boiler on their
emissions certificate, and they will be required to demonstrate to
Ofgem that they are meeting this requirement.</hs_para>

does not prove to be overly burdensome for manufacturers of boilers and
we are therefore introducing flexibility through type-testing. This
will mean that, when there is a “family” of boiler 
<?notus-xml column=103?>models which are identical apart from their capacity, only a limited
number of them will need to be tested. Also, plants which have had to
obtain an environmental permit will not be expected to provide an
additional emissions

will now cover the other major change to the regulations, the revised
metering requirements of the RHI. This is another technically complex
area covered by these regulations. Since the launch of the
scheme  in November 2011, the metering requirements have been
highlighted as overly burdensome and considered a disincentive to
joining the scheme. We place great importance on feedback from industry
and from the scheme operator, Ofgem. This feedback led to our proposal
to revise the metering requirements of the scheme. As all payments made
on the non-domestic RHI scheme are on the basis of metered heat, it is
essential that this is done absolutely right, by ensuring that only
generated heat being used for an eligible purpose is paid for.
Fundamentally, we remain committed to the principle that the
non-domestic RHI payment is based upon metered heat. At least one meter
will always be required to measure the heat used for eligible
purposes.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071084000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071084000023">The
proposed changes to metering are to allow more flexibility and to
reduce the number of unnecessary meters being installed. Under the
revised regulations, there will be an increased use of heat loss
calculations when participants have taken appropriate energy efficiency
measures and insulated external piping to industry standards. We also
recognise alternative ways of determining heat generated. When a
back-up gas or electric fossil fuel heat source is still in place, we
will allow its fuel consumption to be measured rather than the heat
output. We will assume that 100% of the fuel consumed is converted into
heat, ensuring the taxpayer never loses out to inefficient heat
conversion, while still providing additional flexibility to the
participant.</hs_para>

smaller scheme improvements included in these regulations, I will focus
first on the two that are aimed at increasing uptake to the scheme.
Allowing the relocation of an accredited RHI installation will increase
the uptake of companies providing heat to third parties. The ability to
relocate while continuing to claim RHI will remove the barrier of
needing to obtain a long-term lease to make a renewable heat source a
viable option. On relocation, the installation will need to be
reassessed by our delivery partner Ofgem to ensure that it still meets
the accreditation requirements before payments recommence. We recognise
the need to provide greater reassurance for investors that renewable
heat is a good investment. This change will help provide confidence
that their asset will retain value, by enabling a renewable heat
installation to be moved.</hs_para>

expands the number of “eligible purposes” under the
scheme. Currently, to be eligible for the RHI, any heat produced must
be used within a building. However, this has restricted the suitability
of the scheme for some industrial processes. In order to incentivise
additional renewable heat, these regulations open up the scheme to
commercial cleaning and drying, which can take place outside. This
would allow woodchip 
<?notus-xml column=104?>and wood pellet drying to take place without the need to construct a
shell of a building around the process. Allowing cleaning that takes
place outside will encourage the use of renewables for heating water
for commercial cleaning processes, such as washing a fleet of
commercial vehicles.</hs_para>

being introduced were agreed on by both DECC and our colleagues in the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Defra is the lead
department on issues relating to air quality. The limits set were at a
level intended to significantly reduce the air quality impacts of the
RHI, but where we could also expect significant growth in the biomass
boiler market and the rollout of renewable heat. The aim of introducing
these limits is not to exclude any particular biomass fuel from the
scheme but rather  to ensure a good level of air quality. We
accept that  it will be harder for some fuels than others to
meet the requirements of the scheme. However, we should  not be
supporting fuels which cannot meet the stated emissions
limits.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071084000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071084000027">The
changes I have set out will apply to England and Wales, and Scotland.
RHI policy in Northern Ireland is devolved. Colleagues in Scotland have
confirmed that they are content with the changes I have set out today,
and Scottish Ministers have given their consent to the regulations as
required by the Energy Act 2008. Northern Irish Ministers administer a
separate but equivalent scheme and have been notified of the intended
changes, as have Welsh Ministers.</hs_para>

must drive up the uptake of renewables for us to meet our 2020
renewables targets. These amendments go some way to making that scheme
more accessible. The renewables market is still relatively young and
the improvements and extensions planned for the RHI will result in our
seeing a significant increase in the uptake of renewable heat. The
scheme is a key driver in helping to develop that market. I
therefore commend the regulations to the

is a serious subject. As my noble friend said and as the Explanatory
Memorandum sets out so well, heat is an important part of our energy
usage in this country. It is an important part of decarbonising our
energy requirements and meeting our 15% target by 2020. Starkly, as the

emphasis on air quality, which is really important in terms of solid
biomass, and another is the flexibility that it gives to ensure that
the scheme will be much more user-friendly than it is at the moment.
The consultation showed that some of the 
<?notus-xml column=105?>metering requirements were difficult, and I congratulate the Government
on taking that on board and trying to fix it in a very practical way. I

to ask the Minister about the domestic RHI but she has more or less

last question is on the impact. Paragraph 10.2 of the Explanatory

that the air quality standards for an RHI installation are different
from those for boilers otherwise—or are there air quality

understand whether there is a differentiation here and, if so, why, and
how we move forward on that—or perhaps I have misread or

Grantchester:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for her extensive
introduction to the regulations. The RHI, launched in November 2011, is
a key financial scheme

relevant to off-grid businesses in rural areas which are dependent on

sides of the House, renewable heat is recognised as an essential
component of the UK’s long-term energy mix. In a debate on the
order in the other place yesterday, the Minister there gave details
regarding uptake of the scheme, which is very
encouraging—indeed, the Minister here has mentioned some of
those figures

I am concerned about the application of the degression system, whereby
tariffs are reduced if one or other or both of two thresholds of
expenditure are reached—namely, a technology-specific trigger
where an imbalance in take-up between technologies occurs and a total
trigger that puts an overall cap on spending. While I am not critical
of there being an overall total trigger, I am nevertheless concerned
that the total may be set rather low, and therefore I am concerned
about its effect on applications. If, as of 1 June this year, a scheme
payout to date of £13 million has resulted—as the
Minister in the other place said yesterday and the noble Baroness has
repeated here today—the degression system is already in
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000013">I am
concerned that a tariff reduction of 5% at this early stage will
discourage schemes coming forward. The Minister in the other place went
on to say that £53.8 million is expected to be spent by this
time next year. Will this result in further tariff reductions and does
this total include the effect of degression? When an application is
made under the scheme, when is it known at what level the tariff will
be paid? While it is not specifically relevant to the regulations, it
is nevertheless important to understand how the scheme has worked to
date and how details of the degression payments are published in real
time to applicants. Will the payment level be set at the time of an
application and thereby not be affected by later uptake by further
applicants?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000014">The
developments in the RHI that the Minister has outlined today are
entirely to be welcomed. Meeting renewable energy targets should not
come at the price of increased risks to public health or the
environment. Several key outputs will be achieved. First, air quality
will be protected through the introduction of emission limits for new
biomass installations supported through the scheme. Secondly, the
number of excessive, burdensome compliance requirements will be
reduced, thereby increasing take-up; for example, by reducing the
burdens associated with
metering.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000015">Thirdly,
the relocation of accredited installations will be permitted, thereby
allowing asset values to be maintained and the economic life of assets
to be extended. The Explanatory Memorandum is commendable in its
assessments, judging that the total resource cost increase will amount
to about 8% over the lifetime of the policy, that additional testing
and certification costs are likely to be largely immaterial and that
Ofgem’s administrative costs be limited to 0.5% of total costs.

have new biomass boilers fully compliant by that time. The memorandum
identifies that, where a biomass installation replaces a non-net-bound
fuel-based installation such as heating oil or coal, its introduction
can improve emissions and therefore there should be no delay to any
scheme. In contrast, where biomass displaces electricity or gas-fired
heat, the air quality impacts are negative. Will the Minister clarify

applications that displace electricity or gas-fired heat may well be
rejected?</hs_para>

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord
Teverson and the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, for their warm welcome
to the regulations. I am also grateful for the quality, rather than the
quantity, of the debate. In this House, the one thing that we do well
is contribute with quality. A number of questions have been asked and I
will try to go through them as much as I can. If there are any
questions that I fail to answer today, I will undertake to write after
reading <I>Hansard</I>.</hs_para>

noble friend Lord Teverson asked what “properly
insulated” means. I am advised that it means that it is a
section of external piping that does not exceed the maximum permissible
heat loss outlined in British Standard 5422. I am sure that means a lot
more to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, than it does to me.
“Properly insulated” is defined in Regulation 3 of these
regulations.</hs_para>

asked about relocation. I think that I referred to that in my opening
remarks. However, I am quite happy to repeat myself if the noble Lord
wishes me to. Basically, if any plant is relocated the participant will
be entitled to the remainder 
<?notus-xml column=108?>of the existing tariff for the remainder of the tariff lifetime. The
plant does not have to meet air quality requirements, for example, as
it is not a new accreditation, provided that the original accreditation
is provided.</hs_para>

asked whether air quality emissions limits will apply only to future
installations. The RHI emissions limits in these regulations are more
stringent than those that apply to the highest-emitting boilers
currently in the market. As a result, we will be encouraging
the use of lower-emitting
boilers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:19:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

which technologies have not met their potential, the currently
supported technologies that have been subject to the tariff review are
large biomass—that is, with a capacity of over 1
megawatt—ground source heat pumps and solar
thermal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:20:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Grantchester, asked why we were using degression so early in the
process. The deployment of medium biomass has exceeded the rate that we
had expected when the tariff was originally set, which suggests that
the tariff is higher than is necessary to incentivise installers.
Therefore, we may be overcompensating further installations if we do
not adjust our tariffs downwards. Although we encourage biomass through
its size, we do not want to support one type of technology in
particular when there are other technologies out there that may do as
well and provide equal value for money—and it is value for money
that we are really keen to get. I hope that that has answered the noble
Lord’s

Grantchester:</Member></B> I am listening very carefully to the noble
Baroness. Following the wise words of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, my
concern is that it is quite a big ask to reach our limits by 2020. I am
concerned that, if the degression totals are set too soon and too
early, we may choke off from coming forward those who could potentially
help to meet these quite stringent

noble friend Lord Teverson asked about the limits on boilers outside
the RHI scheme. There are  no emission limits for boilers
outside the scheme  but other measures may apply—for

the directive by 22 July this year.</hs_para>

directive creates a new regulatory framework and a passport to market
funds across the EEA for managers of investment funds that are not
already authorised under the undertakings for collective investment in
transferable securities, or UCITS, directive. The regulations also
create an optional lighter framework for smaller managers of venture
capital and social investment funds, including a marketing
passport.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000033">The
investment management industry is one of the UK’s success
stories. It serves millions of customers all around the globe and forms
a key part of the UK’s financial sector, managing £4.9
trillion of funds and earning an estimated £12 billion a year
for the UK economy. Around one-third of European assets under
management are managed out of the UK and the industry is a significant
provider of high value-added jobs and skills, with clusters of
expertise in London and Scotland and across many UK
regions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000034">Because
of the importance of this sector to the country, sensible and
proportionate application of the requirements of the directive is vital
to safeguarding its future. Therefore, we have consulted extensively
with industry and other stakeholders while developing these
regulations. As well as setting up face-to-face meetings with a range
of trade associations and individual firms, we published a discussion
paper and two consultation papers. We received 27 responses to the main
consultation paper. Jointly with the Financial Conduct Authority we
also set up an open forum event, which was attended by more than 300
stakeholders. The regulations have been developed in line with the
feedback that we received, and the asset management sector has been
very supportive of our overall approach to their
introduction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000035">We
have made full use of the flexibility provided by the directive to
ensure that our industry has as reasonable a timetable of transition to
the new regime as possible. 
<?notus-xml column=110?>UK firms must therefore be authorised or registered in accordance with
the directive before 22 July next year. A firm will need to comply with
the relevant directive requirements by the time that its authorisation
or registration is approved. The full scope of the directive applies to
firms managing cumulative assets with a value in excess of the
threshold of €500 million, or €100 million if they are
leveraged—that is, if they have used debt to supplement
investment. Other firms may also opt in to the full scope of the
directive if they
choose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000036">The
directive prescribes uniform regulatory standards for fully
AIFMD-authorised firms, in particular a requirement to appoint a
depositary, new rules on delegation, disclosure of leverage to
investors, liquidity management standards, common standards on valuing
fund assets and restrictions on asset-stripping for private equity
firms. In exchange, fully authorised firms will be able to benefit from
a marketing passport. This  will allow them to market the funds
that they manage across the EEA, based on a single authorisation with
the Financial Conduct
Authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000037">There
is little discretion for individual member states on exactly how they
implement these requirements. However, we are working closely with the
FCA to ensure that these new rules are applied in a pragmatic and
proportionate manner. We will not add any new regulatory requirements
to firms below the threshold, with the exception of a few minor
obligations imposed by the directive.</hs_para>

directive will represent a significant shift in the way that the
European alternative investment fund management sector operates, and it
is likely to increase operational costs for many firms. We have
therefore explored every opportunity to minimise the negative impacts
on UK firms. In addition to the 12-month transitional period to which I
have already referred, we have made a number of policy decisions,
including the use of available derogations to keep these impacts down.
Also, we have not applied any gold-plating in our implementation of the
directive. No directive requirements above the minimum required for
implementation will be applied to UK firms and no other new
requirements are being
introduced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000039">Our
regulations are also designed to ensure that UK investors continue to
have access to funds in other jurisdictions, so that EEA and
third-country managers seeking to market here will benefit from a
similar transitional period to UK firms. EEA managers who cannot make
use of the marketing passport will be able to market to UK retail
investors on the same terms as a UK firm would, provided that the fund
has been recognised as providing sufficient investor
protection.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000040">Third-country
managers will be able to market to UK investors once they have
completed a simple notification process with the Financial Conduct

requirements imposed by the directive as soon as there are no longer
any UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:29:45"></hs_TimeCode> investors
invested in their fund. Again, this overall approach to non-UK firms
follows the strategy of replicating the status quo of marketing

the European position, but I notice a dearth of Conservative support in
the Committee on this issue. On issues such as this, in the absence of
some of those noble Lords who, like their colleagues on the
Conservative Benches in the Commons, always smell a rat in anything to
do with the European Community, one always worries whether any such
indication exists as far as this SI is concerned. Certainly, our side

Minister identified the issue of costs, which, it is clear from the
documentation, are not negligible. However, I ask the Minister to come
clean on something that I do not think occurred in the other place.
When this SI was being considered and the consultation had taken place
with the industry, how is it that the Government, with extraordinarily
adroit timing, also included in the Finance Bill £150 million of
tax cuts to the industry? In this a case once again of the Government,
with their well-known friends in the City and conscious that some costs
are involved—I am not underestimating the costs—thinking
that some softening of the impact must be made by other aspects of
government policy?</hs_para>

I can say is that I do not agree with that. I am not at all convinced
about the necessity for that. After all, as the Minister was at pains
to point out, and as was also made clear in the other place, there are
considerable benefits from what the noble Lord referred to quite
clearly as a passport for effective operation in Europe. That is not a
negligible thing. Ordinary citizens pay for a passport when they have
the right to go abroad, so I am not clear why the costs appear to have
been partially defrayed by the Government acting in another legislative
capacity to moderate costs for the industry with the tax concessions
that they have
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:34:35"></hs_TimeCode>. 
<?notus-xml column=112?>After all, it is not as if the industry has not for some time been quite

apologise if I am a little slow in understanding the position but
perhaps the Minister can spell it out. I understand entirely the
€500 million threshold on activity and the €100 million
base, but I take it that those who fall below that threshold yet are in
this category of activity are subject to some regulation from the
Financial Conduct Authority. I was not quite sure whether the Minister
had spelt that point out. I apologise to him in advance if he did and I

The Minister referred to the date by which we were obliged to comply.
What are the prospects of the other 27 states complying with that
timetable? He says, “Well, we haven’t gold-plated this

must exist across Europe. We therefore want some assurance that other

the noble Lord’s questions, he raised the point about whether
the decision in the Budget to abolish Schedule 19 stamp duty reserve
tax was a sop to the industry that was being hit by this directive, to
which the answer is no. It is not, if for no other reason than that the
firms covered by this directive were not bearing the stamp duty. This
directive covers hedge funds and private equity, which were not paying
the stamp duty reserve tax in the first place, so that is not the case.
The reason for abolishing that relatively modest bit of stamp duty was
that we were undertaking a package of reforms designed to enhance the
competitiveness of the funds industry, and to help secure our status as
the global asset management centre. The scope within the EU to expand
that kind of activity of fund management is considerable, in our view,
and we do not want to constrain it by unnecessary burdens of any
sort.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071095000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000054">The

that I cannot give the noble Lord any information on the state of

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally):</Member></B> My
Lords, the order amends two key provisions in the Coroners Act 1988.
The first is Section 4A(8), which governs the jurisdiction of coroners
in Wales. The second is Section 13, which allows applications to be
made to the High Court by, or under the authority of, the
Attorney-General, for an inquest, or fresh inquest, to be ordered.
These provisions of the Coroners Act 1988 will not be repealed when the
bulk of Part 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 is implemented
later this month. The purpose of the draft order is simply to amend the
terminology of these provisions to make them consistent with the
Coroners and Justice Act 2009.</hs_para>

contains a number of important reforms to the coroner system. It
creates the new post of chief coroner, the new judicial head of the
system, and makes a number of changes that will help to speed up the
inquest process, improve consistency between coroner areas and drive up
standards.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071095000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000058">Part 1 of the 2009 Act
also introduces new terminology, including new titles for coroners and
the areas they are appointed to. It also introduces the new concept of
an “investigation” into a death, of which the inquest
will form part. Under the 2009 Act, the coroner or jury will make
“determinations and findings” at the end of an inquest
rather than reaching a “verdict” and making an
“inquisition”.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=114?><hs_para UID="13071095000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000059">Following a consultation
exercise earlier this year, we intend to commence the majority of the
2009 Act provisions, and new coroners’ rules and regulations, on
25 July. When we implement the 2009 Act, we will repeal the 1988 Act
but with two important exceptions. The first exception relates to the
deployment of coroners in Wales. Section 4A(8) of the Coroners Act 1988
provides that a coroner appointed to a district in Wales is to be
considered a coroner for the whole of Wales. This gives additional
flexibility in the deployment of resources in Wales. It means that a
coroner with specialist skills can temporarily act outside his or her
own district without having to be appointed as a coroner in the other
district. This is particularly useful for urgent matters which may
arise, such as the need to request a post-mortem examination or to
facilitate organ donation. The draft order, therefore, updates the
language of Section 4A(8) to make it consistent with the 2009 Act. It
does this by changing the word “coroner” to
“senior coroner” and “coroner’s
district” to “coroner area”. We will repeal the
rest of Section
4A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:46:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:48:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:44:59"></hs_TimeCode>other 1988 Act
provision that we need to save is Section 13. This important provision
allows an application to be made by, or under the authority of, the
Attorney-General to the High Court for an inquest or a fresh inquest to
be ordered. Noble Lords will no doubt remember the important debate
that we had about implementation of the post of chief coroner when the
Public Bodies Bill was before this House. The Government listened to
concerns expressed about the importance of the role of the chief
coroner and agreed to take the post out of scope of the Public Bodies
Bill. This was on the proviso that Section 40 of the 2009 Act, which
created a new system of appeals to the chief coroner, would be
repealed. In doing so, we were clear that we would instead retain
Section 13 of the 1988
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:46:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

order therefore amends the terminology of Section 13 to match the
language of the 2009 Act.  For example it allows the High Court
to order an investigation, rather than an inquest, into a death where
the coroner has refused or neglected to hold one, or a fresh
investigation where a coroner has already held one. The order also
allows the High Court to order a different coroner within
the coroner area  to conduct the investigation or fresh
investigation. Alternatively, the chief coroner will be able to direct
a coroner in a different area to conduct the investigation, using the
power in Section 3 of the 2009 Act. Retaining Section 13 of
the 1988 Act preserves an important means for bereaved people to
challenge the outcome or conduct of a coroner’s
investigation.</hs_para>

concern was raised in the other House about  the effectiveness
of Section 13 for those bereaved people who are dissatisfied with a
coroner’s investigation. The recent example regarding the tragic
deaths at Hillsborough should be sufficient to demonstrate the merits
of Section 13. Last December, my right honourable friend the
Attorney-General lodged such an application with the High Court on
behalf of the families of those who died at Hillsborough. The High
Court subsequently quashed the original inquests and ordered new ones
to be held. We expect the inquests to begin early next year. Without
Section 13, the only available means for 
<?notus-xml column=115?>challenging a coroner’s decisions would be by means of judicial
review, which was not an option for the Hillsborough families, given
the time limits for bringing such
proceedings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:48:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:48:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

reassure noble Lords that the Government remain committed to reforming
the coroner system, to make it more responsive to the needs of bereaved
families. Retaining those two provisions from the 1988 Act will help us
to achieve those aims. I therefore commend this draft order to the
Committee. I beg to

Finlay of Llandaff:</Member></B> I am very grateful to the Government
for this order, and I am glad to speak to it today. I thank the
Government for the way in which this is happening because there has
been a gentle transition that aims to enhance the experience of the
public. When they are bereaved, people are incredibly vulnerable but
there will now be a process that is kinder to them. If an investigation
is required  it can be conducted. If the investigation shows
that it was a natural death, the coroner can simply register the death
and the family will be spared the court process if it is not necessary.
If, however, a hearing is required, the family will get an inquest and
they will have the hearing that they may seek. That means that it meets
the needs and expectations of the bereaved. I hope that having a
process that is much clearer in its stages will also help with that
group of deaths that are deaths by suicide. It has been particularly
difficult even to ascertain the data on how many such deaths occur
because of how they are often recorded. The term
“verdict” is used, which is often seen as suggesting that
there was some kind of criminal intent behind the suicide, when death
by suicide is a very tragic event for everyone left behind.</hs_para>

transition should also raise the overall standard of the experience of
families from lower standards to the standards of the better and best.
I have discussed the order with coroners, and there is an expectation
that it will achieve what we have all wanted, which is to drive up the
overall standard. I hope that the Government will encourage the chief
coroner to have the courage to put pressure on those coroners that
people have been concerned about.</hs_para>

final point is to welcome the flexibility for Wales. We will have new
transplant legislation before us in Wales fairly soon, and it will be
particularly important that at all times of the day or night the
coroner can be contacted in relation to organ retrieval. Having the
ability to provide cross-cover should mean that we will have the
service that is needed and that the coroners themselves will have a
working life and home life that are compatible with enjoying living in
Wales, rather than being exhausted. I am grateful to the

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I have some second-hand acquaintance
with the coroner system because I was articled to a coroner and
subsequently became his partner. He was a part-time coroner in the
north-east of England. I cannot resist the temptation—I rarely
do—to recount a couple of incidents from that time. The first
was the remarkable theory constructed by the 
<?notus-xml column=116?>coroner’s officer, who is a police officer attached to the
coroner’s office, about a chap who was found drowned in the
bath. The officer came up with the wonderful theory that this man had
committed suicide by deliberately banging himself on the back of the
head so that he would become unconscious and drown in the bath. My
principal was not entirely convinced by this theory, and accidental
death was recorded instead. On another occasion he had to show a
bereaved widow the body of her husband for identification purposes. The
body was produced from the cabinet and uncovered, and she acknowledged
that this was indeed her husband. She turned to go away and my partner,
as he then was, began to put the drawer back into the cupboard, but
then she said, “Do you mind, Mr Henderson, if I have another
look?”. “Oh yes, my dear”, he said, and pulled the
thing out again and uncovered it. She looked down at her husband and
said, “Well, there you are”—I will not repeat the
expletives—“may you rot in hell”. So a
coroner’s life can be quite an interesting
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:53:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

order, my honourable friend Robert Flello raised a couple of points in
the other place. The first was to regret the fact that it did indeed
take something of a struggle to persuade the Government to retain the
office of chief coroner. However, they did that, and I join the noble
Baroness in commending that and, up to a point, the changes before us
today. She and the Minister are right to refer to the continued
availability of Section 13 of the 1988 Act and the possible process of
obtaining an order from the Attorney-General. However, that is by no
means a simple procedure; rather, it is convoluted and, given that the
noble Baroness has reminded us of the state of mind of bereaved
families, it is one that is difficult to
pursue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:50:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the 2009 Act there was provision for an appeals procedure. My
honourable friend asserted, and I agree with him, that it would have
been better to have retained or implemented that provision,
particularly as the alternative to the Attorney-General procedure,
cumbersome and protracted as it is, will now be only to rely upon
judicial review. Judicial review, of course, poses a question of cost
and of course will largely be out of scope of legal aid. It will be yet
another difficult process for someone, particularly in the
circumstances of bereavement, to negotiate, both practically and
emotionally. It is unsatisfactory that the Government have not
retained—or, rather, implemented—that provision for an
appeals process, and are leaving the potential applicant with an
unsatisfactory choice between the Attorney-General process and JR, the
access to which is highly questionable

noble friend pointed out, the two things are not incompatible. Of
course it may well be, as both the Minister and the noble Baroness have
said, that standards should indeed be raised, but that does not
necessarily mean that there will not on occasion be the perceived

challenge a decision. There ought to be a proper scope to facilitate
that, and the concern is that that is not easily available under the

other aspect that the Minister might perhaps touch on is what is left

other aspects of implementing the reform, and I assume that there will
be further orders to come. I do not know if he is in a position to
indicate when that might happen—I hope it will not be for a
while so that some of us, the Minister included, can take a breath in
the mean time from the tide of regulations and orders that we will be

it made sense for the whole thing to be brought together, but we have
to deal with the order today. In the circumstances, we cannot object to
it but we have regrets about the limited way in which the 2009 Act is

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to both the noble
Baroness, Lady Finlay, and the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, for their
contributions. I pay tribute to the noble Baroness. Whenever a
Government listen to wise advice and make an adjustment of policy, the
Opposition immediately and churlishly brand that a U-turn rather than
what good government should be, which is to listen to wise advice. I
think that everyone now believes in the campaign that the noble
Baroness very successfully worked on to restore the office of chief
coroner; I do not think that anyone would now go back on that decision.
Indeed, one of the more welcome things about what has happened is that
His Honour Judge Peter Thornton has hit the ground running in his job.
He has been visiting coroners across England and Wales, meeting
stakeholders, issuing guidance to coroners on issues such as the
location  of inquest hearings and less invasive post mortem
examinations, and drawing up proposals for specialist cadres of
coroners to conduct certain types of investigation. He has been working
very closely with my own office, the MoJ, on the rules and regulations
under the Act, and has set up a new coroners’ training group and
is working with the Judicial College to deliver training for coroners.
Therefore, the hopes and expectations that the noble Baroness, Lady
Finlay, has for the office are justified by the new chief
coroner’s “hit the ground running”

pleased to note, and welcome, the noble Baroness’s point about
the way that the new chief coroner is approaching his appointment and
the way that the  Act is being implemented. He is taking a
kinder approach at a point of vulnerability. These cases are
always  very heart-wrenching, particularly those involving
suicide. A case came across my desk recently in which the parents
simply did not want to believe that their son had committed suicide.
Reading the case, I thought that one should always give the widest
margin of interpretation where there is a scintilla of doubt, because
it is the people who are left behind who are left with the questions
and doubts. It is a point of real vulnerability.</hs_para>

that the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, made about Sections 13 and 40. For
cost and other reasons, we did not want to implement Section 40. If we
are to help bereaved families to achieve closure, the addition of a
further layer of appeal rights is not the answer. This can simply
encourage distraught relatives to pursue lengthy legal challenges and
to exhaust all avenues of redress. The Government consider that it is
better to focus on raising the standards of coroner investigations to
ensure that bereaved families are satisfied with the process rather
than to have new appeal rights and expensive litigation. Retaining
Section 13 in addition to judicial review will provide a mechanism for
challenges to coroners’ decisions where things go wrong.

of consistency across coroner services in England and Wales over what
is available in the way of out-of-hours cover, which allows for quick
decisions in this kind of area. It depends in large part on local

services are designated as a commissioner-requested service. There are
also special conditions that will apply to an individual provider, such

turn to the second aspect of these regulations. Monitor has powers to
take action where a person—which may be a licence holder, an
exempt provider, NHS England or a clinical commissioning
group—has not complied with a request for information documents,
records or other documents that it considers necessary for Monitor to
carry out its regulatory functions. Monitor also has powers to take

Monitor’s powers to impose three different types of
discretionary requirements, and I remind the Committee of them as a
refresher. The first is a variable monetary penalty of such amount as
Monitor may determine, up to 10% of the organisation’s turnover
in England. The second is a compliance requirement, or, in other words,
action to stop the breach in question or to ensure that it does not
happen again—for example, a requirement that a provider ceases
plans to dispose of an asset needed for the provision of a specified
service. The third is a restoration requirement, an action to revert to
the position before the breach occurred. For example, Monitor could
require that a provider reopen a service that it had closed in breach
of a licence

guidance sets out how it will determine the use of its enforcement
powers, including fines, and these regulations set the definition of
turnover that Monitor will use when determining the level of fines.
Simply put, providers’ turnover is defined as their turnover
from NHS income. The turnover of clinical commissioning groups and NHS
England is defined in terms of administrative spend; total spend would
be vastly
disproportionate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:14:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

aspect of the regulations. The Government want to ensure that the
health system delivers better health, better care and better value for
money. Better value for money and more accurate pricing will be a key
part in delivering enhanced services to patients and in equipping the
NHS to improve standards. The new system will drive improvement through
providing mechanisms to ensure that prices better reflect costs of
supply, incentivise better data 
<?notus-xml column=121?>recording and collection and make available better incentives and
stronger compliance mechanisms. Monitor will have the specific duty of
promoting healthcare services that represent value for money and
maintain or improve quality. Monitor will achieve this by working with

local pricing and
flexibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:15:16"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:19:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071095000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000148">6.15

statutory basis for providers and commissioners to raise formal
objections to the methodology that Monitor proposes for calculating
national prices. It is very like the process that I have described for
objecting to modifications to licence conditions. Following
comprehensive engagement, Monitor will be required to publish a final
draft of the national tariff and allow 28 days for commissioners and

calculating national tariff prices for specified

consultation, Monitor will calculate the percentage of commissioners
objecting, the percentage of providers objecting and the percentage
share of supply held by the objecting providers, which allows
providers’ objections to be weighted proportionate to the
nationally priced services that they deliver. If the threshold for any
of these three types of objections is met, Monitor has three options.
Monitor may drop the proposed methodology in light of the objections
received; it may put forward alternative proposals in the light of the
objections received, and publish these for consultation; or, it may
refer the proposed methodology to the Competition Commission, which
would then be required to investigate and report on whether the

the three objection thresholds, each one at 51%. The thresholds are
higher than for licensing. This is because the threshold for licensing
was based on precedents for objections to licence changes in other
sectors, but there are no precedents for price-setting. The department
proposed a higher threshold for pricing because the group of potential
objectors is wider there. Following consultation, the department has
concluded that setting the thresholds at this level will effectively
balance the interests of patients, while protecting commissioners and

licensing, specifically paragraph 3 concerning monetary
penalties. Can I ask the Minister about the logic of fining providers,
when all that happens is that worse care will be provided for patients
as the organisation will have less money? I think that the figure of up
to 10% of turnover would virtually bankrupt most providers. While I
certainly accept the need for penalties and consequences for failure, I
wonder whether they would be better being not financial, as the reality
is that they will not happen in many cases because the people who
suffer will be those who get services. I just wonder about the logic of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000100">It took
NHS England months to wake up to the fact that the A&amp;E problems
were to do with the failure of systems, but for months it was pressing
CCGs in some parts of the country to fine hospitals for poor A&amp;E
performance. I think that NHS England has completely lost the plot when
it comes to understanding what is happening in the health service. I
cannot think of a more hopeless response to the crisis than to come
along and say, “We should fine hospitals”. I worry about
this whole approach to fining. I say to the Minister that there are
very limited signs that systems understand the winter problems and
there is a real reluctance to get to grips with what needs to happen.
This is a worry for the future which may not have much to do with the
regulations, but my seeing the Minister here represents a good
opportunity to raise them with
him.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000101">Does the
Minister think that fines and targets can lead to some perverse
incentives? Of course, it is right to issue targets, but I wonder
whether the Minister might comment on a very interesting section of the
<I>Chief Medical Officer’s Report</I> for 2013, published
earlier this year, where she refers to the low number of instances of
MRSA and C. diff. I do not think that there is any doubt that the
targets that were set for  the health service have been
responsible for the focus that has led to this very welcome
improvement. My understanding is that part of the response to this by
the NHS has been to use antibiotics which should have been reserved for
hard-to-treat infections. There is now real concern that the
antibiotics that go with those hard-to-treat infections have been used
rather widely, which is causing great problems in more general
infection control. According to the CMO, while the typical, large,
1,000-bed acute NHS hospital has two to three MRSA bacteraemias per
year and 50 to 60 C. diff cases, 400 to 500 bacteraemias involving
Gram-negative bacteria can occur in a 1,000-bed-type hospital, 
<?notus-xml column=123?>10% to 15% of them being due to strains resistance  to those
antibiotics for hard-to-treat infections. You can reach a point where
individual targets become counterproductive because the focus of the
NHS is simply on C. diff and MRSA and not on the wider infections which
clearly need to be tackled as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000102">Will
the regulations lead to more specific targeting which can in turn lead
to perverse incentives, or is a more sophisticated approach likely to
be taken? It is clear that the Chief Medical Officer is concerned about
the way in which some MRSA and C. diff targets are leading to perverse
behaviours.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000103">On
Part 3, the rationale for each of the thresholds described for
penalties, prices and licence changes has not been explained in
relation to an evidence base. In other words, why are the thresholds
where they are? What work has been done to suggest that those are the
right thresholds? Of course, now they will only be tested
post-implementation, but it would have been good to have seen a clearer
review mechanism that enabled a sensible approach.</hs_para>

mechanisms to lodge an objection to the pricing methodology, my
understanding is that the Foundation Trust Network has stated
throughout the development of the policy that the 51% threshold for an
objection, together with the denominator comprising all tariff
services, is too high a threshold to be met. Is the noble Earl prepared
to look at this? That might be a reasonable approach for general
objections to the general approach, but it is insufficiently sensitive
to address sections of the tariff that may be inadequately
compensated—cancer services, for example. The noble Earl will be
aware that there were issues around the tariff for children’s
services and women’s services. My reading of that is that if you
were a specialist adviser your chances of reaching the 51% threshold
would be very limited. Could this be looked
at?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000105">If my
noble friend Lord Warner were here I am sure he would raise this. It is
the question of what happens to non-foundation trusts. I know that
Monitor is working closely with the NHS Trust Development Authority,
but I would welcome clarity about what will happen to trusts outside
Monitor’s remit to ensure that there is an even-handed approach
across all providers in the sector. No one is more admiring of the work
of Sir Peter Carr as chair of the NHS Trust Development Authority. The
noble Earl knows that Sir Peter has held chairmanships under both
Governments for many years. While he is a marvellous person, there is a
fear that he will hold the chairmanship of the NHS Trust Development
Authority for many years to come because of the issue about what on

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I was just going to refer
the Minister to his remarks about the Competition Commission, because
it is relevant to the  
<?notus-xml column=124?>regulation. There is great confusion in the health service about the
commission’s role. The Minister will know that there have been
interventions in Dorset and Bristol on what seem to be entirely
sensible proposals. In Dorset it was the merger of two small acute
trusts, while in Bristol it was the “divvying up”, I
suppose the phrase is, of services between two trusts in order to allow
for more patients to be treated and all the benefits that you get from
that, with one trust focusing on some services and the other focusing
on others. In anyone’s terms, those are both examples of the
kind of configuration of services that is entirely sensible and that
the Government in other guises are
supporting.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000109">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:38:03"></hs_TimeCode>
is quite clear that the OFT has been trying to get into the health
service for some years. I will not get into Section 75 now but the OFT
now feels that it can get into the health service, although it is very
difficult to see what the point of that would be. The OFT is
independent, I understand that, but Ministers have been silent about
this. There is utter confusion in the health service and, I believe,
among the regulators about how to run these two issues—on the
one hand, the Competition Commission and OFT approach, and on the other
the need for us to be aggressive in terms of the reconfiguration, and
in many cases the centralisation, of services. This matter needs to be

to be considered in relation to more general policy on pricing as part
of the national tariff. The Minister will know that in October last
year, when the House of Commons Health Committee had its annual
accountability hearing with Monitor, David Bennett, the leader of
Monitor, talked about perverse incentives with regard to the tariff. He
said that he was not sure that they were fundamental to the pricing
system but he agreed that the way it is working can create perverse
incentives. One example he used was that if we want to move activity
out of hospitals and into a community setting, one thing we
have  to think about is that there some real
transition  costs which will have to be paid one way or
another. The question is: is the tariff being adjusted to allow for
that?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071095000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000111">The

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to both noble Lords who have
spoken. First, I hope that I can reassure the noble Baroness, Lady
Finlay, on the question she posed about the cross-border aspects of
patient flows and the tariffs that apply. The tariff will apply only to
services commissioned by commissioners in England: that is to say, CCGs
and NHS England. Any provider who provides healthcare services for the
purposes of the NHS which are covered by the proposed tariff will be
able to object to Monitor’s proposed methodology, so I do not
see that patients in Wales or on the border need to be anxious about
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000114">The
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked a series of questions. First, he
questioned the wisdom of allowing Monitor to fine providers. It is
worth saying that the discretionary requirements which Monitor can
impose, as laid down in these regulations, are based on those used for
other regulatory offences. In fact, they are based on Part 3 of the
Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act 2008. That menu of options has
been picked up and put into the 2012 Act.</hs_para>

need to be clear—and it is certainly my
understanding—that Monitor regards fines as a last resort. It
will need to consider each case carefully and has a responsibility to
ensure that its regulatory actions are reasonable, while deterring poor
conduct in the future. It must also consider whether its other powers
would be more appropriate. I understand the point that the noble Lord
has raised but it is unlikely that we will see Monitor exercising this
power with any frequency. We must bear in mind that 10% of turnover is
of course a maximum figure.</hs_para>

about the thresholds as laid down in the regulations. The 20% threshold
relating to licensing is based on a similar process which was in place
for modifying licences in the energy sector. We considered that the
situation here in the health service was comparable, and it is a
threshold that commanded general
acceptance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:44:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:44:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the thresholds are higher than for licensing because the threshold for
licensing was based on precedents for objections to licensing changes
in the energy sector, as I mentioned. However, there are no precedents
for price-setting in any other sector. We have proposed a higher
threshold for pricing because the group of potential objectors is
wider. We consulted on this and, following that, we concluded that
setting the thresholds at this level would achieve the balance that I

noble Lord’s question about the foundation trust pipeline, the
2014 deadline for reaching foundation status has, I think, done quite a
lot to galvanise the NHS trust sector and drive improvement. However,
in the light of the Francis report, we have allowed the NHS Trust
Development Authority to agree trajectories for NHS trusts to reach
foundation trust status but to go beyond 2014 on a case-by-case basis.
In doing so, we will ensure that the primary focus of the NHS Trust
Development Authority and of NHS trusts themselves is on improving the
quality and sustainability of services for
patients<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:47:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lord asked whether I felt that the regulations might lead to a target
culture, which could have perverse effects. I do not see the
regulations in that light. There are in fact no targets for healthcare
standards in these regulations. The regulations set the thresholds for
objecting to Monitor’s proposals on licensing and pricing, as I
have described, so in that sense they are very narrow in their
focus<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:47:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble Lord asked me about the role of the Competition Commission. The
commission clearly has wide experience of determining similar questions
in a number of other sectors. It is the body best placed to consider
these questions for the purpose of the  new licensing and
pricing regimes. It will not apply a competition-based approach but,
rather, a test of public interest in the case of licence modifications
and a test of appropriateness in the case of the pricing methodology.
However, I am sure that I do not need to remind the noble Lord that the
issue of competition in the health service is not by any means new, and
it was for that reason that the Co-operation and Competition Panel was
set up under the previous Administration. As he knows, that panel has
now been absorbed into

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> I am of course aware of that but the
reality is that the Competition Commission and the OFT did not really
start intervening in the NHS. Clearly, they have been interested in
areas such as dentistry for some time but they have not intervened in
the wider NHS. I think that the problem is that it  is now very
unclear what is to be done when a reconfiguration of services takes
place and, although I do not want to anticipate tomorrow’s
debate on funding, it must be in the interest of greater centralisation
of services, which, in a Competition Commission/OFT view, might be said
to lead to reduced competition.</hs_para>

problem is that it takes long enough to get change through in the NHS.
The costs of delay to the health service if there is a Competition
Commission referral and an investigation are very high. I wonder
whether we can really afford it, given the imperative to get on with
service changes. I know that guidance has been issued by Monitor which
has reflected on the various roles, but at the end there is a lot of
confusion. The Competition Commission and the OFT have not exactly made
themselves available to debate either in Westminster or in the NHS
about those issues. All we can read are the slightly acerbic comments
by the staff of the Competition Commission and the OFT. I am not aware
that they have ever made themselves available for a general discussion

Howe:</Member></B> I take the noble Lord’s point about
uncertainty and confusion that I know exists in certain parts of the
health service as to what all this means. I can tell him that officials
in the department have had some very productive discussions with both
the OFT and the Competition Commission to ensure that their approach
need not set unnecessary hares running as regards apprehensions that a
purist competition-based approach will be taken by these bodies. I am
satisfied that that will not happen. My advice is that the Competition
Commission, in particular, has welcomed the input of departmental
officials in terms of the factors that need to be brought into play
when making a judgment on what is in the best interests of the health
service and patients.</hs_para>

aware that a number of useful events and conversations took place
within the health service itself when we clarified with providers the
considerations that the OFT and the Competition Commission will look at
in proposed mergers. We are ensuring that when proposals are made the
benefits of mergers are clearly defined in terms that will resonate
with the competition authorities. The noble Lord is right that we are
in new territory in many senses, but I am optimistic that the system
will work in the way that it should. It is certainly about looking at
competition aspects but, more pertinently, looking at the criteria that
I mentioned earlier, such as the public interest in the case
of licence modifications, the test of appropriateness in pricing
methodology, and in the case of mergers, the interests of patients in
the health service. The OFT and the Competition Commission must take
into account the benefits of a proposed reconfiguration if they
consider it under the Enterprise Act 2002. I remind noble Lords that
that is the governing Act, so in theory at least, we have been in this
situation for more than 10 years. In doing so the competition
authorities must consider whether those benefits would outweigh any
substantial lessening of competition that they find.</hs_para>

about the tariff, and in particular, primary care. We agree that
payment mechanisms need to be aligned to drive better outcomes and
better value for patients. They also need to be responsive and
flexible, for example to enable services to be provided in an
integrated way. Monitor and NHS England will work together to move the
tariff in this direction. They are best placed to do that given their
different roles.</hs_para>

what would happen if the tariff proved to be inadequate. We expect the
tariff in future more closely to relate to the costs of providing
particular services. If the price payable for a service would make it
uneconomic for a provider to provide a service, Sections 124 and 125 of
the 2012 Act provide for a process for local modifications of the price
payable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071095000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130710-gc0001.htm#13071095000128">My
advice is that NHS England and Monitor  are working very well
together in this regard. Guiding principles have been defined and six
shared principles for pricing have been agreed: that the pricing
mechanism should enable and promote improvements in care for patients
and taxpayers; that it should enable efficient providers to earn
appropriate reimbursement for their services; that it should have
regard to sustain the NHS offer in the long run; that it should not
preclude the delivery of the Secretary of State’s mandate for
NHS England; that it should have regard to the principles of better

set out a series of actions which, fully implemented, would deliver a

is 15% smaller than in 2010, and productivity is correspondingly
higher. Some of the actions in the Plan could not have been expected to
be complete in twelve months. On others, substantial progress has been

An estimated figure calculated as 22% of the total crop science spend
and based on analysis figures from 2007/08 and 2008/09. Note there is
significant effort in marker assisted breeding in crops and livestock

direct and specific monetised benefits for operators by reducing their
costs. The overall economic benefit will only become clear as operators
begin to deploy fixed broadband infrastructure, taking advantage of
these measures. Their purpose is to enable economic growth by removing
regulatory barriers. As well as reducing costs to operators it is
expected that they will provide certainty about planning decisions,
thus speeding up investment in superfast broadband infrastructure.
