Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs (Lord De Mauley):</Member></B> My
Lords, agreement on common agricultural policy reform was reached in
June at both the Agriculture Council and in the European Parliament. As
part of the deal, from 2015, 30% of Pillar 1 farm subsidies will be
dependent upon a series of greening practices being carried out on
farms. We shall be working in the coming months to devise a greening
policy for England. At the same time, we are making plans for the new
rural development programme from 2015. I should declare an interest as
a beneficiary under the current

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, the progress made on the CAP is
welcome, though not as radical as some people will allege. The
increased requirements for environmental compliance by farmers who are
getting the single payments are particularly welcome. The proposals for
transferring more money from Pillar 1 to rural development, including
environmental works, are also welcome. Will the Minister assure us that
the Government will remain firm on these objectives and not give in to
the short-sighted campaign by some people, including the NFU, to try to
block these valuable
changes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T11:08:52"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T11:08:56"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, we have a legal obligation to
implement what is known as greening from 2015. No decisions have yet
been taken on implementation. We will consult stakeholders, including
farmers’ representatives and NGOs. We need to achieve genuine
environmental outcomes from greening, without impacting unnecessarily
on farmers’ business

Plumb:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as a farmer. First,
to satisfy 28 nations with a policy that is acceptable to all, when we
see such a diverse structure of farming there, is a recipe for an
uncommon market rather than a common market. Secondly, does my noble
friend the Minister not agree that the emphasis at this time should be
on the growth of food and the food security part of that, rather than
just on greening? The whole emphasis seems to have turned to greening,
switching from one pillar to the other. How do the new greening rules
overlap with the existing agri-environmental 
<?notus-xml column=1634?>scheme commitments, and what changes will those produce, as against the
existing commitments faced, when the greening comes into
effect?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000006"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T11:10:01"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord De Mauley" PimsId="4732" UID="13073026000308" xid="1856" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000308">Lord
De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, there are a couple of questions in
there from my noble friend. Our priorities for CAP reform have always
been to help EU agriculture become more competitive and market-oriented
while improving the capacity to deliver better environmental outcomes.
It is unclear precisely what the greening requirements will look like
since the detailed rules have yet to be drawn up. However, we are
working to ensure that all these elements are complementary and
coherent so that we have a smooth transition to the new programme in
2015<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T11:10:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Curry of Kirkharle" PimsId="5991" UID="13073026000309" xid="2160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000309">Lord
Curry of Kirkharle:</Member></B> My Lords, could I pursue with the
Minister the issue of the existing environmental schemes referred to by
the noble Lord, Lord Plumb? Many farmers have signed contractual
agreements for the entry-level scheme, and I can claim some
responsibility for that scheme, having recommended it. They are under
an obligation under those contracts. Will these be jeopardised by the
new greening arrangements? There is a lot of concern and some confusion
among the farming community on this

point. If I have understood him correctly, no, it is very much our

De Mauley:</Member></B> Well, my Lords, that is indeed a question. In
the context of the reduced CAP budget, the UK’s key aims for the
CAP reform negotiations were to increase the resilience, market
orientation and international competitiveness of EU agriculture; to
improve the CAP’s capacity to deliver environmental outcomes;
and to simplify the CAP for farmers and authorities. We want an
efficient and responsive agricultural sector in the EU and globally,
and we want the future CAP to achieve

Grantchester:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare my interests in the
countryside. Does the Minister’s department recognise that
success in greening policies relies very heavily on good will and
implementation from farmers? Is the cart before the horse in this
instance? Will the Minister outline what the Government want to achieve
from greening measures, rather than transferring funds into Pillar 2

De Mauley:</Member></B> I understand the noble Lord’s question,
and others have asked that. The Government’s view is that
environmental outcomes can be more targeted and more effective if they
are delivered through Pillar 2. There will be a new set of
environmental measures within Pillar 2 but we will honour the
obligation in Pillar 1 to achieve the greening that is set

Tomlinson:</Member></B> Does the Minister accept that when we look at
the European Union budget, it really does not
reflect priorities? We have an agricultural budget that exceeds that of
research and development and indeed that of employment measures. While
I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Plumb, on the need to maximise food

what the noble Lord says. We worked very hard in the direction in which
he is moving. The cut to the CAP budget was €55 billion, which

better than a real

bees and other pollinators have bred well this year are most welcome.
More concerning are reports that the lead government scientist on the
effect of neonicotinoids on bees is joining Syngenta, one of the
leading manufacturers of the insecticide. She previously worked on a
Syngenta-funded project on bees and pesticides for FERA. Given the
widespread concerns among the public about bee health, what assurances

programme on ITV about bees, in which the Food Minister David Heath and
Matt Shardlow of Buglife gave their views on neonicotinoids. Mr Heath
said that there are other chemicals that are even more damaging to
bees. Is my noble friend able to tell us what those other chemicals are
and what action the Government are taking to ensure that they are not
used? While ensuring that our Government implement the suspension of
neonicotinoids as soon as possible, will the noble Lord encourage

second question, I am very grateful to him for resolving the thorny
problem of how I should spend my Friday evening. As regards his first
question, I am not absolutely sure of the chemicals to which my
honourable friend referred. However, in the absence of neonicotinoids,
we expect farmers to use the available products, such as pyrethroids
and organophosphates, for their particular pest
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T11:20:33"></hs_TimeCode>.
Without something effective, the consequence for farmers could be a
reduction in crop yields, potentially substantial in scope. Despite not
being as effective as neonics, these other products are legal and have
passed the safety tests set in
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000033"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Curry of Kirkharle" PimsId="5991" UID="13073026000335" xid="2160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000335">Lord

bees can tolerate neonicotinoids. However, when combined with
glyphosate, which is in the ubiquitous Roundup, their immune systems
become affected. That is one of the reasons why they cannot withstand

the interception of communications incredibly seriously. For these
actions to go ahead we need a warrant from one of the most senior
members of the Government as well as detailed legal advice to support
it. That decision will be reviewed by independent commissioners and
implemented by agencies, which are bound by legal and ethical
frameworks, alongside parliamentary scrutiny through the Intelligence

nuclear proliferation to cyberattacks, it prevents serious and

it supports the work of our Armed Forces. These are all things that

basic point of nuisance calls. In the past, I have asked why we cannot

significant environmental footprint, as we have had in the United
States, but, more fundamentally, the fear of water pollution? I know
that the latest study of the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of
Engineering says that fracking takes place hundreds of metres below the
aquifer, but does she not agree that the science is still in a fairly
early stage? Would it not be better to wait until next year’s

Howell of Guildford:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister accept
that it could be a mistake to discuss fracking in terms of the whole of
the United Kingdom in one go? Obviously, in beautiful rural areas there
are worries not just about drilling and fracking—which I think
are exaggerated—but about trucks, deliveries, roads and
disturbance, which are quite justified. However, there are large,
uninhabited and desolate areas, certainly in parts of the north-east,
where there is plenty of room for fracking, well away from
anybody’s residence, and where it could be conducted without any
threat to the rural environment. Does the Minister agree that a
distinction should be made between one area and another rather than
lumping them together, and that if we can push ahead with this kind of
gas production, it will take us fast away from coal burning, which is
increasing at the moment because of the delays in authorising gas
production that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, talked about a moment
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T11:33:30"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

noble Lords will be aware, it has always been the Government’s

those who have acted diligently and decently, doing their best not to

Consequently this amendment introduces to the existing defence of
non-infringement a further defence of reasonable belief that the design
in question was not

amendment will ensure that those who had sufficient reason to believe
that their activity was not infringing would not be guilty of a
criminal offence. This is a further safeguard for businesses which act

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, the arguments for and
against criminal sanctions for designs have been extensively aired over
our discussions on this Bill. Proponents feel that current civil
enforcement is expensive for small innovators and that current civil
sanctions are not dissuasive to large infringers. Opponents are
concerned that unexamined IP rights are a dangerous basis for taking
criminal sanctions and that there is a risk of stifling competition in
useful products.</hs_para>

Government’s aim in this Bill. As the Minister said, we were
anxious to see if we could move towards a common position. However, we
are still concerned about whether it is appropriate and proportionate,
whether it would really deter those pirates and counterfeiters whose
behaviour the public would consider criminal and whether it may turn
out to have a stifling effect on innovation and
competition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000079">One
concern, which we have expressed previously, is that the proposed
provision could turn into a tool to be used by unscrupulous companies
to the detriment of UK designers. It is reasonably inexpensive to
register a design, especially as there is no effective examination
involved. An unscrupulous company could apply to register designs it
copied from a UK designer, then threaten that designer with criminal
sanctions for producing his or her own designs. The prospect of
defending a criminal action might be enough to make the designer give
in. What sort of fairness does that speak
to?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000080">As the
Minister says, the Government’s intention is that blatant,
deliberate copying of designs for commercial gain, safe in the
knowledge that many of the victims will be unlikely to have the
resources to respond, is an act worthy of punishment, and they believe
that the UK needs a coherent approach to the protection of intellectual
property rights. On the other hand, the measure is opposed by the IP
Federation, the Intellectual Property Bar Association, the City of
London Law Society, the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys and a
number of IP lawyers and specialists. I put it to the Minister that it
may not turn out to be a brilliant career move for the IP Minister to
cross swords, as he has done, with Sir James Dyson and, indeed, the
Ministry of Defence on this point.</hs_para>

tried to find a compromise position with the Government on this point.
We wanted the Government to raise the bar for criminality so that
criminal penalties could only be considered in cases, using the words
used by the Minister, of “blatant, deliberate copying of
designs, for commercial gain”, but we failed. However, we are
glad that the Minister listened to one part of our argument, which is
that the legislation as drafted might open a Pandora’s box of
unintended consequences, potentially discouraging the very kind of
legitimate, competitive risk-taking that policy makers have been keen
to encourage as a driver of
growth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000083">We
therefore welcome the government amendments tabled today, which propose
a defence for anyone who reasonably or in good faith believes that
their actions were non-infringing. We will continue to oppose the
introduction of criminal sanctions for registered design infringement
as a matter of principle. However, we are pleased that there will now
at least be a defence for any person who reasonably believes that they
are not infringing. The objective test of reasonableness should cover
situations such as where someone has taken legal advice on the issue,
or where an opinion of non-infringement is secured from the IPO opinion
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000084">They

the European Union. The European Union Act 2011 provides that Ministers

Bill provides Parliament with the right, given to it by the European
Union Act 2011, to consider the proposed use of the Article 352 treaty
basis. This article is used in those cases where further action is
necessary to achieve one of the objectives set out in the treaties, but
where there are no specific provisions to give the EU institutions a
specific power to take that
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000094">The
two measures for which approval is sought are proposed Council
regulations brought forward under Article 352 of the treaty on the
functioning of the European Union. The first draft decision establishes
a legal obligation on the European institutions to deposit their paper
historical records at the European University Institute in Florence.
Previously, European institutions have voluntarily deposited their
archives at the European University Institute, and the proposed move to
an obligation seeks to provide long-term certainty that the archives
will be preserved in accordance with recognised international standards
at a single accessible location.</hs_para>

regulation already obliges the European institutions to preserve and
provide access to their historical papers once those records are 30
years old, when they would no longer be in business use. The European
Council, Parliament, Commission, Court of Auditors, Economic and Social
Committee and Investment Bank currently meet that obligation by
depositing their paper archives within the EUI on a contractual basis.
The proposed legal obligation reflects these existing arrangements, and
will not change the point in time at which the public can access
historical records, or the place at which they can be
accessed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000096">Making

the EU moves towards digital record-keeping, the measure also provides
that the European institutions should, where possible, make their

Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Central Bank
will be exempt from the obligations under the proposed regulation, but
will be able to deposit their records on a voluntary basis. I would
like to explain why this is the case. For the Court of Justice, this is
because of the volume of records, most of which are case files often
containing sensitive personal data, which need to be quickly accessed
to support the court’s functions. For the European Central Bank,
the exemption is due to the bank’s organisational autonomy and
because it’s historical records are subject to a separate 2004

Kingdom, and its subject matter does not give rise to any devolution
issues. There will be no financial effects or any impact on public
service manpower as a result of the Bill. The provisions contained
within it do not require an impact assessment. For Europe for Citizens,
the EU Commission had originally proposed a budget of €229
million, representing an increase of around 7% on the budget for the
existing programme of €215 million. Following the negotiations
on the multi-annual financial framework earlier in the spring, it is
hoped that that figure will be significantly reduced. This would be a

Having seen the national curriculum’s GCSE programme and the

very little mention of the European Union. There is certainly greater
emphasis in history, religious studies and so forth on historical
events that have affected the European Union as we see it today, but
the actual processes, procedures, decision-making, structure and
organisation of European Union institutions are not touched on in any
depth of knowledge at all. There are no courses at A-level that prepare
candidates for European Union decision-making studies or employment in
the EU. While this lies in the purview of national
Governments, this Government have been profoundly aware for many years
of the lack of United Kingdom participation in the EU Civil Service and
the institutions of the EU, and the extremely low numbers of civil
servants that find themselves working at EU level. Will my noble friend

referendum on whether we stay in the EU and at the same time taking
hold of this Bill with plentiful support. These situations may not seem
not to contradict one another, but I think that they do. For that
reason I should like to hear more from my noble friend on this subject.
It is not a problem for me personally. I have always been in favour of
our active membership of the European Union and convinced that it is

matter of the archive, I do not expect the Minister to be able to
answer these questions today, but it would be interesting if he could
write to me. I wonder whether that archive will contain the material of
real substance that will enable historians to analyse how decisions
were taken in the European Union. In my experience, you do not get much
of that flavour from the official documents or from the official
conclusions of ministerial meetings. A historian would need access to
things such as the notes that the secretary of the Commission meeting
took about who said what, the correspondence between commissioners and
the records of the chef de cabinet meetings. In this way it could be
seen how decisions were prepared. Access would also be needed to the
verbatim reports that are made of the European Council meetings, rather
than simply the conclusions. I would throw in the proceedings of
COREPER. Although it is not an official European institution, it played
a crucial role over the

those documents be part of the archive? This is an important point. We
have seen in the 60-year development of the European Union that we are
moving step by step from a world of secretive diplomacy, where
suspicious nation states came together to take the first bold steps
towards union, to a much more open democracy. Analysing that process

in the United Kingdom, there is a sense that we need to have a

of fate. In other words, what happens in all those countries really
matters to us; and what happens in the European Union really matters to
us. A classic example is that the British economy has not avoided the

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I am most grateful for all
the contributions that have been made. We have had a short but most
interesting debate—indeed, a prelude to further consideration of
the European adventure. These two EU measures, both of which provide
for more citizen engagement in the EU, are of great
benefit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000131">First,
we discussed a measure to secure the long-term future of the EU
institutions’ archives which takes account of the advances in
record-keeping in an increasingly digital age. I was of course
intrigued by the point of the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, about the
substance of archives. For someone such as me, who is interested in
history but extremely amateur, the point of the history book is when it
hits on something that goes beyond the ordinary notes and into the most
intriguing parts. Although I cannot answer the noble Lord precisely, I
very much hope that he is right that 
<?notus-xml column=1660?>this will be an archive that historians will find of great value, not
just for the agenda and minutes of the meetings but for the discussions
and how they came to the decisions that they made. I will consider that
and obviously come back to the noble Lord if I have anything of greater
value to add, but I am with him on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000132">The
measure also reflects the flexibility required in introducing digital
archiving and accordingly avoids prescribing technical solutions, which
would not allow for rapidly evolving technologies. Approving this
measure would contribute to ensuring the transparency and scrutiny of
the EU. I was particularly taken by the point that my noble friend Lady
Falkner of Margravine made about transparency because the Government
definitely support the general principle of transparency, both
domestically and within the European Union. I wish that I was able to
comment more fully or specifically on the minutes of the European
Central Bank but I very much hope that it will continue to make as much
of its archive available as possible because that, again, plays into
what the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, was saying about the importance of
archives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000133">This
also reflects our own Government’s priority in using digital
platforms as a means of facilitating contact between citizens and
public institutions. Again, my noble friend Lady Falkner of Margravine
mentioned the engagement of young people and I endorse very much the
concern that she raised. However, we need to remember that there are
young people coming forward who need to know more. One of the great
advances with digital platforms is that I very much hope that they will
be a medium that young people will find more user-friendly. It is this
digital technology which provides the means for bringing people of all
generations more closely together, an aspect of today’s world
that is very much to be welcomed. I saw this for myself in a recent
visit to the outstanding National Archives at Kew, which certainly
opened my eyes to the scope and opportunities that these advances
provide.</hs_para>

the Europe for Citizens programme, which should be seen in the same
context. I hesitated at what my noble friend Lord Renton of Mount Harry
said about the contradiction because this programme will run from next
year to 2020 for all of Europe, and I see this as a positive. Whatever
decisions the British electorate may or may not make about the position
of this country in Europe, I believe that from 2014 to 2020 there is a
great citizens’ programme across all the nation states, which is
of value to this country and to the citizens of all the countries. I do
not see it as a contradiction in that way. This is a positive, whatever
happens.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073026000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000135">It
is particularly poignant at this moment to commemorate those in the two
world wars and their lives, and many of your Lordships have been much
involved in that. There are certainly many communities up and down the

where taxpayers’ money is going. It is going, through the
European institutions, towards this being a rewarding
exercise.</hs_para>

opportunity for civil society organisations. To pick up on something
that my noble friend Lady Falkner of Margravine said, we encourage a
much more positive engagement at institutional and local level for
citizens of all ages. I particularly go back to young people who have
ideals. Having many ideals about the common values that are shared is
an important part of the European adventure, so I very much hope that
this programme will be seen as an opportunity. I very much agree with
the point that the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, made about the
opportunities. I also hope that this Bill will not take too much time

such hearings, covering topics as diverse as the G20 growth and jobs
action programme, the situation in Mali and the EU’s
neighbourhood policy. In addition, we followed up our inquiry into the
multiannual financial framework and conducted and completed a new
inquiry into the future of European Union enlargement. That report
emphasised the importance of enlargement to securing stability and
economic prosperity for the European Union itself and its
neighbourhood. It analysed the way in which the enlargement process was
conducted by the Commission and the Council, and made recommendations

highlighted concerns about the future of the euro area, raised further
questions about the desirability and efficacy of eurobonds and set out
how the democratic legitimacy of solutions to the crisis could be
ensured. Secondly, the sub-committee undertook a significant piece of

I do need to be firm about it. Despite the current pressures on civil

years ago. He told me that he had previously been clerk of the Defence

It was a classic, needed a little light touch on the tiller and the
accelerator, had regular servicing and caused very little trouble,

there was more than enough work for Sub-Committee E. In addition to
very substantial scrutiny work, the sub-committee carried out one full
inquiry, a joint inquiry together with Sub-Committee F, and
a follow-up inquiry. I shall briefly describe each. We conducted an
inquiry on combating fraud against the European Union’s
finances. It was launched in July 2012. It was timed, in part, to
coincide with the publication by the Commission of its proposed
directive designed to protect the EU’s financial interests via
the criminal law. Evidence was taken from a range of parties, including
academics, the United Kingdom police, government agencies, the relevant
European Union Commissioner and, after some reluctance, the Exchequer
Secretary, Mr David Gauke. I will say at this point how surprised we
were that the Government refused permission for us to take evidence
from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and it took quite a lot
of prodding for the Minister to appear before  us at all. In
addition, members of the committee travelled to Brussels to take
evidence from, among others, MEPs, Eurojust, and OLAF, the European 
<?notus-xml column=1666?>Union’s anti-fraud body. In total, the sub-committee held
13 evidence sessions with more than 30 individual
witnesses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000158">Our
subsequent report identified a number of weaknesses in the EU’s
current anti-fraud system, including a lack of enthusiasm among the
member states in taking their responsibilities to combat EU fraud
seriously, weaknesses in the ability of OLAF to fulfil its remit to
protect the EU’s financial interests, and a considerable
mismatch between the known levels of fraud perpetrated against the
EU’s finances. The Commission’s figure of €404
million for 2011 and the committee’s own estimate in the region
of €5 billion are at variance to say the least. In their
response to the report the Government stated that,</hs_para>

the course of the inquiry, we were unable to ascertain whether any
government department or agency in the UK takes overall responsibility
for fraud against the EU’s finances. No one was able to tell us
with any confidence how much known EU fraud is perpetrated from within
these shores, despite the fact that the individual member states are
required to tell the relevant EU authorities when they uncover these
offences. In our report, we called for a single government department
or agency to take responsibility for fraud against the EU’s
finances. However, the Government rejected this recommendation on the
grounds that any move designed to place responsibility for the matter
on to what they called a “single UK department or agency”
would create duplication and slow the process down.</hs_para>

in relation to the upcoming proposals for the creation of a European

workload of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The
sub-committee carried out a follow-up inquiry into this matter in the
later part of the Session. We sent a call for evidence to all those who
provided evidence during the original inquiry and also took oral
evidence from the Minister for Europe. In our report, we expressed
concern that the number of cases pending before the Court of Justice
continues to rise year on year and we called for the right balance to
be struck between the length of time it takes for the court to dispense
with a case and the quality of its judgments in order to preserve its
credibility. We also found that although the latest statistics from the
general court indicate a reduction in the number of pending cases, the
number of new cases has more than doubled between 2000 and 2010. Those
cases are of great interest, principally to business in this country.
We therefore reiterated that there is still a very strong case for
increasing the number of judges in the general court and urged member
states without delay to find a system for appointing additional judges
to safeguard the stability of the court and the quality of the
judiciary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000165">In
their response, the Government agree with most of the report’s
conclusions. They appear to have shifted their position a little in
that they are being more positive about appointing additional judges to
the general court as a means to deal with the court’s backlog of
cases. Also, the Government now appear to favour a merit-based
selection process to appoint additional judges to the general court
instead of a rotating system of appointment. The sub-committee hopes
that progress will be made soon on resolving the general court’s
excessive workload and it will follow developments in this area with
interest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000166">I

Home Secretary made a Statement that provided more information about
the Government’s approach to the opt-out decision. At the same
time, the Government published Command Paper 8671—not the
easiest of documents to digest—which sets out a list of

Scott of Needham Market:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak on the
work of Sub-Committee D which, for the uninitiated, deals with
agriculture, fisheries, environment and energy. I have had the honour
to chair it since the start of this Session in May, but all credit for
the past year’s work must go, of course, to my predecessor, the
noble Lord, Lord Carter of
Coles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T12:58:02"></hs_TimeCode>. I extend
my thanks to him and to his committee during that session; he has set a
remarkably high bar. I also note that since May, without the benefit of
quotas, we now have 50% female and 50% male chairs of the EU
sub-committees.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000173">The
obvious feature of the past Session for Sub-Committee D was the
addition of energy policy to the remit following the reduction in the
number of sub-committees. While this was a substantial new policy area,
it was very well aligned with the committee’s existing
responsibility for climate change policies.  As one might
expect, the sub-committee approached  
<?notus-xml column=1669?>its new remit with great enthusiasm and, as we have heard, chose to
focus on EU energy policy for its principal inquiry during the previous
Session.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000174">The
energy report was debated only yesterday in Grand Committee, so I will
not dwell on content. However, I am pleased that many noble Lords made
reference to our report during the debate in Committee on the Energy
Bill. It is pleasing that an EU committee report has served the House
in its wider context of scrutinising UK legislation—which helps
to emphasise the obvious point, that UK legislation cannot be
scrutinised in isolation from EU legislation, and vice
versa.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000175">Our
energy report received widespread press coverage in the UK and beyond
and has been referred to by the members of the parliaments of many
other member states. Our report was primarily timed to feed into
discussions at EU level on its future energy and climate change policy
framework. It is pleasing that the report was published in good time to
do that. I know that the Commission has been drawing on some of the
material and phrases from our report in its consideration of future
policy options. Our phrase “the energy trilemma”, to
describe the balance between affordability, sustainability and security
of supply, is now coming into common
parlance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000176">Beyond
the inquiry, the sub-committee’s scrutiny focused on major
reforms to the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries
policies. Both have demonstrated the long-term added value of the work
that we do in this House on EU scrutiny. In the case of fisheries
reform, for example, the thrust of the new package very much reflected
the sub-committee’s 2008 report. In the case of agricultural
reform, the new rural development policy reflects several of the
recommendations that the sub-committee made in its <I>Innovation in EU
Agriculture</I> report some years ago. While EU decision-making is
slow, and it is difficult sometimes to show immediate policy impact, I
think that we can demonstrate the long-term beneficial effects of
examining policy areas at an early stage of their
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000177">Not
content to just leave these issues as they lie, the sub-committee is
undertaking short pieces of work on how these reforms will be
implemented. In fisheries, we have recently held evidence sessions to
examine issues relating to the new ban on discards of over-quota fish.
In agriculture, we will hold several sessions with stakeholders in the
autumn to have a look at implementation issues and concerns on CAP
reform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000178">Turning
to the sub-committee’s plans for the new Session, we are about
to launch a new inquiry into food waste prevention, examining how EU
policies can assist rather than hinder attempts to prevent food
wastage, and how local, national and EU initiatives can be harnessed
most effectively. This will build on previous work that we have done on
agricultural innovation and fisheries discards. We hope that this will
feed into work being done by the European Commission on food waste and
on waste policy more generally. In particular, it is our aim to produce
a piece of work that will be helpful to the incoming European 
<?notus-xml column=1670?>Parliament and the Commission next year; it is an attempt to build a
“coalition of the willing” with other member state
parliaments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000179">The
noble Lord, Lord Carter, and I have been very fortunate to have an
enthusiastic and knowledgeable committee backed by a skilled and
dedicated secretariat. They absorbed the new area of energy policy with
great enthusiasm. However, I flag up my strong belief that any further
attempts to reduce EU scrutiny committees should be resisted. From my
experience on Sub-Committee B previously and now Sub-Committee D, I do
not believe that either could take on a new major policy area without
the quality of the work suffering in some
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000180">The
Minister for Europe and the Foreign Secretary have recently flagged up
the importance of national parliament scrutiny of EU legislation, and
they are right to do that. However, if we are to do such work, it needs
to be properly resourced and supported, not just in this House.
Frankly, I am dismayed at how much time my small team of three has to
spend chasing up government departments which do not provide
information on time and within deadlines, or which produce explanatory
memoranda that are neither explanatory nor particularly helpful. Above
all, we must be very cautious not to see the important issue of
national parliament scrutiny of the EU obscuring the need for effective
scrutiny of government action within the EU. That is a very important
part of the scrutiny role of this House and it is one that we must
hold  on
to.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_30_PT_1/E68773987E4B398BCC113BB061D393EBFB7ECCCE" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 30 July 2013">Tuesday,

Hannay of Chiswick:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a very good and very
necessary time for the House to debate the work of its EU Select
Committee during the previous Session. Whatever view one takes of the
future role of the EU, and of the UK’s role within it, it is
surely a debate worth having ahead of what is likely to become an
exceptionally intense period of debate about the UK’s continued
membership of that Union.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13073026000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000182">Moreover, it is a time
when the role of national parliaments in shaping and influencing EU
legislation is coming into sharper focus than ever before. As the noble
Lord, Lord Boswell, mentioned in his contribution to this debate, the
Select Committee is on the verge of undertaking an inquiry into the
role of national parliaments. I suggest that we need to subject our own
performance to the very closest scrutiny. I welcome particularly the
contribution of our distinguished and effective chair during the period
in question, the noble Lord, Lord Boswell, who moved this debate. He
has made a major contribution over the period since he took up the
chairmanship and I am convinced that he will continue to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000183">This
debate also marks the end of the first Session after the reduction in
the number of EU sub-committees, to which several previous speakers
have referred. The number of sub-committees, which conduct the majority
of the Select Committee’s business, was reduced from seven to
six. This allowed the House to create new committee activities in other
policy areas. While I, like many others, was rather unhappy with that
decision, we have nevertheless done our best to make it work. 
<?notus-xml column=1671?>The abolition of Sub-Committee G resulted in the reallocation of its
remit among the remaining sub-committees, my own included, expanding
their respective workloads accordingly. Despite that, the six
sub-committees have taken on and discharged their new roles
effectively, as is being highlighted in the contributions to this
debate. However, I join the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, in saying that
I think that it would be a gross error if any attempt were made to
reduce further the number of sub-committees. The elastic is being
stretched pretty tight and the burden on our extremely able staff has
become greater in the past year. It would be frankly irresponsible to
increase it
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000184">I
will focus first on the work of the Sub-Committee on Home Affairs,
Health and Education, which I have the honour to chair, and to pay
tribute to its members both past and present, some of whom are here
today, for their hard work and effective contributions. During the
period in question, the sub-committee produced two major thematic
reports, one on the EU’s global approach to migration and
mobility<I>,</I> normally known as the GAMM, of which more later, and
one on the UK’s 2014 justice and home affairs block opt-out
decision, which, as the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, indicated, I will
say a bit
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000185">This
report was produced jointly with the Sub-Committee on Justice,
Institutions and Consumer Protection, first under the able chairmanship
of the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, and now under the chairmanship of the
noble Baroness, Lady Corston. Incidentally, joint work by two
sub-committees of the sort that we did—every single one of our
meetings and all our evidence sessions were held jointly—is an
extremely unusual occurrence and is not without its logistical
difficulties. I believe that its success in this instance is a
testament to the flexibility and adaptability of the system and, above
all, to the willingness of the members of the two sub-committees to
work together as a single team. I must mention that the report that we
adopted, which I think was quite influential and will continue to be
so, was adopted by unanimity—by people from all three main
parties and from none. This was certainly something of an achievement.
That joint report appeared in April of this year. We recently reopened
the inquiry following the Home Secretary’s Statement of 9 July.
A supplementary report to the House will be produced by the end of
October, as the Government have proposed.</hs_para>

report, on the EU’s next five-year justice and home affairs
programme—likely to be known as the Rome programme as it is
likely to be adopted under the Italian presidency in the second half of
2014—was announced by the committee yesterday. However, as this
deals with matters falling within the present Session, I will make no
further reference to it in this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000187">With
respect to the report <I>The EU’s Global Approach to Migration
and Mobility</I>—the GAMM—when the sub-committee
conducted its inquiry into this matter, it was conscious that debates
about migration, like migration itself, are not new. However, recently
the tone has sharpened and there is a risk that a rational and measured
discussion of complex issues will be drowned out by cries of populist
outrage, riding on the back of stress caused by the
recession.</hs_para>

avoid falling into that trap. The committee’s view was that,
given the current and prospective demographic challenges facing Europe,
member states, in particular those with skills shortages, will need to
be flexible in the operation of legal migration from third countries in
order to secure the economic growth and competitiveness that they
desperately need. At the same time, we also recognise, rightly in my
view, that member states retain the primary decision-making
responsibilities in this area, including determining the number of
third-country migrants they choose to admit to their territory. We did
not suggest that there should be any change to that, and nor did any of
our interlocutors, including the Commission and the European
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000189">The
report also focused on a specifically UK policy choice: the
Government’s inclusion of international students in their
current policy objective of reducing net migration to the UK by 2015 to
the tens of thousands per year. My committee was one of five Select
Committees of the Lords and Commons, the chairs of which wrote to the
Prime Minister last January to argue that it made no sense at all to
include genuine international students within the public policy scope
of the Government’s immigration policy, and that by so doing the
Government were risking serious damage to what is, after all, one of
the UK’s most valuable, successful and vibrant invisible
exports. I have not yet heard a single convincing argument in support
of that policy, and I ask the Minister to address this matter when he
winds up the
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000190">I
agree that yesterday’s announcement of an international
education strategy by the Minister for Science and the Business
Secretary was a step in the right direction. However, a good deal more
than warm words will be needed if the higher education sector’s
contribution to our involvement in the global race is not to be
undermined by the Government’s immigration policy. I noted that
the Secretary of State for Business, in an interview at the weekend,
said what I believe: namely, that regarding students as immigrants is
absurd.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000191">I
return to the important matter of the block opt-out. I will not revisit
the complex arguments for and against it, nor delve into the byzantine
complexity of the issue’s component parts, which the House had
ample opportunity to debate as recently as 23 July, and will no doubt
return to again before the end of the Session. Instead, I will focus on
the process. On parliamentary engagement and handling, the
Government’s approach to the opt-out decision has thus far been
notable in a number of respects—but, alas, for all wrong
reasons. Since the Home Secretary made her initial statement to
Parliament about the matter last October, the committee has been
persistently denied official information to aid its scrutiny of this
important matter. Deadlines have continually slipped, and attempts to
elucidate a coherent government position and rationale have proved
elusive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000192">As
noble Lords will be aware, the situation finally improved only on 9
July, when the Home Secretary made a further Statement about the
Government’s intentions in this area. However, any feeling of
welcome was again undermined by the extraordinarily short period
allowed to this House before we were asked  to debate and vote
on exercising the opt-out. I admit 
<?notus-xml column=1673?>that we were allowed a bit longer than the House of Commons, but not
much. That was compounded by the Government’s decision to
respond to the committee’s April report more than a month late,
and only hours before the debate that took place on 23 July. I hope
that the Minister will give an assurance of more punctilious behaviour
in the future handling of this matter. I ask him to undertake in
particular to keep the House regularly informed of the progress of
negotiations with the Commission and the other member states once they
formally begin in early
November.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000193">In
addition to these two major inquiries, my sub-committee also conducted
enhanced scrutiny of the Commission’s proposal for a revised
tobacco products directive. This involved taking oral evidence from pro
and anti-smoking organisations and from Public Health Minister Anna
Soubry MP, as well as receiving a large volume of written evidence.
While public debate in the UK has focused on the contentious matter of
plain packaging, I remind the House that provision for this does not
feature in the proposed directive. It will be left as a matter for
individual member states to
decide.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000194">The
output of the process of enhanced scrutiny was a detailed and well
received letter to the Minister, outlining the sub-committee’s
position on the proposal, which was broadly supportive. This work has
been followed up in the current Session with another round of enhanced
scrutiny of the Commission’s related proposal for an EU
cigarette-smuggling strategy, on which oral evidence has been heard
from officials at the EU’s anti-fraud agency, OLAF, and at Her
Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs. I will say, in advance of our
taking that further, that what the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, said
about her sub-committee’s inquiry into OLAF showed again how
difficult it is to co-ordinate all parts of the British Government that
have an input into this area. I am sure that we will address that when
we write to Ministers after the
recess.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000195">In
conclusion, I turn briefly to a matter that falls outside the purview
of my sub-committee, and which relates to the Government’s
balance of competences review—a matter dear to the heart of the
Minister who will reply to this debate. While the EU Committee as a
whole, and its sub-committees, have not engaged directly with this
review, my sub-committee has made recommendations relevant to the
review in both its recent reports: the one on the GAMM and the one on
the block opt-out. It expects these to be taken into account by the
review’s current second semester, which will include a report on
free movement, which was covered in our GAMM report, and in the
forthcoming third semester, which will include a report on policing and
criminal justice. I hope that those will both be taken on board, and I
hope that the Minister will give an assurance that that will be
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073026000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073026000196">On free
movement, the committee’s GAMM report, which I discussed
earlier, concluded that the free movement of persons is fundamental to
the structure of the EU and is an integral part of the single market,
with revision of its terms in the treaty being neither desirable nor
feasible. The logic of producing the review’s report on police
and criminal justice matters after the Government had made their
decision to opt out of a number of existing pre-Lisbon policing and
criminal 
<?notus-xml column=1674?>justice measures totally eludes me. After all, both the block opt-out
decision and the decision to seek to rejoin 35 measures are precisely
designed to determine the balance of competences in this area—so
why on earth did we not conduct the review before attempting to take
the
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T13:18:06"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_30_PT_1/9D868DD825E85914F80407022EFE437BE7A3AC86" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 30 July 2013">Tuesday,

O'Cathain:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful that the occasion of
this debate on the European Union Committee’s 2012-13 report
gives me two opportunities. The first opportunity is to pay tribute to
the work of the European Union Committee chairman, the noble Lord, Lord
Boswell, for the important work of scrutiny of EU legislation. The fact
that so much of our legislation is directed from the European
Union—from Brussels—or amended in response to the
deliberations of the European Parliament makes it essential that we
keep a watching eye on all that goes
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073029000002">The
European Union Committee does a great job, mainly behind the scenes, in
ensuring that all EU proposals, directives, regulations,
information—usually called “superinformation
documents”—and the rest are scrutinised. The noble Lord,
Lord Boswell, has a very tough responsibility, but he is ably supported
by the clerk, Jake Vaughan, by legal advisers and by staff, who prevent
anything slipping through the net—or the “sift”,
as it is commonly called. The House owes them all a great debt of
gratitude.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073029000003">As
the noble Lord, Lord Boswell, described, the scrutiny process is
carried out by six sub-committees. Today’s debate therefore also
gives me the opportunity to enlighten Members of the House about what
goes on behind the scenes in one of those six sub-committees. I act as
chairman of EU Sub-Committee B, whose remit is the internal market,
infrastructure and employment. I am pleased to have the opportunity of
sharing with the House the highlights of the 2012-13
Session.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073029000004">Before
doing so, I must thank all current and past members of the
sub-committee who have worked so hard, week after week—and we do
meet weekly—and all of whom have contributed greatly to our work
in this Session. Due to them we have accomplished much, enjoyed our
Monday afternoons, and developed a great atmosphere of mutual respect.
That may seem too good to be true but believe me that it is so.
Attendance is excellent and even yesterday there were minor
regrets—I have to say minor—that we were not meeting
again for many weeks. I think we all feel that we need this break and
are looking forward to buckets, spades, sandcastles and paddling as
well as a well earned break from the wave after wave of directives,
regulations, and other documents which pile up each week awaiting
scrutiny.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073029000005">We
were sad to say au revoir to the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, the
noble Lord, Lord Elton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, who is now
chairman of Sub-Committee D. I thank them all. We gladly welcomed the
noble Lords, Lord Cotter and Lord Freeman. The noble Lord, Lord
Freeman, previously chaired Sub-Committee B but has never said,
“In my time we did x, y, and z”, although I am sure that
he has been tempted to do so. We also gladly welcomed the noble
Baroness, 
<?notus-xml column=1675?>Lady Hooper, who came to us from Sub-Committee A. As an

course, without our clerk, policy analyst and committee assistant we
could not have coped. All three were new to us but, yet again, the
powers that be managed to appoint exactly the right persons for each of
these critical roles. I can safely say that without each of them our
work output would be well below that which we have achieved and they
are universally brilliant in guiding us, working indefatigably,
anticipating our needs, filling in the gaps of our knowledge on the
workings of the EU, and ever ready to go that extra mile. They do all
that plus they are so nice and, at times, funny. Yes, we are a happy,
productive, determined team and I feel deeply honoured to be their

the year we completed two new inquiries and published the subsequent
reports. The first inquiry was on women on boards, and we published our
report on 9 November last year. This subject has been debated several
times in this House and, indeed, it seldom seems to be off the business
and other pages in the press. We regard it as unfinished business as we
are now told that the final decision will not be taken until November
this year. This is quite strange because there was a delay in coming
clean about what the directive was going to be in November of last
year, so it indicates that there is quite a lot of disagreement both in
the Commission and in the Parliament. Behind the limelight, however, we
continue to encourage other member states to take our
line—namely, no quotas—while suggesting that the
Commission bring forward an EU-wide system for monitoring
progress.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073029000008">What
did we learn from this inquiry? We certainly developed better
engagement with other parliaments, greater use of video conferencing,
establishing links with the Commission, all of which were most
satisfactory. Time spent in deepening understanding and making and
keeping alive contacts is time well spent and—with the greater
use of modern technological developments—does not necessarily
entail expensive time-wasting travel. Similarly we have initiated and
maintained mutually respected links with officials in Whitehall in the
various departments who are responsible for the sectors of our very
wide remit. Our dealings with departmental heads and the coal face have
led to much greater understanding and are a terrific help in adding to
the ultimate value of our scrutiny role. The subject of Explanatory
Memoranda has come up already in this debate and this has been a deeply
discussed issue. Certainly one or two departments are already beginning
to produce documents that we can understand, so they are Explanatory
Memoranda.</hs_para>

on the effectiveness of EU research and innovation proposals, and we
published our report on 30 April. We highlighted the fact that the
EU’s competitiveness has been, and is, increasingly threatened
by the emphasis placed, and work undertaken, in emerging economies. We
focused on the ability of the EU to compete and retain its reputation
and leadership in this sector. It was a short inquiry but we received a
great deal of interesting evidence from a very wide range of witnesses
including those from the 
<?notus-xml column=1676?>SME sector—the sector on which are pinned the hopes of so many of
us for growth and job creation. This is ongoing. The Government

did we learn from this inquiry? It was very challenging for the
committee. It dealt with an important and broad subject in a relatively
short time—three and a half months between the call for evidence
and publication of the report. I have to say that it was a steep
learning curve for those of us who feel scientifically challenged.
However, we had strong help from certain members of our committee who
are leading lights in this area. This is a great example of the very
wide breadth of expertise which is available in this

turn to other work. The committee believes that it is most important to
revisit our previous work. For example, we had a meeting with the
incumbent Minister of Transport to address the lack of government
engagement in our previous report on the Channel Tunnel—another
item that is back in the news. We also had informal,
information-gathering talks with Deutsche Bahn and Eurotunnel.
Revisiting work is scheduled for the <I>Women on Boards</I> report as
it continues through the EU legislative process. We are still inclined

the Session the committee made history, publishing two subsidiarity
reports under the reasoned opinion mechanism introduced in 2009 by the
Lisbon treaty. Incidentally, in the four years since 2009 only four
such reports have been published by the UK. We had two of them in the
space of about three months— on aid for the most
deprived and gender balance on boards. The issue of subsidiarity has
provoked much discussion and debate in the committee, and in the House,
about the meaning of this difficult concept. One example is the Oral

March
2013.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073029000013">What
about current and future work? We plan enhanced scrutiny on EU

yesterday to discuss the shape of the inquiry and the potential

his

that our work is mirrored in the work of the House as a whole. I say to
both our Front Benches—I give an example of the Tyrie commission

the advent of the Liikanen proposals that will come before us from the
European Union, and are not always sure that things done on the
European scene in the single market are matched in the way that they
should be by the work in this House. I hope that we in the Select

of the important elements of the Economic and Financial Affairs

proposed three-pillared approach; that is, a single supervisory
framework, a single resolution mechanism which was recently published,
and a single deposit insurance mechanism. However, the last of those
three was quickly dropped under German pressure and progress on the
second, as I have said, has been recently published. As such, the
proposals initially were set out only in relation to the first pillar,
the single supervisory framework. The committee’s report
reflected on those proposals as well as on the further steps towards
banking union that were required. We undertook a very deep inquiry
which included evidence from the President of the Council, Herman Van
Rompuy; the Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, Michel
Barnier; the vice-president of the European Central Bank, Vitor
Constâncio; and the chairman of the European Banking Authority,
Andrea Enria. I should also say that when we were in Brussels we took
advice on the European Banking Union from Sir John Cunliffe. He, of

committee found that a European banking union was urgently required to
restore credibility to the euro area banking system and to break the
vicious circle between banks and sovereigns. Although the UK
has stated that it would not participate, the consequences for this
country could be enormous. The committee warned of the significant risk
that the UK could be marginalised as banking union participants moved
towards ever-closer integration. This, in turn, threatened to fracture
the single market as the authority of EU’s 27 bodies, such as
the European Banking Authority, came under threat. The committee warned
that the Government’s assurances about the impact on
the City may prove to be misplaced. It called for the
Government to ensure that London’s pre-eminence as a financial
market was not imperilled and that the integrity of the single market
was retained. UK isolation in such debates would be
disastrous.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073029000019">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T13:31:58"></hs_TimeCode>
committee also expressed regret that the three-pillared approach was so
quickly undermined under political pressure. However, it welcomed the
single supervisory mechanism proposals as a significant first step. It
agreed that the ECB should take on supervisory 
<?notus-xml column=1678?>responsibility over euro area banks but warned that the concentration of
so much power in one institution meant that powerful safeguards needed
to be put in place, and that there should be no conflict between the
European Central Bank’s supervisory and separate monetary policy
tasks. Indeed, the ECB should be accountable to the European Parliament
and to national Parliaments in the exercise of its supervisory powers,
and there should be equality in the decision-making process within the
ECB between the euro area and the non-euro area participants and the
role of the European Banking Authority in representing the 27 member
states must not be undermined. It now represents the 28 member
states.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073029000020">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T13:33:16"></hs_TimeCode>
committee has not rested on its laurels since publication of the
report. It has engaged in several rounds of correspondence with the
Financial Secretary to the Treasury as a deal on the single supervisory
mechanism emerged, which, in spite of some of our concerns about the
bail-in deal, is in itself an undoubted achievement. We have given
particular consideration to changes to the voting arrangements in the
EBA and the so-called non-discrimination clause, which the Minister
argued would be a significant achievement and safeguards against any
restriction of the UK’s role as a financial centre of the single
market. However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T13:33:53"></hs_TimeCode>,
we were concerned that such safeguards were not as watertight as
thought. There will be a review of voting arrangements if and when
there are four or fewer non-participating member states. As recent
developments with Latvia remind us, all but two member states are under
a legal obligation to join the single

monetary union and its implications for the United Kingdom. One notable
recent development is the publication of the Commission’s
proposal for the second pillar of banking union, the single resolution
mechanism. We will continue taking evidence on these important
subjects. We have meetings lined up with the Commission’s
Vice-President, Olli Rehn, who recently said that that vicious circle
between the banks and sovereigns was to be diluted rather than broken.

not fulfil any of the Commission’s five stated objectives 
<?notus-xml column=1679?>and that there was a significant risk that financial institutions would
relocate to avoid the tax. The UK had made clear that it would not
participate. Yet we warned that an FTT would nevertheless have a
significant effect on the United Kingdom, not least because of the
obligation placed on UK authorities to collect the tax under EU mutual
assistance agreements or under the provisions of joint and several
liability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073029000024">Follow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T13:37:17"></hs_TimeCode>-up
work to that report has consumed much of the committee’s
attention during the 2012-13 Session and at the start of the current
Session. We criticised the Government and the City for what seemed to
us to be an entirely complacent attitude, assuming that such a flawed
proposal could never survive, but this seriously underestimated the
political will behind the proposal in Brussels. While the
Commission’s original proposal was ditched in late 2012, 11
member states, led by Germany and France, announced their intention to
implement the FTT under the enhanced co-operation procedure, whereby a
smaller number of member states may pursue a proposal, so long as the
rights of non-participating member states are not infringed. When the
new proposals were published, they included a new provision, the
so-called “issuance principle”, whereby financial
institutions located outside the European Union would also be obliged
to pay the financial transaction tax if they traded securities
originally issued within the EU; for example, a trade in Volkswagen
shares between London and New York would be caught. This raised
concerns about the potential extraterritoriality of the tax and added
to the committee’s concerns about the potential deleterious
effect on the United
Kingdom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073029000025">In
light of this, we undertook a follow-up piece of work early this year
when we urged the Government to consider a legal challenge against the
proposal. This finally did the trick and awoke the Treasury from its
slumber. Sure enough, the United Kingdom has since launched a legal
challenge. Indeed, the Minister has
acknowledged,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13073029000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073029000077">“that

clear that participating member states are growing increasingly nervous
about the impact of the financial transaction tax. Informed observers
have predicted that, given the political capital invested in the

developments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0001.htm#13073029000027">Finally,
the euro area crisis: amid these complex legislative proposals the
committee has also sought to remain informed on the political and
economic context in which the eurozone and the European Union as a
whole operates. During the 2012-13 Session we continued with our
twice-yearly updates on the eurozone crisis. In January and February

that we must guard against, especially as it can affect the United
Kingdom and the integrity of the single market. Your Lordships will be
pleased to hear that the committee has not let up on its examination of

conclude with this: as others have expressed,  we, too, have
been disappointed by our relationship with the Treasury and, in

have been disappointed both by the tardiness of receiving explanatory

these failures that I threatened from the chair the meeting’s
conclusion that we would bind up all his explanatory memoranda in a

that it has stalled because agreement cannot be reached on how to
determine which countries have more than one judge; but I hope that the

lest I be misunderstood—seeks to intrude on this matter, a
Written Statement made to the House on 2 July by my noble friend Lady
Warsi will be borne in mind. While the amount that the UK contributes
to the budget of the Court of Justice of the European Union is not
clear, on the basis that we meet some 11.5% of the cost of the European
Union, our share of the court’s budget would be £32
million. According to that statement, we put £25 million into a
variety of other international justice organisations, including the
International Criminal Court and the International Criminal Tribunal
for the Former Yugoslavia, and made voluntary contributions to a lot of
other international tribunals. Given the importance of the Court of
Justice, I feel that this puts its relative cost into
perspective.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073029000036">The
other inquiry dealt with preventing fraud against EU finances. As the
noble Baroness, Lady Corston, said, we were particularly disappointed
with the apparent lack of engagement by both the Government and Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. I particularly regret the
rejection of the suggestion that one department, or one office within
Government, should be responsible for our efforts against fraud on
European finances. More contentiously and on a personal note, I regret
the outright rejection of a European prosecutor’s office even
before any proposal had been made. That seemed to me somewhat ill
judged. It now looks as though this may form part of the revised
Eurojust proposal; and although separate from the proposal for a
European prosecutor’s office, to which the noble Baroness, Lady
Corston, referred, there are likely to be close links. I ask the
Minister: will this lead to the Government not opting in to the new
Eurojust proposal? Eurojust has been identified by the Government as
being very important, as shown by their desire to reapply to rejoin in
the present format. How workable will rejoining in the present format
be if we do not join in the revised

Sub-Committee A, which handles economic and financial issues in the
European Union. I have been on that sub-committee for only two months
and can take no credit whatever for the fine reports that my noble
friend Lord Harrison has outlined. I pay tribute to him as a very
effective chairman of that committee. The reports have received a good
response—not just here but on the continent—and have been
acknowledged by the Government as having contained early warnings,
which unfortunately in many cases they decided not to
take<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T13:54:50"></hs_TimeCode>. Like
others, I pay tribute to the leadership of the noble Lord, Lord
Boswell. In the two months that I have been a part of the system, as it

effective leadership to this very important

is a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Bowness. In the debate we
had last week on justice and home affairs, I paid tribute to the
distinguished report that he, jointly with the committee of the noble
Lord, Lord Hannay, produced on the subject and which was the background
to that debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T13:55:27"></hs_TimeCode>.
That is where I want to start because we had the most extraordinary
debate last week from which it was absolutely clear that the Government
had been faced with 135, or thereabouts, potential home affairs and
justice measures. They looked at them all very carefully and found that
not one of them was against the national interest. Some were otiose and
some were obsolete, but none of them was harmful. The Government
selected the 35 measures which were clearly the most valuable to us,
some of which were absolutely vital to the conduct of justice in this
country. They decided that we could not avoid being a part of these
measures without serious damage to the country and so they decided to
opt back into them.</hs_para>

they opted out of the remainder when it was not logical to do so. There
was no harm in the remainder, which added up to a positive element for
the national interest on the Government’s own assessment. During
the debate last week I read out several quotations from the
Government’s own documents on the subject. There is no doubt
that the whole of the 135 measures contains greater value than simply
the 35, and yet the Government decided not to opt back into about
100 of them. There was no logical reason behind that
decision. What is more, it has set at risk our getting back into the 35
measures because there are always doubts about these complicated
procedures and the Government are incurring additional, unnecessary
administrative and other costs through this complicated
procedure—not to mention the costs in terms of good will. We are
exasperating our partners by this extraordinary and utterly irrational
conduct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T13:57:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073029000045">We
all know that the reason for it is that the Government had to find a
sop to give to their Eurosceptics. The Tory Party is desperately
worried about people voting UKIP and wants to draw back into its fold
the UKIP voters. We all know what the reasons are—they are
pretty squalid party politics—and they have made it impossible
for the Government to come to what any rational human being would have
seen as the right functional decision to take in this

context so that we can be reasonably confident that we are doing the
right job for the British public in the decisions that we take. There
is no better or other obvious mechanism than the committee structure we
have in this place. We all know that the House of Commons does not
engage in a systematic way in these deep and thorough reports on
European legislative proposals. We have this extremely valuable

irrationalities. The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, has just referred to the

looked at the matter in detail or read the report of the sub-committee

are other important issues pending. My noble friend Lord Harrison
referred to the issue of the European banking union. The Government

it reported on that subject. It is clearly a moving feast. It was only
a week or two ago that the Commission produced its second directive on
the resolution and recovery aspect. It has already produced a directive
on the European supervisory mechanism and we hope that it will produce

already had some evidence that there will be increasing costs to our
not being part of the banking union. It will be increasingly difficult

other things, that over the medium or long term it is probably
inconsistent with our being the largest financial centre in the
European Union for us not to be a part of the banking union. All these
things have to be taken very
seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073029000051">Another
big issue that it is quite impossible to expect the Government to take
a rational view on is the issue of Schengen. At first sight, there must
be great advantages to this country joining Schengen—the
convenience and amenity for us all in being able to travel without a
passport through more than 28 countries, as some non EU members have
joined Schengen. The benefit would be particularly great for two very
different 
<?notus-xml column=1685?>categories of our citizens: the very poor and some probably rather rich.
With regard to the very poor, there are a lot of people in this country
who have never travelled abroad. Some get to retirement age and they
have still never travelled abroad and have never had a passport. They
hope to visit Paris, Italy or see the Alps before the end of their
lives and they are going to have only a few hundred pounds at most to
finance that trip. Therefore, the cost of a passport is quite a
significant factor and deterrent, and we should think about people like
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073029000052">At the
other end of the income spectrum, there are the international
businessmen. These people are incredibly important when it comes to
taking business decisions on location—where do you place your
corporate headquarters in the EU? There are international businessmen
who travel quite a lot and travel outside the EU to places where they
need visas. Their passports often have to be with embassies or
consulates for the issuing of visas. If they suddenly want to make a
trip to Brussels or Frankfurt, they cannot do it. We are one of the
very few countries that provide second passports for businessmen who
ask for them for that sort of reason. Therefore, that is a significant
issue, although perhaps not a vital issue, in terms of business
decisions on location and it is something that we all feel strongly
about.</hs_para>

are other arguments about Schengen. One argument for joining would be
that it would involve  a lot of savings and would relieve the
pressure on  the border agency. We know the pressures it
has  been under and the real problems it has been having. The
Government say they are interested in making administrative savings.
There would certainly be administrative savings
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073029000054">The big
argument on Schengen is that we are losing hundreds of thousands at
least but probably millions of tourists a year. For people from the Far
East, China and elsewhere who come to Europe, mostly on organised
trips, it is simply not worth the money or the time for the travel
agency to apply for a second visa. They apply for a Schengen visa and
they offer people a European tour which takes them to Paris, Amsterdam,
down the Rhine, and then to Florence, Rome, Madrid and Seville, and
they do not come to the United Kingdom at all. They do not come because
they have to get an extra visa at extra cost. It is quite clear that we
are now talking in terms of hundreds of thousands, but it might be
millions, of lost visitors to this country every year as a result of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073029000055">Why do
we not join Schengen? On the other side of the argument, some people
would say “Good God, you couldn’t possibly do such a
thing. You’d have millions of people pouring across the Thracian
border into Greece who a day or two later would appear in London,
Birmingham and Bradford as illegal immigrants here”. We have to
think about that. Is it true that the French, Germans and the Dutch
have a much worse problem controlling illegal immigration than we do?
Is it true that sophisticated countries such as Switzerland and Norway,
which are not members of the EU, have actually chosen to join Schengen
when it is so hopeless at actually filtering people through the common
external frontier? We need at least to ask that sort of
question.</hs_para>

“It’s a principle that you must always control your
frontiers. You have only your own citizens controlling the
frontier”. That cannot be an absolute principle because we have
officials in the Republic of Ireland taking decisions about who should
come into the United Kingdom. It is certainly not an absolute
principle. Some will say that it is all to do with sovereignty. People
get very excited about sovereignty. Before 1914 you could go to
Victoria station and buy yourself a ticket to Paris, Berlin, Rome or
Madrid and go without a passport. It was not until you got to the
Russian frontier, the frontier of the Russian empire, that you had to
produce a passport. Whatever the nations of Europe were suffering from
before 1914, I do not think that it was an insufficiency of
sovereignty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073029000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073029000057">All
of these arguments need to be probed. Who is going to look at them? Not
the Government. If you suggested joining Schengen the Eurosceptics
would go berserk. They would go barmy and get hysterical. The
Eurosceptic press—the Murdoch press and the Rothermere
press—would get completely hysterical as well. There is no
chance of a cool, calm, measured and calculated cost-benefit analysis
being done by the Government on a subject like that. It is all the more
important that we have instruments of the kind we do in the form of
committees in this House which are able to give the country some of
that element of analysis of these
issues.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_30_PT_1/ACEC632B3D7348FB2E14EA96A3CD1BFBF63BCDA6" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 30 July 2013">Tuesday,

the equally significant changes in the whole pattern  and

non-governmental networks increasingly melding together in a completely
novel way. It is important, is it not, that your Lordships should

evidence for this view of change from the clear and increasing

principles which we have seen from the Netherlands Government, from
Italy, and from the obvious German resistance; from the all

attempts to repair the euro; and from a clear call for a return to what
has been called deliberative intergovernmentalism. I also refer to a
remarkable paper issued by the organisation Policy Network, which is a
body of impeccable pro-EU credentials chaired by the noble Lord, Lord
Liddle, who is sitting there on the Opposition Front Bench. This paper,
<I>Coordination in place of integration? Economic governance in a
non-federal EU</I>, is by Professor Renaud Thillaye, a senior
researcher of Policy Network. Its message is simple: we have reached
the end of member-state tolerance for one-size-fits-all measures and
demands for more central power. Instead, the professor advocates the
kind of sensible dialogue which leads much more to practical
open-method co-ordination, and therefore to a substantial alteration in
the size and nature of the flow of Commission-inspired EU proposals,
directives and all the rest with which the committee has to struggle so
nobly. However, it is undoubtedly, in its own words, “somewhat

it not perfectly clear that in this digital age of instant

that the committee’s valiantly performed task in holding the
Government to account is not at all helped by the endless, enormous
stream of Commission proposals, all requiring Explanatory Memoranda

instrument. The requirement of nine member states to make it work is
ridiculously high. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs is right to urge that we move to a
tougher reformed red card procedure, although that would have to be on
the basis of far fewer national Parliaments objecting to make it
realistic. Of course, that is precisely what some of us argued for in

Sadly, there, too, the Select Committee report speaks of “short

mention, to which I direct your Lordships’ attention, on page 92

states looks increasingly preferable to packaged- up EU

collective structures was never a great success and the issue now in
the digital age is whether it is even necessary. Collective European
aims in overseas theatres can now increasingly be achieved by swift
co-ordination and alliance for specific tasks rather than by permanent
and expensive new bureaucratic structures. The authors of this balance
of competences review miss the point about the genius of the digital
age: that instant and ad hoc co-ordination can be far more flexible,
quicker, more efficient and better tailored to the particular mission

of more agile and practical co-ordination between states, focused on
well defined common purposes, far more democratically accountable and
closer to the people, is now upon us. Nowadays, Governments can come
together and co-ordinate actions at the click of a button and then

Maclennan of Rogart:</Member></B> My Lords, I have had the privilege of
serving on four sub-committees of the European Union Select Committee.
I have listened with great interest to the current chairmen of six of
the EU committees describing the work of the current Session, which is
of course what this debate is primarily about, but it would be a
mistake to follow their lead in going over the detailed business that
these committees have engaged in.</hs_para>

to say at the beginning how very much I have appreciated the leadership
of the chairman of the Select Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Boswell
of Aynho, and pay tribute to his fresh thinking about how these
committees should work. I also feel it is appropriate to express strong
gratitude to the staff who have serviced these committees. They are 
<?notus-xml column=1690?>not large in number and they have to work extraordinarily hard to
produce the advice and drafts on which we

Select Committee is one of the most important functions of the House of
Lords. It currently engages, I believe, 74 Members of this House. The
noble Lord, Lord Boswell, indicated that Sir John Cunliffe stated how
much influence we have brought to bear on Brussels and Governments. I
disagree very strongly with the previous speaker, my noble friend Lord
Howell, in his summation of the way in which the Union ought to operate
by way of co-ordination, rather than the open legislative process and
the open parliamentary process that we have. I cannot see how what he
has recommended is in the least conformable with democratic thinking in
a modern conglomeration of 28 nations. How could the detail be
co-ordinated effectively so that the disagreements are properly vented
and properly answered and consensus is arrived at? It is not a matter
of modern technology; it is a matter of openness that we have to
embrace if this Union of ours is to enjoy the support that it deserves

did not mean to divert down that route, but I wanted to indicate my
belief that the work of these committees is invaluable in ventilating
issues that need to be raised with the Government, the European
Commission, the European Parliament and with the Council. There is not
much doubt that the work of these committees has made a significant
impact. It is unusual for a clash of mighty opposites to occur, such as
we had over the opt-out from justice and home affairs. None the less,
it ventilated the arguments and enabled many members of the public, who
were certainly not as well informed as they might have been, to grasp
some of the issues and it got significant coverage in the national

would like to open a thought that is not entirely about the influence
that we can have on government, but rather the influence that we might
have with the public. It seems to me that because we are doing studies
of great depth and importance, and we are engaging with witnesses who
are knowledgeable, engaged and interested, we produce significantly
sophisticated reports. However, despite getting our message out to many
newspapers and some broadcasts—the report talks about 35 million
opportunities for people to understand what is being said in
dialogue—I none the less think that we might, within our terms
of reference, contemplate how we could gain more public understanding
of the work that we do and get the public almost to help to promote
some of our

with other parliamentary bodies or with our own European
parliamentarians—we have three meetings a year in the House of
Commons. However, that does not seem to me sufficiently to embrace the
public. I should like to speculate and suggest that we might
communicate with the public to find out which issues give rise to the
greatest concern. A body such as YouGov, chaired by Peter Kellner, the
spouse of the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, might be able to identify
and prioritise the public’s real concerns and consequently we
could engage in a debate. We could have a special meeting open to
stakeholders who are particularly exercised by what they understand to
be the problem with Europe or the way the Union is moving. We could
then include these thoughts in our scrutiny and researches, however
unfocused they may be, and we could answer them directly and possibly

Judd:</Member></B> My Lords, it is good to follow the noble Lord, Lord
Tugendhat. He brings to his chairmanship of Sub-Committee C a lifetime
in politics and of experience in international affairs, and from across
the Floor I have always found him particularly well informed and
enlightened. He also brings his considerable experience as a
Commissioner of the European Union. He referred to his good fortune; I
think that the committee is certainly fortunate to have him in the
chair. While I mention the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat, I want to join
others in paying tribute to the chairmanship of all our committees, and
of course to the noble Lord, Lord Boswell, for his supreme
chairmanship, to which he brings not only an ability that is
desperately needed but a commitment which is very challenging. I think
that we all deeply appreciate that. I want in personal terms to put on
record my appreciation as a member of Sub-Committee F of the
outstanding leadership and chairmanship that we consistently have in
the noble Lord, Lord Hannay. I have known him for many years. He, too,
brings vast experience of the world and international affairs, which
again illustrates just how well served Parliament is by their
leadership in committees and by the experience that that leadership
brings.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073030000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073030000021">In
thanking the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, I would like to say how much I
have appreciated in the joint work between Sub-Committees F and E the
chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Bowness. He provides again to the
House a real example of integrity and political courage. He speaks for
what he believes, and does so not only with passion and emotion, but
always on the basis of sound analysis and detailed knowledge. I think
that the House should be grateful. I wish my 
<?notus-xml column=1694?>long-standing friend the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, well in her
chairmanship. She will have a tough challenge following the noble Lord,
Lord Bowness, but I know that she will more than live up to it. I have
had the good fortune of serving under her on the Joint Committee on
Human Rights and know what a very effective chairman she too can be. I
am sure that we all wish  her
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073030000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073030000022">There is
another group of people whom we ought to bear in mind and thank in our
deliberations. These are the witnesses who provide so much valuable
evidence to the committees as the basis for their work. We would not be
able to produce our reports unless many people had a put great deal of
time into preparing submissions and appearing before the committees,
and sharing their insights, experiences and
thoughts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073030000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073030000023">This
brings me to something about which the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, was
talking. There is one gigantic challenge with the European Union and
our approach to it. To the majority of people in the country, certainly
a wide cross-section, the European Union is a remote and closed world.
It speaks with great deliberation and experience to itself. It is very
well informed about the work with which it deals, but to some extent it
has lost contact with those who are dependent upon it and have to
respond to its initiatives. That underlies a lot of the public anxiety
about it and needs to be challenged. It is something to which in our
work we could all make an important
contribution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073030000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073030000024">When
we are assembling lists of witnesses it is important not to fall into
the trap of taking evidence just from those who are already informed
about the European Community. We must develop the ability to seek out
people who are coping with the consequences of European Union policy,
or who have a great deal to say about the challenges to which the
European Union should be responding, and to hear their views as well.
These are people in the front line of the work with which we deal. When
we were doing our report on migration in Sub-Committee F, I was struck
by some of the witnesses from this front line, dealing with the issues
of migration in our society. As we develop our work we should take this
very
seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073030000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073030000025">As
I understand it, one of the issues with which the Government are
concerned in our future relationships with the European Union is that
it should be opened up and become more flexible and closer to people.
It should be more accountable to the nation and people as a whole. That
is a laudable objective. If it is to be fulfilled it is incumbent on
the Government to live by example and not just theory. Even after a
week, what happened last week was nothing short of a parliamentary
disgrace. Here were two committees that had done tremendously detailed
work on the implications of opting out and taken evidence from a wide
cross-section of witnesses, who had put a great deal of effort and time
into what they had to say to the committees. Theses two committees had
listened to those in the front line of work in the context of justice,
security and the rest. But what happened? Just hours before the debate
on the same day, the Government’s response appeared. How is that
opening up the matters European Union to the public as a whole? How is
that enabling Parliament to do its job as it should? We should all 
<?notus-xml column=1695?>have had time to consider in depth the Government’s response and
prepare ourselves for a sensible debate in that
context.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073030000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073030000026">We
should not hesitate in calling for the Government to do far better on
this in the future. At the moment they are not serving the cause of
enlightening our country at all by behaving in this way. It is not a
totally isolated indication. We must understand what lies behind it and
one of the difficulties is that we all know that there is a huge debate
going on within the ranks of the coalition. It is not simply between
the two formal parties that form the coalition, but even within the
ranks of the Conservative Party. I have friends in the Conservative
Party with whom it would be very difficult to get a thin sheet of paper
regarding their views and mine on Europe. But there are others in the
Conservative Party who are very different, committed to a xenophobic,
insular and narrow view of where Britain’s future lies, and that
is certainly not within the sphere of the European Union, nor even on
too many occasions, I fear to say, of international co-operation as a
whole.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073030000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073030000027">That
will always be a complication when the Government are getting their
case together, but it in no way excuses what happened last week. I have
been disturbed at the way in which we are repeatedly entertained to
what, if it was not so grimly serious, is a charade of on the one hand
senior government voices whipping up the sceptics and the critics of
the concept of the European Union, and on the other those who are
trying to keep the whole show on the rails. I suspect that that
includes the Prime
Minister.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073030000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073030000028">One
of the contentious issues in which emotion has obscured reality is the
repatriation of criminals who have completed their sentences and are
not British subjects. There is too much evidence that some in the
senior ranks of government, who should know better, have been whipping
up a view that this is somehow the fault of the European Union over the
European court. If that were case, it would be a very serious matter.
Let us establish how great the problem is. In that context, I put down
a Question on 3 June, asking on how many occasions in 2012 the
Government were prevented from deporting criminals, who were not United
Kingdom citizens, following the completion of their sentences by
rulings of the United Kingdom courts citing Article 8 of the
European Convention on Human
Rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073030000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073030000029">I drew
the House’s attention to this last week. I have had approaches
from Ministers, who have protested how sorry they are that I have not
had a reply and that I must of course have one. I hope he will forgive
me, as he is not in the House, but because this is so serious 
I must say that last night I sent an e-mail to the noble Lord, Lord
McNally. I pointed out that today was the last day before the recess. A

very touched that the noble Lord sits so assiduously by his iPad,
because within minutes, I had a reply in which he said that he was
shocked that I  had not had a reply. I would like to think that
that is just innocent incompetence, the machine just not getting a
reply together, but I cannot help being concerned lest that reveals
something much deeper: that the 
<?notus-xml column=1696?>Home Office is in no hurry to answer the question because the facts

we consider the future of the European Union, these matters are very
grave indeed. We must have a Government displaying to us openly, fairly
and straightforwardly the matters central to the issue. That, of
course, starts with the Select Committees. I come back to the issue of
how totally unsatisfactory—that is putting it in mild language,
how totally wrong and insulting—it was to produce a report only
hours before the debate took

their support staff, who do a fantastic job for us all. I hope that
they will get a decent break this summer, although I fear that in the
case of Sub-Committees E and F, that will not be as simple as it sounds
because we are going to meet during the recess. That shows the
commitment to those issues by a large number of people. Again, I give

Kerr of Kinlochard:</Member></B> My Lords, I started to take the
reports of the Select Committee seriously 22 years ago. I
discovered that I had to. I then lived in Brussels, and it was the
habit of the then President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, to read
House of Lords reports on Sunday afternoons. When he discovered
something that he did not understand or did not like, it was his habit
to telephone the permanent representative. I discovered that these
conversations went slightly better if I had read the reports
beforehand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T14:52:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073033000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073033000002">I
was therefore delighted when I came here to have a spell on the Select
Committee and on three sub-committees, and I now sit on Sub-Committee A
under the polymathic chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Harrison,
whose habit it is to greet witnesses from far and wide in their native
tongue, to the consternation of his colleagues and, sometimes, the
witnesses. He is an admirable chairman, as he has again displayed today
in his
speech<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T14:53:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073033000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073033000003">The
standard of the big reports from the Select Committee, which attracted
a lot of admiration in Brussels 20 years ago, is undiminished. It is
still very high. I think particularly of Bowness-Hannay on the Protocol
36 opt-out. Sub-Committee A’s MiFID II report was good, and I
think that its report on the financial transaction tax hit on a point
which, at that time, the Government had failed to or did not wish to
recognise: that the obnoxious tax would cost us because we would have
to collect it even if we did not ourselves go along with
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T14:54:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073033000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073033000004">The
big reports are very good indeed. However, compared to 20 years ago, I
think that the standard  of everyday scrutiny of the
legislative workload has diminished. It is not as good as it used to
be. I think that the principal reason for that—the Minister may
disagree with me but he will have heard the feeling of the House from
the noble Lords, Lord Boswell, Lord 
<?notus-xml column=1697?>Hannay, Lord Bowness, and Lord Judd—is that the Government do not
take the process as seriously as they used to. That is my impression
too.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Boswell, spoke of the perpetual lateness and
inadequacy of Explanatory Memoranda. Aficionados will have followed
with interest the increasingly irate correspondence in the previous
Session between him and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury over
the 2012, 2013 and 2014 Budgets, various measures of financial services
and banking legislation and the infamous financial transaction tax. The
common theme to all those letters was delays, missed deadlines,
superficial analysis and unanswered
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T14:55:56"></hs_TimeCode>. I
know that the Treasury suffers from staff cuts and a high
turnover—I read the figure of 20% a year turnover in the press
the other day. I cannot believe that, but perhaps the Minister will
enlighten us. If it is true, it is extremely
alarming<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T14:56:18"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Permanent Secretary to the Treasury came to answer a friendly call from
Sub-Committee A and assured us that performance will improve. I hope it

is a particular reason why delayed Explanatory Memoranda are not just
discourteous and in breach of the rules but actually dangerous. I
attach some importance to the subsidiarity mechanism. There is a
deadline of eight weeks for the use of the yellow card. This morning,
in Sub-Committee A, we looked at a proposal which, to my amateur eye,
seemed to raise a question of subsidiarity. Whether or not I was right
is completely academic, because the proposal was dated very early in
June, but it came to the committee this morning, so there is no way in
which, if I were right and the committee and the chairman agreed with
me, we could use the yellow card, purely because of delays that
occurred in
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T14:57:49"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government need to take seriously the rules which are clearly set out
in Cabinet Office guidance to the whole of Whitehall, and which used to
be enforced quite fiercely by Permanent Secretaries—I can give a
personal assurance that that used to be the case.</hs_para>

course, there are also objective reasons why the scrutiny process has
got more difficult, why we have to run harder to stay still. We have to
catch up with co-decision. The Council is now only the co-equal
legislator with the European Parliament. I am not convinced that we in
this Parliament or the Government are yet doing enough to try to
influence the European Parliament in the European Union interest and
the UK interest. The problem is exacerbated by the Conservative Party
having left the EPP. It is quite difficult even for distinguished
senior Conservative Members of the European Parliament to have as much
influence as their predecessors. I pay tribute to Malcolm Harbour, who
is a sterling exception to what I just said: he proves that what I am
saying is not true in all cases. I pay tribute to Sharon Bowles, but I
think that the West Lothian question—let us call it the
Westphalian question—will impose itself on the next European
Parliament in relation to the chairmanship of committees. Sharon Bowles
has put in a sterling performance as chairman of one of the key
committees of the European Parliament. She has done extraordinarily
well but she has hung on to her job by the skin of
her  
<?notus-xml column=1698?>teeth because, for a large number of members of her own grouping in
Strasbourg, it is difficult to see why, when the United Kingdom has
stood aside from fiscal union, banking union and bailouts—from
the core business of the Parliament on economic matters—a UK MEP
can be the chairman of its key economic committee. I hope that she
survives, as she does a great deal of good in the European interest and
the UK interest, but I am not sure that she
can.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073033000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073033000008">The
European Parliament has also drifted away from national Parliaments a
bit. On the multiannual financial framework, I did not see much
recognition in the European Parliament, with its insistence that the
totals were too low, of the need for painful belt-tightening being felt
in member state Parliaments. On the financial transactions tax, I was
shocked by some of the arguments advanced in the European Parliament,
where the greatest enthusiasm came from those who thought that the
financial sector needed to be punished for its crimes in the financial
crisis and that throwing grit in the wheels of the capital markets was
a good idea, per se. I did not see many arguing that having a great
international financial centre inside the EU is a huge EU asset and
that the City of London needs to be listened to, and that the FTT
therefore needs to be rejected. Those who want to make such arguments
in the Parliament could be assisted in making them by people like us,
so I have three very modest proposals.</hs_para>

a case for inviting key United Kingdom Members of the European
Parliament to participate in certain subject-specific Select Committee
meetings, not as witnesses but as country members sitting on our side
of the table and talking with us about how best to affect the EU
outcome? Secondly, should our chairmen regularly meet the chairs of the
European Parliament committees and, thirdly, could we even
consider—a daring suggestion—a joint committee of members
of the Select Committee of this House with UK Members of the European
Parliament? It could perhaps have fluctuating membership, depending on
the issue of the day. I am not saying that these meetings should be the
kind which happens for form’s sake, with very long agendas, or
on a regular basis. I see them as ad hoc, and called to deal with a
particular big issue, such as the seven-year financial framework this
spring, or the financial transactions tax. If, as  I hear, the
Select Committee is to consider the role of national Parliaments, I
hope that it might consider looking into these
suggestions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073033000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073033000010">I
have one other suggestion, which I also put to the noble Lord, Lord
Boswell, with a certain degree of trepidation. We have to acknowledge
that the performance of our own committee could be improved. We do very
well but I think we could do better. The Commission sends to this
House, electronically and instantly, every legislative proposal that it
puts forward at the moment when it is sent to the Council. They are
here before they are read by Sir Jon Cunliffe in Brussels. What do we
do with them? We actually do very little because since we joined the
European Union, it has been our practice to wait. In those days, we
would have waited for the carrier pigeon to arrive with the paper from
Brussels. We wait until the Government send us along a copy, telling us
what they think of it. Why do we  wait for the Government? We
could be self-starters 
<?notus-xml column=1699?>and form our own view by considering the most contentious

importance on deadlines and

would be resource consequences from such a change. It would have costs
for this House. But if we cannot get the Government to perform as they

scrutiny that we used to have and, I hope, improve them—and we

it as if it were a matter for treaty change. I really cannot see that
at all. We could look again at Articles 10 and 12 of the treaty, which
could be expanded, but they are deliberately
unspecific—correctly, I think. It would be wrong in principle

I cannot hope to match, and I listened with great interest to his

member, now of Sub-Committee E and previously of Sub-Committee F. This
has given me the opportunity to study in detail four very different
chairmen: my noble friends Lord Jopling and Lord Bowness, the noble
Baroness, Lady Corston, and, previously, the noble Lord, Lord Hannay.
Each has been extremely effective and has been able to corral their
potentially recalcitrant flocks with humour and good sense. It has been
a pleasure to serve under them all. The other group to whom I add my
thanks are the clerks, who do such terrific preparatory work and manage
to turn the meanderings of the committees 
<?notus-xml column=1700?>into a coherent whole. In my view, the country and the House owe a great
debt of gratitude to both these groups.</hs_para>

Sub-Committee E, I served on the joint Select Committee considering the
opt-out decision but I am not proposing to cover that issue now. The
House has debated it at length and I agree with the noble Lords, Lord
Judd and Lord Hannay, that the delivery of the Government’s
response was unacceptably late. However, we have had a good chew of
that and candidly, if I am honest, I am suffering a bit from opt-out or
opt-in fatigue, at least for the time being. We will no doubt return to
that issue in the

I will focus first on another of Sub-Committee E’s reports: that
on <I>The Fight against Fraud on the EU’s Finances</I>. The
evidence that the sub-committee received indicated that the official
figure of fraud—which, as we have been told, was £404
million—was a woeful underestimate and that the real figure
could be as much as 12 times higher: around £5
billion.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073033000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073033000018">We
also received evidence that OLAF, the European agency charged with
fighting fraud, did not always receive the full-hearted national
co-operation that it deserved. In these circumstances, the
Government’s participation in our inquiry, or perhaps I should
say their non-participation, is disappointing. Further, the
Government’s response to the sub-committee’s report,
received only recently, did not seek to rebut the
sub-committee’s suggestion that EU fraud could be as high as
£5 billion, merely recording, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Corston, said, that it was not a figure that they recognised. This
smacks of a good deal of complacency. Fraud is theft—theft from
the taxpayer, whose interests every Government in the EU ought to be
protecting. Moreover, fraud, if not investigated and prosecuted with
vigour, has an unhappy habit of spreading. I hope for a more vigorous
approach by the Government on this topic in

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</Member></B> As always, the noble Lord, Lord
Davies, has a seductive tone to his voice, but of course that is a
completely different issue. We are trying to ensure that OLAF, which is
the European fraud investigative committee, operates effectively. That
is what we need to concentrate on first rather than, as my noble friend
Lord Howell has said, superimposing yet another body that will be out

shall focus the rest of my remarks on Chapter 10, the future look. I
have written to the noble Lord, Lord Boswell, to give him some advance
warning of what I wish to raise and what I would like the EU Committee
to look at in future: the implications for this country of the
continued free movement of labour within the EU—one of the
pillars, as the noble Lord, Lord 
<?notus-xml column=1701?>Hannay, firmly pointed out, on which the whole EU structure rests.
However, I fear that the UK, uniquely, is already facing some strains
from this free movement, strains that I fear will almost certainly
become more severe and increase over the next 10 to 20 years.</hs_para>

help to illustrate the point. England, not the United Kingdom, has now
overtaken the Netherlands as Europe’s most densely populated
country, with some 400 people per square kilometre. By comparison,
France has 125 people per square kilometre, which is one-third or
one-quarter as densely populated, and Germany has 260 per square
kilometre—about two-thirds as populated. That is today, but over
the next 15 years to 2027, if you believe the mid-projection by the
Office for National Statistics, the UK’s population—here
I am talking about the UK, not England—will increase by 7
million people, from 63 million today to 70 million then. What does
this mean in comparable statistics? Last year, the UK’s
population grew by just short of 1,100 people per day—a small
village every week; a parliamentary constituency every three months or
so. By contrast, Italy’s, France’s and Germany’s
populations are falling, and on present projections the UK will
overtake Germany to become the most populous country in Europe by the
early 2030s.</hs_para>

this? Before answering that question, one needs to make it clear that
race, colour and creed play no part in the debate. Indeed the social
strains, if social strains there be, are likely to be felt most harshly
in the minority communities. So should we worry? Physically, we can
certainly fit the people in. Bangladesh has 1,400 people per square
kilometre compared to England’s 400. However, it will be
up  to wiser minds than mine as to whether we wish to reproduce
Bangladeshi living conditions in the

revolve around two specific issues. First, there is the impact on our
environment—the pressure on the green belt around our cities,
the impact on our countryside, especially in the south-east, and so
forth. These are important to me but are not the critical issues. For
me, the critical issue is the potential crowding out of our native-born
population—please note that I say, and I mean,
“native-born”; that is not another word for white but,
rather, means anyone and everyone who was born here—and the
consequences of that crowding-out on our social structure. If the
default option for British industry and commerce is to call for more
immigration as opposed to upskilling our own population, we run the
risk of creating a sullen, disconnected, unemployed and in due course
no doubt unemployable underclass—an underclass that, in the
minority communities, may well find extremist activities attractive.

shall give the House a practical example. I have a house on the
Shropshire/Herefordshire border. As I speak here today, there are about
4,000 people from eastern Europe picking fruit. They are here legally,
they behave well, they work hard and at the end of the season all, or
at least most, of them will go home. However, there are unemployed
locals in Herefordshire and south Shropshire. Talk to the fruit farmers
and they will tell you that the locals will not work hard 
<?notus-xml column=1702?>enough, are not reliable and turn up once and do not come again. Talk to
the locals and they will tell you that they cannot get the farmers to
recruit them because they prefer to recruit in bulk
from eastern Europe in the hundreds. Where does the truth lie? I have
no idea, but there is an issue here that at some point we have to

argument often advanced for increasing immigration is the need to
provide additional people to look after, and compensate for, our ageing
population. This has extremely superficial attractions but it ignores
the inexorable laws of ageing and compound interest. Today’s
increased number of young people leads inevitably to tomorrow’s
increased number of old people, who will in turn require still further
increases of young people to compensate. Indeed, it has been calculated
that if we wish to keep the same number of workers to pensioners as at
present—it is about 3.5 to 1—we will already need an
extra 27 million more workers by 2050: a 40% increase in our
population<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T15:17:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073033000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073033000027">To
conclude, while free movement of labour within the EU is only part of
the challenge, it is an important part and one which an EU committee
will be uniquely well placed to address because it can do so in the
non-partisan, equable, evidence-based way at which it excels and which
this subject, above all, demands. I take a fairly hard-nosed approach
to this country’s relationship with the EU but I do not doubt
that at root it has been of great benefit to the United Kingdom. The
900,000 or so graves in France and Belgium are mute witnesses to that
fact. However, outside the M25 in particular, the apparently inexorable
rise in our population is causing concern. We need to reassure any
concerned people that Parliament is aware of those concerns and

points in a brief speech. First, this work is essential and therefore I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and the noble Baroness, Lady
Scott, that there should be no further cutbacks to it in this House.
Secondly, it can work properly only if all parts of the Government take
it seriously. I have a lot of sympathy with the strictures on the
Treasury that I have heard from various quarters in this debate. When I
worked in 10 Downing Street the Treasury would not even tell No. 10
what was going on. That was not so much because of the personalities at
the top but rather because of an institutional arrogance: they believe
they are guardians of the state unaccountable to anyone else. This
attitude has to change.</hs_para>

I may make an aside, I am somewhat alarmed by the fact that at present
the two key posts in the management of European business—in the

third point is about the future work of the committee. Here I rather
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Howell—and not just because of
the very nice compliment that he paid my think tank—that the
committee could take a more ambitious view of its role beyond scrutiny.
We have to recognise that a big debate has been started about
Britain’s future in the European Union and the committee can
make a very valuable contribution to it, particularly in two areas
where it is extremely well, if not uniquely well, qualified. One is the
question of competences and the whole debate about subsidiarity and
proportionality. The second is the debate about the need for an
enhanced role for national parliaments.</hs_para>

would be the Government’s balance of competences review. My
fears about this have been somewhat allayed by the tone of the first
reports, as they show an objectivity of approach. There has certainly
been a bit of Lib Dem influence there, which is possibly more effective
in this area than on many coalition policies. I also think there is a
sense in parts of the Conservative Party that it is simply not going to
follow the kind of bar-room prejudices of Nigel Farage in setting its
future European agenda—at least, I hope so. I detect—I
would like to know what the Minister says about this—that the
Government are shifting from what started off as a Conservative
manifesto commitment to the repatriation of powers to a sensible debate
about the need for multilateral reform of the way the European Union
exercises its competences. If that is the case, it would be quite an
important shift, which on this side of the House we would very strongly
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T15:23:37"></hs_TimeCode>. The
committee could help that debate along, particularly if it carried out

am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, is right to say that the work
of the committee could be even better. Certainly, the role of national
parliaments in the system could be strengthened without treaty change.
We have to look, at a much earlier stage in the policy-making process
than at present, at how national parliaments hold Ministers to account.
We should seek to beef up the role of COSAC—the body that brings
together the parliaments in Brussels—so that the yellow card
procedure is used more effectively. Of course, there are all sorts of
other ways in which the role of national parliaments could be

we have shown a constant tension between concern about procedural
issues and substantive issues. Perhaps I may select in particular the
remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, who felt strongly about both. I

today. As I have said on previous occasions, any discussion of European
policy matters is not a binary one where everyone immediately agrees or
disagrees to the suggestion you have made after your detailed inquiry.
It is very much more a process of evolving. One of our important roles,
which I think has been touched on, involves our ability to go further
back in the decision-making process and to respond as the Commission
has a bright idea or wishes to develop themes, and not simply to wait
until the last minute when we can say, “We are not happy with
this as it’s turned out”, “It raises a
subsidiarity issue”, or
whatever<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T15:47:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

raised—for which we are indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Howell
of Guildford, as we are for others—is that it is now a very
complex process. As for his comments on the contribution of the
electronic dialogue, although I can e-mail my colleagues in COSAC, for
example, which is the sort of thing we should be doing more than we do,
that might not be the answer 
<?notus-xml column=1710?>to every situation. We do not simply have a central authoritarian system

migration issues. Indeed, I hope that the House will not land
everything with even the remotest relevance to Europe on our shores.

not as a criticism—that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach,
is not here today; not because we are not pleased to see the noble
Baroness, but because we discussed this in Committee. I said to him on
7 July that if I remained dissatisfied with the answers to our queries

Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee made the point that the
Government needed to justify how the benefits offset additional
bureaucracy, and the wider application of the code. Those two issues
stand together. There is significant increased bureaucracy and cost for
local authorities and the police, as I outlined previously. This is
addressed in the impact assessment. In Committee and in his letter to
me, the noble Lord addressed this. He said in his letter that the Local
Government Association agreed that it was difficult to assess the costs
involved. He then added that it was around £1.6 million each and
every year, although given the information on the impact assessment,
this is a conservative estimate and could be much higher. The impact
assessment suggests that is the best estimate and that it could be as
high as £3 million each and every year, and that the best
estimate for the one-off transition costs is over £14 million
and could be as high as £29

further difficulty which was raised in Committee but has not been

and refers to the advantages of CCTV. It also refers to the

order is therefore being promoted as a protection of civil liberties
against the power of individuals, organisations and the state. However,
it does not apply to individuals, organisations and the state; it
applies only to the state and public institutions. So if these
guidelines are so essential to protect civil liberties, why does the
policy giving effect to the Government’s principles outlined so
boldly in the Explanatory Memorandum only apply to the public
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T15:57:04"></hs_TimeCode>? Can the
noble Baroness tell me what percentage of CCTV cameras the order
covers? I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T15:57:37"></hs_TimeCode> know
that previously the Minister said that this was because they were in a
public place, but so are shopping centres; shop and 
<?notus-xml column=1713?>office cameras look onto the street. Do the same principles apply to
those CCTV cameras as to the ones that police and local authorities
use? If I am to believe what I see on “Law and Order UK”
and other detective programmes on TV, the police often ask for access
to the information on these private CCTV cameras to collate evidence of
criminal activities. So, in many cases, the use of those cameras and
the people they film are
identical<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T15:57:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13073033000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073033000084">The
Government have made much of leaner, slimmer government and fewer
regulations—they want to cut quangos—and yet here we have
not only a new commissioner but significant additional regulations for
local government and the police. I understood that the Government
policy was that for each new regulation that was brought in, two would
be jettisoned as the overall burden, as the Government call it, of
regulation was reduced. I think that is a poor way to make policy.
There are serious issues around regulation; it is not a numbers game.
In his comments to the Committee, the Minister said that, in terms of
bureaucracy and regulations, the rule of “one in and two
out” does not apply to the public sector, only to business. That
is a new one on me. I had not realised that the Government’s
commitment to reducing bureaucracy, as they call it, was
qualified<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T15:58:47"></hs_TimeCode>. Given

second point I have raised before and on which I am still not
clear—perhaps the noble Baroness can help me—is that when
I raised the issue of compliance with the principles the
Minister’s response was that the legislation to establish the
new Surveillance Camera Commissioner limited the commissioner’s
role to encouraging compliance and that the legislation provided no
enforcement powers even though it was the Government’s
legislation. At an annual cost of £250,000, the Government are
therefore setting up a commissioner to encourage local authorities and
the police to comply with the new regulations, which will not apply to
the private sector. However, although there is a statutory duty, there
is no way that this commissioner, at a cost of £250,000—a
quarter of a million—can enforce the regulations.</hs_para>

are 12 guiding principles within the code, seven of which are
considered not to have any cost. Each one of those places an additional
bureaucratic obligation on the police and local authority. Therefore,
non-compliance with any of those 12 criteria or principles opens up the
possibility of a judicial review, and judicial reviews do not come
cheap. This statutory instrument allows for any public sector CCTV
installation  
<?notus-xml column=1714?>to be subject to a judicial review. I am not sure if the noble Baroness
is aware of this, but local authorities are
understandably becoming more risk-averse whenever there is a
possibility of legal action or judicial review because they fear the
costs. Experience tells us that the threat of a judicial review can
lead local authorities to avoid decisions that can lead to a JR, even
when they are likely to win, just because of the huge costs that are
involved.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13073033000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073033000087">The

the Protection of Freedoms Act, Parliament debated and agreed the
function of the commissioner and the scope and nature of the CCTV code
of practice in so far as it applies only to the police, local
authorities and other designated bodies. As we made clear then, the
Government believe that the CCTV code will ensure that CCTV is deployed
and used transparently, proportionately, and effectively. We want the
police and local authorities to use CCTV to help cut crime. During our
consultation, we received widespread support for it: 80% of respondents
supported it. The Information Commissioner was also positive in his
response, as was
ACPO.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073033000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073033000095">It might

noble Baroness asked why the code covers only public authorities such
as the police and local authorities, and some other enforcement
agencies that are listed in the order. The list of relevant authorities
is set out in the Protection of Freedoms Act, which was debated and
approved by Parliament. Therefore, Parliament agreed that the project
should begin on a limited basis, effectively covering local authorities
and the police. The fact that it is limited in this way does not arise
out of this order or the code of practice, but was in the original Act
that was passed by Parliament. The code will be mandatory for only a
relatively small proportion of CCTV cameras but we believe that it is
right and proportionate for others to be encouraged to adopt the code
because it is in their interests rather than to be obliged to at this
stage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073033000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073033000098">The
noble Baroness asked what proportion of CCTV cameras will be covered by
the code. Although it will be small to start with, because it will be
limited to the police and local authorities, the Government believe
that all cameras operating in the public space owned by public bodies
should be used openly, transparently and effectively, in line with the
code. The Surveillance Camera Commissioner will review the
implementation of the code, including its take-up by private bodies,
and report to the Home Secretary and Parliament in 2015. Indeed, we
expect the police and local authorities to be able to demonstrate the
benefits of the code and to help raise awareness of it among those who
would voluntarily adopt
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073033000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073033000099">The noble
Baroness asked about costs. The Government believe that the costs of
implementing the code are minimal. As she said, the costs cited in the
impact assessment are estimated at £1.6 million per year across
350 local authorities; in other words,  about £2,000 per
year per local authority and £23,000 per year per police force.
These costs are minimal in 
<?notus-xml column=1716?>comparison to the budgets of these bodies. They are also average costs
and will vary depending on the size and nature of the locality. The
noble Baroness asked about how costs might vary from force to force and
authority to authority. I do not have those details at this time but,
as the impact assessment makes clear, we have based the costs per
authority and per force on an average that has been acknowledged by the
LGA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073033000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-0002.htm#13073033000100">We think
that these modest costs are worth while in terms of the expected
benefits that they will bring of better quality images to help
investigate crime and bring criminals to justice, and greater public
confidence. It might be worth me referring to a recent incident to do
with the use of automatic number plate recognition in Royston in order
to illustrate the benefits of the code and how the relationship between
the Information Commissioner and the new Surveillance Camera
Commissioner might work. Earlier this month, the Information
Commissioner issued an enforcement notice against Hertfordshire
Constabulary and its use of automatic number plate recognition. The ICO
has ordered the force to review its use of ANPR cameras around Royston.
It says that it has created a ring of steel that means no one can drive
their car in or out without a record being kept. Although this predates
this code, the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice will provide
guidance for the police and others and enable the public to hold them
directly to account for the proportionality and effectiveness of ANPR
and CCTV<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T16:10:27"></hs_TimeCode>. We

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> Yes, the order is necessary. The
reason I used that example to illustrate the point is that the
Information Commissioner retains all his enforcement responsibilities
regarding the Data Protection Act, both in respect of ANPR and CCTV.
The point I was going to make is that the relationship between the
Surveillance Camera Commissioner and the Information Commissioner has
been set out in a memorandum of understanding. If there were any issue
around enforcement in the use of data protection, which was the example
that I gave from Royston, then enforcement would remain the
responsibility of the

code is to go further than enforcement. It is about ensuring that CCTV
cameras, which make an important contribution to helping to cut crime,
are used in the most effective way. It is about ensuring that the
public can have confidence in the way in which cameras are deployed and
can see that, in times of reduced budgets and competing priorities,

raised points about enforcement and judicial review. In terms of
enforcement, the Information Commissioner retains his responsibility.
The code itself is self-regulating. We did not want to bring in this
code and introduce additional burdens unnecessarily on local
authorities or on police forces. We wanted the code to ensure good
practice and that the best use possible was made of CCTV. The
Surveillance Camera Commissioner will be required to provide an annual
report to the Home Office and that will be laid before Parliament. He
will be able, through his transparent way of monitoring performance, to

operate in the same way as in any other context. A judicial review can

designed to provide an opportunity to discuss an element of the Bill
which has not had much attention so far, and that is the financial
investment enabling investment contracts. Our amendment would provide a
sunset clause to this aspect of the Bill such that it would no longer
be part of the mix of policy two years following the legislation being
given Royal Assent. We have tabled this as a probing amendment because
we wanted to give the Minister an opportunity to provide some
background information and clarity on the thinking behind the
investment contracts element. When the draft Bill emerged, it was clear
that quite a high degree of emphasis was being placed on a provision to
enable the Secretary of State to enter into contracts for difference
with investors ahead of all the detail of the Bill being worked
through. The most significant difference is that this would be a
contract between the Secretary of State and a party who wished to
develop low-carbon electricity, not an enabling counterbody. The
rationale was that such a counterbody would not be in existence, so it
would be a direct contract with the Secretary of
State<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T12:02:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

there has been considerable interest in these FID-enabling contracts.
We were grateful to receive information from the department about the
number of applications that have been submitted to date in relation to
this element of the Bill, which now total 57. I note that that is just
the number of applications that have come from renewable energy. The
table we have been given does not indicate the level of interest 
<?notus-xml column=626?>that has been expressed by CCS or nuclear. Obviously the FID-enabling
process is there for all technologies and yet the supporting literature
and table show that while we have a lot of information about the
renewables aspect, very little is supplied in relation to the other two
major categories of low-carbon electricity. Can the Minister provide a
bit of background information in relation to those nuclear and CCS
projects which may have expressed an interest? Have there been any? If
so, how many, and at what level of gigawatts? That information would be
very useful and it is pertinent to the discussions around investment

that the FID-enabling contracts were necessary in order to prevent a
hiatus in investment, but that is the least of the problems with regard
to the renewables. Renewables have an existing support mechanism and we
have already discussed in Committee the transitional arrangements that
are in place for that. We have some concerns, but in general there is a
transfer and crossover period for renewables that is clear. However,
CCS and nuclear will be embarking on a completely new policy of
support; I would have thought that those are the projects which need
early sight of and access to the contracts, yet we are not being given
much detail at all. That strikes me as odd. Perhaps the Minister can
give the Committee an update on where we are in relation to being able
to arrive at strike prices for those two technologies. It is important
that the strike prices are subject to parliamentary scrutiny. We have
been given an awful lot of information about renewables, but not about
the other two
technologies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073028000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073028000007">It
will be increasingly important to treat these three diverse groups of
technologies as similarly as we can, given that that is how we will be
able to argue that our measures are subject to competition and to
comparisons that will enable the least cost and the most sensible
decisions. I am sure that that will be of great interest to state aid
discussions. One of the main rationales for EMR intervention in the
first place was that we were seeking to treat low-carbon electricity
providers equally, yet still we seem to be proceeding in a fairly
unequal way, with renewables being treated separately from CCS and
nuclear. There is a great dearth of information on CCS and
nuclear.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073028000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073028000008">The
state aid question is important, of course, for this section of the
Bill. The rationale is that these investment contracts can be signed. I
note with interest that the latest investment contract allocation
update from the department says that they will not be signed until
March 2014. Previous timetables implied that that would happen in
autumn this year and that they would be subject still to state aid
clearance. I struggle to see how this whole jigsaw will fit together.
How will the investment contracts be able to be assessed for state aid
if the remainder of the Bill is not yet worked through? Is it realistic
to think that by March 2014 the Secretary of State will enter into
contracts before the Bill has been approved or signed off in its
detail?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073028000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073028000009">As I
have said, this is a probing amendment. It is specifically designed to
try to elucidate more information in relation to these contracts. I
note that it seems to have gone very quiet on the negotiating front
with  
<?notus-xml column=627?>EDF. I saw today that in a 17-page press release, EDF found no space to
mention Hinkley Point in the update on its results. I do not want to be
overly pessimistic; however, if this is a really serious negotiation
that is of material interest to its investors and people interested in
its company, it seems odd that there was no mention of Hinkley Point.
Perhaps I may end by asking that we have as much of an update as the

provisions in the Bill are already time-limited. The Secretary of State
can only enter into investment contracts on or before 31 December 2015.
However, the remaining provisions set out in Schedule 2 cannot be
time-limited, as they provide the Secretary of State with the necessary
powers to administer and make payments under investment contracts in
the unlikely event that the enduring EMR regime is substantially
delayed or does not come into force at all. In the main, the powers
mirror those in Chapter 2 of the Bill on contracts for

made under an investment contract, it is likely that they would need to
be made for considerably longer than two years, potentially for the
duration of the contract. The effect of time-limiting the investment
contract provisions through this amendment would be that developers
would not have the confidence to take final investment decisions on
much needed low-carbon generation projects that might otherwise be
delayed or cancelled, as there would no longer be a means to make
payments under the contracts. The amendment would therefore negate the
purpose of these powers and risk creating the investment hiatus that
they are intended to address.</hs_para>

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 55ALB is largely an attempt to
get greater clarity than we got on, I think, the second day in
Committee about the way in which the Bill as a whole applies to
Northern Ireland. There is also the particular question of why Northern
Ireland is referred to here in relation to investment contracts with
the Northern Ireland generator, and whether that actually means
generation in Northern Ireland into Great Britain. At the moment, the
whole balance of interconnection is into Northern Ireland, with both
the gas pipeline and the electricity line, and there is a separate
issue between Northern Ireland and the
Republic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073028000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073028000022">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T12:15:52"></hs_TimeCode>
I have said before, Northern Ireland has a very different energy market
structure. It has a dominant supplier and a different systems operator,
which is in part owned by interests in the Irish Republic. There is a
wholesale electricity market that is jointly operated with the Irish
Republic. The consumer regulator works on very different precepts than
Ofgem, in that it is still, essentially, a price-regulation process.
Finally, of course, consumers there face different problems and higher
prices. I suppose I should declare a slight interest and an affinity in
that I have done some work for the Consumer Council in Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T12:16:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073028000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073028000023">I
have never quite understood how contracts for difference apply in
Northern Ireland within that structure. I can see that capacity
payments might apply, because the history relates to what they used to
call availability contracts in Northern Ireland and the island of
Ireland as a whole, which were quite expensive to consumers and
business in Northern Ireland. However, I do not really see how
investment contracts apply in Northern Ireland, particularly if they
are ongoing—in reply to my noble friend just now, we are not in
favour of putting an end date on the period in which investment
contracts are issued. Rather than go into vast detail on this last day
in Committee, I simply ask whether the Minister could contrive with her
department, possibly in conjunction with DETI in Northern Ireland, to
produce a paper that would indicate to us, before we reach Report, just
how this operates in Northern Ireland. I am still bemused and suspect
that those who have even less familiarity with the situation in
Northern Ireland are even more bemused. There are references to
Northern Ireland all the
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T12:18:00"></hs_TimeCode> through the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073028000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073028000024">There is
one other particular point in this amendment, which was raised, if I
remember rightly, by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, in an earlier
debate. There are references to the department rather than to the
Minister, whereas for the other devolved Administrations, there are
references to the Minister. That sounded on the face of it to be a bit
of a hangover from direct rule, 
<?notus-xml column=630?>and an explanation would be helpful on that front. Northern Ireland is
distinct from Scotland and Wales in this regard because energy is a
devolved matter in Northern Ireland. However, this provision appears,
in one sense, to provide for the possibility—not necessarily the
absolute certainty—of the schemes that we are devolving in vast
detail for Great Britain being applied in Northern Ireland. If it only
relates to the possibility of Northern Ireland supplying some
electricity into the GB grid, that is a slightly different and probably
unlikely matter. The Minister can probably answer this point fairly
succinctly. If she is prepared to let me have a note over the summer
that could be circulated to the other Members of the Committee,
explaining how this applies to Northern Ireland—one which she
has agreed with her Northern Ireland counterpart—I will say no
more about it. I beg to move.</hs_para>

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for those comments
and look forward to receiving a letter from her. However, what I am
really looking for is something which explains how we envisage CFDs
applying in the very different market in Northern Ireland in the same
way as they apply in the market in Great Britain. I am sure that all
the political niceties have been followed but I still do not see how
the pattern is replicated within Northern Ireland. I can see that it
can be replicated in terms of the possibility of Northern Ireland
supplying energy to the GB grid, but that is a separate matter. Given
all the complications of the very different Northern Ireland structure,
including the all-Ireland complications, I still find it difficult to
see how this measure applies. Therefore, something a bit more than a
letter will probably be needed to convince the Northern Ireland
authorities that they should go down this road. There must be something
which sets out how the measure applies within Northern Ireland, even if
it is a fairly technical background note which hardly anybody
understands, or hardly anybody over here understands. Other documents
of that nature have been floating around. It would be useful to have it

what the Minister said and I will not press that point. It just looks
slightly odd when we refer to Scottish and Welsh Ministers but to
Northern Ireland departments. Again, that is a presentational matter,
which perhaps the Minister will have another look at. It is not central
to my question, which is: how do these three new forms of supply
contract apply in a very different market? For example, is there to be
a separate counterparty, or is it the same counterparty we are talking
about? If it is the same counterparty organisation, how does that

part of the provisions on investment contracts, but some of this reads
across to other parts of the Bill. My amendment essentially would limit
the exclusions in the information that the Minister will provide on the
contracts and the transparency that they provide to Parliament. It
would restrict it to trade secrets, which is provided for in Schedule

tried to find a definition of a “trade secret”. It
apparently relates to anything which has not been disclosed to the
public and which is of benefit to the holder of that secret. It is
normally enforced by the confidentiality rules, which include
commercial in confidence. In that case, surely sub-paragraph (3)(c),
which deals with commercial in confidence, and sub-paragraph (3)(d),
which deals with breaches of confidence that are actionable, fall under
the paragraph dealing with trade secrets. If not, the suspicion has to
be that the Secretary of State, by his or her subjective judgment,
could exclude a whole range of other information that was pertinent to
an understanding, by Parliament or by the public in general, of what
are going to be pretty complex contracts. If we get a contract that is
public and available to Parliament but heavily redacted because the
Secretary of State thinks that in some direct or indirect way there
might be a breach of commercial confidentiality of somebody who is not
only not party to the agreement but not directly relevant to the
agreement—or, indeed, any person—what does the Minister
think, if I may boil it down to this, is covered by sub-paragraphs
(3)(c) and (3)(d) which is not already covered by sub-paragraph (3)(b)?
If other kinds of material are covered, we either need to be much
tighter on the exclusions or spell out precisely what kinds of
information could be legitimately redacted from any disclosure of the
contracts.</hs_para>

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for
his amendment. The Government are fully committed to ensuring
transparency of investment contracts. The existing provisions are clear
that in order for a contract to become an investment contract it must
be laid before Parliament and published in order to benefit from the
powers in the Bill. In addition to the contract itself, the Bill
requires that the Secretary of State makes a Statement to Parliament
that he considers that the contract would encourage low-carbon
generation; and that without the contract, there is a significant risk
that the electricity generation would not be built or would be
significantly delayed. The Statement must also summarise the regard
that the Secretary of State has had to the impact on energy security,
decarbonisation, affordability and the renewables directive
targets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073028000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073028000039">For
the Hinkley Point C investment contract, the Government have already
committed to publishing a summary of the reports from external advisers
and the value-for-money appraisal of any contract agreed. With these
provisions, we are trying to achieve a delicate balancing act between
making available as much information about the contract as possible,
while at the same time allowing commercially sensitive information to
be withheld from publication. It would not be appropriate to publish
this information if it would risk significantly damaging the
developer’s commercial interests. However, it is crucial that
the developer can provide such information to enable us to be confident
that the contract represents good value for money for the
consumer.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073028000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073028000040">I
believe that the current wording of the Bill strikes this balance
appropriately. The information that can be withheld from publication,
as the noble Lord said, is information that is a trade secret, would
prejudice a person’s commercial interests and would constitute a
breach of confidence. The key commercial information—the strike
price and the reference price—cannot be withheld from
publication. While the Bill was being discussed in the other place, the
Government identified two areas where we are able to further improve
transparency of investment contracts.</hs_para>

alongside the investment contract that is laid before Parliament, the
Government will also publish a description of the information that has
been withheld, and the reason for doing so. Secondly, we removed the
Secretary of State’s discretion to withhold information from the
contract after it has been agreed but before it has been laid before
Parliament. This means that any confidential information will 
<?notus-xml column=634?>have to be clearly identified as such during contract development,
and there is no further discretion to withhold
information once the contract is concluded. These commitments and
legislative improvements ensure that there will be transparency in
investment contracts, and that only the most sensitive information will
be withheld from publication.</hs_para>

Whitty, asked why the Government resisted amendments to the Bill to
restrict the definition of confidential information to information that
is a trade secret. The Government’s intention is to publish as
much information on investment contracts as possible. As I have already
laid out, the extra things that we committed to after the Commons
Report stage have now been put into the Bill. I hope that the noble
Lord is reassured by the explanation that I have given and will
withdraw the

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I am reassured only to a limited extent.
I thank the Minister particularly for her reference to the fact that
one has to identify what is going to be commercially confidential early
in the process and that one cannot change that at a later stage. That
was a reflection of a discussion in the
Commons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T12:35:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to me that sub-paragraphs (3)(c) and (3)(d) are expressed in
extremely wide terms and I am still not clear what would constitute a
problem not already covered by trade secrets, particularly under
sub-paragraph (3)(c). Without being a total conspiracy theorist, one
must recognise what lies behind the anxiety here. I shall have to
choose my words carefully because, as the noble Baroness has said, we
are in negotiations over one nuclear contract. However, people believe,
particularly in relation to nuclear power, that historically things
have been agreed by Governments over and above what has been disclosed
publicly. Some of that is related to state security but some is related
to regulation planning permission and other payments. In other words,
there is a suspicion that in order to gain a commitment for a contract
for difference it is conceivable that the strike price is not the only
commitment that the Government make and that there may be other
commitments. If that were to be a suspicion which the Government would
find it difficult to counter, they could find themselves in a difficult
public relations situation further down the line.</hs_para>

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may try to further reassure the
noble Lord that the reason why certain parts of the information will be
trade secrets is, for example, when allowing the future actions of a
company, such as in relation to a potential financing structure.

are always commercially sensitive—rather than anything

a danger for the

signed, particularly in the nuclear industry. If there is any feeling
that something has not been disclosed, future Governments may well
suffer from it. I thank the Minister for the reassurances that she has

make a few more but, for the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the

the recommendations of your Lordships’ Delegated Powers
Committee. Noble Lords will forgive the slight sense of
déjà vu with which we return to this subject but, as the
Delegated Powers Committee highlighted, the scale and nature of the
extensive powers this Bill affords to the Secretary of State are vast.
That these powers are subject to annulment only and could require no
parliamentary approval seems completely inappropriate in the most part.
This amendment also extends the provision for parliamentary approval to
the CFD counterparty as well as enforcement provisions and the
oversight of consultations. When commenting on this section of the
Bill, the Delegated Powers Committee notes that much of the provision
for investment contracts mirror those that will implement the CFDs in
Schedule 2. Therefore its recommendation is the same.</hs_para>

amendment would slightly change the current wording of the clause that
allows for the Secretary of State to determine the kind of appropriate
measures needed to ensure that there is no conflict of interest between
National Grid’s commercial enterprises and the role that it has
been given under the EMR. I am sure that our amendment is not perfectly
worded—it is a probing amendment intended to clarify that this
should not be a question of discretion. The current wording makes it
clear that the Secretary of State has a certain degree of discretion in
deciding whether it would be “necessary or desirable”.
That seems slightly too broad. We have tried to encapsulate in our
amendment the idea that sufficiency is the important aspect, not
desirability, and that there should be absolutely no question but that
action will be taken to eliminate conflicts of interest between
National Grid’s commercial enterprises and activities and its
EMR
role.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000003">Along<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T12:47:40"></hs_TimeCode>
with, I am sure, many other noble Lords, we received a briefing from
National Grid on this issue. We obviously recognise and take note of
the many measures that National Grid has already put in place to manage
conflicts of interest in other parts of its business and its very
strong undertaking to continue to operate in a way that has no
conflicts of interest. We do not mean to question National
Grid’s desires or motives and are sure that it does indeed seek
to work in such a way that it has no conflicts of interest—our
concern is with the legal basis for the interventions that the
Secretary of State will undertake to ensure
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000004">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T12:49:53"></hs_TimeCode>
is worth considering that the Utilities Act 2000 and the Electricity
Act 1989 built in certain provisions that prohibit National Grid from
undertaking certain activities. For example, it is not allowed to
disclose to a third party any information about individuals or
businesses that it receives by virtue of their transmission licence
activities. That seems to be the kind of quite tightly drawn provision
that might need to be updated in the context of the EMR. Clearly,
National Grid will receive information from third parties in relation
to the functions that it will carry out under the EMR. It is the body
that will be tasked by the Government with signing the investment
contracts and the CFDs, which will give it 
<?notus-xml column=638?>access to information that it would not otherwise receive. I just
question whether the provision created under the Utilities Act needs
updating to ensure that it applies to not just the transition licence
but the new role in the
EMR.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000005">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T12:49:20"></hs_TimeCode>
is an example of why we need to get this right and make sure that we
have thought of every angle. We should not create a framework in which
the Secretary of State can determine whether something is necessary or
desirable. It is the word “desirable” that gives us
slight cause for concern. We think the actual criteria should be that
it is “sufficient” and would like to see explicit mention
that there should be no conflict of interest between the system

matter of conflicts of interest that arise between National

the findings of that joint work with Ofgem, together with our analysis,

a lengthy procedure or encumbrance that would prevent us benefiting
from the expertise of National Grid. On the contrary, we were trying to
give National Grid cover and protection by ensuring that we remove the
discretion that is currently in the Bill. It comes down to
another  example of creating enabling powers that can
be  broadly interpreted. Obviously, we all trust that future
Governments and Ministers will have the best interests of everyone at

which strikes at the heart of what National Grid does. The Committee
already knows this, but we currently have two parallel solutions for
capacity: the capacity mechanism as proposed in the Bill, which will
not come into force until 2018-19, and in the interim period we have
National Grid consulting on interim measures, apparently under its own
licence initiatives and powers, to address what it considers to be a
short-term concern about capacity markets. That already seems to be

the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, who very much regrets that he cannot be
here today, and therefore I shall speak to it. He asked me first of all
to make it clear that he is not personally involved in any microhydro
scheme although in the west country where he comes from, and elsewhere
in our countryside, a growing number of families and individuals are
trying to make the best use of our many rivers, old mill leats and mill
houses to create small amounts of renewable power both for themselves
and their communities. Therefore, it seems odd that one part of
government, DECC, should arrange a subsidy to encourage such investment
through feed-in tariffs and ROCs, while another part of government, the
Treasury, through the Valuation Office Agency, seeks to remove part of
that
subsidy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000022">The
noble Lord, Lord Cameron, has set out nine reasons why microhydro
should not be assessed for business rates and, with the
Committee’s indulgence, I shall quickly go through them.
Domestic hydro sites may be located on rivers that are able to provide
much more power than the owners require for their own consumption. It
is obviously in the interests of the nation that domestic owners be
encouraged to generate as much power as their sites are able to provide
and consume as little of their output as necessary, otherwise the
potential benefit of their hydro plants’ contribution to the
grid and the community as a whole is
diminished.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000023">Domestic
owners do not want the complication of their residential property being
designated as a business. There is already clear evidence of gaming
around the capacity bands chosen for the feed-in tariff, and some
owner-operators will perhaps downsize the scale of their investment to
avoid non-domestic rates being levied, which, again, cannot be in the
interest of the nation as a
whole.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000024">The

assumptions. Indeed, its rating model and the DCLG legislation on
non-domestic rates are insensitive to yearly variations in the weather.
For example, the output from the run-of-river site may vary by more
than 40% from one year to the next, depending on rainfall. There are no
operating costs that an owner-occupier can cut to offset the
consequential losses in revenue.</hs_para>

will be reflected in the income of the owner and taxed accordingly,
taking into account capital allowances for this very long-term
investment. The approach of the Valuation Office Agency to calculating
rateable value does not allow for the repayment of loans or the cost of
borrowing and assumes that funding will be through equity, which, in
the view of the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, is a ridiculous assumption
for domestic microhydro. Non-domestic rates have been applied
retrospectively, creating havoc and uncertainty for a number of
domestic-scale financing plans. Indeed, according to evidence supplied
by DECC, no allowance was made for non-domestic rates when the state
subsidies were originally
established.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000026">A
further example of the inflexibility of non-domestic rates means that
when the subsidy ends, the drastic reduction in revenue—a
reduction of 40% in the case of the renewables obligation and 75% for
the feed-in tariff—will not be acknowledged or included in the
calculations for rateable value until the five-yearly antecedent
valuation date arrives. It will then be another two years before the
adjusted rateable value comes into operation. Clearly, these two
systems are incompatible. It is also worth pointing out that no other
domestic renewables, for example photovoltaic solar panels, are charged
business rates on the amount of power they export. This is a strange
anomaly, and the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, was right to bring an
amendment in these terms to the Committee. I look forward to hearing
the response of my noble friend the

addition to the reasons which have been so clearly enunciated, I would
like to inject into the discussion the issue of culture, because much
of what we are about in energy policy in this country is working on a
change of culture. It has become a fashionable word. The Second Reading
of the Financial Services Bill was all about changing the culture of
banking and financial services, and that is absolutely right. However,
the same applies in the energy realm. The sort of installations that we
are talking about are relatively small in themselves but speak more
widely.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000029">I will
digress very slightly to a non-domestic instance. In Chester in the
1920s, the tram system was powered by a small hydroelectric plant on
the River Dee. The University of Chester, where I am president of the
council, is in the process of bringing that hydroelectric plant back
into operation, partly to satisfy its obligations to HEFCE
vis-à-vis its green credentials but also as a very reasonable
project in itself. it will have a cultural impact in Chester quite
beyond the actual electricity component of the project, and I think
that the same will apply in the circumstances we are
discussing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000030">There
is something about hydroelectric power that goes with the grain of the
countryside and nature rather better than windmills and some of the
other things we are doing. We should do more to encourage local use of
natural resources. If the projections about 
<?notus-xml column=643?>future rainfall are right, there will be even more rain flowing into our
rivers to power these microhydro projects. Although I cannot comment on
the precise terms of the amendment, it seems to me that the spirit of
it is absolutely right at the present

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> I rise stimulated by the right
reverend Prelate’s remarks, partly because when hydropower
developments took place in Scotland, the nature of the opposition to
them was very similar to the nature of the opposition to wind turbines
today. Indeed, if you read any of the histories of hydropower in
Scotland, you find the same arguments and the same kind of
protagonists. Indeed, as I recall, one of the supporters of hydropower
in the 1930s was expelled from the Perthshire hunt on the grounds that
they were going to deface Pitlochry. Anybody who knows Scotland will
know that Pitlochry is a great tourist attraction on the way up to
Inverness and that the jewel in the crown of Pitlochry is the
hydroelectric dam and the salmon leap there. If anyone were now to try
to say that they wanted to close it down because it is spoiling the
countryside, they would get rather a lot of fleas in their ears from
the kind of people who say that they want to have hydropower but not
wind power. That has to be taken into
account.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000032">Hydropower
is one of the most attractive forms of generation. It is also
interesting that subsidies for refurbishment have been made available
to small-scale hydro, which may well be the case in Chester as well as
in Deeside in Scotland. I had the opportunity of visiting one site some
years ago because the kit had been refurbished in my constituency by
the Weir Group of Alloa. The output had been increased from
70 megawatts of power to 81 megawatts, which was a
considerable achievement. This is far smaller, but we can bring into
play hydro opportunities that have perhaps fallen into disuse. It would
be better if they can get the best possible deal because river
flow—drought notwithstanding—tends to be pretty reliable.
One would imagine that this, out of all the renewables, would be less
prone to interruptibility and that therefore an amendment of this
nature seeking to give a bit of extra assistance would be extremely
helpful at this time. I support the

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Roper, and other
speakers have made a very good case for looking at what the noble Lord
says is an apparent contradiction, but I think is a clear
contradiction, between the approach of the Valuation Office Agency and
DECC to these things. We are talking about schemes that are very
different from Pitlochry or whatever. We talking below 1.2 megawatts,
but even at that level, I have some hesitation. If you were doing it
for domestic purposes only, it is unlikely that you would get huge
benefit in terms of your energy bill or your carbon footprint or that
climate change would benefit any more than from putting a windmill on
the side of your house in Notting Hill. It is not for domestic
purposes. The way in which it is financed feeds into the grid and it
therefore becomes a business. It is not entirely illogical for the
business rates people in the Valuation Office Agency to take that into
account, 
<?notus-xml column=644?>although the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Roper, about this being
treated differently from  other forms of renewable energy is an
issue. I wish  this amendment godspeed in terms of looking at
the
contradiction.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13073032000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000091">1.15

make one other point. It appears to be an attractive and
environmentally sensitive technology that makes use of the flow and
drop of the river, but you have to bypass the river and therefore take
some water out of it. By definition, you will probably take some fish
out of the river and alter its ecosystem. I am reflecting, I suppose,
on my experiences as a member of the board of the Environment Agency,
where this became a hugely controversial issue because of the views of
the nature conservancy people and the angling community in particular,
who it is unwise entirely to ignore.</hs_para>

important for anyone thinking of investing in and installing one of
these mini or microhydro systems to not only rationalise it in order to
benefit from the FITs that attach to it but to not thereby bypass the
other planning and environmental restrictions. It affects the water as
well as other people’s interests. I know that the whole
permitting process in this area is quite complex and I would not want
the deletion of a requirement to regard it as a non-business premises
to bring with it exclusion from those other environmental regulations
and planning considerations. Apart from that, the Government have a
case to answer in terms of the contradiction between the two different
approaches here, as the noble Lord, Lord Roper,

rates, otherwise known as business rates, are a tax on properties that
are not domestic and capable of beneficial occupation. Most onshore
renewable generating power stations, such as hydro or wind plants, are
non-domestic properties and, therefore, liable for business rates. The
amendment would give a tax break from business rates for hydro plants
with a capacity of 1.25 megawatts or less, provided they were on the
operator’s domestic premises. It would mean that two otherwise
similar plants would be treated differently for tax purposes merely
because one was located next to the owner’s house. I do not
think that that would be a fair outcome for this sector.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13073032000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000038">The amendment raises
some good questions about when plants at domestic properties should be
assessed for business rates. I hope that on that point I can offer the
noble Lord some assurances that the business rates system operates
fairly. The rating list is maintained by the Valuation Office Agency,
which is responsible  for deciding when an installation should
be assessed for business rates and for assessing its rateable value. In
this regard, the Valuation Office Agency acts independently of
Ministers, and we cannot therefore 
<?notus-xml column=645?>intervene in its decisions. However, we are aware that during 2010-11
the VOA undertook a review of hydro projects to ensure that all
facilities that should be considered non-domestic were assessed for
business rates. In some cases, these installations were located in the
grounds of what would otherwise have been domestic premises.
Where a hydro facility is considered to be domestic—for example
all installations under 10 kilowatts—it is included
in the council tax assessment of the house. Larger installations may
also be considered domestic if the output of the plant is being used to
provide power to the living accommodation. However, other projects
where the output is being sold to the grid are assessed separately for
business rates. This means that the smallest domestic hydro projects,
which in the main are used only to provide power to the owner’s
home, are not caught by the business rates system. Only those larger
projects, where more power is exported and sold to the grid, are
assessed for business rates.</hs_para>

larger hydro projects, I can assure my noble friend that the Valuation
Office Agency’s model has been adopted specifically to deal with
the lack of direct rental evidence. Renewable energy plants, such as
wind farms, hydro schemes, PV installations and anaerobic digesters are
assessed using a receipts and expenditure method of valuation. This is
because the value of such properties is very closely related to their
trading position and their ability to make profits. The costs of
generating power at an electricity generator and the earnings from the
sale of that power are tangible evidence of assumed rental value. The
model is also based on a fair and maintainable forward projection of
output averaged over a number of years, and the figures used are
derived from actual outputs received from occupiers. Additionally, a
ceiling level of output equivalent to a 40% load factor has been
applied to the model, even though some schemes generate at well in
excess of this level. The model also allows for borrowing costs and is
consistent with the general application of receipts and expenditure
valuations. I hope that the noble Lord agrees that this is a fair
approach to drawing the line for this tax and that it ensures
consistency across the sector.</hs_para>

that more than 500,000 businesses in England benefit from the small
business rate relief scheme, and about a third of a million of them pay
no rates at all. We anticipate that many domestically based hydro
schemes will benefit from the small business rate relief scheme,
providing the owner does not operate any other non-domestic premises.
We have also given authorities powers to provide their own discounts,
which they can use to provide further support for hydro projects.
Should they do so, central government would meet 50% of the costs. In
addition, the Government’s feed-in tariff scheme supports the
deployment of hydro, and as the noble Lord will recall from earlier in
our proceedings, we are planning to extend the scheme to 10 megawatts
for community
projects.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000041">I

sorting out and taking a much more robust approach to food waste. This
arises within the context of a much broader issue. Worldwide, some 30%
of all the food that is produced is lost between the field and the end
consumer. In developed countries, it is mainly around wastage because
we do not use our refrigerated produce quickly enough or we buy more
than we need and throw it away. In non-developed countries, it is
around the failure of the supply chain so that food is wasted, lost or
defiled as it is distributed. We have one last chance to make up for
what we have wasted at the end of the food chain by using it to produce
energy and other materials. The amendment seeks to guide the United
Kingdom more in that direction.</hs_para>

benefit here. First, renewable energy is produced and, secondly, the
cost of landfill is substantially reduced. It has been estimated that
landfill worth some half a billion pounds would be saved if we managed
to treat all our food waste in this way. I shall come on to some of the
practical experiences seen in parts of the UK and elsewhere in the
world on food waste strategies, but let me go through the
practicalities briefly. The amendment does not provide that this should
happen immediately. It understands clearly that there is a timeframe
and there must be a proper strategy which is worked through in a
practical fashion during the following years. Having said that, we know
that recycling works and that people are able and willing to sort their
rubbish in different ways. In fact, food waste is already being
segregated and taken away in a number of different areas.</hs_para>

collection service is available to 88% of households. The technology is
already in place and well proven, particularly in anaerobic digestion.
A quite staggering estimate is that in Wales some £420-worth of
food is wasted by each family every year, and I suspect that the figure
is exactly the same for the rest of the UK. It represents food that has
already been bought but is thrown away. It is much better to reduce
such wastage first of all, but if that cannot be done, we need at least
to use it later. In London, 23 out of 33 boroughs provide some sort of
food waste collection. Fifteen boroughs are very adept at it and do
well, but 10 still do not manage to undertake any food waste collection
at all. It has also been estimated that if the whole of London managed
to segregate and reuse its food waste, that would avoid some 900,000
tonnes of landfill which would save 400,000 tonnes of CO<Sub>2</Sub>
emissions and reduce landfill costs by £9 million. Again, that
demonstrates the multifaceted benefits of doing this. This is strongly
promoted elsewhere in Europe, particularly in Austria, Sweden, Germany
and the Netherlands, as well as in a number of municipalities in north
America.</hs_para>

there to lose? It is slightly more difficult because we have to make
sure that households can segregate their food waste more easily. A
number of households, of which mine is one, are deeply into composting
so that uncooked food waste is used in the garden. I have become a real
convert to composting over the past couple of years. However, we would
win in many ways. We would see a major reduction in the cost of
landfill. There would be a substantial source of renewable energy. I
think that some 3% of our greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to
methane, which is one of the most powerful greenhouse gases. We could
really get our anaerobic digestion industry going, we would have
landfill reductions and methane reductions and at the end of the
process we would have a fantastic compostable material that can be used
in gardens and on agricultural land to make sure that every aspect of
the technology is used. I beg to move.</hs_para>

to the market for independent generators. Last week, we heard that
while the rest of the economy showed meagre but welcome signs of
growth, green growth in 2011-12 was 4.8%, thereby outstripping almost
every other part of the economy. It bears saying again that investment
in emerging technologies, such as biogas, that will provide the engine

level of deployment? The Government set themselves no specific targets
for regional adoption of AD; however, they aim to remove unnecessary
obstacles to its development. Given the Combined Heat and Power
Association’s concerns about the ability of decentralised energy

course to meet that. An EU review of those targets is under way as part
of a wider review of EU waste policy and legislation. I must stress
that the outcome of the EU review will not be known until mid-2014, but
there is a possibility that the European Commission will propose

preventing food waste is the most effective approach in carbon-saving
terms, compared to landfilling. Each tonne of food waste prevented

Stephen:</Member></B> My Lords, I refer to my entry in the register.
Amendment 55D is tabled in my name and that of my noble friend Lord
Teverson. When I was the Minister responsible for energy in Scotland
and, in particular, for renewable energy, the Scottish Government set
some very ambitious targets to increase renewable generation and
decrease reliance on fossil fuels. I used to give speeches saying that
100% of Scotland’s electricity should come from renewables. I
got challenged on this quite substantially from certain sources. One of
the big challenges was intermittency. People said that it was okay if
renewables were 10%, 15% or 20% of what we were generating, but if it
went higher than that and into base load territory, it would be a
disaster as renewables could not be relied upon and could not be a
secure source for future energy supply. When you adopt that line of
argument, what happens when fossil fuels become extremely expensive or
substantially start to run out, I do not know, but there are plenty of
people, some of whom we have seen in this Room over the past few weeks,
who are quite prepared to put that to one side and hope for the
best.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13073032000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000093">1.45

that and instead of backing off or changing my mind, I now realise I
was being too timid. We have to start tackling, in a substantial way,
not only electricity 
<?notus-xml column=652?>generation in this country but two other major areas of energy use in
all countries: transport and heating. Making major inroads into
reducing our reliance on fossil fuels for transport and heating will
require even more renewable energy and, almost certainly, even more
renewable electricity. One of the most important answers and, I would
argue, the most central one, is storage. I do not know what sort of
storage it will be but it will probably be big. At the moment it is
estimated that for every megawatt of storage you need a block roughly
the size of a London double-decker bus, though that may reduce over
time. Could we have storage the size of Peterhead power station in vast
buildings in centralised locations, or will it be much smaller-scale,
decentralised storage? There may be a need for both but if so we need
to get on with it. We need to develop our skills, technology and
experience in relation to storage. Will it be fuel cells or liquefied
air? Will more pumped storage be more environmentally acceptable in
this century? All of this and more—new technologies that have
not even been thought of or developed yet— will probably be
needed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000070">If we
are, through this Bill, helping to set down and create the energy
infrastructure for the century ahead, then storage is important. How
important is storage? For example, is it more important than carbon
capture and storage? I do not know but I guess it probably is. I do
know that people talk far, far more about carbon capture and storage
than about electricity storage. Is electricity storage crucial in the
same way as electricity demand reduction? I believe it is just as
important. Both carbon capture and demand reduction are being
encouraged or progressed and are specifically referred to in the Bill,
yet there is currently nothing, nil, zero on electricity
storage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000071">I am
not in any way disheartened by this. As we will all recall, when the
Bill was first published decarbonisation was not any part of it but it
is now, rightly, absolutely central to it. I am not seeking a whole new
Part 1 of the Bill for electricity storage but rather one short, simple
amendment introducing a new clause. In all of this, we are building on
what is already there and what is being done in other countries. For
years, we have had large-scale electricity storage in the United
Kingdom. We have already referred to hydroelectricity in Scotland and
Wales and some of that is in storage plants with  3 gigawatts
of pumped hydroelectricity. So we already have, in a different form,
quite a few London double-decker buses of stored electricity
capability. However, we have to do a lot more. I suspect that not many
in this room will know about the newer types of electricity storage.
There are large-scale batteries in Shetland, Orkney and Northumberland.
A new type of electricity storage based on liquid air is operating in
Slough, developed by Highview Power Storage, a UK company, and UK Power
Networks is due to start construction on a 6 megawatt electricity
storage project in Leighton Buzzard. That project is the biggest
battery in Europe, even at only 6 megawatts. The Japanese, in contrast,
are already developing a 34 megawatt battery to balance wind power, and
their proposals clearly dwarf ours at present. Interestingly, the
Leighton Buzzard project will illustrate how electricity storage defers
the upgrade of new power lines as well as providing essential 
<?notus-xml column=653?>balancing services to the National Grid and services to the local
community, so it is not all about renewable
energy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000072">We
will place more and more reliance on renewable generation, but the
output from both solar photovoltaic and wind generation is time
variable. Photovoltaic is the best example of that. This means that we
need a method to balance the output to make it useful for our
electricity system. There are suggestions that the problem could be
solved by more interconnectors and adding more flexible gas fire
generation through the capacity payments system, switching demand or
just averaging out the renewable generation over the whole country.
However, recent reports to DECC point out that interconnectors cannot
be relied on as a source for balancing services and demand response is
not a complete
solution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000073">Electricity
storage is a perfectly valid and achievable method to provide system
balancing. It can absorb and reject power and act as reserve capacity
to cover short or long-term interruptions. Through trading, it smoothes
prices and so reduces the overall system cost. By reducing the peak
demands on the system, it lowers the investment costs of our
distribution networks; by absorbing energy from our wind farms and PV
installations at times of low demand, storage lowers the carbon
intensity of our electricity industry. Electricity storage remains one
technology that does not receive support or any form of secure income
stream under the Energy Bill
proposals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000074">My
noble friend the Minister said recently in response to a question on
electricity storage from the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, that both
storage and demand-side response were eligible to participate in the
capacity market auctions. However, I am told that the capacity market
does not provide the right commercial framework for new build
electricity storage. I have been given reasons for that, although I
will not list them here—but one thing I can say with absolute
certainty is that the capacity market has not in any sense been
designed to support electricity storage, which is a technology with
high initial capital expenditure and low operating expenditure. Because
of the lack of the right signals, there are still not enough orders to
achieve economies of scale in terms of initial upfront capital cost and
the operating costs involved. All this could change if there was a
greater focus, new momentum and new
investment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000075">Financial
support is available in all other areas—and we are led to
believe that that includes tax breaks for fracking—giving lower
costs of capital for supported green tech projects at the expense of
increasing the cost of capital for electricity storage. Without a clear
revenue stream, higher costs of capital place financing costs out of
reach of most electricity storage projects. As I have said, our
competitors in Italy, Japan, Korea, Germany and the USA have recognised
the value of electricity storage. These countries are developing a
commercial structure in their electricity markets to recognise the
valuable role of electricity
storage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073032000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073032000076">The

enough. This can be either a storage system that can capture the power
of the primary installation when it is in excess of the current demand,
or it can be a means of importing power from a region where it happens
to be in surplus or from another power plant that can be deployed
rapidly to meet the deficit. The latter is currently the most common
recourse and the ancillary plant is likely, nowadays, to be an
open-cycle gas turbine
installation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000002">In
that case, given that the plant has a significant carbon footprint, it
is liable to subvert the virtue of emissions-free renewable generation.
For that reason, we ought seriously to consider other options. In fact,
it has been asserted that the upper limit of the proportion of a
nation’s electrical power that can reasonably be expected to be
supplied by intermittent renewable sources is about 20%. This figure is
well within the aspirations of the European Union energy directives.
The EU aims to get 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.
Whereas renewables include wind, solar, hydroelectric and tidal power
as well as geothermal energy and biomass, we imagine that the
preponderance of the power will be from wind
turbines.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000003">Let
us put aside the question of importing power from afar, which was
discussed yesterday in Grand Committee, in order to concentrate on the
matter of energy storage. There are two principal means of energy
storage that appear to have the greatest potential for development. The
first to be considered is a system of reservoirs and dams. At times of
low power demand, water can be pumped up to the reservoirs. When demand
peaks, it can be released and passed through turbine generators.
Approximately 70% to 85% of the electrical energy used to pump the
water into an elevated reservoir can be recovered, so this is an
efficient affair in terms of energy conservation. The technique, so far
at it has been pursued, has also proved to be a cost-effective means of
storing large amounts of energy, but high capital costs are entailed in
creating such facilities, and they depend on the existence of an
appropriate geography.</hs_para>

example of pumped storage in the UK is the Ffestiniog reservoir and dam
in north Wales. One of the largest facilities, which is also the least
visible, is in at Dinorwig, in north Wales, where a huge reservoir sits
in a hidden cusp in the mountain. There is currently a peak capacity in
pumped storage in the UK of around 2.8 gigawatts, which is about half
the installed capacity for wind-powered generation. There is potential
for an increase in capacity, albeit that the associated costs are
uncertain. The Department of Energy and Climate Change conducted a
hydropower resource assessment for England and Wales in 2010 but not,
it seems, for Scotland, and there is much that needs
clarifying.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000005">It
should be noted that, in the UK, the volatility of electricity demand
is greater than in any other country. The reason for this lies in the
electric kettles that satisfy the tea drinking urges of our citizens,
which are closely linked to the evening schedules of our television
programmes. Much of our pumped storage capacity is devoted to meeting
the resulting spikes in electricity demand and the reaction of the
system to the conditions of demand can be almost
instantaneous.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13073034000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000152">2

means of storage to consider is one  with a vast potential. It
is based on the production of hydrogen by the electrolysis of water,
which is most efficient if conducted at high temperature. The energy
efficiency of this chemical means of energy storage is low compared
with pumped storage, but I believe that, in its various forms, it
represents the best way forward. Currently, 48% of global hydrogen
production is from natural gas, 30% from oil and 18% from coal. Water
electrolysis accounts for only 4%. These facts reflect the
thermodynamic constraints and the consequent economic choices, which
are made within the context of the costs of the feed stocks and the
energy. The advent of hydrogen-based storage will, therefore, depend on
the availability of abundant supplies of energy and the rising costs of
hydrocarbons. I shall deal with the question of the supply of energy
later.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000007">There
are both direct and indirect uses of the energy stored in hydrogen. The
direct uses are in fuel cells and combustion engines. Fuels cells,
which nowadays represent a mature technology, pose high capital costs
and require a supply of hydrogen of the highest purity. It is probable
that combustion engines, both turbine engines and Otto cycle
engines—that is, pulsed combustion engines analogous to petrol
engines—will eventually
predominate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000008">Hydrogen
might also be used, as it has been in the past, to produce synthetic
fuels, either synthetic petroleum or so-called synthetic natural
gas—that is something of an oxymoron. These are ways of eking
out the supplies of hydrocarbons but, on their own, they do not
represent a way of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide. However, it is
possible to establish a closed cycle whereby methane could be
synthesised from carbon dioxide and hydrogen and burnt to produce water
and carbon dioxide. The cycle would be closed by recapturing the carbon
dioxide and using it to generate a further supply of methane.</hs_para>

fascinating technical opportunities, and we ought to be devoting
considerable resources to research and develop some of them. Two things
are clear. The first is the need for a strong governmental role in
research and development if the opportunities are to be grasped. The
second is that most of what is envisaged will require ample supplies of
energy. Renewable sources of energy can go only a small way towards
fulfilling the requirement. We shall need to resort to nuclear energy
to provide ample supplies of electricity and
hydrogen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Worthington" PimsId="5934" UID="13073034000161" xid="2144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000161">Baroness
Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment tabled in
the names of the noble Lords, Lord Stephen and Lord Teverson. It is an
excellent amendment, and had I been administratively competent enough,
I am sure we would have tried to add our name to it because it raises
an important aspect of this energy trilemma that we are trying to
solve. As the noble Lord, Lord Stephen, eloquently pointed out, it is
sadly missing from the Bill. This amendment or a similar amendment
would be an excellent addition to it and would help to make it clear
that this will be a very important part of the energy system. The
reason it belongs in this Bill is because it is a significant move
towards supporting the greater use of variable sources of electricity.
As has been pointed out by previous speakers, one clear way of
addressing the issues and challenges that variability creates is
through the use of
storage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000011">It is
often—I think wrongly—stated that electricity cannot be
stored. That is incorrect. It can be and is stored in many ways. We
have heard of some of them today. Dinorwig is an amazing example. It
was a government-funded public work, and it has been operated very
successfully by a number of private companies. It is a jewel in the
crown of our grid and provides fantastic, very fast and very efficient
back-up at times of
need.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000012">However,
there are many other sources. Hydro pump storage is not just in North
Wales. There is an awful lot of it in Scotland, where it is a very
reliable and well integrated source of renewable energy that has become
at one with the environment in which it is located. These are
technologies that were built in the 1950s and are still serving us
today. They are amazing examples of what renewable energy can achieve.
With the renewed interest in storage, a plethora of new approaches is
emerging. I read with interest that GE, the wind turbine manufacturers,
has launched a turbine that it is calling the “Brilliant”
turbine. It is 2.5 megawatts and has a chemical storage facility built
in to smooth the curves when wind power is operating or not operating.
Obviously, that is a statement from the manufacturers that they can see
a commercial advantage to being able to provide storage to help deal
with the variability of the energy
supply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000013">The
Leighton Buzzard project was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Stephen.
This is a fascinating and great example of where Britain can really
excel. It is fairly straightforward engineering excellence at its best.
The challenge is to take electricity at times of high supply using a
filtration system to separate out nitrogen and then to cool the
nitrogen as a liquid. That 
<?notus-xml column=657?>is the storage mechanism. Once it is heated and released, it can power a
turbine. The great thing about the Leighton Buzzard project is that it
is located next to a source of low-grade waste heat, which would
otherwise be wasted, and that is helping to improve the efficiency of
the system. These are exactly the sort of projects you can rely on the
engineers and innovators of Britain to deliver. I really hope that we
will see much more of such projects and more support for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000014">The
chemical project has also been mentioned—but I might have got
this the wrong way round. The liquid air project is in Slough, and the
chemical project—the 6 megawatt chemical battery, also mentioned
by the noble Lord, Lord Stephen—is the one in Leighton Buzzard,
so I apologise for the confusion. Nevertheless, those are two
examples.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000015">There
is also a wide amount of pre-existing distributed storage available on
the grid in the form of Economy 7 and storage heating. This is another
aspect of storage that has been slightly forgotten. When we had our
initial push for nuclear power and found that we had an overabundance
of power in the night, when there was not much use for it, a parallel
process was introduced to encourage householders to fit storage heaters
in order to absorb that excess electricity at times when it was cheap
and use it to heat their homes. I do not see why that should be
forgotten. I think it has an essential part and could now, with the
advances we have made in smart metering and the information that will
be available to consumers, provide another form of
storage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000016"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Teverson" PimsId="5087" UID="13073034000162" xid="1932" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000162">Lord
Teverson:</Member></B> I will just point out that the noble Baroness is
absolutely right about that. It is true that heating water by
electricity can still be done. Storage heating has perhaps become less
popular—most water heating is by gas—but there is still a
substantial element of electrical water
heating.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000017"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Worthington" PimsId="5934" UID="13073034000163" xid="2144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000163">Baroness

not want to take too much time, but I also mention one of my favourite
discoveries of this year: the flywheels at Culham. A little-known fact
of our grid is that the fusion research unit at Culham demands a huge
burst of power in order to work, and it was deemed to be too great a
demand to place on the grid. So, in the 1970s, flywheels were
installed, which are still operating today, based on the flywheels that
operate in Dinorwig. This is another example of fantastic engineering
that solves a problem. I am dwelling on all these examples because I
think they really show that, as our energy system transforms itself and
as we embark on this road with, I hope, a very clear and unswerving
purpose, we will solve many of the problems and obstacles that have
been cited today as insuperable. Innovation in engineering is something
we excel at and I expect that noble Lords will come forward with many
more
examples.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000019">I
turn to the amendment and the requirements to introduce a strategy and
set a target. I am at times a little sceptical about the setting of
targets, but I am very supportive of the idea of a strategy.
Representatives 
<?notus-xml column=658?>from the industry have told me that they are very confused about how to
interact with the Department of Energy and Climate Change. There is not
a single point person in the department who really has an overview of
this issue, and they have asked if we could raise that issue and ask
that it be prioritised and given a home within the department. They
tend to feel that they are being passed from side to side, with no-one
taking overall responsibility for it. I think that is in part because
the definition of “storage” is not quite clear, and this
hits at a core issue. Dinorwig is classed as a generator and holds a
generating licence, but if you have an Economy 7 storage facility in
your home, you are not a generator. Lots of technologies may emerge
that are somewhere in between because they are both absorbers and
generators of power. They could offer very particular services to the
system. Is there a need for a separate licence category for such
operators? The Government need to think about this and perhaps come to
a conclusion. In the course of writing a strategy, I am sure that this
is one of the things that needs to be addressed.</hs_para>

particularly important in relation to the distribution network
operators. We tabled amendments in earlier Committee sittings to tease
out the fact that the DNOs are currently preparing the business
strategies which they will implement over the next eight years. It is
my strongly held belief that the capacity mechanism within this Bill,
if it is done correctly, could have a dramatic effect on the
introduction of electricity storage, and therefore should have a
material impact on the DNO strategies. We have said before that it
seems crazy to be signing off on DNO strategies before the detail of
this Bill and the capacity mechanism within it is fully worked
through.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073034000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000021">The
Electricity Storage Network, which is the relevant trade association,
has pointed out that support for electricity storage is currently
available. It is not quite clear from the briefing whether the grant is
worth £30 million or £50 million, but it is
clear that the Government are making available some tens of millions of
pounds for grid-scale demonstrations of storage. That is very welcome
indeed. However, the association makes a point which makes sense to me:
if you spend that kind of money on the demonstration but you do not
have a policy to secure the route to market, that is effectively wasted
money. What the sector is really looking for is a clear signal that it
will be able to participate in the capacity mechanism and that there
will be a way in which it can compete against the other potential
sources of capacity that will be brought forward. The problem is that
we are dealing with what is essentially quite a new set of technologies
which is facing all the challenges that you would associate with that.
Potentially, these technologies could be commercially viable, but they
are not yet. How can they compete in a capacity market that essentially
seeks to be technology neutral and provide one price for all? This is a
contradiction in the proposals being made by the Government that really
needs to be thought through.</hs_para>

that on the supply side,  when it comes to supporting
low-carbon electricity supplies, the Government have accepted that we
need a tailored strategy for the different technologies. We have
differentiated strike prices as well as different 
<?notus-xml column=659?>treatment for nuclear and renewables—and within the renewables
category, there is an enormous difference in approach. The reason for
that is that the Government recognise that in bringing forward the
low-carbon economy, it is not just a question of the least cost
initially because these technologies are at different stages of
development. The Government have expressed a desire to bring forward a
range of technologies and not simply to compare them all against
levelised cost. It is more subtle than that. Those interests may
include the ability to establish a supply chain, which might have a
material bearing on how we support certain technologies. The Government
have gone so far as to create a levy control framework which is split
up into the different technologies and potentially into different sizes
of technologies, and even into different locations. I say that because
on the supply side it is clear that the Government accept that one size
fits all will not work and that different policies need to be brought
forward in order to help all the various technologies at their
different stages of development.</hs_para>

and reduction side is thrown out of the window and we are told that all
technologies must be able to compete on a level playing field. What I
would argue is that that simply will not work for those technologies
which are less far along the development curve. Those include
electricity storage, which has huge potential and will be very
important, but at the moment would find it extremely hard to compete
against the existing coal-fired generators, with gas that has just been
mothballed or, indeed, potentially with new CCGT, although I hope it
would be able to compete with it. I would simply state that on the
supply side, the Bill recognises the need for differentiated
approaches, but when it comes to the demand side we take a completely
different approach. I would like to hear from the Minister what the
justification is for those very different approaches. I am sure that
she will respond by saying “the least cost”, but if it is
a question of the least cost, the argument should apply to both sides.
There must be something different on demand to which we are applying a
different logic, and I would like to hear what it
is.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_30_PT_1/47D38D02C0380A1564BAA2E1D72A3F277C3B7EA6" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 30 July 2013">Tuesday,

electricity storage would seem to be a very interesting area for it.

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> We have had an interesting debate
that was kicked off by the noble Lord, Lord Stephen. Before telling us
about the need for electricity storage, he told us that, as a Minister
in the Scottish Government, he was in favour of moving towards 100%
renewables. His speech had a certain revelatory note as though, when he
was advocating 100% renewables, he had not really thought about 
<?notus-xml column=660?>storage. If you are dealing with renewables, you are of course dealing
with interruptibles and you have to have something to fill the gap.
Storage has always been one of those things. I find it a bit disturbing
that the Scottish Government—of whom my party was a part at the
time—signed up to what seems to be a somewhat ill-considered
approach to renewables. However, it shows that when something with an
element of newness and freshness comes along, it is thought that it
must be good; and once its goodness is established, everything is
possible. I get the message this afternoon that everything involving
storage is good and therefore possible.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T14:17:05"></hs_TimeCode> happen to be
in favour of storage and in favour of a strategy, but if we are going
to have a strategy, it means that there will be priorities. If there
are priorities, it means that some of the projects now enjoying the
cosy embrace of Members of this Committee on both sides may well be
cast to the
wind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000027"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T14:17:39"></hs_TimeCode>On
the question of cost, the energy industry is saddled with bad

energy—of which I am an enthusiast—saying that it would
be too cheap to meter. We have got to be a lot cooler in our

bit of discipline into what I think is the wishful thinking that has
prevailed in so much of today’s discussion. I am not sure
whether we are going to get very much more in the way of pump storage,
as you need to have the terrain and the water. I remember talking years
ago to people in the hydro industry in Scotland and they did not think
there was really very much more that you could eke out of the Scottish

the Government, we can change the world and make a fortune for

have been in this game for far too long and have seen so many of these
schemes founder. I want us to have a strategy and I think that we
should have storage, but let us not lose our sense of proportion. At
the end of the day, we will not be storing that much because it will be
the surplus electricity. We will not be generating for storage
purposes. It will be a case of storing the extra, the margin and the
bonus. Let us keep a sense of proportion so that when a strategy is
produced, we are ready for the fact that some folk may be disappointed
because they did not get everything they wanted. We have heard already

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord
Stephen and to all noble Lords who have contributed to this very
helpful and useful debate on Amendment 55D. Subsections (a) and (b) of
the proposed new clause support the development and piloting of storage
systems for electrical energy. The Government agree that technologies
that can be used to help balance the supply and demand of electricity,
such as energy storage systems and demand-side response and
interconnection, are increasingly likely to be required. This was the
conclusion in DECC’s report, <I>Electricity System: Assessment
of Future Challenges</I>, which was published in August
2012.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000032">Energy
storage systems can be used to store surplus electrical energy for use
at times of high demand. They help to match the supply and demand of
electricity efficiently and cost-effectively. Technology companies in
the UK and elsewhere are actively developing energy storage systems
which could help to address the problems associated with intermittency
of supply. However, different energy storage technologies are currently
at different stages of development and further innovation and
development is needed to reduce the costs and thus make storage
technologies applicable to wider deployment.</hs_para>

department therefore identified energy storage systems as a priority
area for funding under its Innovation Programme. We then consulted with
storage technology developers and users, as well as other public sector
innovation funders, before developing a plan to help support the
development of storage systems. This led, in October 2012, to the
department launching two innovation competitions to support research,
development and demonstration of energy storage systems. As a result of
these competitions, funding has already been awarded to 16 energy
storage projects, and in the autumn DECC expects to announce details of
up to 
<?notus-xml column=662?>four energy storage demonstration pilots, which it  will be
supporting during the current spending review period. The aim of these
pilot projects is to demonstrate the scope for cost reduction of
innovative energy storage technologies and to explore the opportunities
for deployment of energy storage technologies to address a wide range
of future UK electricity network balancing and other storage needs. I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill, that this should be
part of fulfilling the capacity of needing more energy rather than it
being a means to an
end.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000034">Under
Ofgem’s Low Carbon Networks Fund, three pilot projects are
already under way to incorporate storage into our electricity
distribution networks. These projects have the potential to assist in
balancing local demand to facilitate the timely and cost-effective

to the Leighton Buzzard six megawatt battery project, which is one of
the three pilot storage projects being supported by Ofgem’s

to subsection (c) of the amendment, the proposal to set targets for the
provision of renewable energy storage capacity. Energy storage systems
are one way to address issues arising from intermittent supply and so
to support the deployment of renewable generation. However, other
mechanisms such as demand-side reduction, interconnectors and smarter
networks can also be used to help to balance supply and demand.
Different mechanisms are likely to be needed to meet different
balancing applications depending on the characteristics they offer,
such as power, duration of supply and response times. The commercial
markets should be best placed to select the most cost-effective
solution to address each balancing
requirement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000036">Energy
storage of all sizes will have the opportunity to compete alongside
generation and demand-side response in the capacity market. This will
provide a secure revenue stream, ensuring sufficient investment in the
reliable capacity we need. Of course we recognise the importance of
developing a more responsive demand side for the longer-term efficient
functioning of the market. Given that certain technologies such as
storage have different characteristics from generation, we are
developing transitional arrangements to provide particular support to
demand-side response and alternative capacity types, including smaller
scale storage which is connected to the distribution rather than the
transmission network.</hs_para>

previously in our debates, the early stages of the capacity market will
include “go early auctions” for specific technologies in
2015 and 2016, which are designed to help certain emerging industries
to grow. We envisage that these auctions will include demand-side
response, embedded generation below a size threshold and storage
connected to the distribution network. The auctions will allow storage
to take on limited obligations and benefit from regular guaranteed
payments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000038">Finally,
subsection (d) of the amendment would require the Government to set out
progress made on these energy storage system issues in the form of a
report which must be laid before Parliament. DECC is already planning
to carry out post-project evaluation on the outcomes of the energy
storage innovation schemes once the supported projects have been
completed.

shall pick up on a couple of points that were raised during the debate.
My noble friend asked how much funding DECC is putting into current
projects. There is a list of things that we are doing and I have
highlighted one or two of them. In spring 2013 we awarded
£500,000 to a total of 12 organisations to carry out phase one
feasibility studies into innovative and diverse energy storage ideas
under the Energy Storage Technology Demonstration Competition. We will
invite some of the innovators who have won funding under this
competition to take part in the second demonstration phase of the
competition, which is worth up to £17 million, to test designs
on the ground. We also awarded £1.5 million to four
organisations in the first round of the Energy Storage Component
Research and Feasibility Study Scheme.

carefully to the noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, and, sitting here, I
wished that I had paid far more attention to my chemistry and physics
lessons. Hydrocarbons and all these things that I studied many years
ago suddenly came to the front again. He asked about pumped hydro
schemes. One of the energy storage schemes already being supported by
DECC is a study into possible novel locations for pumped hydro schemes.
The noble Viscount also asked for the Government’s position on
the use of hydrogen fuel cells and about electrolysis. Using fuel cells
and generating hydrogen is at present very expensive and inefficient.
DECC is investing in collaboration with the Technology Strategy Board
in a number of hydrogen system demonstrations, so we are working on it.
I promise the noble Viscount that I shall take far more interest in
those projects to have a greater understanding of
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000041">The
noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, asked about DECC’s lead for
storage. I can confirm that we do not have a single policy lead for
energy storage, but there is, of course, strong interest and technology
leadership from DECC’s own Science and Innovation Group, which
is managing the current innovation support projects for storage, so it
is a key part of the department’s role. I very much take her
point that it would be helpful to have a named person, which is
something that we perhaps need to think a little bit more about. She
also asked why we were being neutral in the capacity market when we are
differentiating between technology and CFDs. It is a point raised by
the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill. The capacity market is intended to
deliver security of electricity supplies at least cost. That is where
the differential
lies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000042">I hope

the department and some of the other government or public sector

I do not see that as in any way contradictory to the benefits of
bringing in this sort of amendment. In being prepared to withdraw it
today, I would ask the Government to consider the benefits of
introducing an amendment of this kind at a later stage in the
consideration of the Bill. This is such a centrally important issue
that it merits introduction to the Bill, for the reasons that I have
mentioned. I will not go over all those reasons again, but we need to
say that it is important and include it in the Bill, in the same way as
we think that decarbonisation is important—and a number of us
want to include a target in the Bill for
decarbonisation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000044">I
was interested in the comment from the noble Baroness, Lady
Worthington, that she is not particularly keen on targets, because I
thought that the issue of targets was pretty central to the arguments
coming from the Opposition Bench in relation to its criticism of the
Bill. When I first came into government in Scotland in 1999—and
the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill, referred to that—one issue
that we had to deal with in coalition negotiations was the enormous
number of targets that the Labour Party wanted to introduce into every
aspect of government. At that time, there was a general view in
Scotland and in my party that we could do with slimming down
considerably the number of targets that the new Labour
Party—bright-eyed and bushy-tailed in 1997—came surging
forward with in its early days of
government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000045"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Worthington" PimsId="5934" UID="13073034000167" xid="2144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000167">Baroness
Worthington:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for giving way. I want
to clarify that, as I said in my speech at Second Reading and as I have
consistently said in Committee, I agree with the setting of outcomes in
terms of what the Government want to achieve. However, I am nervous of
the micromanagement of individual technologies through ever smaller
targets. An editorial in the <I>Financial Times</I> this week asked why
we could not have a process where the Government set the objectives and
the market chose the least costly and most sensible solution. I have
consistently said that is what we should be doing. This Bill is not
taking that approach and I fear that another very specific technology
target might be the straw that breaks the camel’s

Stephen:</Member></B> We have touched on a very interesting area but we
can all agree that a strategy is a very good thing here. Even the noble
Lord, Lord O’Neill, thought that a strategy was a good idea.
Sometimes in government you have to be bold and ambitious in setting
strategy and, sometimes, in setting targets. I take the point made by
the noble Baroness about the importance of outcomes and not
micromanaging. If the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill, had been given
John F Kennedy’s speech about sending a man to the moon by the
end of the decade, he would probably have set it to one side and
declined to go for it. Sometimes we have to be ambitious and we are
dealing with very important change that needs to be driven by
government. None of the major changes we are seeing in energy
infrastructure in the United Kingdom and many other developed nations
would be happening without huge intervention and commitment from
government.</hs_para>

Energy Bill will deliver exactly the sort of change we are all hoping
for but not in relation to storage where much more needs to be done.
The noble Lord, Lord O’Neill, was exactly right that when these
big targets for renewable energy were first set storage was seen as a
vital issue if they were to be introduced. They can also be achieved
through a mixed basket of renewable energies, not all of which are
intermittent in the way that wind and solar energy are. Storage is not
rocket science; it is not so uncharted. We are aware of the
technologies right here and now: the issue is how to deploy them
sensibly. It is not all about balancing the network: it is about
focusing some energy storage on renewable energies. I was interested to
hear about the proposal for an individual turbine having its own
internal storage capability. When we are building, as we have done, the
biggest wind farm in Europe, there should be consideration of some sort
of energy storage alongside such a huge investment. We have a lot more
to do and I am excited at the prospect. I am ambitious for all of this
and genuinely believe that we can do it. With the right commitment,
support and focus, we can make this happen. I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13073034000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000210">Amendment

voltage optimisation when I was working for Scottish and Southern
Energy which was considering internally how it might go about meeting 
<?notus-xml column=666?>a theoretical demand to reduce the demand of its customers. I was
advocating voltage optimisation as a policy that it should embrace and
the company was mulling over how it might meet it if it were to happen.
The things the company thought about off the top of its head to reduce
consumers’ demand were the greater use of thermometers and
controls in heating, which was very obvious, and voltage optimisation
on the electricity side. I had never heard of it, but the engineers
understood the system far better than I could. They knew about voltage
optimisation and its potential for knocking down demand in a very
certain way.</hs_para>

with demand reduction is that it can have a rebound effect. Some energy
efficiency measures increase efficiency but do not produce a net
reduction in demand. The fridge is a classic example. You get a bigger
fridge that may be A++-rated, but its overall demand is greater.
Voltage optimisation gave very clear and concrete outcomes.</hs_para>

amendment to reiterate some of the benefits of voltage optimisation and
to highlight that at the moment it is slightly falling between the
cracks and does not receive any support, despite the fact that it can
and does reduce electricity bills, has a very short payback period for
companies and households that fit it and has the added advantage of
stabilising the voltage used in equipment and extending the lifetime of
that equipment. If you consider that the voltage coming into a home can
fluctuate quite widely, a voltage optimisation unit will hold the
voltage at an optimised level so that everything in the house is using
that controlled voltage, which can extend the lifetime of white goods
and other equipment that works far better on a stable voltage. I should
have explained voltage optimisation at the start, but I assume a very
high level of understanding among eminent noble Lords here.</hs_para>

amendment is the concern that this technology is currently excluded
from existing support mechanisms. It does not qualify for support under
the ECO or the Green Deal. It seems that the reason is that it has not
been accepted as part of the SAP rating of energy efficiency assessment
for homes. The industry says that it has been trying to resolve this
for a number of months—in fact, for years—and is feeling
very frustrated that the department has not done more to expedite the
issue. It seems that there is a slightly negative perception of this
technology at the BRE. The industry is doing all it can to address the

reducing customers’ bills, very short payback periods and
increasing the lifetime of appliances. It seems to me strange that this
is not being supported more by government. I know that the Government
use this technology—I think that it has been installed in both
No. 10 and DECC’s buildings and in many other public buildings.

Roper:</Member></B> My Lords, I made a brief reference
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T14:45:46"></hs_TimeCode> voltage
optimisation earlier in the Grand Committee’s proceedings. I
referred to the very useful lunch organised by the noble Baroness, Lady
Worthington, where a number of us were able to learn from members of
the trade association what was being done. In the rather steep learning
curve on the topic of energy that I have experienced over the last 12
months, that was one of the high points, given that not only has the UK
been a pioneer with this technology, but it is very effective, both at
the level of the large consumer and, in other ways, at that of social
housing.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073034000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000060">I
will make one suggestion to the Minister, if I may. We discussed
earlier the situation laid down in Clause 37 of a pilot
scheme or schemes for electricity demand reduction and the possibility
of the Government setting up or examining pilot schemes to see what
could be done. It seems to me that voltage optimisation is one of the
areas that could come under what we have already considered in Clause
37. I would be interested to know whether the Minister feels that there
is any chance of considering it within that
framework.</hs_para>

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, I am sorry not to have been able to be
here earlier. I declare an interest, given that in the past I have
assisted firms of this kind to try to get a wider application of their
equipment. There are certain drawbacks with this, but what I find so
interesting is that it is a particularly British problem. It is simply
because we have gone along with a voltage that is out of line with that
of other people. Given that everybody manufactures to a voltage that is
common elsewhere, we have something that is less than optimal. That is
all. If the system is less than optimal we waste significant amounts of
energy and our equipment works less sensibly and wears out more
quickly.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073034000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000062">I do
not to repeat what the Committee is perfectly well aware of but simply
to say that this is another example of how much can be done in very
simple and small ways, which all add up. One of the things that worries
me about governments of all kinds—this is 
<?notus-xml column=668?>not a comment about the present or the previous Government—is
that small things that add up do not get the same attention as big
things that very often do not add up at all. There seems to be a kind
of desire to do things people will take note of, rather than understand
how much there is which, if we add it up, makes a huge
difference.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073034000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000063">I
do not want to go over it all, but I am sure that there has been a
significant saving of energy simply because kettles now show you how
much water has been put in, so that you know what you need for a cup of
tea and do not put in too much. All those simple mechanisms actually
make a difference. The trouble is that people tend to laugh at them,
because in themselves each one does not matter. If we had voltage
optimisation as a built-in feature of every new home, for example, and
if it was automatically offered in every circumstance, we would save a
significant amount of energy.</hs_para>

noble friend will be able to say that her department will concentrate
on the small things that add up but which will not get headlines in the

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady
Worthington, for the amendment. Over the past few months, a number of
questions on voltage optimisation have been raised in this House and
the other place. This is the result of having an industry that is
passionate about its product and its estimates of potential savings.
The Government, however, have to look at this objectively and consider
the evidence of performance. I am not sure whether my noble friend Lord
Deben was here during our previous debate but it demonstrated that the
Government look at smaller projects. Perhaps my noble friend would look
at <I>Hansard </I>to see how we are already supporting some smaller
projects.</hs_para>

a piece of electrical technology that could potentially reduce the
energy consumption of household appliances and industrial machinery by
lowering the supply voltage. Manufacturers of voltage optimisation
devices have asked for recognition of this potential to save energy
through its adoption in government-sponsored schemes, including the
Green Deal, which the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, mentioned. The
Green Deal is an example of how a government strategy has been
introduced that encourages householders and businesses to invest in
technology, as long as it has a measurable and verifiable energy saving
and can be recommended for a given building. These criteria are
important to ensure that we realise real energy savings and ensure good
value for money to
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000067">There
is an established process for admitting new technology into the Green
Deal, which entails the industry submitting its evidence to the
Government’s contractor for entry to the standard assessment
procedure, which is the tool for determining the energy efficiency of
domestic buildings. In the case of voltage optimisation, this evidence
has been reviewed by BRE, and its  report has confirmed that
there was a saving from  the installation of voltage
optimisation in some of the 
<?notus-xml column=669?>properties tested. In all these instances, however, part of this saving
was found to result from a reduction in the level of service provided
to householders—for example, by making lights dimmer. This
cannot be counted as a real energy efficiency
saving.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000068">The
report also highlighted further reductions in the estimated savings
from voltage optimisation arising from the impact that EU directives
are having on the energy efficiency of household appliances. The effect
is that appliances are becoming more tolerant to, and efficient at,
working within a range of supply voltages. A realistic projection of
the likely take-up of modern appliances reveals that the potential
saving from voltage optimisation will reduce each year, such that by
2020 the saving is likely to reduce to zero in a typical home and then
become negative in later years. This is due to the voltage optimisation
unit’s own power
consumption.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000069">In
the commercial sector, it is more difficult to make generalisations
about the efficacy of voltage optimisation due to the wide range of
electrical plant that could be in use. However, this sector, too, is
subject to improvements in the energy efficiency of electrical plant
due to EU directives, which will reduce the savings from voltage
optimisation. It is against this backdrop of evidence that the
Government cannot commit to supporting voltage optimisation. There
already exists a strategy within the Green Deal that allows industry to
get its technology recognised and adopted, subject to it meeting key
criteria. If the evidence for voltage optimisation were to change, then
we could reconsider whether the market forces found within the Green
Deal were sufficient to encourage its
uptake.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000070">I
should also like to touch on the scale of savings that the noble
Baroness believes will be made with voltage optimisation. We found that
the indicative costs and savings were as follows: voltage optimisation
units could cost around £300 plus the cost of installation but
may save, on average, only £2 per annum. It has been suggested
that by 2020 the units will use more energy than they save and will
therefore have to be removed at further cost. This is evidence provided
by the industry to the BRE, and the organisation <I>Which?</I> agrees
with DECC about this. Given that, I hope that the noble Baroness is
reassured that we are taking every possible opportunity to look at new
entrants, and that on that basis she will withdraw her
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-30T14:55:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness
for those comments. What they serve to do is illustrate quite how
closed the department is to this technology. If it was true that there
was a saving of only £2 on an investment of £300, no one
in their right mind would develop, manufacture and install it, and yet
we have an industry that is doing so. Not only that, it is a British

positive

Worthington:</Member></B> I take the point, but what the industry is
feeding back to me is that it is finding the process to be incredibly
slow and time-consuming. People are pushing against an attitude of
resistance which starts out by considering what they say to be false.
However, that does not add up because some quite hard-nosed commercial
operators such as Tesco have installed this equipment and are finding
that it saves them money. If that is the case, some support should be
offered. It is probably true that the quantum of savings and investment
is better in larger-scale uses, but it cannot be true that this is an
industry based on a fallacy. I refuse to believe that people would put
their hard-earned money, hours and initiative into something which is
of no benefit. I recognise that there is a procedure that needs to be
gone through, but I hope that it can be opened up to scrutiny and
perhaps a conclusion can be reached rather more swiftly than is the
case at the

service will be barely noticeable. People have said that voltage
optimisation does not work because the lights are so dim that you
cannot read a book. However, it is not on that scale at all. It is
probably true that most households would not notice it. We probably
enjoy a surfeit of lighting because we have all installed lots of
halogen lighting in recent years. The loss of service is a contestable

demand reduction comes with all sorts of potential loopholes and
problems. I go back to what I said about fridges. The Government have
been perfectly happy to hand out eco-credits, or whatever they were
before they were called that, for the installation of appliances, but
there is no requirement that those appliances should contribute to a
net reduction in demand. They simply have to be efficient. As I have
said, a larger and more efficient fridge, which is what the current
trend is moving towards, uses more energy than a smaller, less
efficient fridge. There is an inconsistency here. I know for a fact
that when the light bulbs credits were available, we were handing out
support to people who were simply putting those light bulbs into the
cupboard under the sink. It is slightly unfair on the part of the
Government to apply incredibly tight and overly restrictive criteria to
a technology which I do believe is of benefit while not recognising
that great leniencies have been shown towards other technologies in the
past. I am not saying that we should go back to that but there is an

Hanworth:</Member></B> Throughout the Committee’s debates, one
vital element has been barely mentioned—the future of
Britain’s nuclear energy. Without the prospect of major
investment in nuclear energy, the nation’s energy policy makes
no sense and the Energy Bill is virtually meaningless. The lack of
debate about Britain’s nuclear programme has been a reflection
of its uncertainty. The Government are still in protracted negotiations
with the French state-owned monopoly
EDF—Électricité de France—which in reality
represents, at present, the only means of achieving new investment in
nuclear plant. For reasons of political ideology, allied to fiscal
anxieties, the Government are loath to finance the investment. They are
relying on EDF to raise the necessary funds from the financial markets,
which are currently in a parlous state. The company, in turn, sees an
opportunity to recoup some of its recent losses in projects elsewhere
at the expense of the British taxpayer. It can look to the examples of
foreign national rail companies, which are recouping their losses by
adopting rail franchises in Britain. It hopes that it can follow
suit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000079">With
such a prospect in view, one might expect greater eagerness on the part
of the company to strike a deal. In a previous debate on the subject of
Britain’s nuclear programme, one of my colleagues voiced the
opinion that our Government were in a strong negotiating position and
that they should therefore stand their ground. That is a misjudgment.
EDF has other prospects in view, in China in particular, and the scale
of those Chinese projects will far exceed anything that is on offer in
Britain. Moreover, the Government’s expenditure in Britain to
date in connection with the prospective Hinkley C nuclear power station
is no guarantee of their
commitment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000080">According
to an economist’s nostrum, bygones should be bygones, while
according to an alternative version of the dictum, one should not throw
good money after bad. The Government are therefore advised to have a 
<?notus-xml column=672?>properly conceived and well publicised plan—a plan B, as it is
usually described—to meet the eventuality of a breakdown in the
negotiations. There is a strong suspicion that the Government have a
plan B, albeit a covert one, given that an influential faction within
the Government appears to believe that Britain’s impending
energy deficit can be overcome by a dash for gas that would rely on
supplies of gas that could be magicked out of the ground beneath our

been feeling the effects of the Government’s schizophrenic
attitude throughout the debate in Committee on the Energy Bill. The
schizophrenia is not unique to Britain but has been severely affecting
Germany’s energy policy, which accounts for the fact that the
German energy companies that originally intended to bid for nuclear
contracts here have withdrawn, The nuclear schizophrenia has also made
some inroads into the policies of the French

further reason for the Government’s reliance on foreign
utilities to realise their nuclear ambitions is the attenuated state of
our nuclear industry. A recent report by the Science and Technology
Committee of the House of Lords bore witness to this state of affairs.
It recommended that drastic action should be taken to revive the
industry and foster its research and development. The consequence of
the report was flurry of activity that gave rise to a cluster of
government reports centred on the so-called Beddington report that
reviewed the civil nuclear research and development landscape in the

conventional uranium reactors, mainly of the pressurised water variety,
which follow the designs of the majority of the original civil
reactors, albeit that nowadays they have greatly enhanced safety. There
is, however, strengthening conviction that the succeeding reactors
should take a new route that proceeds from a design that was realised
in prototype form almost at the inception of the civil nuclear age.
This is the thorium-based molten salt reactor. It has the signal
advantage of using abundant fertile thorium fuel in place of fissile
uranium fuel. In contrast to a uranium reactor, a thorium reactor will
generate very little of the problematic wastes that afflict
conventional reactors. It is also endowed with passive safety, which is
to say that a malfunction leading to overheating the reactor would lead
to its automatic shutdown. The reason why such a design was not adopted
at the beginning  of the nuclear age is that the reactor has
one signal disadvantage which today is one of its major
advantages —it fails to produce weapons-grade
plutonium.</hs_para>

nuclear technology and nuclear power in general. Those who are

are other reactor designs we should also be considering, including fast
breeder reactors. Notwithstanding some negative anti-nuclear propaganda
that was aimed at them, fast breeders are eminently practical devices.
The PRISM fast breeder reactor of the GE Hitachi company has been
proposed to our Nuclear Decommissioning Authority as a way of
profitably burning our stock of 120 tonnes of plutonium that resides at
Sellafield. The authority has been given the task of recommending the
best way to dispose of the stockpile, which was once regarded as a
menace. Now it is being seen as a valuable nuclear resource which could
power efficient and cost-effective ways of meeting our electricity
demand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000088">Originally,
it was proposed to bury the plutonium waste. Then it was thought that
it could usefully be converted into a mixed oxide fuel for burning in
conventional reactors. The emphasis appears to have shifted in favour
of either the PRISM fast breeder as a means of burning the plutonium or
the alternative Canadian CANDU reactor, which might be described as a
slow breeder. It is because of this shift of emphasis, which implies a
widening of the discretion of the NDA, that I believe that its original
terms of reference, which were set out in the Energy Act 2004, need to
be
modified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000089">In
1954, the American physicist, Lewis Strauss, predicted that atomic
energy would eventually make electricity “too cheap to
meter”. That is the correct attribution of the quotation. He may
have had in mind fast breeder reactors, which effectively create their
own fuel, or he may have been thinking of power generation by hydrogen
fusion. Either way, his vision, or something close to it, is still in
prospect. We might therefore ask why, after the rapid progress at the
start, the goal is still so distant. There are several answers to this
question. One of them points to the nuclear phobia associated with
nuclear weaponry, which has been exacerbated by nuclear accidents.
However, the nuclear accident at Fukushima, which has created a major
impediment, has little bearing on the question of the safety of a new
generation of
reactors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000090">There
is also, in this country at least, the effects of a failure of the
technological courage that once characterised the nation which we

have the resources or the skills to deal competently with the complex

rely  
<?notus-xml column=674?>extensively on outside consultants. I hope that this will change in the
near future. That is no criticism of them; it is a criticism of the
circumstances in which they find themselves. I hope, too, that the

with EDF regarding the proposed Hinkley Point C reactor. The contrast

astonishing. The glory days of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment

helped to establish the all-party parliamentary group to which my noble

benefits of thorium and closed-cycle breeder reactors because I think
we are all getting a little tired now as we are very near the end, but
I understand the sentiment behind this amendment. I am particularly
interested in the latter part of it, which requires the Government to
report

reason why I am interested in that is that we have an opportunity here,
in considering what we do with our plutonium stocks, to mark a new era
in nuclear fission. That shift from seeing the plutonium as a liability
that is just costing us money—which it is at the moment, to be
honest—to seeing it as an asset that can be exploited to
generate low-carbon electricity is, I think, just upon us. Soon it will
be there, but we are not quite there yet.</hs_parafo>

is, quite understandably, a high degree of conservatism—with a
small C—in the industry. There is a tendency to stick with what
you know and not to do anything risky or to look beyond your immediate
priority. The NDA does an amazing job of managing the process of
decommissioning our existing nuclear sites, and I just hope that, when
it considers what to do next with the plutonium stocks, it will
consider in the round and will not be encumbered by a preponderance of
doing only what it knows best and sticking to what it has seen
previously. If it does that, I fear that once again we will be building
a very expensive MOX fabrication plant, for which there will be
probably no known customers by the time it is built. Certainly, the
PWRs that are being built by AREVA and EDF will not wish to take it. It
is much better for them to use newly fabricated fuel while it is
available. That will be the “do nothing”, “stick
to the plan”, “keep going as we are”
strategy.</hs_para>

addition to those, new ways of approaching this problem have now been
put forward by different industry representatives. My noble friend Lord
Hanworth mentioned the PRISM reactor, GE Hitachi’s breeder
reactor and the CANDU reactor from Canada. There has been quite a lot
in the media about the PRISM reactor, but much less about the CANDU
reactor, which is potentially an excellent solution. CANDU reactors are
very flexible, are a tried and tested technology developed over many
years by the Canadians, and have a very big investment arm behind them.
It is a very viable project. There you get the advantage of building
not just a fuel disposition solution but a reactor to provide clean
energy. Given the precarious—or perhaps
protracted—negotiations with EDF over Hinkley, it is very clear
that we need to have a plan B. If we just switch our frame of reference
to consider the plutonium stocks as an asset and then exploit them to
maximise the production of electricity and minimise the production of
waste, it will point us to a novel solution that would open up great
benefits to the UK. I hope that the department, in the advice that it
gives to the NDA, will consider this in the round and consider whether
we need, perhaps, to rethink the remit of the
NDA.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13073034000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000157">3.15

the picture for nuclear was very different. Things have changed and it
might just be a good thing to think again about what the NDA is doing,
how it relates to the broader thrust that the Bill introduces, and
consider whether a slight tweak might mean that we get a really good
outcome that opens up a great deal of potential for low-cost, safe and
very low-waste nuclear energy, which I think is what we are all aiming
for and the nuclear industry accepts we now have to deliver. We have
had decades of public support for nuclear energy; it has had a period
of contraction and might be seeing some return to growth. However, it
will grow only if it can develop reactors that are inherently safe and
therefore more cost-efficient, and for which the costs will not
escalate and the building timetables will not overrun. They have to
come in as cheap as the alternatives. That is a real
challenge.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073034000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0001.htm#13073034000096">I

noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, is to be congratulated on giving us an
opportunity to debate this matter. In many respects, if in the nuclear
industry we had been able to get things started at Hinkley right away,
we probably would have been committed to different reactors from the
ones that are now coming along as opportunities. There is therefore
some virtue in a degree of delay in the process. However, both PRISM
and CANDU have to go through the generic design assessment process,
which could take  
<?notus-xml column=676?>up to 30 months although, in fairness to the regulators, they have
suggested that they will try to accelerate that by using foreign
experience and so on.</hs_para>

about a nuclear programme of construction that will continue for
probably 30 years. As someone once said in the context of school
dances, “You rarely went home with the person you danced with
first”. In this context, we may well find emerging technologies
that provide us with opportunities. At the moment we have to be
realistic about the fast breeder element in the technologies that have
been spoken of this afternoon—they are somewhat limited. When I
was chairing the Nuclear Industries Association, I had the opportunity
to attend a conference in Paris that was meant to be a shop window for
the French nuclear industry. I think that the French were a bit miffed
when Japanese and South Korean companies came forward and spoke very
confidently about their capacity to realise fast breeders in what will
now probably be  15 years’ time. We did not go down the
road of fusion today, which every schoolboy knows will be available in
35 years’ time; 35 years ago, they said it was going to be
available in 35 years’ time. We therefore have to be a wee bit
cautious about fast breeders, but we could be talking in terms of
getting one in the United Kingdom perhaps 20 years from now, when we
will probably still be
building—</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000099"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Hanworth" PimsId="832" UID="13073034000183" xid="2155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000183">Viscount

is that we have already had a fast breeder in the UK that worked fairly
well, in spite of rather diminished support. There were two fast
breeders in France. There was Phénix and Superphénix.
Phénix was very successful. There were some doubts about
Superphénix, which had some engineering difficulties. However,
its primary difficulty was, of course, political. I will reassert what
I said previously, which is that fast breeders constitute an eminently
practical technology. They are not 15 years away, but are as far away
as it would take to ratify and certify

over a number of years; this was not a coalition-specific charge. The
previous Government, when they woke up to the requirement to embrace
nuclear, understandably did a number of commendable things in terms of
training and widening the opportunities for nuclear to be part of

to both Governments’ active encouragement. However, we still
have a long way to go. We have a national laboratory at Sellafield

getting too specific or hung up on particular technologies within the
nuclear framework, it is essential that if we are going to take
advantage of the new technologies as they come through we have got to
have trained, capable people to do that. At the moment, I am not
certain that the Government are giving it the highest priority and that
is what this debate should be about. We could go through the specifics
of Select Committee reports but that is not productive. If we are going
to have this technology it is not a once-and-for-all thing. It is not

are possibilities for bigger changes but, in order to invest in the
right and most appropriate one, we must have a skilled labour force and
institutions and research establishments capable of dealing with that.
As someone hinted, we need to have an open-mindedness in the industry
which, at times, it does not have—because they are very much
companies wedded to particular technologies, as EDF is. It is just
unfortunate in some respects that the company that is first to the
starting line is the one that in the European context uses the least
reliable technology in terms of construction, and probably the most
expensive to run. If we get a strike price, as we will eventually, it
will have to be set in such a way that it does not provide the more
efficient and perhaps cheaper technologies with a chequebook to make
fabulous amounts of money out of. I realise that 
<?notus-xml column=678?>that is the predicament that the Government have, but we
must not just keep saying, “We don’t
have a UK capability—we’re dependent on foreign
countries”.  The technical changes that will come

Worthington:</Member></B> On the question of what the UK can
contribute, the noble Lord is absolutely right that Rolls Royce is
already involved here in reactor design and manufacture. That company
is sponsoring a student in the Dalton Research Institute in Manchester,
looking at a small modular reactor based on a thorium fuel cycle; it is
looking at different reactor designs, including molten salts. So it is
here. One example of how a small amount of money can have a big effect
is the $10 million grant given by the Department of Energy in America
to a number of universities, plus the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to
look at molten salt-cooled pebble-bed reactors. That funding programme
enabled them to leverage into the Chinese nuclear reactor research
programme, such that the Chinese changed direction and are now
collaborating in work on a molten salt-cooled pebble-bed reactor using
thorium. I use that as an illustration that you do not have to build
everything yourself and spend hundreds of millions; you can have a
highly leveraged impact if you are smart about your R&amp;D choices and
build on our existing strengths.</hs_para>

exposure to an increasing number of scientists in the UK who are
working on thorium and molten salts—and in combination. It is
true that Sellafield and the National Nuclear Laboratory, by being
commercial, have to go out and seek funding from the existing
incumbents in the market. Therefore, they do not have the luxury of
being able to horizon scan or think slightly more outside the box,
because they are continually looking for funding. If more funding were
provided by government and we had a genuine R&amp;D for nuclear fusion
strategy, the NNL would be an absolute asset in this search for the
most sustainable forms of nuclear power. They are the ones working with
Thor Energy, fabricating solid fuel thorium rods today that are being

the Science and Technology Committee’s excellent 2011 report on
<I>Nuclear Research and Development Capabilities</I> in the UK, and in
responding to it we committed to undertake a programme of work designed
in the simplest terms to assess where the UK was in terms of nuclear
R&amp;D, where we and the industry believe the sector could be by 2050,
and how to get there. The work under this programme completed around
the beginning of this year and went on to form the basis for the
development of the nuclear industrial strategy. The strategy was
published alongside the outputs from our R&amp;D work in
March.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000112">This
package of work highlights how essential  research and
development will remain in ensuring that nuclear power can play its
role in the current and future energy mix while allowing us to continue
to deal safely and securely with the legacy of our nuclear past. The
strategy was clear that the co-ordination and development of nuclear
R&amp;D needs to be taken forward in collaboration between industry,
academia and public bodies. In doing so, we aim to maximise the use of
public and private resources and provide a level of harmonisation
between industry’s commercial aspirations and maintaining energy
options for the UK’s future growth. As such, we believe that it
is unnecessary and even counterproductive to put a legislative
requirement on the Government part of this larger collaboration when we
have already committed to moving forward together. We recognise that
while R&amp;D on advanced fission technologies and alternative fuel
cycles is important, it is just part of the wider whole that includes
essential work on decommissioning and long-term waste
management.</hs_para>

the management of the UK’s plutonium stockpile, all the options
being considered involve the spending of public money, and a key driver
will be ensuring best value for taxpayers. Following a public
consultation on long-term plutonium management, the Government have
concluded that for nuclear security reasons the preferred policy for
managing the vast majority of UK civil separated plutonium is reuse,
and that plutonium should be converted to mixed oxide fuel for use in
civil nuclear reactors. The Government’s expectation is that at
current uranium prices the value of the fuel generated will be
significantly less than the cost of its manufacture; in other words,
for the foreseeable future, the manufacture of MOX is primarily a route
for consuming plutonium stocks rather than a commercial operation in
its own right. However, the Government remain open to any alternative
proposals that offer better value to the taxpayer, and the Nuclear
Decommissioning Authority continues to work on an assessment of both
the CANDU and PRISM technologies, the use of either of which would
involve the use of advanced reactors and new fuel forms.</hs_para>

couple of points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, on the

plays an essential role in ensuring that the historic civil nuclear
legacy sites are decommissioned safely, securely, cost-effectively and
in ways that protect the environment. As we set out in the Government
response to the committee’s report, we would have serious
concerns about changing the authority’s remit or reallocating
essential resources from it because we do not want to dilute its
ability to focus on this critical mission. It is also worth noting that
over the past five years, the NDA estate has itself contributed more
than £544 million to R&amp;D activities, with an annual spend of
between 3% and 5% of its overall budget.</hs_para>

Worthington:</Member></B> Before the Minister sits down, I have a
question about one key phrase that was used. The noble Baroness talked
about value for taxpayers. However, I was trying to communicate that
the Bill will introduce considerable extra costs for consumers. What I
am trying to get at is that taxpayers and consumers are one and the
same—we are all taxpayers and all consumers of electricity. If
you focus purely on the disposition of plutonium as something
completely separate that the public purse has to fund, and argue that
we just spend money on what costs the least, you are missing the bigger
picture. As a citizen, I am both a consumer and a taxpayer, and will be
paying for nuclear projects as a consumer. I would like to see a
coherent strategy that says, “Here is a solution that gives two
outcomes. We get rid of plutonium and we have low-cost electricity,
which saves consumers money”. I just want to test
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000119"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13073034000190" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000190">Baroness

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, we really are at the end now. I shall
try to be brief but make no apology about turning to a subject that
affects the deliverability and credibility of the entire Bill. When we
had a discussion on the establishment of an expert committee, the
Minister referred me to the clause to which this amendment applies.
Clause 139(2)(c) provides for resources to be raised for the employment
of advice. I have no objection to that, but ad hoc advice, as we said
the other day, is not sufficient for delivering such a complex project.
We are now horribly aware of that, having been through nine days in
Committee. Apart from a few serious experts in DECC and possibly Ofgem,
a few very sharp lawyers sitting in the big six and other interested
parties that may be on the other side of these deals, we probably know
as much as is likely to be known at this stage about the nature and
process of the contracts, the difference in the process of investment
contracts and to a lesser extent, given that a lot still is fairly
obscure, about capacity mechanisms.</hs_para>

nothing, the potential participants know nothing and consumers know
nothing. DECC, the counterparty and Ofgem will face a complex process.
They will have to deal with extraordinarily complicated and novel
arrangements that do not reproduce anything extant anywhere in the rest
of the world when it comes to electricity supply. They will be dealing
with companies who are very sophisticated, who employ the very best
advice and who, necessarily and rightly, are looking for a deal which
will profit them as well as helping the long-term future of our energy
security.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000123">Delivering
what is in the Bill, even though it is not that thick a Bill, will be
an extremely complex process. Parliament and the public would expect
departments and others representing the Government and the public in
this process to have very solid advice. Some of that can be dealt with
on an ad hoc basis, contract by contract and aspect by aspect. However,
as was made clear in a previous debate, you need an institutionalised 
<?notus-xml column=682?>body which is clearly publicly known and respected, consisting of people
with deep experience of the legal, financial, technological and
economic issues which it is tackling. Above all, you need consistency.
You need corporate memory and a body to oversee the individual
officials and Ministers who, whether we like it or not, are not there
for ever. They are often there only for a few months or years and
cannot take full responsibility for negotiating these
contracts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000124">The
expert panel is an advisory panel, but it is an important strengthening
of the whole process. I do not expect the Minister to change her mind
today, but unless the Government recognise that they need something
like this—they may want to call it something else—the
deliverability of this whole process, on which so much depends, will
look extremely shaky. I therefore hope that the Government will at
least take on board that they ought to look at this concept again. I
beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000125"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deben" PimsId="5754" UID="13073034000194" xid="2031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000194">Lord
Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, I very much oppose the amendment, which
seems unnecessary. A great deal of advice is available and it is not
necessary to have yet another committee. A committee has been proposed
with a different role, which seems to me to have a much more sensible
and wider view. That was in an earlier amendment—which has been
withdrawn but which I have no doubt will come back—proposed by
the former chairman of Shell UK, the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh. That
seems to be a much better proposal than this one. It is not necessary
to shove this in at this point. The Secretary of State will have at his
behest a whole range of people on whose advice he can rely. This gives
him permission to do that, and although I am all in favour of giving
him that permission, I do not want him to have yet another committee. I
think that this is the wrong way to do it and I very much hope that my
noble friend will resist the amendment. I rather suspect that she will,
and it is always a pleasure to end such an afternoon, now almost
evening, by entirely supporting my noble
friend.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000126"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13073034000195" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000195">Baroness

the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for his amendment, which would set up an
expert panel to advise the Secretary of State on the exercise of his
powers relating to CFDs, investment contracts and capacity payments. I
reassure the noble Lord that we are working hard to ensure that the
process through which final contracts for difference and strike prices
are set is transparent, robust and informed by a full range of expert
input. The consultation on the draft delivery plan, as well as
workshops and events with stakeholders, will allow industry, consumer
groups and all other stakeholders to scrutinise the figures, and the
evidence used to develop them, and provide us with feedback to inform

the consultation, the draft strike prices were also informed by two
pieces of independent advice: the analysis provided by National Grid,
which helped the Secretary of State understand the potential impacts
that different strike prices could have on the Government’s
objectives and, of course, the independent scrutiny of that analysis by
the panel of technical 
<?notus-xml column=683?>experts. Both these reports were published alongside the draft EMR
delivery plan and copies have been deposited in the Libraries of both
Houses. The panel of technical experts in particular, which consists of
experts in relevant areas such as economics and generation costs, was
appointed through an open competition. It is impartial and independent
of any particular viewpoints. I do not therefore think that we need to
create another expert advisory panel. We have used existing powers to
appoint the current interim panel of technical experts and, following
Royal Assent, we intend to establish an ad hoc advisory group. Clause
139(2)(c) provides the spending authorisation to support this
work.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13073034000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000159">3.45

the strike prices published in the final delivery plan to set strike
prices for investment contracts for renewable technologies. As such,
they will be informed by the analytical process and independent panel
that I have described. For investment contracts that are bilaterally
negotiated, specialist advice will be sought as appropriate and there
will be rigorous scrutiny of proposals. For example, the Government
have appointed technical and financial specialists to scrutinise a
developer’s plans and proposals. We will publish summaries of
reports from these advisers and a value-for-money appraisal in the

me reassure the Committee that the Government have listened to concerns
of Parliament. Similar concerns to those being raised now were voiced
in the other place, and that is why we made amendments to
this Bill in response. We removed the discretion of the Secretary of
State to withhold information when publishing an investment contract,
beyond what was explicitly agreed as confidential in the contract
negotiations. For information agreed as confidential and thus withheld,
we have committed to publishing a description of that information and
the reasons for doing so. In relation to EMR more widely, we introduced
a statutory reporting duty at Clause 5(4) which requires an annual
report on how the Secretary of State has exercised his functions under
Part 2.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073034000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000130">In
relation to scrutiny of contract terms, I agree that this needs to take
place but believe that it would be better done by industry and consumer
groups at large. This is why, over the past year, we have been working
with an expert group consisting of industry and consumer group
representatives in the development of key terms. We will also shortly
be publishing the CFD contract spine, which builds on the draft
contract terms published alongside the operational framework in
November 2012. This will allow industry and other stakeholders to
examine the terms of the contract and discuss them further with my
officials. Because investment contracts for renewables will be based on
the final standard form CFD, they will benefit from the same scrutiny
that I have set
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073034000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-gc0002.htm#13073034000131">I

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and
Local Government (Baroness Hanham):</Member></B> In <I>The Coalition:
our programme for government</I>, and thereafter my Department’s
published Business Plan, we said we would require continuous
improvements to the energy efficiency of new buildings. I am therefore
today setting out the Government’s response to last
year’s consultation on proposed changes to Part L of the
Building Regulations (Conservation of fuel and power) and announcing
changes to the energy efficiency requirements in the Building
Regulations for England. These changes have been overseen by my
colleague, the Building Regulations Minister the Rt Hon Don Foster
MP.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073027000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-wms0001.htm#13073027000004">In doing
so I am also responding to our key external partners who are seeking
clarity on the issue. Strengthening these requirements takes the next
step towards our zero carbon ambitions, will contribute to national
emission reduction targets and help to lower people’s fuel
bills. The changes are projected to deliver savings of £16
million per year to business and 6.4 million tonnes of carbon
dioxide.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073027000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-wms0001.htm#13073027000005">These
changes have been developed in light of the consultation responses
received, feedback from the Cabinet Office Red Tape Challenge process,
consultation with the Building Regulations Advisory Committee and
engagement with external partners. They strike a balance between the
Government’s ongoing commitments to improving energy efficiency
requirements and ensuring that the overall effect of regulation upon
consumers and businesses does not stifle growth. And given that
industry wants clarity on the further direction of travel beyond these
changes the Government intend to publish a consultation shortly on the
next steps to take forward zero carbon homes, including the means of
delivering allowable
solutions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073027000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-wms0001.htm#13073027000006">These
Part L changes take an important and technically meaningful step
towards zero carbon homes but one that also allows Government to meet
its commitments to reduce the overall regulatory burden upon home
builders. For new homes, the changes deliver a 6% improvement on 2010
standards across the build mix, with compliance targets differentiated
by home type to take advantage of the most cost effective savings. The
existing partial relaxation of targets for homes built off the gas
grid, the so called ‘fuel factor’, will stay at current
levels to help rural home builders. Home builders will continue to have
flexibility in how they meet carbon dioxide targets however the
emphasis of these changes is on getting the building fabric right and
this is reinforced through the introduction of a new target for fabric
energy efficiency.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13073027000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-wms0001.htm#13073027000007">Similarly I am
announcing a strengthening of carbon dioxide targets for new
non-domestic buildings that delivers a 9% improvement on 2010 standards
aggregated across the build mix. Again this should be seen as part 
<?notus-xml column=166?>of the next step towards zero carbon, achievable in most building types
through cost effective fabric and services efficiency improvements. I
can also confirm a strengthening of the minimum energy efficiency
standards when specific building services work including air
conditioning and lighting replacements are carried out in existing
non-domestic buildings. The direct energy savings arising from these
changes outweigh the costs thereby providing a net benefit to
business.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13073027000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-wms0001.htm#13073027000008">I
am also announcing today the decision not to proceed at this time with
a strengthening of the minimum energy efficiency standards for
extensions and replacement windows to existing homes. The Government
has decided that this would be inconsistent with recent reforms to
extend permitted development rights under the planning system and it is
not the right time to impose additional costs on hard-working families
trying to improve their homes. Although the revenues from energy
savings from strengthening extension standards are currently
insufficient on their own to cover the costs, technical innovation is
expected to lead to improved cost effectiveness over time and subject
to securing consumer buy in I have not ruled out the possibility of
reforms to standards in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073027000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-wms0001.htm#13073027000009">Similarly,
I can announce that the Government has decided not to proceed with
regulation at this time for a new homes quality assurance process. The
consultation response supported the principle of addressing discrepancy
between design and as built energy performance but said that more
evidence is needed to better understand where the problems lie before
taking regulatory action. The Government is therefore supporting the
Zero Carbon Hub led industry programme set up to look at the issues in
more detail with a view to achieving industry’s own target that
90% of new homes should meet, or better, their design performance from
2020. The Hub has today published a progress report providing a summary
of the collaborative work carried out to date and initial findings. The
next stage of the project will focus on analysis of the evidence base
and report on recommended priority solutions by next
Spring.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073027000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-wms0001.htm#13073027000010">On
timing, I can announce that the amending regulations will be laid

January last year contained a range of proposals to improve the
Building Regulations regime. Following the successful introduction of
the significant deregulatory measures in April this year, we are today
publishing two further elements of that package, changes to the

Document A provides guidance on how to meet the Building Regulation
requirements for structurally safe buildings. The Approved Document
published in 2004 includes references to British Standards that might
be used for structural design, which the British Standards Institution
replaced in 2010. The new British Standards reflect latest industry
practice and adopt a new pan-European design approach referred to as
the Eurocodes. The changes I am announcing today will see the guidance
updated so Approved Document A refers to these new British Standards. A
number of minor related changes are also made to the guidance in
Approved Document A and Approved Document
C.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073027000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-wms0001.htm#13073027000014">While parts
of industry have already moved over to this new design approach
voluntarily, it is recognised there will be transitional costs to some
in industry. That is why the consultation proposed issuing additional
guidance alongside the Approved Document to minimise the impact on
business. We propose to do this in two ways. First, we will make clear
how, given the functional nature of the Building Regulations, use of
the withdrawn British Standards remains acceptable for some time,
providing industry with a number of years to adapt. Secondly, we
propose to provide reassurance that engineers and Building Control
might agree, subject to the requirements of the Regulations being met,
continued use of the withdrawn design standards is appropriate for
smaller-scale, less complex structural work for the foreseeable future,
thereby avoiding the additional transitional costs. The Department is
writing to building control bodies and industry setting this
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13073027000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130730-wms0001.htm#13073027000015">The major
change to Approved Document C relates to protection from radon gas.
Exposure to radon is the second major cause of deaths from lung cancer
in the  
<?notus-xml column=168?>UK. Approved Document C sets out, by reference to radon maps, where it
is necessary to incorporate measures to reduce peoples’ exposure
to radon. The changes we are introducing will update the guidance so as
to align it with the most up-to-date radon maps. This is a sensible
retargeting of existing health protection with a clear benefit to those
living in higher-risk radon areas.</hs_para>

There is no official definition of term
“digital company” which can refer to a wide range of
companies across a number of sectors. Estimates of the numbers of
digital companies will therefore vary depending on the definition used.
In the Information Economy Strategy, published on 14 June, we estimated
there to be 120,000 information economy companies. This figure is based
on Office of National Statistics figures for companies primarily in the
software, IT services and telecommunications services

returning an ESA50 back to six weeks. The timescale was originally
based on the Incapacity Benefit (IB) arrangements which allowed an
extra two weeks to get an additional medical statement (Med4) from the
GP, which is not required for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
claims. As has always been the case, claimants can submit any evidence
they feel will support their claim up to the point the decision is
made, which may be several weeks after the expiry of the ESA50 time
limits. We want claimants to provide such evidence as soon as they can,
in order to help the decision maker make a fully informed decision
about benefit eligibility. All evidence submitted will be considered in
the decision making process.</hs_para>

that the report did not sufficiently explain the advice or lacked the
detail required by the Department. The departmental audit has shown
that claimants whose reports did not meet our rigorous quality standard

Export licence applications require supporting
documentation to help verify the end-use of the goods to be exported.
Where the export is for the end-use of the Israeli government, then
they would be required to provide the appropriate assurances. These
assurances are: confirmation of the end-user; details of the specific
purposes for which the goods are to be used by the end-user; that the
goods will not be used for any purpose connected with Weapons of Mass
Destruction (WMD) or missiles capable of delivering such weapons; that
they will not be re-exported or otherwise re-sold or transferred if
known or suspected that they are intended for WMD; that they will not
be re-exported or otherwise re-sold or transferred to a destination
subject to a UN, EU or OSCE (Organisation for Security and co-operation
in Europe) embargo and that act would be in breach of the terms of that
embargo and that the goods, or any replica of them, will not be used in
any nuclear explosive activity or unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle. In
cases where exports are for the end-use of commercial entities in

the UK to maximise the business opportunities that Crossrail presents.
Crossrail is working with local and regional business groups to raise
the profile of Crossrail and is participating in a series of targeted
events around the UK. Crossrail requires all tier one contractors to
use the CompeteFor website, which matches suppliers to opportunities
that suit them and allows them to apply for contracts quickly and
easily. In addition a list of “Current Opportunities” and
the Crossrail “Supplier Guide” are published on the

has been particularly active in east London. On 23 May 2013, Crossrail
held a Meet the Contractor Event in Canary Wharf in partnership with

opportunity to learn about the project, the types of contracts that
will arise over the years ahead and what they need to do to maximise
their chances of winning work on Crossrail. Throughout the day over 200
targeted “one to one” appointments between
Crossrail’s principal contractors and suppliers took place and a
