solar can be great and often is, but inappropriate development risks
alienating public support. That is why I am pleased to say that, in the
next few weeks, as a result of close work with the Department for
Communities and Local Government, we will issue revised planning
guidance for renewables. That will mean that renewable energy does not
automatically override environmental protections and the planning
concerns of local communities. It will also make it clear that care
should be taken to preserve heritage assets and beautiful countryside,
and include the impact of planning proposals on views and landscape
when it comes to things such as solar. That is in addition to our
sustainability criteria, on which we are working closely with the

The UK Green Investment Bank, which was introduced and created by this

in that time it has invested £635 million and mobilised, in

autumn. I urge anyone who has a view on the proposals to use the
opportunity to respond to IPSA. The Government, like the Opposition,
have set out our views. We have made it clear that we expect IPSA to
take the broader fiscal climate into account, in particular the context
of the Government’s approach to public service pay and pensions.
I expect that we will maintain that position in any further response to
the consultation. I should add that my party’s view is that in
tough times we should see the cost of politics going down, not

I explain the vote that will occur next Monday to the shadow Leader of

Command Paper. It is not essential—nothing legally requires
it—for the Government to have a vote of the House before the
opt-out, but back in October the Home Secretary made it clear that we
would have such a vote. The vote on Monday is an opportunity for the
House to support the opt-out. It is not a vote about the
character of the opt-in. Since the negotiation the House is able, in
addition, to vote on Monday to take note of the Command Paper. That is
the basis on which having opted out in due course, as we are intending
to do, the House and the Select Committees of the House will then have
an opportunity to consider the opt-in. I am afraid that it is simply
not true to say, as the shadow Leader of the House does, that the

that, as you rightly pointed out, the public expect high standards of

sometimes the character of the questions being asked. I knew exactly
what was happening; I make no bones about it. In the context of the
heat-seeking missile that was aimed at the Leader of the Opposition in
the previous week about Unite’s relationship with the Labour
party, Labour Members were throwing out noise and chaff. Of course,
they knew they were doing it, we knew they were doing it, and it would
be helpful if the public knew they were doing it. However, we will not
stop making sure that that missile hits its target. The Labour party is
bought by the trade unions. We do not permit donations to the
Conservative party to have strings attached. We do not allow donors to
buy policy, to buy influence or to buy candidates, and they cannot buy

Manchester is home to some of the best and most innovative health care

Wythenshawe are two of the finest hospitals in the country. The area is
blazing a trail in the integration of primary, secondary and social
care services, but more needs to be done to ensure that emergency care

clinical case for change in Trafford general hospital is clear. It is
one of the smallest hospitals in the country. Its accident and
emergency department is the second smallest in the country. Between

become unsafe in the future. According to the Greater Manchester
critical care network, the unit needs to treat a minimum of
200 patients a year to be safe, but it treats fewer than
100. Emergency surgical services are also not sustainable. The Royal
College of Surgeons states that emergency surgery should serve a

the A and E at Trafford general hospital will be replaced by an urgent
care centre. The A and E currently sees just 100 patients a day. The
majority of those patients—around 75%—will continue to be
seen at the urgent care centre. That means around 25 patients a day
will be treated at the three neighbouring large university hospitals,
all within a 10-mile radius. In the longer term, as services are
developed over the next two to three years, the urgent care centre will
become a minor injuries unit. Trafford general hospital will become a
centre of excellence for elective orthopaedic surgery.  That

expansion of day surgery, such as ophthalmology and other vital local
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000321" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0001.htm#13071159000321">On

the implementation of these proposals subject to the prior fulfilment

system and ensuring continued access to out-of-hours mental health
services when the urgent care centre eventually closes. Progress will
be assessed and evaluated throughout the transition by NHS England in
conjunction with the local joint health scrutiny committee. Following
the advice from the Independent Reconfiguration Panel, I am also

day surgery, diagnostic tests and rehabilitation services. The centres

clinical consensus that doing so will improve outcomes for patients. I
know that Members representing north Lancashire and south Cumbria are
particularly concerned about the distance patients will need to travel
for specialist treatment. I do sympathise, but in the end have taken
the difficult decision that the clinical benefits of concentrating
specialist services outweigh any disadvantages in terms of additional

turn to the substance of what the Secretary of State has said. He is
right to say that the IRP provides excellent support and advice to
Ministers. It did so to me and my predecessors in the last Government,
and I am sure it is doing the same for the current Government. Where it
can be shown that changes will save lives and reduce disability, in my
view all Members of this House have a moral obligation to support them.
Changes to vascular services in Cumbria and Lancashire clearly fall
into that category. The concentration of this highly specialised
surgery on three sites will save and improve lives, but given the
geography it is essential that people are supported with travel. The
Secretary of State made a vague commitment, but can he be more specific
about the support that will be made available to patients, 
<?notus-xml column=563?>particularly in the sparsely populated northern part of our region, who
will now have to travel much further to receive this life-saving
surgery?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000337" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000337">Although
we support the Secretary of State’s decision on Lancashire and
Cumbria, we have much greater concerns about the process that has led
to the decisions today about Trafford hospital. While the IRP has
undoubtedly done what it has been asked to do, I wrote to the Secretary
of State in November last year to express serious reservations about
the Trafford review proceeding ahead of Healthier Together, a much
wider review of acute and emergency services across Greater Manchester.
Speaking as a Greater Manchester MP, I cannot see why it makes
sense to pick off Trafford hospital ahead of this review without
looking at things in the round. It does not feel to me that this is
part of a coherent plan for the NHS in our city region, and I ask the
Secretary of State today why his decision is justified, given that the
wider considerations affecting health services in Greater Manchester
have not yet been completed.</hs_Para>

of State claims that the patients affected by the closure of Trafford
can be easily and safely absorbed by the neighbouring A and Es. How can
he say that when all the A and Es that will now have to absorb extra
patients missed his own A and E target for at least four months during
the worst winter in the NHS for a decade? Have the Secretary of
State and the IRP made their decision looking at the very latest
evidence of growing pressure on A and E departments in Greater
Manchester? He mentions extra funding for Wythenshawe, which is
welcome, as the hospital was built for 70,000 patients a
year and is currently seeing almost 100,000, but will other affected A
and Es also receive additional
funding?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000339" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000339">Finally,
Mr Speaker, the appalling mishandling of this statement today, which
has left the people affected unable to put the Secretary of State under
scrutiny, is just the latest example of the wider mishandling of
hospital reconfiguration under the coalition, which has seriously
damaged public trust in our ability to make changes to hospitals.
Picking off Trafford ahead of a wider review broke the illusory
moratorium on hospital changes announced just days after the general
election outside Chase Farm hospital by the Secretary of State’s
predecessor and the Prime Minister—incidentally, that hospital
is also now
downgraded.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000340">Sir

the Secretary of State’s officials have been in court in the
past few days trying to justify the indefensible: a decision to rob a
local community in south London of a successful A and E to solve
problems in another trust that were not of its making. Is all this not
causing severe damage to trust in how these decisions are made? Will he
give a commitment to the House today that if the court finds against
him, he will abandon

the facilities in Blackburn at a time when many of the clinicians and
others have been under great anxiety because they have been subject to
the Keogh review. I think all my constituents recognise that sometimes
they will have to travel, as mine have to Blackpool for many years, for

If we level with the public about these difficult changes, they do
understand that there are times when they get a better outcome even if
they have to travel further. Perhaps the most dramatic example of that
has been how trauma services have been centralised on fewer hospitals.
Even after incidents as dramatic and dangerous as road traffic
accidents, people are not necessarily taken to their nearest A and E.
They are stabilised and then they are taken to an A and E that has the
equipment that is necessary to give them the treatment that is most

my hon. Friend’s point about urban versus rural, part of the
underlying reason for these changes is that we need to get more care
out of big hospitals, which are often in urban areas, and into the
community—into settings near people’s homes. That is very
important for rural communities where there are often large
concentrations of older people. Today’s decision will mean an

Different Ministers adopt different approaches. In some cases Ministers
have conversations with Members in advance—I know that the
Secretary of State himself has done so on other occasions—and
signal an intention to make a statement, or the possibility of a
statement, at a particular time, but on other occasions they do not do
so. On the strict question of whether it is in order, I can confirm
that the Secretary of State’s conduct is not disorderly. Beyond
that, it is for hon. and right hon. Members to make their own
assessment of the handling of the matter. There is scope, as with so
many matters, for different points of view. I think that is the fairest

prompted the audit. As part of my Department’s work on
tightening up procedures—both to prepare for the new electronic
monitoring contracts which are now out to tender and to improve the
quality of our contract management—we identified what appeared
to be a significant anomaly in the billing practices under the current
contracts. It appeared that we were being charged in ways not justified
by the contracts and for people who were not in fact being
monitored<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:08:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000408" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000408">Following
this discovery, I took immediate steps to investigate the issue,
commissioning an audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers. I also sought
assurances that there was no risk to the public as a result of issues
we discovered, and I am clear that these billing issues have not given
rise to any risk to public
safety<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:08:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000409" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000409">This
audit has now confirmed the circumstances in which the Department was
billed for services. This has included instances where our suppliers
were not in fact providing electronic monitoring. It included charges
for people who were back in prison and had had their tags removed,
people who had left the country, and those who had never been tagged in
the first place but who had instead been returned to court. There are a
small number of cases where charging continued for a period when the
subject was known to have died. In some instances, charging continued
for a period of many months and indeed years after active monitoring
had ceased. The House will share my view that this is a wholly
indefensible and unacceptable state of affairs.</hs_Para>

team is at present confirming its calculations, but the current
estimate is that the sums involved are significant and run into the low
tens of millions of pounds in total, for both companies, since the
contracts commenced in 2005. The audit shows that the overcharging
began at least as far back as the commencement of the current
electronic monitoring contracts in 2005. It might even date back as far
as the previous contracts let in
1999<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:09:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000411" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000411">The
audit also reveals that contract managers in the Ministry of Justice
discovered some of the issues around billing practices following a
routine inspection in 2008. Although it appears that these contract
managers had only a limited idea of the scope and scale of the problem,
nothing substantive was done at that time to 
<?notus-xml column=574?>address the issues.
None<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:10:11"></hs_TimeCode> of that,
however, justifies the billing practices followed by the suppliers. The
House will share my astonishment that two of the Government’s
biggest suppliers would seek to charge in this way. The House will also
be surprised and disappointed, as was I, to learn that staff in the
Ministry of Justice were aware of a potential problem and yet did not
take adequate steps to address
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:10:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000412" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000412">Let
me set out for the House what we are doing in response to these
findings. The billing practices in question were clearly unacceptable
and the Government will take all necessary steps to secure a refund for
the taxpayer. In view of the seriousness of the issue, however, and
having taken full legal advice, I am clear that, as Lord Chancellor, I
must not only take action in terms of financial recovery, but seek to
rule out the possibility that what went on involved dishonesty by
anyone involved in the
contracts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:11:04"></hs_TimeCode>. I
have therefore put it to the two companies that we should now carry out
an independent forensic audit, not just of the contractual
arrangements, but of the evidence, such as internal e-mail trails
between their executives, to establish the detail of what happened. I
have now received their responses.</hs_Para>

me deal with each company in turn. Serco, which is one of the
Government’s biggest and most important suppliers, has agreed in
full to such a forensic audit. It has said that it will co-operate
fully with our auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and that it takes the
issue extremely seriously, and it assures me that senior management
were not aware of it. It does not believe that anything dishonest has
taken place, but we have agreed that if the audit does show dishonest
action, we will jointly call in the relevant authorities to address
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:11:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Serco has
also agreed to a forensic audit of all my Department’s contracts
with it to ensure that there are no other issues. In addition, it has
decided that it would not be appropriate for it to continue to
participate in the current tender process for electronic monitoring and
has agreed to withdraw. I am grateful to Serco for its

me now turn to G4S. We put the same proposal for a further detailed
forensic audit to G4S last night. It has rejected that proposal. I have
given careful consideration to how to respond. I should state that I
have no information to confirm that dishonesty has taken place on the
part of either supplier, but given the nature of the findings of the
audit work so far and the very clear legal advice that I have received,
I am today asking the Serious Fraud Office to consider whether an
investigation is appropriate into what happened in G4S and to confirm
to me whether any of the actions of anyone in that company represent
more than a contractual
breach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:13:12"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
also disappointed that G4S still feels it appropriate to participate in
the tendering process for the next generation of electronic monitoring
contracts, which we are in the process of renewing. I have therefore
started a formal process to determine whether to exclude it from this
competition. Furthermore, we will be commencing forensic audits of all
existing contracts that the Department has with
G4S<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:13:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:13:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000415" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000415">Let
me deal with some other immediate procurement issues that I need to
address. My Department was also due to announce the results of the
competition to take over the management of prisons in Northumberland
and Yorkshire. I can tell the House that the winning bidder for
Northumberland is Sodexo, and that this 
<?notus-xml column=575?>transfer will continue as planned. However, the
leading bidder in Yorkshire was Serco. I have decided that we will
delay the award of this contract until the audit process I have put in
place is complete, and clearly it will only be awarded if that process
is completed to our
satisfaction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:14:17"></hs_TimeCode>. We
have also begun work on two new house blocks at prisons run by Serco

of the prison estate, I intend to proceed with this construction
work.</hs_Para>

auditors. The Permanent Secretary is also instituting disciplinary
investigations to consider whether failings on the part of individual
members of staff constitute misconduct. I have also commissioned an

<?notus-xml column=576?>20 years. The Justice Secretary’s statement is a serious one,
with wide-reaching consequences, and I have some questions for him.
What other sanctions has he considered taking against the companies

were back in prison and had had their tags removed; charging for people
who had left the country; charging for those who had never been tagged

the lay public, that appears to be straightforward fraud: obtaining
property by deception. The Justice Secretary mentioned the SFO, but
does he not agree that both companies should be investigated by the
SFO, not simply G4S? Will he pass on all the papers from the audit to
the police and the SFO and ask them to investigate whether any criminal
offences have been committed? I am sure he will agree that the law
applies to everyone, including big multinationals. What we need is the
police and the SFO going to G4S and Serco offices and preserving
evidence, not some cosy arrangement with one of the two companies. Will
he confirm that all the evidence has been preserved by the two
companies, as well as the Ministry of

Secretary confirm that those two companies will not be awarded any
further Government contracts? Giving that tagging involves potentially

Serco, and the management of Serco has accepted that the consequence of
that investigation, if dishonesty is found, will be a joint reference

in dealing with the issue. G4S should never have got another Government
contract after the shambles of the Olympics. G4S and Serco hold 17
contracts worth £118 million with the Home Office, and although
I accept what the Lord Chancellor has done in referring G4S to the
Serious Fraud Office and the police, I think he should have done the
same to Serco. When its chief executive appeared before the Home
Affairs Committee on 25 June, he said that he did not believe that
Serco had overcharged. The right hon. Gentleman is right to have acted
as he did, but he should not take a different approach to Serco. We
need the high-risk register that the Home Affairs Committee recommended
after the Olympics. That register should be held by the Cabinet Office,

not get another

Friend the Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan) and, above all, the
Secretary of State himself about this issue, not least because it was
during my watch in 1999 
<?notus-xml column=580?>that the original contract was let, before I was
again responsible for the contracts between 2007 and 2010. It is a

no evidence that we have so far seen that the Department was aware of
the nature of what was happening up until 2008. There have subsequently
been a number of interchanges in relation to this matter. In no case do
we believe that the Department had full sight of the scale of what was
happening, but it is clear to me that things were known at a junior

Grayling:</Member></B> I would make two points to the right hon.
Gentleman. First, we must be careful not to apply the judgments that
will inevitably be made after today’s announcement to all
private sector contractors that work with Government. That would be a
great shame and the wrong thing to do. I should also say that even in
the two companies in question, there are large numbers of
people—all our constituents—who are at work today, doing
their best to operate on behalf of the public sector. We should not
allow them individually to be tainted by what has happened.</hs_Para>

the same time, when we look at our plans for probation reform, we see a
large number of organisations —public and voluntary
organisations, as well as potential mutual organisations from
staff—interested in providing a solution to what is a glaring
problem, whereby at the moment people who go to prison for less than
12 months get no supervision at all. The longer we wait to
introduce the reforms, the longer those people will walk our streets
without supervision. When people talk about “leading
candidates” for contracts, I am clear that there are no
“leading candidates” for contracts in our probation
reforms. We have not started a contracting process. We are actively
encouraging as wide a range of participation as possible. I have been
talking to the social investment sector to bring in social capital. We
are working actively with the Cabinet Office to encourage employee
mutuals to come forward, either individually or in partnership with
potential investors. This is not a world that will simply be handed
over to a couple of big companies. I am very much of the belief that
there is expertise out there, which I want to capture, and skills that

disorder and discourtesy. The Secretary of State was not guilty of
disorderly conduct in any way. Ultimately, it is for Members of the
House to judge whether there was a discourtesy. I did indicate in my
response to an earlier point of order that there are ways of handling
these matters. It is often the case that a Minister will seek to inform
Members in advance at least of an intention to make a statement on a
matter, even if the Minister is not in a position to guarantee it or
indicate the precise date. These courtesies are important. Members must
form their own assessment, but I hope that in the future we can
operate, in respect of matters of this kind, in a way that commands
general assent across the House. That, I think, would be helpful to all

support the motion and to thank other colleagues across the House for
supporting it. Matters of war and peace are extremely serious, whether
we are talking about direct intervention, the provision of lethal

rebels. They therefore involve serious decisions for the Prime
Minister—or for any Prime Minister. Lives are at risk, and while

many ways, the debate on this matter has already been a success. When
we first discovered that the Government were seeking to lift the EU
arms embargo, there was no statement from the Government; we discovered
it for ourselves. Initially, there was some confusion. There was
certainly no clarity as to whether Parliament should vote to authorise
any arming of the rebels. At first, there was talk of consulting, and
there were hints and indications. These were confirmed in media
exchanges only three or four weeks ago, when colleagues on both sides
of the House who support arming the rebels advocated that Parliament
would not be bound by any such vote and that no such vote was required
before a policy to arm the rebels was decided upon and
executed.</hs_Para>

in this place before such a policy was executed. That is definitely a

sympathise to a large extent with the view that Parliament sometimes
comes late to these decisions. We debated and voted on the question of
Iraq as the troops were on the start line. When the mission in
Afghanistan morphed into one of nation building, it was
suggested—although not promised—that we would be in and
out without firing a shot, but 440 lives later we are still counting
the cost. The vote on Libya took place almost as the jets were leaving

problems with this conflict is that there are extremists on both sides.
On the rebel side, for example, we know that al-Nusra has close links
with jihadist and extremist groups including al-Qaeda. The Government
have not been able to answer the question about how they would track
and trace weapons to ensure that they did not fall into the wrong
hands. We need to remember that in that part of the world weapons are
tradable assets. Very little escapes the bazaar. Given that the

all share the Prime Minister’s genuine anger at the humanitarian
disaster. We all agree that Bashar al-Assad has become a callous
butcher who, instead of responding positively to non-violent protests
when the Arab spring reached Syria in March 2011, drove his people into
carnage and chaos. Russia and Iran have been culpable in the unfolding
horror, and so have the Saudis and Qataris. But Britain, too, is
culpable. We should have promoted a negotiated solution from the very
beginning. Instead we began by demanding Assad’s unconditional
surrender and departure. However, calling for regime change meant
chasing an unattainable goal at the cost of yet more bloodshed and
destruction, and so did supporting a rebel military victory.</hs_Para>

brutal regime and the Syrian people.
Assad<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:19:28"></hs_TimeCode> and the
ruling Shi’a-aligned Alawite minority form a 10th of the
population and were never going to give up power if it meant, as they
fear, being oppressed by the Sunni majority. Christians and other
minorities are similarly nervous about change. Together those behind
Assad amount to nearly a third of the Syrian people; add the Kurds and
the total reaches about 40 per cent. Few of them like Assad or his
Ba’athist rule, but they fear even more the
alternative—becoming victims of genocide, jihadism or sharia
extremism.</hs_Para>

economic and intelligence interests in the area; for example, Syria

the US, the UK, Saudi Arabia and their allies must drop their present
stance and help to implement that. Preventing Iran and also Assad from
attending a peace conference means that it will not even get off the
ground. Transitional arrangements that reach the end point of
democratisation are crucial, but their pace must be negotiated, not
imposed. However unpalatable, Assad and his henchmen may have to be
granted immunity to get them to sign up: hardly worse than the

will all be incredibly, tortuously difficult, and I understand that
Foreign Office Ministers are seeking to grapple with this on our
behalf, but what is certain is that UK policy was always going to fail.
The Prime Minister began with a demand for regime change, which did not

other resources, which failed too. Then he tried to supply British arms

ultimately rest? What would we give? The sort of things that are being
discussed are highly sophisticated—it is not like loosing off
several hundred rounds from a Kalashnikov. Therefore, how would we
ensure that any arms that we gave were properly used? We could only do
that by sending either military or civilian technicians. That might not

certainly constitute intervention.</hs_Para>

third question to which I believe we are entitled to seek an answer is
this: what impact would the supply of arms have on the relationship

shore-to-ship missiles over the last few weeks, anything that the

Libya again the House was given the opportunity to vote. It might be
argued that the supply of arms does not fall neatly into that category,

me give an illustration of that. Jordan is a country with which we are
closely allied, and it is a neighbouring country in the region which
has received very large numbers of refugees. The refugee camps are
characterised by forced marriage, rape and violence, and the impact on
the fragile economy—and, indeed, the fragile
Government—of Jordan of an influx of refugees on the
scale now being experienced must inevitably have an effect on
that country. If we were preparing our humanitarian effort for its own
intrinsic merit, we would also be creating a pragmatic outcome in
helping to protect from possible instability a country that is of great
importance to us and of great importance in the middle east, not least
because it, along with Egypt, signed a peace agreement with

that Iran would be invited, however, because this issue is of very
considerable regional significance, and Ahmadinejad has been replaced
by someone who is alleged to be of a less combative nature, and we now

further thing we can do, which I do not think has been mentioned yet,

particularly for the current President, whose father was the Minister

that regard, but I do not believe its interests would be properly
served by becoming engaged militarily. I hope the British Government

me conclude by reiterating that this is a very significant foreign
policy proposal. The Government have said that they have not yet
decided whether to implement it, but if they want to have the
discretion to take a decision of this kind, it can only be because they
have considered that decision among a range of options. We need only
look at who has signed this motion to see that they come from across
the entire political spectrum. The motion is therefore the
determination of those from all parts of this House, and that is why I
believe the proper course of action is for it to be
passed.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_11_PT_1/0839D10B0C10C197A2ED0995AA26A3CE8C2C04CC" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 July 2013">Thursday

very rare for the hon. Gentleman and I to agree. I hope that does not
mean that we are in the wrong on this issue. My concern is that we are
going into two long recesses and the Government could make a decision
arguing that, given all the circumstances, it was necessary to arm the
rebels in Syria, and although the House would almost certainly be
recalled, the decision would 
<?notus-xml column=597?>have already been taken. The Government would be asking for support from
their own Members on a three-line Whip. That is why is there is a good
deal of anxiety—all the more so as we start our recess next

Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the hon.

that statement the Foreign Secretary also spoke about the
amount of support already going to the Syrian rebels—those we
support. We are talking about armoured vehicles, body armour and
communications equipment. Moreover, as was stated, another £20
million of supplies will be sent in the coming months. Might not the
argument then be, “With all these supplies already sent, why not
lethal weapons?” These things escalate, although I am not
altogether certain that what has been sent has been
justified.</hs_Para>

clear about the background to this debate. Nearly 100,000 people have
died in Syria since the conflict started. So many of the people who
have been killed have been civilians going about their normal
lives—or trying to do so; these are the men, women and children
who have been killed, on both sides. The bloodshed and the suffering
continues now. The argument for the supply of arms is that the stronger
the rebels—at least those rebels the British Government
support—the more likely it is that the Assad regime will be
brought to the negotiating table. That is the basic argument, and no
doubt we will hear further arguments along those lines
from<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:32:19"></hs_TimeCode>

would not dismiss that view out of hand; it is possible that there is
some logic in that argument. Is it not, however, much more likely that
arms supplies from the west, including from this country, would simply
lead, as other hon. Members have said, to even more arms for the regime
from its current backers? We would have an escalating arms race. Why do
we believe that if the west started to supply arms to the rebels, the
countries supporting Assad’s brutal, murderous
regime—Russia, foremost, but also Iran—which, without
question, has no legitimacy, would not increase the arms supply
likewise? As I say, an escalating arms race can lead only to further
death and destruction.

by my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:33:25"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Neath (Mr Hain), neither should we overlook the

want to make it clear that there are circumstances where armed
intervention from this country is justified. Nobody could have been
more in favour of the support given in Bosnia and Kosovo than me. I
believed that we had a duty in those places to provide support, and I
was pleased to be among those who did so when Muslims were facing
outright massacre. In the mid-1990s, at the time of the Bosnian
conflict, I said that such support should be
given—unfortunately, it was often not to be until too late. But
in Bosnia and Kosovo we were not 
<?notus-xml column=598?>faced with extremist elements; we were not faced
with elements such as those in Syria, who obviously want to bring about
a form of state run along more or less the same lines as the Taliban.
Syria is a different situation altogether and that should be very much
borne in mind.</hs_Para>

we must redouble our efforts to try to bring the conflict to an end,
not by sending arms, but by trying to persuade Russia and other such
countries to come to the negotiating table to end the
suffering, to end the war and to bring about a situation where people
in Syria can once again go about their everyday lives, however much
there was a dictatorship there. That is a far better way of trying to
deal with this terrifying problem than sending arms to those in Syria
whom we believe are on the right side. Of course, we have no guarantee
that if we were to do so, those arms would go to the people we believe
should be supported.</hs_Para>

reluctant to be involved, in any way, militarily in Syria, has
nevertheless been persuaded, with all the advice available to him and
with all the analysis that has been made, that the time has come to
change position and give military support. The British and French
Governments, who have supported the European embargo, have been forced
to change their view towards a different position. Governments are
often accused of pandering to public opinion—going for
votes—but here it is the other way around; public opinion is
against supplying weapons in Syria. No votes are to be won by doing
this, so it is worth asking why three of the major Governments in the
world have gradually come to the view that, far from being an
irresponsible act, it may be not a good solution but it is less bad

because it has been part of Assad’s tactics from the very
beginning to try to force his own people and the wider international
community to believe that there is a stark choice between the Assad
regime and jihadi extremists such as Jabhat al-Nusra and to ignore the
fact that the Free Syrian army, the Syrian secular forces and moderate
Islamic forces, represent between them the overwhelming majority of the
Syrian public, and to suggest that they are somehow irrelevant to this

so for two reasons, the first of which is the humanitarian
situation. More than 100,000 people have died so far. We are not
talking about soldiers, militia or rebels; the vast majority of them
were innocent men, women and children. All the analysis by human rights
organisations—by Amnesty International and others—says
not that every one of them was killed by the Assad regime, but that
the vast majority were killed and slaughtered because of
indiscriminate bombing by the Assad regime throughout Syria,
particularly in the urban areas, where the opposition was
active.</hs_Para>

contemplate such an approach when he has refused all along to

Malcolm Rifkind:</Member></B> Let me go straight to that point. It is
perfectly fair, but I do not think it is as convincing as my hon.
Friend clearly believes. First, if we provide the weapons that the
Syrian moderate secular opposition want and of which they are
desperately short—they are the only people who do not have such
weapons as the jihadi nationalist extremists and the Assad regime
already have them—on what common sense grounds should we
anticipate that to any significant degree, the Free Syrian army, for
the first time given proper means of defending themselves and advancing
their cause, should wish to hand them over to the jihadi nationalists
who already have them and are their sworn enemies? Jabhat al-Nusra is
not even part of the Syrian National Coalition. Of course, we cannot
exclude the possibility that the odd weapon might go in that direction,
but to rule out providing them on those grounds alone seems unwise and
unreasonable.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071159000573" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000573"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:43:38"></hs_TimeCode>The
broader point is that if Assad knows that he not only has Hezbollah
forces fighting for him, which he needs to advance on Homs and Aleppo,
but has been promised Iranian revolutionary guards and if he has the
weapons, what possible reason would he have to be prepared to reach a
compromise that involves his sharing power, never mind giving it up?
When hon. Members who take a different point of view say that we must
have a diplomatic solution, I agree. When they say that lots of things
can be done on humanitarian grounds and through diplomatic initiatives,
I utterly agree. They know as well as I do, however, that in the middle
of a civil war, diplomacy by itself will not deliver the results
required. Why should it? That happens only when both sides to a civil
war realise that they cannot get military victory by themselves and
therefore must compromise.</hs_Para>

this moment in the conflict, the Assad regime has no reason to come to
such a view. It is not short of weapons and it is not short of fighters
from other countries—Lebanon and Iran—so such an approach
will not succeed. By all means, let us say that this is not our war and
that it is all terribly tragic. By all means, let us accept that events
will go on as they have been, but hon. Members must not kid themselves
that anything that relies on diplomatic initiatives alone, without the
real pressure that strengthening the secular opposition would provide,
has even the remotest prospect of bringing peace and preventing the
continuing slaughter of tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands

Flynn:</Member></B> I absolutely agree. The assumption is being made
that Governments decide whether we go to war, but even that is not
true. The decision to go to war rests with the monarch under the royal
prerogative. That is a key point, particularly as we might well have a
change of monarch in the foreseeable future—although it is a
long way off, we all hope. The change of monarch would not strengthen
the case for continuing the status quo when we know that the future
likely monarch has written letters that we are not allowed to see
because it might endanger his status and his future
prospects as the Head of State. A decision was taken by the
Government, after a freedom of information inquiry and a decision by a
High Court judge that anyone who lobbies Parliament should have the
contents of their lobbying letters published, to censor that
correspondence. That person will be in a key position on any decision
about going to war. We might say that that does not matter, but it
does.</hs_Para>

same issue came up in a little-known practical example published by the

the Conservative party, when it decided to get rid of Mrs
Thatcher, that she might call a general election. At that time, she was
much more popular in the country than she was in her own party and she
could well have come back. No one could have stopped her in Government,
in the Cabinet or in Parliament, but one person could have stopped her
calling a general election if that person had said that Mrs Thatcher
was a Prime Minister who was acting in her own interests and not in the
country’s. I think we all know that the present Queen had the
strength of character to ensure that Mrs Thatcher did not act in her
own interests.</hs_Para>

defend our country against non-existent weapons of mass destruction
allegedly held by Saddam Hussein. We proceeded to the second greatest
error that we have made in recent times. That was in 2006 when we went
into Helmand province, as has been said. The hope was that not a shot
would be fired and we would be out in three years, having cleared up
the drug trade. We now know what happened. At that time only two

could not be further from the truth when he says that this is an
academic debate? Quite the opposite. There is a clear showing that the
Government have moved some way since we first discovered that they were
lobbying for the arms embargo to be lifted. No assurance was given in
the early days, as illustrated by the fact that there were media
exchanges where proponents of arming the rebels were clearly making the
point on the Government behalf that they were not confined by a vote in
this place. This debate, plus the efforts of parliamentarians on both
sides, have been useful in getting clarity from those on the Front

Ottaway:</Member></B> I have no wish to quarrel with my hon. Friend.
What I was saying was that the motion was academic. The debate is very
important. On his second point, the words that the Foreign Secretary
used yesterday were almost identical to the original words used by the
Prime
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000591" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000591">A
number of criteria must be met before we intervene in these situations.
We must be clear that the situation has been properly thought through.
The first criterion should be that we should not intervene unless it
makes a difference to the lives, prosperity and security of the
Syrian people. When we examine that closely, it is a hard ask. It is
increasingly unlikely that we will move to a situation where President
Assad is forced out. He has the support of Iran and Hezbollah and
Russia, who are 
<?notus-xml column=604?>using as a justification for their support for Assad their concern over
the interpretation of the Libya resolution. They
argue that there was a generous interpretation of that resolution and
the bombing campaign went too far. I see that as a diplomatic excuse on
their part. The Russians are concerned for two primary reasons. One is
that, with an eye to Chechnya and the Muslims at their back door, they
do not wish to offend their Muslim community and they do not want to
lose their port on the
Mediterranean<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000592" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000592">The
second criterion that must be met is that we ask ourselves whether we
have exhausted all diplomatic solutions. Hopes must rest on the Geneva
conference but optimism is fading. The earliest that the conference
will take place is in September. I agree with others when I say that I
believe Iran should be present at such a conference. I wish the
Secretary of State for the United States and Mr Lavrov on behalf of the
Russians well in trying to set an agenda. The most likely outcome is a
rehash of the Annan plan and that President Assad will stay in office.
That may turn out to be the least bad
option<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:57:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000593" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000593">On
this point, I detect that the Government have changed their position.
At the outset it was a precondition that President Assad should go. Of
late, speeches by the Foreign Secretary and the Minister in the House
of Lords have dropped that requirement. I would be grateful if the
Minister could confirm when he winds up whether it is a pre-condition
that Assad should go as part of any negotiated settlement, or whether
he accepts that we may yet have to work with
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:58:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000594" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000594">Thirdly,
we have to ask ourselves whether there are military operations that we
can sensibly undertake that will make a difference. The region is in
turmoil. It is no longer the regime <I>v.</I> the rebels. The rebels
are split into good rebels and bad rebels. Chemical weapons have
clearly been used, although it is not clear by whom. The
concern now, and it may well be the reason why the Prime Minister and
the Foreign Secretary set out the option to take action without
consulting the House, is that those chemicals stocks may fall to the
rebels. I would be grateful if the Minister, in his winding-up speech,
could confirm his assessment of the risk set out by the Intelligence
and Security Committee the other day and what steps he will be taking
if there is a threat that they may fall into the wrong
hands.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000595" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0002.htm#13071159000595">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:59:12"></hs_TimeCode>
the military side, where do we go from here? I for one do not think
that throwing a few cases of rifles into the rebels’
hands will make a difference. As many have pointed out, the Saudis and
Qataris are already supplying a large number of weapons. If we supply
more sophisticated weapons, that will produce a response from Russia,
which has pledged to match like for like. However—this is

the Member for Basildon and Billericay about weapons falling into the
wrong hands. We have to ask ourselves whether that is possible with a
sophisticated air defence system. If it does happen, it should be on an
international basis. Why must we always look to the west for solutions?
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and Turkey all have perfectly good air
forces, and there is a case for an international
coalition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000599" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000599"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:01:24"></hs_TimeCode>The
fourth criterion that must be considered is whether we are prepared for
the long term. We have learned many lessons from Iraq and
Afghanistan and much needs to be done to stabilise the region. The
fifth criterion is this: exactly what is our national interest? That
must be spelt out before any intervention. If chemical weapons are to
be used as a justification for an intervention—I have made this
point to the Minister before—the House should be
shown the evidence about their use. All options must be on the table,
which is why I am uncomfortable about the motion, because in truth they
are

where has international law gone? I believe that there is more than a
grain of truth in the remarks my hon. Friend made a moment ago when he
argued that to intervene would be illegal. I am not convinced about the
legality of an intervention. The intervention in Libya was legal
because it followed a UN Security Council resolution. Taking sides in
what is essentially a civil war has no legal precedent and no legal
authority. Whatever the outcome of this situation, the United Nations

extraordinary that in the 21st century we still do not have a war

relations with Gaddafi at various times, and there have been many
others.</hs_Para>

I want to make two brief points. First, on the refugee question, there
are a very large number of Palestinian refugees in Syria who have made
their way there from Nakba in 1948, from Iraq after its invasion, and
at many other times. They are now being driven out, being treated very
badly by many of the opposition groups in Syria, or ending up in
Lebanon with very little support or resources, just like all
the others.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:12:23"></hs_TimeCode> answer has
to be to look for a political solution to the whole issue that must
involve Iran, Russia and all the neighbouring countries. Qatar and
Saudi Arabia are pouring money and arms into the situation. Russia is
supplying arms to Syria at the present time. Iran, as a
neighbouring state, feels that the war in Syria is a precursor to a
future invasion of Iran. I want the Minister to say that there is a
serious attempt to use the opportunity of the new President of Iran to
engage with the Iranian Government. We should obviously condemn
Iran’s human rights record—the executions and all the
other human rights abuses—but we will not achieve a political
solution in the whole area unless we engage with all the powers that
be, which must obviously include Iran. A date needs to be set for
Geneva II so 
<?notus-xml column=608?>that we can bring about some kind of political
solution that will end the fighting. All wars have to end with a
political solution; let us have it now rather after another 100,000 are

have been making my point about the debate after this one week in, week

destruction. Weapons of mass destruction—chemical
weapons—are known to exist in very substantial quantities in
Syria. We went to war in Iraq precisely to keep al-Qaeda from any
possibility of getting its hands on weapons of mass
destruction—chemical weapons—that were thought to
exist in Iraq. In this situation, people who wish to supply lethal aid
can have no guarantee that, if Assad falls, the chemical weapons that
he holds will not fall into the hands of the jihadists who are fighting
on the side of the opposition. You do not have to believe me, Mr

accountability through the House and its Select Committees, and we

transferring weaponry to states, but about providing weaponry to
factions within a state. We might say that the National Coalition is
the sole legitimate representative, although I do not hear that phrase
being used quite so forcefully now, but it is
certainly not the Government. Our Government 
<?notus-xml column=610?>would therefore be taking a decision to supply
weaponry to a faction within a wider faction, within a state that still
has a Government who control part of the territory, while other areas

Afriyie</B> (Windsor) (Con):</Member> For many reasons, it is
absolutely right that the House expresses its view before any lethal
action is taken in Syria. If we arm the rebels, that is likely to be
the first of many interventions. We cannot place arms in the hands of
rebels and then wash our hands of the consequences, and history tells
us that we cannot get half-involved with lethal force in a
conflict zone and then expect a quick, simple and bloodless exit at the
time of our
choosing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:22:16"></hs_TimeCode>. If we
impose a no-fly zone, as has been mentioned, we will need aggressively
to remove anti-aircraft assets, and if we arm the rebels with
sophisticated weaponry, we will need to get in there and train them.
This step would be the first of many on a slippery slope, so Parliament
must have its
say<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:22:29"></hs_TimeCode>. If step one
is to arm the rebels, step two is to become engulfed in a war and to be
dragged into all the consequences that follow or, worse still, to risk
the moral hazard of abandoning the rebels we wished to encourage and
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:22:46"></hs_TimeCode>. By

shall cut down my speech, given the time limit, but let me say that war

lead Britain into a foolhardy conflict on a false premise for reasons

repercussions over decades. Action should certainly not be taken

Stewart</B> (Beckenham) (Con):</Member> As the House may recall, in
1992-93, I was the first British United Nations commander sent into
Bosnia. I was sent for humanitarian reasons and with the mandate of the
Security Council. The Bosnian Muslims were fighting for their lives,
with precious few arms or equipment, primarily against the Bosnian
Serbs, who had largely appropriated the weapons and equipment of the
Yugoslav national army. In comparison with the Bosnian Muslims, the
Bosnian Serbs—and indeed the other warring faction, the Bosnian
Croats—were well equipped. I never saw a Bosnian Muslim tank.
The only armoured vehicles they possessed seemed to be a few 4x4s with
makeshift metal plates strung along their
sides<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:25:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000638" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000638">I
remember despairing that so many civilians were dying but no one was
able to defend them. In my reports up the chain of command, I
repeatedly argued that we should get involved, as well as arm, equip
and train the Bosnian Muslims so that they could better protect
themselves, even though that would have meant challenging the then
European arms embargo. Of course I felt that way on the
ground—who would not have done, given what my soldiers and I
witnessed? If I was in Syria today, I would feel exactly the same way.
My heart bleeds for anyone trapped in that
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:26:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000639" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000639">With
the passage of time, I have often wondered whether there would have
been a change in events if we had armed selected belligerent parties in
Bosnia. My conclusion now is that it would not have made much
difference. However, Syria is not like Bosnia, and I shall cite two
obvious
differences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:26:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071159000640" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000640">First, the
Bosnian Muslims were united, unlike the diverse groups that constitute
the Syrian rebel opposition. Worse still, it seems that the most
militarily successful group among the rebels is the al-Nusra Front,
which is directly affiliated with al-Qaeda. The rebels in Syria are
hardly a credible, unified entity. Even if we were to arm the
apparently moderate Free Syrian Army, there is no way we can forecast
its chances of securing power after the eventual fall of
Assad<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:27:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000641" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000641">Secondly,
we operated in Bosnia under Security Council resolution 775, which was
agreed by all five permanent members of the highest international
authority in the world. However, there is no international mandate for
action in Syria—Russia and China will not sign
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:28:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000642" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000642">I
would be willing to consider supporting humanitarian active operations
into Syria itself. Under certain circumstances, I might even support
some form of international military protection for aid convoys.
However, I have two caveats. As things stand, there
is neither the 
<?notus-xml column=612?>agreement of the warring factions to such
operations, nor a Security Council mandate for action. In truth,
addressing those circumstances seems highly unlikely in the foreseeable
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:28:43"></hs_TimeCode>. Unless
circumstances or the current situation change radically, I would not
support British arms being sent to the Syrian opposition, if such a

Bingham</B> (High Peak) (Con):</Member> I congratulate
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:29:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron) on securing the
debate. Given the shortage of time, I shall focus on the wording of the
motion. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:29:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis) said, we are discussing the
principle of the House having a vote on any decision, not the merits of
sending lethal assistance into Syria.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:29:23"></hs_TimeCode> believe very
strongly that it is Parliament that should decide and that we should
give the Government our
steer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:29:29"></hs_TimeCode>. A second
debate would give us all the opportunity to give our views and listen
to contrasting ones, and then we could decide whether we should get
involved in Syria and how. That is what
today’s debate is about: giving this House its
say<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:29:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000645" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000645">I
believe that many people in this country feel there is a
democratic deficit. They do not feel engaged with us in this place and
I think that if a decision is made outside this House, it will further
widen that gulf. We should give Parliament and Members of all parties a
say. We were voted in here to represent people’s views and that
is what we should
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:30:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000646" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000646">When
we sent troops into Iraq it was controversial and many people had a
view on it. I was not a Member of this place when that decision was
taken, but it was voted on here. If the decision about Syria is made
elsewhere, how will we be answerable to our constituents? If we make
the decision here, we will be. This is about the democratic
deficit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:30:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000647" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000647">There
is no bigger decision for an elected member than whether to send our
troops to war—it is a huge decision—but deciding whether
to send arms and lethal assistance is a close second. That is why the
decision should be taken by this House. It should be taken not only for
ethical reasons, but for democratic reasons. This House will be held
responsible for the decision no matter who makes it. We will have to
answer to our electorate, whether it be through our surgeries, e-mails
or letters. That is why I think that we as Members should be allowed to
contribute to the
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:31:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000648" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000648">As
has been said, the British public remember Iraq and Afghanistan.
Outside these walls, I sense among my High Peak electorate a growing
reluctance for this country to get involved in foreign conflicts. My
constituents ask whether it is our place to be the world’s
policeman. We could debate these issues in a second debate, to which
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:31:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for New Forest East referred so eloquently earlier
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:31:38"></hs_TimeCode>. If we have
that second debate—I believe we should—the public may not
agree with the decision this House makes, but if they can see that it
has been made through democratic means in this Chamber I think they
will acknowledge it. If it is not made in that way and is made in a
closed room, I think they will be
unforgiving<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:32:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000649" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000649">It
is ironic that in a discussion on democracy in a far-off land we are
debating our democratic right to make a decision. Democracy is a very
precious commodity —that is why we are
talking about it. Other countries 
<?notus-xml column=613?>would love to have it. Democracy should not only be
held and cherished; above all, it should be used. In this case, it is
crucial that we use it, and use it in this

other Members present, I spent some time as a member of the Committee
on Arms Export Controls, which gave me a picture of some of the issues
at stake. Like every previous speaker and many of my constituents, I am
appalled by the unfolding events in Syria—by President
Assad’s attacks on his people, the bloodshed, the destruction of
whole communities of whole towns and cities, and the huge transfer of
refugees out of, and displaced people in, the country. Like
many other contributors, I am frustrated that the usual levers do not
seem to work, that ethics and morality do not seem to have any force,
and that nations outside Syria are making the situation ever more
complex. Even an appeal to the basic common sense and pragmatism of the
country’s leaders is not delivering results. In the meantime,
the killing and destruction continue. There is also the threat of
chemical weapons, which I will ask the Minister about when I
conclude<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:33:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000652" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000652">We
are, of course, very angry about our impotence in this situation. I
caution the Government against letting their anger spill over into a
feeling that something must be done to assuage it. This has to be about
principled and measured steps. There are already at least two bulls in
this particular china shop and we should not put a third bull in
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:34:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000653" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000653">That

for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron), who introduced the
motion, and I do not agree, but on this issue we very much do agree. Of
course, it is right for this or any Government to use careful and
deliberate decision-making processes when deciding whether they want to
use force and, if so, what level of force. Of course, they will want to
keep their cards close to their chest—they do not want every
card they hold to be put up in lights before it is played—and,
of course, they will want to choose the timing of any announcement, not
simply because it might meet this House’s satisfaction, but
because it may be very important in terms of international
negotiations. I accept all of those constraints —if I may put it
that way—on how the Government might proceed, but I have to say
that successive Governments have a very poor record of judging which
cards to play and how and when to play

want to stress that this type of decision cannot be taken lightly. I
have visited refugee camps in Turkey and talked to those who have fled
for their lives, and I believe we need a chance to scrutinise the
situation carefully and to consider the consequences of our actions,
for which we would all be
responsible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:42:38"></hs_TimeCode>. We
all want to see the balance of power altered so that the Syrian people
have a chance at rebuilding their country, but my concern is that the
Government’s suggested proposal—that to strengthen
certain rebel groups would bring Assad to the conference
table—is like a very high-risk chess move or a game of bluff
that could go badly wrong. One has only to consider the reaction of
Russia and Iran to the easing of the EU arms embargo. They immediately
bolstered the Assad regime
militarily<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:43:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000670" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000670">I
want to consider another question that underscores the complexity of
the challenge. Why, after more than two years of fighting, is Assad
still in power? We can point to the material support provided by Iran
and Russia, which is significant; another factor might be the
international community’s reluctance to intervene militarily; 
<?notus-xml column=616?>but what is often underestimated is Assad’s
domestic backing from key communities beyond his core Alawite
constituency. The Ba’athist regime has promoted a secular
society in which the Christian community, which constitutes 10% of the
22 million population, as well as Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians, Turks,
Druze and other Shi’ites and secular Sunnis have coalesced to
shore up Assad’s
base<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:44:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000671" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000671">What
motivates and unites these communities is not so much any inherent love
of the Assad regime, but fear—fear of the chaos that would ensue
if Assad was overthrown; fear that the rebels will bring about not the
peaceful, multi-sectarian society to which we all aspire, but violent
retribution against them. This is where my concerns
lie.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000672" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000672">Rebel
groups have been accused of the indiscriminate shelling of civilian
areas such as Aleppo, and there are reports of extrajudicial killings
of pro-Government civilians. Human Rights Watch found that Syrian
rebels have kidnapped, detained and tortured Government fighters and
supporters, and we all know that when the heavy lid of authoritarian
rule is lifted, sectarian and tribal aspirations are often violently
unleashed.</hs_Para>

Government’s plan A is to force Assad to the conference table
and it fails, and if plan B is for the various opposition groups to
succeed militarily, we may face a humanitarian catastrophe. Those
groups already show no mercy and will, I fear, set out to massacre any
group seen or perceived to have supported the Assad regime. We will
then not be dealing with 1.5 million refugees, but with perhaps 4
million, 5 million or 6 million people fleeing across the
borders to Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan. I believe the priority is
to bring Assad, Iran and Russia to the conference table.</hs_Para>

Brooks Newmark</B> (Braintree) (Con):</Member> In the land of the blind
the one-eyed man is king, and I have probably spent more time in Syria
than most Members of this House, including meeting Bashar Assad up
to 10 times over a six-year period. My experience of Syria is
very different from the Syria we have heard about today. Syria has
always been a highly secular country. There is no Salafi tradition in
Syria; it has more of a Sufi tradition and a mystical approach to
Islam. There was no sense of radicalism there, so how have we got from
where we were to where we are today with a highly sectarian divide and
the potential for a fragmented Somalia on the
Mediterranean?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000676" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000676">We
must remember how this began, which was when a 13-year-old boy in Daraa
had the audacity to urinate on a poster of President Assad. The
security forces took him, beat him up, killed him, cut off his penis,
and returned him to his parents. That sparked massive outrage among
civilians in five different cities and was the beginning of the Arab
Spring. Those who point to hardly any complicity of the Assad regime in
causing what is happening today should think carefully. It made a very
bad situation worse with civil disobedience met by repression.
Ultimately, individuals felt that they had to protect their
communities, and small militias were set up in various towns. The Free
Syrian army was really a fragmented group of people, and only more
recently has it become a little more co-ordinated under General Idris.
The Syrian National Council has been equally dysfunctional and has not
sought to reach out at all beyond the Sunni community.</hs_Para>

when I was in Cairo, there was an opportunity and the Russians said
that they would try to lead engagement. The regime was feeling
insecure, but unfortunately Minister Lavrov dropped the ball. He did
not do anything and, in fact, the opposite happened. Iran and Russia
provided more arms, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard bolstered the
Assad regime, including his personal bodyguard, which became a member
of the IRG. Until then I had always believed in engagement, but
Al-Qusayr was a turning point. The regime knew it could not win alone,
so Iran and Hezbollah came in and gave it the support to win Al-Qusayr.
I changed my mind and believe that one needs to do a little more than
simply provide humanitarian aid. From my understanding of Assad, he
will have to be pushed, or driven kicking and screaming to the
negotiating table.</hs_Para>

there are 70 to 80 citizens of the United Kingdom who are today with

fifth recommendation is this. I am not asking for British soldiers on
the ground or for our pilots’ lives to be put at risk; I am
asking for what the Syrian people have set out to me time and time
again. We need to rebalance the situation on the ground. We need to arm
the Free Syrian army and support General Idris. If we do not,
unfortunately more and more of the Free Syrian army—the
moderates—will drift towards the extremists. I am afraid that
inaction will breed extremism and the fragmentation of Syria.
Supporting the Free Syrian army is also more likely to bring Assad and
Russia to the negotiating table.</hs_Para>

without fear of repetition, of saying things that have not been said

the Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron) on
securing it. I look up at the Annunciator screen, which shows the title
of the debate as “Arms to Syria”, and wonder whether it
should say “Arms to the Middle East”. We are considering
arming the Free Syrian army, but we also have arms contracts going back
many years with Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region. We have
never come to this Chamber to authorise the Government to make those
arms deals. I am therefore not in favour of the motion.</hs_Para>

the motion concerned committing British forces on the ground in Syria,
I would suggest it appropriate, for reasons that pre-date my time in
the House, to have a debate and a vote. On Iraq and on other conflicts
we have been involved in, the public have lost faith in the democratic
process in relation to how Britain engages in military
conflicts around the world. All I see in the world at the moment is
increasing chaos, so I suspect that we will find ourselves involved in
other conflicts in the middle east in the near future. We need to take
the British public with us, and that involves our being able to go back
to our constituencies and make a case for intervention.</hs_Para>

is a country created by the colonial pen strokes of Sykes-Picot, and
other countries across the middle east were created by former colonial
masters. On top of that, one lays the Sunni/Shi’a split, a sense
of an Islamic reformation taking place, and the unresolved issues
concerning democracy and Islam. I am no historian, but it feels like
the Catholic Church in the 16th century wrestling with how to give
power back to Governments of free and increasingly democratic nations.
Because of the complexity of the situation and the fact that we are
trying to look at these issues through the prism of countries that will
probably not exist in 10 years’ time—there will be
fragmentation—it is extremely difficult to come here and talk
about sending arms to a particular country that would not have existed
had it been created on tribal lines and by taking ethnic loyalties into
account.</hs_Para>

Britain’s best interests. I think it is in
Britain’s best interests to have as coherent and 
<?notus-xml column=620?>consistent a policy as can be applied across the
middle east. After Syria, this situation could fall into Lebanon,
Jordan and, dare I say it, Saudi Arabia, with the consequent impact on
energy prices and so on. It is in Britain’s interests to garner
the trust and support of the wider Arab public, and not just intervene
and fiddle around the edges. I could come here and vote for a
commitment on the ground in the middle east. I struggle to come here to
vote for a commitment to arm just one particular

Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood) said earlier about public
distrust. I agree with him, given the disastrous cock-ups in Iraq and
Afghanistan. As a journalist and as a Member of Parliament, I have seen
the way in which pliant officials in the Ministry of Defence and the
Foreign Office have done the will—or what they think is the
will—of their political masters. In future, if it is possible,
we need the reality check of a Commons vote in order to create clarity

this side of the House, we have for some time supported the provision
of non-lethal support to Syria, including water purification, vehicles

House still has no codified role in approving participation in military
action. In 2003, the Iraq war debate established a working
precedent—certainly a powerful political precedent—that
UK troops should not be committed unless there had been an opportunity

retrospective approval for the deployment of forces to Libya was sought

national debate about the Iraq war defines the present context in which
the approach to intervention takes place. We have seen that
intervention of itself does not secure answers. Rather, it is a
starting point, which can have both positive and negative consequences.
The United Kingdom has a long history of involvement in the middle
east—a history that colours perceptions of any actions that we
take in this area. We must take account of those perceptions when
assessing whether any intervention we take will be for the best. We
must also define very closely indeed what the intervention should be.

their remarks. There are millions of Syrians who want a peaceful and
democratic future, and legitimate forces are fighting for their
interests. We should be on their side. However, the extremist groups
operating inside—affiliated to or aligned with
al-Qaeda—are taking advantage of ungoverned spaces created by
the conflict. They pose risks to UK national security. We judge that
more than 100 UK-linked individuals of concern have travelled to Syria.
Some individuals returning to the UK could pose a long-term terrorist
threat.</hs_Para>

Friend the Secretary of State for International Development—on
UK aid in response to the Syria crisis, dated 4 July. It deals with
some key facts on what we are doing. I will ask my right hon. Friend to
make sure that it is e-mailed to every colleague, because, as more than
one Member has mentioned, the humanitarian assistance is not a

Burt:</Member></B> Well, I do not believe so. Let me comment on
something that is at the nub of this: the long shadow of Iraq. I am
convinced that when this Government took office we were very well aware
of the deficiency in trust felt in the nation on account of that. My
sense is that, particularly in respect of the area my portfolio covers,
in the last two or three years both the Prime Minister and the Foreign
Secretary have repeatedly updated the House on circumstances as they
have arisen. They have been very conscientious in doing that. The
National Security Council was created precisely to try to find a
structure that could address the concerns about foreign policy
decisions that people had felt in the past. I believe that right from
the beginning as the UK considered all its options—and I repeat,
despite whatever I have said, that all options remain on the
table—both 
<?notus-xml column=625?>the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister have been very keen to
ensure that the House has been engaged, because ultimately this is an
issue of trust.</hs_Para>

on to the point made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:18:23"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Hazel Grove (Sir Andrew Stunell) and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:18:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Croydon South (Richard Ottaway) about the possibility of
something being sneaked through in the recess.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:18:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Walsall North (Mr Winnick) also talked about that. The whole point
of what the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have been doing has
been to generate trust in the House. If the Government were to do
something and then seek retrospective support in respect of an issue
where Members felt we should have come before the House in advance,
that trust would be broken, which would run contrary to what the
Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister wish to convey.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:19:21"></hs_TimeCode> may still be
the case, of course, that emergencies arise that require the Head of
Government to have the flexibility to make decisions in the national
interest, as the House would expect, and the debate on Iran some time
ago indicated that no hands should be bound. The clear intention of
what I am saying and what the Foreign Secretary has sought to do,
however, is that the Government want to keep the confidence of the
House by going this extra step. So there is no question of our trying
to use the recess or another opportunity to do something, because we
would then have to come back to the House—and what would be the
House’s reaction? I have tried to make clear the intention on
which the Government are determined to act.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Andrew Bingham) said that many
people were asking what is in our national interest. Importantly,
whether a decision is made to arm or not, there is a UK interest that
needs to be considered. Let us make no mistake: whether we continue on
our current course or do something different, we are involved. As a
permanent member of the Security Council, we have an interest in
promoting peace in the most conflict-ridden areas. It is to the
discredit of the international community that that has not been
possible, but that has not been due to any sparing of effort on our
part at the United Nations. The conflict has been spilling over into
neighbouring areas, as we have seen with Hezbollah and Lebanon. As my
hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr Newmark) said,
if<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:20:52"></hs_TimeCode> empty space
is used, that is where a threat to and an attack on the United Kingdom
can come from. We know that people are going out there to be
radicalised, and that will come back to bite us as well. Whatever is
done—whatever decision is taken—nobody in this House can
escape the fact that there is British interest in Syria.
Accordingly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:21:57"></hs_TimeCode>, our
main interest is in closing this down and ending the conflict. This is
not a plea from me to arm; I am saying that unless the conflict is
ended, British interests will continue to be further damaged.</hs_Para>

not the case. On 20 April, the Syrian National Coalition declared its
commitment to democracy, ethnic and religious pluralism, and the rule
of law, and it rejected discrimination and extremism. It also declared
that it would guard against the proliferation of any supplied lethal
equipment and would return such equipment at the end of the conflict,

the night of 6 July 1988, an incident occurred on the Piper Alpha
platform that led to the deaths of 167 men. It was the worst
tragedy in the offshore oil and gas industry anywhere in the world. It
was the direct consequence of negligence, bad management at every
level, poor maintenance, extremely weak regulation and failure
to have proper work systems in place or a proper safety strategy for
major incidents. The regulation management and safety systems failed at
every level. Those 167 men died, survivors suffered the most traumatic
experience that any of us could imagine, many of them being seriously
injured, and of course the families and relatives of those
involved have been irrevocably
damaged.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000872" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000872">I

just as vivid and distressing as it was then. The pain does not go

colleagues are well aware, following the disaster Lord Cullen was
appointed to lead an inquiry into the disaster. He made 106
recommendations. The Cullen report was welcomed on all sides. It has
changed the safety culture in the North sea and throughout the global
oil and gas industry. Aside from the practical workplace and management
issues, the most important recommendation was on the question of who
should be the regulator. From the beginning of the North sea industry,
the Piper and all other North sea installations were regulated by the
then Department of Energy.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:42:39"></hs_TimeCode> 
<?notus-xml column=630?>Department had two fundamental problems. The first was the conflict
between its responsibility to maximise oil production and its duty as a
regulator. More importantly, the Cullen report made the
Department’s inadequacies abundantly clear. Cullen recommended
that responsibility for offshore safety should be handed over to the
Health and Safety Executive, where it resides today.</hs_Para>

the main, the HSE, through its offshore division, has been a good
regulator, and there has been substantial improvement in the
industry’s safety record.
Recently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:44:21"></hs_TimeCode>,
however, concerns were raised when the HSE announced that the offshore
division was being merged into a new energy division. The announcement
was made without any apparent consultation with the industry, unions or
Members of Parliament. That raised concern on all sides, particularly
as to whether the decision was driven by cuts in funding. However, we
eventually received from the chair the rationale for the move.
Ministers also came in with a promise of some extra
inspectors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:43:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000877" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000877">The
most recent information I have on staffing in the offshore division is
that it has 109 full-time equivalent staff—14 more than 2010, so
that is significant progress. However, across the HSE the total number
of inspectors has fallen by 75 from 1,316 to 1,241. In future, with a
merged division, it might be much more difficult for us to identify the
precise numbers of dedicated offshore inspectors.
Broadly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:44:00"></hs_TimeCode>
speaking, there has been a steady improvement in the safety regime and
in accident rates, but the industry remains dangerous compared with
other UK industries. In 2011-12 the fatality rate was 6.9 per
100,000 workers compared with 0.6 for all UK workers. The major injury
and fatality rate per 100,000 workers for offshore oil and gas is
130.8, compared with 90.4 for all UK workers. However, at a major event
last week, a representative of one of the major oil companies cited a
statistic suggesting that, on the basis of last year’s figures,
the industry was the third safest, behind banking and education, but I
have not seen that
information<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:44:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000878" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000878">Beyond
safety, the other major issue facing the industry is the continuing
problem of gas escapes on offshore platforms. We should remember that a
gas leak led to the Piper Alpha tragedy. In 2011-12, there
were 94 hydrocarbon releases, 44 of which were classified as
significant. Nine of those were identified as a major incident, which
is a leak that, if ignited, would cause an explosion capable of causing
multiple casualties. Those nine cases were therefore very serious
incidents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:45:26"></hs_TimeCode>. Last
year, the Elgin-Franklin complex, which is operated by Total, was
closed down because of a major gas leak. It was restarted, but then
shut down again, and it was not fully operational until March this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:45:38"></hs_TimeCode>. Gas leak
statistics, like those for injury rates, are showing a steady
improvement, but the volume of escapes and the scale of the
Elgin-Franklin problem show that there is still a lot of work to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:45:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000879" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000879"><Member ContinuationText="Anas Sarwar" PimsId="5637" UID="13071159001694" xid="1071" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159001694"><B>Anas

HSE has been increasingly proactive. It has embarked on several
projects, one of the most important of which is the key programme
project, which involves an assessment of the integrity of offshore
installations. The KP3 report, which was published a few years ago,
followed an assessment of 100 platforms. It told us that, in a number
of cases, the industry was slipping back on areas such as the
maintenance of platforms. In the run-up to the 20th
anniversary of the Piper Alpha disaster, the then Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions ordered a review of KP3, which showed that the
industry had responded to its findings and that improvements were being
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:47:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000884" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000884">We
have now reached the KP4 stage, and the interim report identifies
several issues relating to ageing plant. Oil and Gas UK, the industry
body, has established working groups to produce guidance and promote
improvements. I understand that, as at the end of March, HSE had
undertaken KP4 inspections of more than 75% of operators. The
Department of Energy and Climate Change has also set up a
senior oversight group, which includes the HSE, to supervise the
implementation of the review’s recommendations. Such an
integrated approach is necessary and
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:48:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000885" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000885">While
the industry is making progress on safety, the KP3 report shows that
the regulator needs to be ever vigilant. A good job has been done, but
several points still need to be considered. The trade union side
recognises that progress has been made in the industry, but its
officials are aware that there are several installations on which
workers are afraid to bring up safety issues with their employers. Some
employers tell union officials that they are put under pressure by the
staff of the operator—the client—to cut
corners<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:49:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000886" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000886">The
regulator also identifies problems. At the Piper 25 conference, Steve
Walker, the retiring head of the offshore safety division, made several
points, including about the control of work. The inadequacy—and
failure—of the permit-to-work system led directly to the Piper
Alpha disaster, and it is still a key weakness for the industry. Poor
isolation and inadequate adherence to permit systems remain a common
thread during incident
investigation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000887" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000887">Another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:49:25"></hs_TimeCode>
key Cullen recommendation is not being fully adhered to by some
companies. The regulator is regularly taking enforcement action for
maintenance and testing temporary safe refuges. A Health and Safety
Executive inspection in 2011 found that there was still variation in
the implementation of safety representative legislation. In other
words, it is not being
applied<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:49:52"></hs_TimeCode>

last point is important, because one of the major steps that has been
taken by the industry, with the full support of the HSE, is to
recognise that safety 
<?notus-xml column=632?>offshore can only improve with the full engagement of the work force.

Goodman</B> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab):</Member> I congratulate my hon.
Friend on securing this very important debate. I was on the energy desk
at the Treasury when the Piper Alpha accident happened and it was truly
terrible. One of the things I remember is that there were communication

working offshore on British and American-managed platforms simply did
not understand what was going on. Does my hon. Friend know whether that

Doran:</Member></B> That certainly was not an issue for Lord Cullen. I
think that the communication difficulty was the failure to have a
proper management structure in place with a process to deal with such
an incident. The only message that was put out was a mayday message.
From recollection, I think that two foreigners—a Frenchman and,
I think, a Spaniard—were killed in the Piper Alpha incident, so
there was no issue
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:51:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000891" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000891">Under
Step Change in Safety, materials have been produced and conferences
held to encourage employers to accept that top-down management does not
work. Full engagement and involvement of the work force at every stage
of the work process is crucial. There is no doubt that there is a great
deal of traction in the principles being set out by Step Change in
Safety and most operations offshore are embracing the changes, some
more enthusiastically than
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:51:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000892" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000892">At
the Piper 25 conference, I attended a session where employees of Maersk
Oil, which is fairly new to the North sea, spoke about its approach. It
has gone for full engagement and has introduced a system that involves
new rules about handling safety issues, encouraging workers to come
forward with ideas to improve safety and to report safety concerns
without fear of sanction and so on. Maersk Oil has produced statistics
which show that since the inception of the new ideas, accidents have
declined significantly and profits have increased. They present a
win-win scenario—safer workplace, increased
profit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:52:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000893" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000893">Others,
while accepting the basic principle and making some progress, have been
less enthusiastic. Old habits die hard and trade union officials and
regulators tell me that as soon as they step off the helicopter and on
to an offshore platform they can read the mood of the work force and
what sort of approach the employer is taking to work-force
engagement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:52:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000894" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000894">Despite
that, there is no doubt that serious progress is being made. I have
been involved with the oil and gas industry in one way or another for
nearly 40 years. For most of that time, management was top down, harsh
and very anti union, with a few exceptions on the contracting side. I
would be a fantasist to suggest that the industry fully embraces trade
unions. However, significant progress is being made. The industry
recognises that the unions can make a valuable contribution to the
workplace and safety. Trade unions are represented on the board of the
industry training body OPITO—the Offshore Petroleum Industry
Training Organisation—and one of the representatives chaired it
for a number of years. Two full-time union officers were appointed to
the separate task forces set up to look into the Super 
<?notus-xml column=633?>Puma helicopter disaster a few years ago and the
consequences of the Macondo incident in the gulf of Mexico. At this
year’s industry safety awards the keynote speaker was the

of the major issues for the industry this year has been the threat from
the European Union to take control of offshore safety. A number of very
senior figures in the industry have assured me that the turning point
in a meeting with the Commission was the presentation made by John
Taylor, a full-time official of Unite who would put to shame the Prime
Minister’s cartoon image of Unite
members<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:53:53"></hs_TimeCode>—I

raise these issues because my biggest fear about the integrity of the
steadily improving safety environment in the offshore industry is that
the process is running in direct contradiction to Government policy. If
we leave the union relationship aside, the industry is putting huge
effort into its worker engagement and involvement strategy. It
recognises the value of the worker on the shop floor, seeing him or her
as a vital part of the business, contributing to the safety of the
enterprise and—if we follow the Maersk line—its
profitability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:54:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000897" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0003.htm#13071159000897">Meanwhile,
at the national level, we have various reports, including the Beecroft
report, whose objective seems to be to take us back to Victorian times,
chipping away at rights at work and job security, and changes to health
and safety legislation. At a time when the oil and gas industry is
still operating in one of the most dangerous work environments in the
country, placing responsibility for safety on its work force and
valuing each individual as a key part of the enterprise, I do not want
to see these gains whittled away by Government
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:55:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Out of
the Piper Alpha tragedy, there is clear evidence of serious progress on
safety brought about by the close working together of industry workers
and trade unions, but the North sea is a dangerous place and we
cannot be complacent. The memory of the fate of the workers on that
night in July 1988 should spur us on to achieve and maintain a safe
working environment for all

represent a coastal constituency where for centuries the economy and
jobs have been inextricably linked to the North sea: in fishing and
over the past 40 years in the oil and gas sector. While Piper Alpha was
in the northern North sea, the tragedy could have occurred anywhere,
and the people who work in the sector are often drawn from communities
in Scotland, the north-east and East Anglia. They share a bond and
invariably there are no boundaries to where they work. At present,
increased activity in the North sea in both the oil and gas and
renewables sectors presents East Anglia with considerable job creation
opportunities. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:57:05"></hs_TimeCode>

doing so we must always keep safety at the forefront of

recent days the newspapers, television and graphic words of those who

This was not an unpredictable “act of God”, but an

thorough and excellent inquiry left no stone unturned in establishing
what happened and made 106 recommendations to improve safety. All these

lie ahead. The blueprint that Lord Cullen set down should be viewed as
a living document that must evolve to meet these challenges. To be
fair, though, I do not detect any complacency from the Government in
their pursuit of the highest safety standards. In the 10 years
following the Step Change in Safety initiative in 1997, the number of
fatal and major injuries fell by 70%. The 2010 target for reducing the

more than I expected to be, particularly when the families were invited

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:07:45"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

approach. My instinct is that I genuinely believe top management when
they say to me, “Safety is paramount.” They believe that
that is what drives their culture. The problem is that people down the
line have a dilemma. Their job is to produce oil and gas. If somebody
says, “I’ve got a problem,” or,
“I’ve got an anxiety,” there is a tension. Bob
Keiller, the chief executive of the Wood Group, made an impressive
speech at a dinner a couple of weeks ago in Aberdeen, in which he

moral responsibility to ensure that people get back to their families,

However, the industry faces difficulties on safety. One thing that has

North sea. Many of them remember Piper Alpha and have been brought up

people are being encouraged to join the industry through very good work

North sea is a mature basin these days, but the industry is still

Shetland, in very deep and dangerous conditions. It will be very
difficult to get oil out of there, and it is important that we continue

has been a refocusing on safety, but a danger is creeping in because
the risks that are the easiest to measure are the slips, trips and

chasing of statistics that has focused on that element, and perhaps a
lack of recognition of the importance of structural safety and
integrity. The KP3 and KP4 reports focused on ensuring that that was
understood. Structural safety issues might not show up so often in the

dramatic and serious. That structural safety element must be
paramount.</hs_Para>

Post-Macondo, we 
<?notus-xml column=640?>have the restructuring of the safety and environment
regime as a result of the EU’s intervention, which will divert
resources into resubmitting safety cases, rather than looking at new
safety cases. Someone working offshore now aged 30 was just starting
primary school when Piper Alpha happened. It is important for that
legacy to be passed on to the next generation and to the new owners who
have mainly not inherited the same culture as the original owners of
the platforms. Redoubling safety is the best legacy for the members of
Piper Alpha.</hs_Para>

Piper Alpha disaster that they realised just how dangerous the job was.
It certainly changed for ever the offshore oil and gas industry, which
woke up to the dangers of the business and how heavy a price had to be
paid if safety was not embedded into everything it did. Here was a
stark and tragic illustration of just how important a strict safety
regime is, and how crucial it is to carry out maintenance in a timely

I was a student, I worked in the purchasing department of
Occidental’s headquarters in Aberdeen throughout the summer of
1977. Occidental was the operator of Piper Alpha, and it was found
culpable by Lord Cullen’s inquiry. Despite that, no one was
prosecuted. It was enough, however, for Occidental to disappear as a
company and in a supreme irony, the building that housed Occidental in
Aberdeen, where I had worked throughout that summer, became the home of

that marking the anniversary of such a disaster is somehow maudlin,
wallowing in tragedy and should be only for those directly affected,
but I am not one of them. The memorial is very important for the whole
offshore industry. It acts as a stark reminder of just how important it
is to take safety seriously, never to let standards slip and to listen
to people who are expressing concerns about particular working
practices. Memories do fade, and attention to a safety regime can fade

those working in the industry to pause and to take stock of what
improvements could be made, to shake out any complacency that may have

the face of the European directive introduced last month, which
requires member states to nominate a “competent

directive’s provisions on planning for responses and preventing
major hazards.
Prior<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:29:15"></hs_TimeCode> to the

unnecessary for the UK, as that extra regulation would largely mirror

at the cessation of a stand-alone, specialist offshore safety

that the decision to scrap the OSD will undermine safety, with 62%
venturing that changes of this nature risk a repeat of Piper Alpha.
This is not a risk we should be taking, particularly at a time when
platforms and infrastructure are ageing and the risk of safety issues
is potentially increasing. Indeed, when speaking

years have passed and we can be thankful that we have seen no other
disasters of this scale in our offshore oil industry. However,
complacency on safety in the environments we now look to explore could
again exact a terrible price if we do not remember Piper Alpha. We have
seen again evidence of concern with the BP environmental disaster in
the deep waters of the gulf of Mexico, which reminds us that we are
pushing the boundaries of oil and gas exploration and retrieval. The
men of Piper Alpha should never be forgotten as those who paid the
ultimate price; they were pioneers prepared to work in one of the most
dangerous environments, so that we can enjoy an uninterrupted supply in
our energy demand. The lasting legacy of Piper Alpha should be a legacy

already make the sacrifice of having long weeks with loved ones away

can expect is that we have done all we can to guarantee

four minutes past 10 and eight minutes past 10, three mayday

major explosion occurred on the platform when the Tartan gas
riser ruptured, and the first men began jumping into the North sea from
the north-west corner of the platform. By 10 to 11, there was a further
massive explosion caused by the rupture of another gas riser, this time
from MCP-01. That was the most powerful, projecting debris over 800
metres and with enough force to be felt more than a mile

scale of the disaster called for a radical rethink of the safety

Cullen provided. His 106 recommendations covered the safety regime,
design of platforms, procedures for evacuations and the involvement of
the work force. The safety case regime meant a rigorous system that
elevated responsibility for safety on the platforms to board level. The
move of the regulator from the Department of Energy to the Health and
Safety Executive removed the conflict of interest caused by the
Department being both regulator and beneficiary of the oil and gas
extracted from the North

of the linchpins of the Cullen report was the establishment of the

the dedicated division for the first time since Lord Cullen’s

well as focusing on the families, as was right, every contribution we
heard today also focused on safety. In my role as Secretary of State, I
have seen at first hand over the past three years the work of many
companies in north-east Scotland that are at the forefront of the
industry. The people who work for them are at the front line, and all
the way back through the supply chain it matters that safety counts at
every turn. The industry employs over 29,000 people offshore at any one
time and supports hundreds of thousands more jobs onshore, and
£11.2 billion was paid in tax on production in 2011-12, so it is
really important to the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000997" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0004.htm#13071159000997">The
industry faces challenges in the years ahead as we seek to access
reserves that are becoming ever harder to reach. We are rightly focused
on ensuring that the correct fiscal regime is in place to drive the
necessary investment to maximise the returns from the UK continental

nothing unless we maintain the strongest possible safety regime for
those working offshore. We need to ensure the viability and security of
that key sector of the UK economy, but every bit as important is the
protection of the individuals who work in
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159000998" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0004.htm#13071159000998"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:52:15"></hs_TimeCode>We
have heard many observations this afternoon about the Cullen inquiry.
We still owe Lord Cullen a huge debt for his recommendations, which
have been implemented in full. A revolution took place in North sea
safety as a result of the lessons learnt from the Piper 
<?notus-xml column=649?>Alpha catastrophe. We have a duty to maintain the
highest possible standards. Only recently the European Commission
published its directive on oil and gas safety and environmental
measures. It borrows heavily from the United Kingdom’s regime,
which we welcome. We are committed to meeting the implementation
deadline in July 2015 and will immediately be working with the
industry, the work force and other interested parties to develop the
necessary legislation. We envisage the formal consultation taking place
from the spring of 2014.</hs_Para>

Alpha might have revolutionised North sea safety, but Deepwater

there is never any room for complacency, and that must begin in
government. We recognise that this is not just about action from the

number of Members mentioned the Health and Safety Executive and the
creation of a new energy division that will bring together its offshore
division, its gas and pipeline specialists, both onshore and offshore,
and its mines inspectorate. At the heart of these changes is our desire

programme, as in the past, and that is important. The HSE has also been
given ministerial approval to recruit additional offshore staff and to
widen the range of recruitment methods to maximise the chances of
identifying suitable recruits. Hon. Members have made detailed points
and broader points about health and safety, and I will ask
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:54:36"></hs_TimeCode> Minister of
State, Department for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Fareham

issue that has been raised is the impact of asset life extension on
safety in the North sea, and it is right that we should turn our
attention to that. In the 2008 debate mentioned by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:54:58"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Stirling, there was a commitment to review the key programme
3 report on asset integrity, which had shown some less than
satisfactory outcomes. The review found that the industry had allocated
considerable new resource and effort to improve offshore assets,
supported by evidence of good progress in addressing more general
issues identified by the KP 3 work. The findings of the review show
that we all need to recognise the ongoing need to keep our focus on the
assets that we have.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:55:44"></hs_TimeCode> is why it
is so essential that the HSE-initiated KP4, the ageing and life
extension inspection programme, also comes to fruition. That programme
will run until December this year before finalising its findings. An
interim report was published last autumn and we aim to publish the
final report as soon as possible after it has
concluded.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159001003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0004.htm#13071159001003">Throughout
the debate, Members have rightly focused on the role of the work force
in the North sea. We continue to seek the highest level of engagement
with the work force at every turn, particularly in relation to safety.
Nobody is closer to those hazards or understands them better than those
who work on the different platforms and installations, and we have to
ensure that we work closely with them in designing and maintaining our
safety regime. However, as Members have highlighted, safety culture
cannot be achieved simply through legislation. It is a combination of
many factors, including leadership 
<?notus-xml column=650?>and basic competence that translates into a set of
behaviours at all levels in an organisation. That is why it is so
important that the industry keeps working with all its different
stakeholders to ensure that safety is at the heart of every
regime.</hs_Para>

for those of us in the north-east who are in direct contact with the

thoughts occur to me. First, it is always helpful to have a debate
about the reality of health and safety and the consequences for those
who work in any industry of poor safety systems, a lack of safety
systems, or poor management of safety systems. We have been talking
about the awful reality in, yes, an admittedly extreme case. Away from
the cauldron of party and ideological differences, we have made the
important point that health and safety is fundamental, as Bob Keiller
said and as many others involved in the North sea are recognising, as
are, I hope, people throughout the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:58:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159001007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0004.htm#13071159001007">Secondly,
my right hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs McGuire) reminded me
of Gavin Cleland, whose son tragically died in the incident. I first
met Gavin in the Shadow Cabinet Room after it happened. He was part of
a group I had brought down to London because they wanted to meet the
various politicians involved, including the then Secretary of State for
Energy. One of Gavin’s ambitions was to campaign for a
prosecution, because that is one of the key things that is missing from
the case. Despite all the evidence in the Cullen report and everywhere
else, there was no prosecution. I am not calling for a prosecution at
this stage, but at a time when many historical cases are being looked
at in retrospect, such as Hillsborough and events in Northern Ireland,
re-examining the Piper Alpha case is worth considering. What holds me
back, however, is the fact that that might be difficult for a lot of
those who were involved, especially the survivors and the

In the light of those new proposals, I argue that we need fresh

state that that needs to be a material consideration at the planning

the location of children’s homes, although we must give priority
to the needs of vulnerable children, we must also consider the needs of

eloquently outlined the planning arrangements, and I hope she will
forgive me if I go through them to make things absolutely clear. Use
classes orders operate by grouping together land uses that have similar
impact into “classes”. The order—this is the
specific point—allows changes between certain land uses where
the impact would be minimal, without the need for planning permission.
Change of use is allowed within the same class, and there are cases, as
the hon. Lady rightly says, where movement between classes is
permitted. For example, premises currently used as a
restaurant, which is class A3, could be converted to a
shop—class A1—without seeking planning permission. That
is because the impact of a shop on the surrounding area is likely to be
the same or less than that of a
restaurant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159001040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0004.htm#13071159001040">The
hon. Lady suggested the creation of a new use class category for
children’s homes. The use classes order is intended to be
deregulatory, however, allowing changes of use with minimal impact on
land use and amenity. That removes the time and expense of making
planning applications, and allows local authorities to concentrate
their planning resources where they are most
needed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159001041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0004.htm#13071159001041">Under
the use classes order, children’s homes—depending on
their particular type—can either be in an ordinary family home,
which as the hon. Lady rightly says is classed as C3, or in a dedicated
residential institution, classed as C2. It is for local planning
authorities to decide on a case-by-case basis into which class a
particular use falls. I would expect most children’s homes to
fall into the C2 category, which is the same class as other residential
institutions such as nursing homes or training centres. Some smaller
children’s homes could fall into family house class C3, which
provides for small groups of people living together as a single
household, including cases where there is an element of
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T17:19:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071159001042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/debtext/130711-0004.htm#13071159001042">When

context of a planning application, because planning is concerned
primarily with the use of land and the effect on amenity of an
alteration or 
<?notus-xml column=657?>change to the use of land. Planning is not intended to deal with

a risk assessment of the area in which they plan to operate and a list
of safeguards regarding how they will mitigate any identified risks.
That would include the sort of issues raised by the hon. Lady about
prostitution, drug dealing and serious crime. The potential provider

complied with those duties, registration could be refused or suspended.

children at significant distance from their home. We know that such
children are more likely to go missing from care and be at risk of
exploitation. Proposals include a requirement for a senior local
authority official to sign off all placements that are at a significant
distance from the child’s home. They also require the placing
authority to consult with the area authority prior to placement to

vulnerable children being exploited or getting involved in crime. We
are consulting on plans so that children’s homes work much more
closely with police and local authorities to prevent children going
missing. We are strengthening the rules so that local authorities take
decisive action where children are at risk of going missing,

conclusion, we fully agree with the hon. Lady’s aims, but do not

use classes orders. Some want to make it easier to change use, while
others want to see greater restrictions. I think that we probably have
the balance right at the moment, but I give the hon. Lady the assurance
that we will continue to keep under review the use classes order in
general, and we will continue to keep under review the issue of
planning guidance, particularly in relation to the point she

conversation, we tend to use the word “ability” to
indicate that we believe that someone has a special talent. We mean
that someone has the ability to play the piano or tennis or to speak in
public rather well. That is an inaccurate way to use the word, but it
can sometimes lead to the false view that a disabled person is seeking
special attention. We have heard that for ourselves:
“They’re always after something.” Such disparaging
remarks are often made. The reality is that that is simply not true.
What disabled people seek constantly is not special attention at
all—as a good liberal, I would say this, wouldn’t
I?—but the basic human right to a normal life.</hs_Para>

that does not mean that people with disabilities cannot ascend the
heights and cannot have unbelievable special abilities—we know
that all too well, and history is full of countless examples—but
the starting place must be the basic human right to access all
life’s opportunities, such as work, leisure and family, things
that non-disabled people far too often take for granted. As a good
left-of-centre liberal, I believe that the state has an important role
to play in supporting people, not necessarily through direct state
provision but by helping them attain their rights.</hs_Para>

power and force to our arguments when bidding to the Backbench Business
Committee for this debate, we were rightly asked to justify the time
devoted. We were given eligibility criteria, including topicality and
importance. As for topicality, we know that social 
<?notus-xml column=126?>care is the largest remaining area of reform for the coalition
Government in this Parliament, and the Care Bill is on its way through
the legislative process. The crucial issue of eligibility, to which I
will return, is extremely topical, not least for people in Bradford,
where the council is one of the few remaining local authorities to use
the moderate level of need when assessing support. However, the council
is consulting as we speak with a view to moving to assessments of
substantial need. That consultation will last until 4 August.</hs_Para>

importance, we must acknowledge that much of the debate about meeting
and funding care needs has focused on the elderly. We understand the
reason perfectly, but we must also remember that one third of care
users are working-age disabled adults. That one third equates to more
than 500,000 people between the ages of 18 and 64. It is a big issue
for us as a nation, and the numbers are projected to increase
substantially. In addition, working-age adults have considerably
different aspirations from the social care system. They are not more
important, but they are different and must be clearly understood when
developing social
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000016">A
report called “The other care crisis: Making social care funding
work for disabled adults in England” was published in January
this year by Scope, the National Autistic Society, Mencap, Leonard
Cheshire Disability and Sense. The report highlights the fact that,
since 2008, there has been a constant move from moderate to substantial
needs as the basis for assessment in local authorities. Since 2008, the
number of people using care, at a time when we know need is increasing,
has fallen by at least 90,000, or one in six of all people using care.
We also know that there is a shortfall of £1.2
billion in the funding required to support social care for working-age
disabled adults.</hs_Para>

states that if social care reforms go ahead as planned, a further
100,000 people or more risk losing vital care and support. I know the

human right to live an independent life? That is not a freedom: to be

read the discussion document on the draft national minimum eligibility
threshold for adult care and support and I do not get it. To me, there
seem to be four crucial elements to the provision of care and support,
and there may be more. First, without sufficient funding, there will be
a problem, no matter how effectively and efficiently we deploy the
available resources. Funding will always be vital. The other three
parts are integration, eligibility and the actual care services
provided<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:42:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000024">We

Eligibility, however, will determine the level at which a person can
access the wonderfully improved care and support that we will achieve
through integration. Eligibility is the gateway, and the integration
can take place at any level of care. We could remove all the postcode
lottery uncertainty by setting the eligibility level at critical and
yet integrate wonderfully, but how would the improved integration help
the hundreds of thousands of people whose needs fall below the
threshold level? I do not get

integrated teams of health and care workers have been created, he would
see that those teams can together make rational judgments about the
people who need care and support, by identifying the individuals most
likely to end up in hospital and allocating a worker from an integrated
team to support them. I absolutely recognise that the eligibility
criteria play a role, but the joint team can assess the needs in the

integration would certainly improve the system with greater economies

planned to introduce a whole new system and remove all
criteria—looking

wonderfully well funded and integrated system, how that might work.
What is planned, however, is not that but an eligibility threshold
against which people will be assessed. At that point, even with the
washing, the getting dressed and all the other things that Baroness

stroke—something that we saw at the Stroke Association event

down to moderate, but about how someone who has had a stroke perhaps
may never move back to a point at which support is not required and
live a truly independent live. The danger is that such people might go
down, in terms of the needs as assessed, and fall out of the system.
Where will they then end up? Later, at greater cost, they will go back
into the system. That is the

care reform is a cross-party concern and provides a clear example,
notwithstanding what has recently been splashed across the media, of
how all-party groups do good work in Parliament. I applaud the
Government’s 
<?notus-xml column=129?>commitment to investment in social care, which they set out in the
2013-15 spending review—£3.8 billion is not a small sum.
As our joint inquiry underlined, the social care system has faced
decades of underfunding, and the Government’s understanding of
the need to address the problem effectively should be
recognised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000036">It
was extremely important to me to be involved in the all-party
group’s inquiry. For the first time, we managed to bring
together the voices of working-age disabled people with those of local

want to bring the focus of social care on to working-age disabled
people. I praise the Government’s ambition to deliver a care
system that is capable of meeting the needs of both the older
population and working-age disabled people. The plans to improve
integration and closer working between health and social care bodies
have been a positive development. However, in the Chancellor’s
speech on the spending review no reference was made specifically to the
one third of care users who are working-age disabled people. I hope
that the Minister will confirm the Government’s commitment that
the purpose of moving the money from the NHS to local government was to
meet not only older people’s needs but those of disabled people
of working age. We must ensure that this group remains in the spotlight
when reforming the care

want to reiterate the importance of addressing the national eligibility
criteria that my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:51:29"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East raised. Despite the intention
that the current fair access to care services criteria should be a
broadly national framework, councils have considerable leeway in
setting the threshold for eligibility. That has resulted in significant
variation throughout the country. Moreover, councils have been
tightening their own local eligibility criteria in response to budget
pressures. That is completely understandable, but the implications are
that people are living with the fear that they will lose their support.
The new eligibility framework and national threshold proposed in the
Care Bill will therefore go a long way towards alleviating the lottery
of care, and will be vital in ensuring more clarity and consistency in
the provision of care for disabled people in
England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000039">The
Government published the draft regulations for the national eligibility
threshold on 28 June and confirmed in the accompanying document their
intention to set the threshold at a level equivalent to
“substantial” in the current FACS system. People tell us
that that means that, for more than 100,000 working-age disabled
people, the bar has been set too high to receive the care and support
they need to live independent lives. I hope that the Minister will

turn to what social care means to our constituents when real help is
given. It means that someone can get up, and be washed, dressed and fed
each morning. Those are basic, everyday actions that many of us take
for granted. When that level of support is offered comprehensively, the
person may hold down not only genuine social interaction but
employment. Real social care may also prevent social isolation. For
example, a member of the National Ankylosing Spondylitis Society has
said:</hs_Para>

feel overly tired most days. Outside of work my participation in
activities has been reducing. I don’t spend as much time as I

instead.”<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:54:44"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13071153000043" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000043">It
is brilliant that, with help, that person feels able to remain in the
work force, but we must ensure that the care offered is not at the cost
of other factors, such as mental health or well-being.</hs_Para>

an unambiguous concern of the Government and is clearly addressed
through the well-being principle in clause 1 of the Care Bill. That
reflects the fact that it is, first and foremost, a human issue. The
principle is the thread that runs through the whole of the Bill and
ensures that the care system not only delivers basic support but
promotes disabled people’s independence, allowing them to
realise their potential by participating more fully in their
communities. That is a bold vision for the future and will truly
revolutionise the care
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000045">It

and independence also means providing support when an individual moves
from one local authority area to another. The Care Bill should ensure
that the receiving authority has a duty to ensure that any social care
provision for an individual will ensure the same outcomes as those of
their previous local authority. I stress to the Minister the importance
of that portability factor to our constituents. They live in a mobile
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000048">A
preventative social care system not only has benefits for the quality
of care and the lives of disabled people but represents a financially
sustainable approach for the future. In addressing the concern about
the eligibility threshold, local authorities will be in a position to
deliver appropriate care at an earlier stage, reducing escalation of
the crisis. As the British Red Cross told the all-party group’s
inquiry:</hs_Para>

Government have recognised that local authorities are delivering
innovative solutions in social care provision, and have rightly chosen
health and wellbeing boards as the mechanism through which social care
can be delivered effectively. The boards have been implemented fully
since April 2013. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 mandates a
minimum membership consisting of one local elected representative, a
representative of the local healthwatch organisation, a representative
of each local clinical commissioning group, the local authority
director of adult social services, the local authority director of
children’s services and, crucially, the director of public
health for the local authority. That will ensure a wide range of views
and experience on the boards and will help with the implementation of
preventative social
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000051">If
the Government fully resource local authorities to implement
preventative social care, the financial returns to local authorities,
national Government and the NHS will be significant. Deloitte’s
economic modelling in Scope’s report, “Ending the other
care crisis”, has shown that a £1.2 billion investment in
establishing a lower national eligibility threshold would lead to a
£700 million saving for the Government and a £570 million
saving for local authorities and the NHS. That is care and compassion
at a better net price for the
nation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000052">In
addition, that money must be available to be used for care services
within communities that are not exclusively health focused such as
housing and employment. Such support would aid many disabled people in
actively contributing to society as independent, participating,
tax-paying citizens. As Sue Brown, head of policy at Sense, told our
inquiry, the employment market currently risks losing out on the
contributions that disabled people can make. That is the crux of the
debate; we want to get disabled people living the lives that they want
to lead, and being as independent and as self-sufficient as possible.
Not only do they benefit from that, but the economy benefits
too.</hs_Para>

National Autistic Society told me that new economic modelling by
Deloitte published earlier this month shows that for every £1
invested in support for people with autism—and other
disabilities—who have moderate needs, returns of £1.30
are generated. As the Government have rightly recognised, social care
is not merely about allowing people to survive; rather, it is about
enabling them to live full and independent lives. The Bill explicitly
places a duty on local authorities to provide care that promotes the
well-being of individuals. Let us now establish that the regulations
fulfil the Government’s ambition and ensure that more than
100,000 disabled people with significant needs can live full, varied
lives, with the basic dignity that we all take for granted.</hs_Para>

reiterate—and to be absolutely clear—I feel that the care
provisions that we put in place need to be standardised between local
authorities in order to promote portability. Those affected by the
provisions are the 
<?notus-xml column=132?>most vulnerable in society. We do not want to make moving house an
ordeal for people, with tensions and stresses about the level of care
that they can expect to receive in the new area.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:01:17"></hs_TimeCode>Before the
excellent changes to this groundbreaking, joined-up government measure
can be implemented, we would like to ensure that a proper impact
assessment is undertaken. We would like any administration costs, or
other associated costs, to be known to local authorities before
implementation. We want to ensure that costs do not force the most
vulnerable in society to be left behind, because of new bureaucratic
layers imposed on local government.</hs_Para>

conclusion, the Care Bill is a significant, welcome step in the right
direction that acknowledges that reforms need to be made. Provided that
they are properly resourced and supported, local authorities, working
with the NHS, now have the opportunity to demonstrate their
considerable experience of delivering social care in a financially
sustainable manner. Funding preventative social care in the manner that
the report recommends represents a win-win situation for the
Government. I look forward to the Minister confirming the new way of
working, by recognising that budgets between the NHS and local
government, as announced in the recent spending review, will be used,
not only for the elderly, but for working-age disabled people. Thank
you, Ms

about talking to the organisations that are out there, either
representing or delivering services for disabled people; it was also
about listening to disabled people. To echo the comments made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:05:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for South Derbyshire, I would like to thank Scope most sincerely, not

can happen to anyone at any time. We could have an undiagnosed
condition, a car accident, or we could develop a progressive illness.
Last week, I attended a reception in the House of Lords for the
management of bowel problems. I met a young man who became disabled in
his early 20s when a rugby scrum collapsed on him. He never thought, in
his wildest dreams, that he would be disabled in his 20s. He loved and
played rugby, and one day, an accident happened. I hope that that would
be the context in which we can discuss some of the issues that both my
colleagues have identified today, because my benchmark for social care
is what we would want to happen if it were us. If we start from that
premise, we can build a picture of what we think should be the exemplar
in terms of social care.</hs_Para>

want to identify why the inquiry took place, and why now. There is a
momentum with the Care Bill, with both political
parties—perhaps, in this company, I should say three political
parties—coming together to recognise the importance of social
care. As the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:07:12"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Members for Bradford East and
for<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:07:08"></hs_TimeCode> South
Derbyshire highlighted, a third of those who rely on social care are,
in fact, working-age adults. Sometimes, there is a great frustration
among the disability community that working-age adults are not
mentioned. We talk about care of older people—indeed, sometimes
we use care of “the elderly”, which I think is somewhat
disparaging, as we are talking about “older people”. That
is only my particular pedantry, I suppose. However, working-age adults
sometimes get forgotten, and I certainly welcome the focus that we are
giving those younger people today.</hs_Para>

both my colleagues have identified, care cannot only be about basic
survival. There is more to life than getting up, eating and drinking,
getting into your pyjamas and then going to bed. Frankly, although the
Minister mentioned Torbay, that, sadly, is exactly what social care
means for many people around the country. For disabled people who want
to live fulfilling lives, care is a facilitator for independent living,
fairness and respect. It is an enabler to a social and family life and,
thankfully, for an increasing number of disabled people, to
participating in their own way in the wider life of their community
through employment.</hs_Para>

social care for working-age adults cannot only be about fitting them
into a pre-ordained system, nor can it be about a template that is
pulled down, and then someone’s name is slotted into it. It is
about ensuring that the individual disabled person has real
independence, choice and control. Sometimes we talk glibly about
independence, choice and control, without thinking about exactly what
they mean; they can be different things for different people. There is
no point in having someone come in to help a person dress at
11 o’ clock, when they need to get to their work
at  
<?notus-xml column=134?>10 o’clock. What is the point of that? That does not
allow them to live a fulfilling life, and there is little dignity and
respect in getting that person into their pyjamas at 6 o’clock
when they might want to go out to the cinema, to visit their friends,
or, indeed, to have their friends round to visit. Let us just imagine
what that must be like. Their family, friends or neighbours are there,
and the person is sitting there in their jimjams. That is not what we
should mean by social care, but sadly it is what is happening in many
parts of the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:09:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000063">In

I think that the current Government, like previous Governments, believe
in principle in the right to independent living. We believe, I hope, as
a Parliament, in breaking down barriers for disabled people and
breaking down some of the Government silos that create those barriers.
Disabled people do not live their lives according to the Department for
Transport, the Department of Health, the Department for Work and
Pensions—we can add on whichever number of Departments we want.
That is not how people live their lives and it certainly is not how
disabled people live their lives, so it is important that we do not
just talk about independent living, but look at how it can be
delivered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:11:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000065">Both

important issue of the portability of care, and I cannot emphasise
enough how important that is to disabled adults of working age. I ask
the Minister to think about this issue. Let us consider the case of a
disabled person in the borough of Lambeth who has to move to
Westminster but finds that they cannot take their care
package—their support—with them. That is echoed across
the country. If it is difficult within one city, just think how much
more difficult it is if someone happens to live in Carlisle and wants
to go and live in Bradford. Let us just think of the challenges that
that poses for an individual disabled
adult<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:11:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000066">However,
it is not just individual disabled adults who are affected. Let us
consider the case of people who are the parents of a disabled child.
The mum or dad gets a new job and moves from Bradford down to
Birmingham. The disabled child has some sort of support mechanism. This
starts in childhood and can develop into adulthood. I appreciate that
we are talking specifically about working-age adults, but I think that
we must recognise that the picture is even bigger than the focus that
we have today. In many cases, this is an issue from the cradle to the
grave<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:12:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000067"><B><Member ContinuationText="Norman Lamb" PimsId="1393" UID="13071153000206" xid="345" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000206">Norman

that someone’s needs change if they are closer to a loved one,

challenge for the Minister, the Government and, indeed, any future
Government that I hope will be there within 18 months or so is how that

obviously speak about the silos within the UK Government, at Whitehall
level, we must be realistic and recognise that there are tensions even
between one local authority and another. The issue is how that policy
is delivered, but of course I give the Minister due recognition for

want to emphasise the issue of the eligibility threshold. I heard what
the Minister said about that, but if the threshold is at the
“substantial” level, many people will not qualify. I
accept what he said—no one will lose out on what they have now,
so if someone gets it at the “moderate” level, which I
understand is the situation in Bradford, they will not lose out. But in
the event that the provision is limited to those whose needs are at the
“substantial” level, many people will still require that
additional element of support, which would allow them to live

lose out. As I pointed out in my speech, 90,000 people have already
lost out. They may be being told that they will not lose any more, but
they have nothing more to lose, because they have already lost it. That
is the big concern. We already have this level in 84% of authorities,

prevented from arising. As

is perfectly true that many disabled people who fall out of the system

closer integration of budgets is needed to ensure that “health

think that any of us can run away from the issue of financial
austerity. It is about getting the best value for money and recognising
the funding gap, but I hope that we can reach agreement across the

want to address a couple of remarks to the Minister. One has to do with
a gap in the Care Bill. There is no mention of the role of the DWP in

debate yesterday in the main Chamber when we discovered that the

shock. We do not know whether his officials had read it, but there is a
strong element that I think must be taken into account. I am referring
to the role that the DWP can play in this. I would be interested if
this Minister had any comments on what he believes will be the impact

want to finish my speech by offering very special thanks to Baroness
Campbell—Jane Campbell. One of the idiosyncrasies of this place
is that although we can share agendas with our colleagues in the House
of Lords, we cannot share with them, even in the slightly less formal
environment of Westminster Hall, some of the discussion and debates.
Baroness Campbell was a pioneer of independent living and a driving
force behind this agenda for many years. She has her own piece of
legislation, a private Member’s Bill, and I understand that much
of what was in that private Member’s Bill has probably been
taken on board by the Government. Individuals such as Baroness
Campbell, who depended themselves on the health and social care system,
were not prepared to let that system drive them down. She has been a
powerful advocate for this agenda over many years. I wanted to pay a

their local community; take part in sport, art, culture and music; and
have fun. In other words, it enables disabled people to have the same

budgets for adult social care have been under pressure for many years,
but have now reached breaking point, as councils have lost a staggering

Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) and I have called for a far
bigger and bolder response, by fully integrating the NHS and social
care. I shall come to the Government’s proposals for the
£3.8 billion of pooled resources. With the greatest respect, I
think that the Government should be bigger and bolder in their
response, with full and true integration that goes beyond the NHS and
social care. If we really join up local services and support and bring
together support from the Department for Work and Pensions, there is
huge potential to do much more to give better care, better outcomes and
better value for money. I will say more on that in a moment.</hs_Para>

shall make five specific suggestions to the Minister about how the Care
Bill could be developed. First, the definition of well-being in the
Bill is important. I welcome how broad it is. It covers mental,
physical, social and economic well-being; personal relationships; and a
person’s ability to contribute to society. The definition also
includes ensuring that individuals have control over their day-to-day
living, but I question whether the definition is as strong as it could
be. The joint report from the all-party groups asks why it could not
specifically include promoting independence, to strengthen the
definition
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000093">An<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:29:12"></hs_TimeCode>
issue raised by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:29:20"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Stirling relates to my point about definitions.
The duty to co-operate in the Bill says that local councils will need
to work with a range of partners. I understand that Ministers usually
do not want to specify lots of organisation types, but I am concerned
that although local councils would, we hope, know that they had to
co-operate with the NHS, there is a real issue about the DWP. There is
not that link-up locally, and if people’s ability to get
training and to participate in the work force is so important, will the
Minister consider whether, either in the Bill or in guidance, there
needs to be more detail about who local councils should co-operate
with? I am concerned that that local relationship might not be
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:30:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

eligibility criteria are, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:30:23"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bradford East said, the most crucial aspect of the social care
system because they determine who is and is not eligible for social
care support. We absolutely welcome the commitment to clear national
eligibility thresholds, but the Minister knows that disabled people,
organisations that represent older people and many of the groups
involved are hugely disappointed that the draft regulations have set
the thresholds at substantial rather than moderate. I am fully aware of
the cost pressures on the system, but has the Department done a true
cost-benefit analysis, to consider the potential saving? The hon.
Member for South Derbyshire made a point about how investing up front
can save money further down the line. Has the Minister discussed with
his Treasury colleagues whether, if a longer time frame were used for
assessing the costs, we would end up saving money for taxpayers if the
moderate level was
set<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:31:37"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000095">My
third point relates to the so-called capped care costs model—aka
Dilnot. The Minister knows that I am concerned that the so-called cap
on care costs is not really a cap. I am concerned not only because it
does not cover hotel accommodation, but because it covers only what
someone’s local authority would pay rather than the amount they
might actually pay in residential care and because no one will benefit
from the cap until
2020.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071153000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000096"><B><Member ContinuationText="Norman Lamb" PimsId="1393" UID="13071153000219" xid="345" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000219">Norman

do not want to focus on older people; I want to come to the point that
the APPGs raised. The joint report states that the majority of
working-age people with disabilities will not benefit from the
so-called capped social care costs model, because they will not have
had the chance to acquire assets. How many disabled people will benefit
from the model? Why does the Minister believe that it is more important
to put in excess £1 billion into implementing the
Dilnot model rather than into the current system, which is being
increasingly

fourth point is about personalisation. I am a huge champion of personal
budgets. I have seen them transform many of my constituents’
lives, not just because they promote genuine independence by giving
people a say in how they live their lives rather than the system
telling them how they should, but because they are essential to
integration. The people themselves know best about how to join up their
needs and support, because they do not see the two things as separate.
However, I have heard the concern expressed in many different places
across the country that personal budgets are getting a bad name. People
feel that they are increasingly not based on their needs and that less
money is being given than is needed, because of how the resource
allocation system works.</hs_Para>

important recommendation in the joint APPG report is about considering
whether the resource allocation system should go on to a statutory

decisions. I do not want personal budgets to get a bad name, with
people feeling that they are a cover for cuts, rather than being based
on what people

final point is on the absolutely essential issue of prevention and
integration. The Government announced in the spending review that there
will be pooled budgets across health and social care totalling
£3.8 billion, including £2 billion transferred from the
NHS. The joint APPG report states that much of the previous transfer of
money from the NHS to social care never reached the front line, and
there is a concern that just continually transferring money in that way
is not sustainable. How will the Minister ensure that the money gets to
the front line? Will it be available, as I think
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:36:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

are unable to know what care costs they might face in the future. We
recognise that some working-age adults may face having to pay for care
earlier than most elderly people do, so we have therefore said in our

is widespread support, in my constituency and nationally, for
roof-mounted solar photovoltaic systems. Projects such as Transition
Streets in Totnes, which the Minister very kindly visited in April,
bring communities together, and they look at energy saving as well as
microgeneration. I hope that the Minister can set out in his response
to this debate how he plans to support community energy projects such
as this, which have the potential to be rolled out at scale. However, I
will not dwell on that issue in detail, because I know that

thank the Minister for his response this morning in oral questions,
because it went to the nub of this issue. We do not want to resist
solar PV as such; we want to resist inappropriate solar PV. I was
immensely relieved, as all my constituents will be, to hear that he is
working so closely with his colleagues in the Department for
Communities and Local Government to bring forward a change to planning
regulations, in order to make it very clear to planners and local
councillors that local opinion, the need to protect our heritage and
our rural landscape, and all the other factors that matter so much to
local communities, cannot automatically be overridden because of the
need to go forward on renewable energy.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071153000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000145"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:02:42"></hs_TimeCode>Perhaps
I can just set out the scale of where we are and say why communities
are so worried. At the moment, we have 1.6 GW of solar capacity within
the UK, and almost all of that is in microgeneration. The average scale
is 4/1,000th of a megawatt and only 71 of the current 369,912 sites
that are listed on the renewables obligation and feed-in tariff
database are more than 500 kW in size. To put that in
context, that would be a site of more than 2.5 acres. These sites
contribute just 203 MW of that total 1.6 GW of installed capacity.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:03:45"></hs_TimeCode>However, if we
look at the Department of Energy and Climate Change planning database,
we see that 1.7 GW is in the planning pipeline or under construction,
which is even greater than the solar capacity that we currently have
installed. The point is that most of that 1.7 GW is completely
different; it is not microgeneration but large-scale generation. In
fact, more than half of it is very large-scale; we are talking about
projects that are more than 5 MW. To put that in context, 1 MW requires
around five acres of land, so more than half of that 1.7 GW that is in
the pipeline will be of a scale greater than 25 acres. That is the nub
of this issue.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=148?><hs_Para UID="13071153000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000146">I will
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:04:25"></hs_TimeCode>put that figure
in context again by looking at the impact on Totnes. My constituency
covers an area from Holne on Dartmoor down to the sea; it takes in an
area of outstanding natural beauty, several sites of special scientific
interest and several special areas of conservation. South Hams district
council has received 28 applications for large-scale solar projects: 25
have been approved and they are either in construction or awaiting
construction; one is at appeal; and just two have been withdrawn. It is
hard to convey the scale of these projects, or how much they cause
devastation to the landscape; people have to see them to understand why
communities are so worried about them. Anyone who travels north from
Diptford, which is a tiny community in a beautiful rural setting, will
come over the brow of a hill and see the development at a place called
Blue Post, and they will be in no doubt whatever about what the future
holds if we do not do something about this issue. There are more than
20 acres of densely packed, ground-mounted panels. Anyone who wants to
see this site can look on my Twitter feed and there is a photograph of
what these things look like close at hand. Effectively, the site is an
industrialised desert, and it is a world away from the misleading and I
have to say—frankly—fraudulent impression given in some
of the glossy advertising that is being targeted directly at
farmers.</hs_Para>

I must say that farmers are the one group that I do not blame for any
of this development. If farmers’ cattle are suffering from the
devastating effects of bovine TB and the farmers repeatedly see their
beautiful herds of South Devon cows being culled, while they are also
under pressure from falling milk prices and face losing their family
farms, and through their letterbox they receive a deluge of advertising
that promises them up to £1,000 an acre per year for having
solar panels installed on their land, together with a maintenance
contract, who on earth would not decide to do
that?</hs_Para>

Wollaston:</Member></B> I agree with
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:07:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend.
The collapse in farming incomes is extraordinary and both of us know
that, having worked closely with farming communities. There used to be
a dairy farm on every hillside in the South Hams area, but I am afraid
that we are losing that vital part of our heritage.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071153000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071153000150">Far<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:07:23"></hs_TimeCode>
from the rural idyll of grazing sheep and wild flowers that we see in
all the glossy literature about these sites, the reality is that where
the panels are closely packed and close to the ground there is very
little grazing land. There may be a margin around the edge of these
sites, which of course is where the photographs are taken, but those
photographs give a very misleading impression. We are often told that
these projects will be sensitively screened. Well, anyone who has
driven past Blue Post will see very high and very ugly wire fencing,
often with security cameras and humming transformers. That is a very
different world from the one that is portrayed in the literature.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:08:09"></hs_TimeCode>The industry
guidelines talk about sensitive siting, consultation with communities 
<?notus-xml column=149?>and sensitive screening, but I am afraid that this process does not
appear to be about renewables and saving the planet; instead, it
appears to be about big money.</hs_Para>

the small community I referred to earlier, has already felt the impact
of the arrays at Marley and Blue Post, and there are already two
further large sites along the power line corridors nearby. Now, AAE
Renewables is in the pre-planning stage for a further 83 acres directly
bordering the AONB.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:08:57"></hs_TimeCode>There is a
visceral sense that something is very wrong. I know that the community
in Diptford will be immensely reassured that the planning guidelines

I will just sound a note of caution, because we often hear the term
“prime farmland” being used. Agricultural land is graded
between one and five, but the grade is determined by a number of
factors, such as gradient, flood risk, versatility, the yield and so
forth. If the Minister looks at the map of agricultural land grading in
my constituency, he will see that almost the entire area is grade 3 or
4. If we restrict the protections to prime farmland, and that is
interpreted as being grade 1 or 2, that will be no protection whatever
to the South Hams. I was relieved to hear this morning that landscape
and rural views are also issues, because it is important that we focus
not only on land type.</hs_Para>

is a wider point about food security, which has been made to me by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:10:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Suffolk Coastal (Dr Coffey), who would have liked to
contribute to the debate. The projects in Suffolk Coastal are taking
over not only areas of outstanding natural beauty, but valuable
agricultural land. In summing up, therefore, will the Minister tell us
whether any assessment has been made of the impact on food security,
because we, as a country, are already unable to feed ourselves? There
is also an issue about the impact on local food webs. The disruption to
local food webs will be important in areas such as south Devon. I would
be interested to hear the Minister’s comments on that.</hs_Para>

real grievance relates to subsidies. We see from the correspondence
between AEE and the planning department that it is not necessary for an
80-acre area of desecration—that is what it is, I am
afraid—to have an environmental impact assessment. Small-scale,
sustainable, self-build projects from the Land Society are held up,
sometimes for years, by the need to have environmental impact
assessments, but the real environmental impact is from inappropriate
large-scale solar developments. In summing up, will the Minister refer
to the need to have environmental impact assessments? Often, the image
we are given is of projects that will be high off the ground and widely
spaced—we all recognise that that has less of an environmental
impact—but if Members go to look at the project at Blue Post,
they will see that there is a major environmental impact when these
things are densely packed and ground mounted.</hs_Para>

developments have little to do with saving the planet; they are
entirely about profit. The subsidies go to a tiny number of people.
When I speak at public meetings, people who are in fuel poverty often
ask why they are paying more to subsidise people who can afford the
up-front costs of some of these developments. Indeed, these people
might even have the entire cost—often including the entire
planning cost—paid for them. As a result, literally nothing
needs to be paid for by the person who will then have all the profit
from the project.</hs_Para>

the Minister will know, there are many community-owned projects, and he
will be aware of TRESOC—the Totnes Renewable Energy
Society—in my constituency. I was proud to open its first
community-owned array, which is on the roof of the local general
practitioners. That is the kind of place these projects need to be.
TRESOC has 502 members, who share the dividends. The point, however, is
that people have to be able to afford the shares in the first place, so
that automatically excludes those in fuel poverty. Will the Minister
put some flesh on the bones as regards subsidies, because there are
probably a lot of misunderstandings about how they operate and who
benefits from them?</hs_Para>

the Minister also review the system for distributing profits, so that
those who suffer loss of amenity—particularly those in fuel
poverty—can directly benefit from a reduction in their fuel
bills? When I met AEE, it told me that Diptford residents could all
benefit from the project because they could have a discount from the
supplier, but only from a more expensive supplier, so it was no
discount at all. That is what is fuelling a lot of the resentment about
these projects.</hs_Para>

a recent speech, the Minister stated his ambition to have 20 GW of
solar, but given the impact the 1.7 GW I mentioned will have, I hope
that he will tell us, in summing up, how he will make sure that future

the Minister also touch on how the national grid will cope? Another
problem is that solar arrays function best at times such as
this—in the middle of hot, sunny days in the middle of summer.
However, peak demand will be on winter evenings, when these arrays have
little, if any, input into the grid. I know they still function on
cloudy days, but at times of peak demand—on dark winter
evenings—they will be of no benefit at all. Another issue is
that when they are functioning best—when demand is at its
lowest—we also have background forms of energy generation, such
as nuclear, which cannot be turned

Wollaston:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his response, and I
quite agree, but if we look at the statistics from National Grid, we
will undoubtedly see that demand is at its lowest when solar produces
its maximum output. At the moment, we do not have the capacity to store
or export that energy, and nor do we have the kind of smart grid that
can easily turn systems off. It would be helpful to understand a bit
more about the investment that is going into the grid, so that our
constituents can have the confidence that we will not be subsidising
large-scale solar arrays and then turning off the electricity supply to
the national grid. We want to make sure that the grid has the capacity
to deal with these things.</hs_Para>

south-west understands that it has a responsibility to contribute to
energy generation from renewables. It is encouraging that Regen
SW’s figures show there has been a 50% growth in that

and 7.3% of that electricity generation comes from renewables. Devon is
the major contributor, closely followed by Cornwall. Between them,
Devon and Cornwall are responsible for the lion’s share of
renewable energy generation in the south-west.</hs_Para>

real enthusiasm in the south-west, however, is for marine renewables.
Those are a fabulous resource, and we have the potential to become
world leaders in marine renewables. Will the Minister update us on his
support for them? Other countries have taken the lead on technologies
such as solar and wind, and they tend to hoover up the profits from
those technologies, but Britain has the potential to be the world
leader in marine renewables. I really hope, therefore, that he will be
able to update us on how he plans to support marine renewables. Perhaps
he could even look at a project in my constituency. Searaser was
invented by Alvin Smith, and it is supported by Ecotricity. The
university of Plymouth is standing ready and could carry out the tank
testing of the technology, which looks very encouraging, if it had

of land, edged with hedges and a tree-lined road. The site, a little
way outside the centre of the village of Wedmore, will power 300 of the

There is an opportunity for people to consider how they might take
responsibility for their communities. As a second example, the isolated
village of Priddy sits on top of the Mendip hills. When the weather is
bad, the village is pretty much cut off. The children of Priddy have
requested on a number of occasions that their parish council install
photovoltaic panels. Originally, they wanted to put them on the school
roof, but it turned out that the school roof was angled the wrong way.
Happily, the village hall, just across the road, was absolutely
suitable, and it was fitted with solar panels in 2010. Those cells
generate 4,400 kWh of electricity and prevent the production of nearly
2,400 kg of CO<Sub>2</Sub> each
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071160000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071160000022">To
generalise, Regen South West’s latest progress report for 2013
shows that the south-west region now supplies about 7.3% of its energy
through renewable means, but at current rates of installation, we will
not meet the target of 15% by 2020, which is worrying. I would love to
see more projects like the Wedmore scheme that work with and for
communities. Community schemes benefit not an individual but the whole
community, and there are ways to spread the wealth around. There will
always be room for corporate players in the market, especially in
industrial areas and on brownfield sites, but in rural areas, the
community and co-op model is far preferable. Once again, I congratulate

They do not want to see solar panels; they want to see sheep and

individual households, so that people get real benefits. The problem
is, however, that the money seems to have landed up in the vast numbers
of field projects, because the price of panels has halved. A year or so
ago, the Minister got lambasted for reducing the tariff on solar panel
production, but in the meantime the cost of the panels has dropped and
they have become lucrative. In the end, it is all about producing
money, and the panels are too profitable. That is the

welcome what the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government, my right hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr
Pickles), and his Department have done, in that local authorities will
now have a great deal more say. My argument, however, is simple: if the
panels are not profitable, we will not get them. We will not get
90-acre farms covered in solar panels if they are not profitable; if

because farm buildings on the whole are not things of great beauty, and
putting solar panels on them might even increase their beauty, and they

the Member for Wells. The Hinkley power station is already there; I am
the first to admit that Hinkley A and B are not things of great beauty,
but they are already in place. If we add two new reactors that will
produce 8% of the country’s total electricity needs in the same
place, no one will notice. In fact, the new power stations will be
marginally better looking than the previous ones. They will certainly
produce electricity for the whole country—some 8%—and we
would have to cover virtually half the country with solar panels in
order to produce a similar amount of electricity. Furthermore, during
dark times of year when little solar energy is produced, we would not
get that electricity, whereas a nuclear power station is a base load,
which is there and producing electricity all the

are getting cross, because they feel that they are being sold green
energy as a total solution, but I am sure that the Minister will admit
that we need all types of green energy in order to balance. We have got
the balance wrong. I do not blame him for that, because he has done his
best to ensure that the money goes to community schemes and
individuals, but we have to do much more. My local council in Mid Devon
was successful in putting solar panels all over council and social
housing, which has been a benefit of about £3 a week to many of
the tenants, who are hard-pressed for cash—that is a great way
of using the

I ask the Minister to look at the issue again. All through the valleys
of east and mid-Devon we have large power lines in many places. The
companies follow the power lines all the way through the valleys, which
are right out in the open. Even quite large farms can be accepted in
places—if they have trees around them and are reasonably well
hidden, that is fine. The companies will carry on following the power
lines all through the south-west, because the region—Devon and
Cornwall in particular—is especially good for panels, on account
of the light and the amount of production possible, making them
lucrative. I wish the Minister well, but I want him to do much more
than the DCLG changes to the planning system; we need to alter the
tariffs to ensure that those huge solar farms are no longer
profitable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:07:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_11_PT_1/424ECB5B7324B5A51186B4BDAC387CC2BBA57A92" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="11 July 2013">Thursday

I begin my remarks with something a little different? I want to talk
about the American inventor, Thomas Edison, who will need little
introduction to  
<?notus-xml column=159?>hon. Members. He was one of the great pioneers of the late 19th and
early 20th centuries. His achievements include the patented system for
electricity distribution and the practical electric light bulb. The
crux of the debate is that over the next decade a quarter of our power
supply will be shut down or switched off for good. We are talking about
how to keep the lights on. It is therefore appropriate to look at
something Edison said about the future of energy more than 80 years

If we are to have any hope of meeting it, solar needs to be a vital
part of our energy mix in the years and decades ahead, and many Members

The time when electricity is generated from solar technology is a good
match for demand, especially in daytime factory production, office and
retail spaces. It would be misguided to put all our renewable eggs in

relatively expensive, so it is unlikely to meet the golden rule of the
green deal, but of course, green deal assessments will prompt people to
consider such measures for their homes. Building regulations will also
prompt developers to think about including them in homes of the future.
I think there is huge potential for home-grown products, and my vision
of the future is for everyone’s home to become, at least in
part, a power station, and for a much more decentralised, distributed
energy economy.</hs_Para>

although I have big ambitions for the solar sector, let me be equally
clear: deployment will not—and must not—come at any cost,
nor in any place, and certainly not if it rides roughshod over the
opinions of local communities. Solar has huge potential, and unlike
some renewable technologies, it still enjoys huge popular support in
many places. We must not allow a few badly sited or inappropriately
scaled solar farms to undermine broader public support and effectively
ruin it for the whole industry. I am determined to stop that

of solar PV, like any other major renewable energy source, must be
thoughtful, sensitive to public opinion, and mindful of the wider
environmental and visual impacts. That is exactly the point that my
hon. Friend the Member for South East Cornwall (Sheryll

appreciate people’s worries.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:25:22"></hs_TimeCode> my hon.
Friends have described, the deployment of large-scale solar farms can
have a very real, negative impact on the rural environment,
particularly in very undulating landscapes. However, it is also
important to say that the visual impact of a well-planned and
well-screened solar farm can be properly accommodated within the
landscape if done sensitively.
Projects<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:25:52"></hs_TimeCode> such as
Powis castle and other National Trust sites are great examples of that.
I was hugely impressed by the vision for a large-scale local energy
park when I visited Kettering this week. It was a well-thought-out mix
of onshore wind, biomass and solar, done with the consent and sympathy
of the local community.</hs_Para>

by the vast majority of responsible solar

advanced in producing its own code of conduct for its members. I

sustainable deployment of large-scale solar PV. The first meeting of
the taskforce was just yesterday, but I have taken on board the points
that my hon. Friends have made about food security, and I will ask the

complex issue requires an effective and well-considered solution. For
example, we could just demand that large-scale development occur only
on brownfield sites, but the simple statement “Brownfield good,
greenfield bad” does not stand up to scrutiny. A brownfield site
could contain a site of special scientific interest or be contained
within an area of outstanding national beauty. It could be in a part of
the landscape—on a hill or the side of a hill—where it
can be seen for miles around. Likewise, even plots of the highest-grade
agricultural land could have areas that are lower grade and could be
legitimately used for solar PV
deployment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071171000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/halltext/130711h0001.htm#13071171000018">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:30:19"></hs_TimeCode>

negative visual impact, even in potentially sensitive and designated
areas. The solar array at Powis castle, which I mentioned, is
effectively shielded from the main visitor approach and the wider view
not by industrial fencing, but by hedging. I have seen other larger
arrays that sit comfortably in the landscape, and many others that do

third reform is introducing a statement of HEI designation conditions.
Regulatory requirements on higher education institutions are currently
primarily applied through the funding council’s financial
memorandum which applies conditions to grant funding and establishes
clear accountability for such funding. This arrangement will continue.
From academic year 2014-15 onwards it is my intention that similar
conditions will also apply to HEI automatic course designation for
student support. This ensures that the rebalancing of funding from
grants 
<?notus-xml column=25?>to tuition fees does not diminish the effectiveness of the current
regulatory regime and the confidence this provides to students and the
public. It also means the regulatory burden is minimised as no further
requirements are placed on institutions than currently
exist.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071149000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0001.htm#13071149000031">To
make this change I will be updating the education (student support)
regulations. BIS will discuss the details of the amendment and its
implementation in practice with representatives of the higher education
sector. Importantly, once the regulations have been made, BIS intends
to delegate to the funding council the function of designation of
courses at higher education institutions for student support purposes.
This continues the existing protections that institutions enjoy through
the funding council being at arm’s length from
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071149000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0001.htm#13071149000032">Over
the next academic year the funding council will be consulting on an
updated version of the financial memorandum, informed by extensive
discussions the council has already held with higher education
representatives and other interested bodies. I understand that the
proposed changes are limited, with the most significant issue for
consultation being new arrangements to manage the risks around
financial commitments. These arrangements are important for sustaining
confidence in universities in the capital

funding council is already consulting on reforming the student number
control system for HEI. While continuing to exercise prudent control of
the overall higher education budget, student choice is being increased
through our tariff policy and the consultation on a flexibility margin
for 2014-15. The tariff threshold has been reduced to ABB or equivalent
from 2013-14 which frees around one third of places from number
controls. These policies will allow more students to study at their
first choice
institution.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071149000034" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0001.htm#13071149000034">Alternative
providers are an important part of increasing choice for students. The
sixth reform is to the designation system for alternative providers.
Specific course designation at alternative providers allows eligible
English-domiciled students on designated courses to access loans and
grants from the Student Loans Company—with the maximum fee loan
being £6,000 per annum. This widens student choice and
strengthens the forces that drive
innovation.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071149000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0001.htm#13071149000035">At
the same time the Government are committed to ensuring that there are
robust processes in place to protect the interest of students, the
reputation of UK higher education, and the public investment. Following
a Government consultation, existing and new alternative providers will
now have to meet stronger requirements on quality assurance, financial
sustainability, and good governance. We will also expect that the
collective student interest is served through this
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071149000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0001.htm#13071149000036">To

in the highly unlikely event that a higher education institution or
alternative provider does not meet the conditions of course designation
in respect of student support funding there is a risk that the course
will no longer remain designated. To protect the students at an
institution where this occurs I have asked the funding council working
with Government and the

Services”.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071149000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0001.htm#13071149000041">Last
September I set out our new industrial strategy, and how we would work
with business to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.
Today’s strategy for tradable, knowledge-intensive professional
and business services (PBS) is the latest in a series which focuses on
key parts of our economy. It has been produced by Government in
partnership with the Professional and Business Services Council and
with others from across the
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071149000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0001.htm#13071149000042">The
UK’s PBS sector comprises a range of high-skilled services, such
as accountancy, legal, marketing/corporate communications, management
and engineering consultancy services, it is significant in scale. It
generated 11% of UK gross value added in 2011 and provided nearly 12%
of UK employment<Sup>1</Sup>. It supports change and innovation right
across our economy. The sector is also a global success story. Its
exports represented £47 billion in 2011<Sup>2</Sup>, with a
trade surplus of £19 billion—a third of the UK’s
total services sector
surplus<Sup>3</Sup>.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071149000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0001.htm#13071149000043">This
strategy identifies several areas for action, including two that are
key to ensuring the future success of the sector. These are, first,
increasing access to the high-level skills demanded by client-focused
professional firms and, secondly, increasing PBS exports to emerging
markets. The strategy sets out plans for both these
priorities:</hs_Para><hs_brevIndent Justify="left" UID="13071149000339" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0001.htm#13071149000339">The
industry will partner with Government to work towards trebling within
five years the numbers of high apprenticeships across PBS. We aim to
create new non-graduate routes into the sector. PBS firms will also
work with schools to highlight the opportunities
available.</hs_brevIndent><hs_brevIndent Justify="left" UID="13071149000340" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0001.htm#13071149000340">Government

order to deliver the future structure of the armed forces under the
requirements of the strategic defence and security review, we are
already reducing their size by adjusting our recruit intake and making
some redundancies. The long-standing five-year UK residency requirement
for Commonwealth citizens to join the armed forces was waived in 1998.
We have reviewed the Commonwealth recruitment rules and, with effect
from 11 July, we will reintroduce the five-years’ residency
requirement in the UK for future new recruits from Commonwealth
countries. In addition, non-British recruits to the reserves will be

Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Chris
Grayling):</Member></B> I have written to Sir David Calvert-Smith,
chairman of the Parole Board for England and Wales, advising him that
it is our intention to withdraw the Secretary of State’s
directions to the Parole Board in respect of the release of determinate
sentence, indeterminate sentence and recalled prisoners. The directions
in respect of Parole Board recommendations on the transfer of
indeterminate sentence prisoners to open conditions will remain in
force.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071150001641" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0002.htm#13071150001641">The
Parole Board has the important responsibility of determining whether
some of the most dangerous prisoners in the criminal justice system can
be safely released back into the community. We have recently enacted
legislation in the form of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of
Offenders (LASPO) Act 2012 which contains a clear and consistent
statutory release test that the board must apply in making those
decisions—that is, the board must not direct a prisoner’s
release unless their detention is no longer necessary for the
protection of the public. The LASPO Act applies this “public
protection” test to all cases which come before the board and
also provides a power for the Secretary of State to amend the test by
order. In view of this, I consider that it is no longer necessary or
appropriate for the directions to remain in
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071150001642" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0002.htm#13071150001642">In
its original incarnation, the board was an advisory body which made
recommendations to the Secretary of State who was responsible for the
final decisions on 
<?notus-xml column=46?>release. It was in this context that the power for the Secretary of
State to issue directions to the board was established. Since then,
however, the board has evolved into an independent decision-making
body. I believe that it is more appropriate, therefore, for the board
to set its own guidance in relation to the application of the statutory
release test that Parliament has put in
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071150001643" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0002.htm#13071150001643">We
are, therefore, withdrawing the existing directions in favour of the
Parole Board applying its own guidance. The board issued guidance for
its members in November 2012 which sets out how the statutory release
test in the LASPO Act is to be applied. In addition, the board has
produced guidance which lists the factors to be taken into account by
panels when considering whether to release different categories of
prisoner. This list largely reflects the same factors set out in the
Secretary of State’s directions, so in practical terms the
withdrawal of the directions will not materially change how the board
approaches its release decisions. I should like to emphasise that the
protection of the public will remain at the heart of every release
decision made by the
board.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071150001644" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/wmstext/130711m0002.htm#13071150001644">Copies

from the report shows that overall the risks to animal health and
welfare and to the environment are not sufficient to justify a ban.
DEFRA has been working with other Government Departments in considering
options for mitigating risks and discouraging the use of these
lanterns. The report suggests that voluntary action taken by, for
example, the hospitality sector, as well as publicity by DEFRA to raise
public awareness of the potential risks, does work and we will continue
to focus on this. Any future action government may take to regulate the
use of sky lanterns will need to be proportionate to the problem and
backed by reliable
evidence.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_11_PT_1/5D0F421C326A56B9C6AAE431F0CBF4329F2A67A5" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="11 July 2013">Thursday

estimates that many of those customers use alternative sources of help,

centres, HMRC believes that c1.3% will require enhanced support under
the proposed new model of additional help by phone and only some of

Wright:</Member></B> Robbery is a serious crime and
this is reflected in the immediate custody rate for adults in 2011
which was 84.3%. Juvenile offenders receive a lower custody rate
reflecting the sentencing guidelines for youths, which direct courts to
take into account the age, maturity and culpability of the individual
offender (as well as a tendency for under 18's to commit less serious
robbery crimes not involving harm). Courts 
<?notus-xml column=392?>must also have regard to the welfare of the young offender and the
principal aim of the youth justice system—the prevention of
offending.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071195000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130711/text/130711w0002.htm#13071195000120">The

should be noted that those offenders receiving a non-custodial sentence
for robbery in 2009 will have had up to two years longer to be
convicted of another offence than those receiving a non-custodial
sentence in 2011. Therefore, no attempt should be made to compare the
figures over the three years presented. The data presented in this

adults, provisions in the Crime and Courts Act 2013 will require courts
to include a punitive element in every community order, unless there
are exceptional circumstances, and will enable courts to impose
electronically monitored tracking of the offender's location. Tougher,
more rehabilitative community punishments will help stop offenders in
their tracks earlier to prevent them committing more crime.</hs_Para>

is known that there is some under-reporting of children missing from

we publish. Comparisons with other data sources on missing children
indicate that the figures presented are an undercount of the true
figure, in part due to definitional issues (e.g. the Department only
collects information on children missing for more than 24-hours). Work
was undertaken in 2012 to improve the quality of the data returned by
local authorities and this is likely to have contributed to the rise in
the numbers of missing children reported. This quality improvement work
is on-going this year and will continue in future
