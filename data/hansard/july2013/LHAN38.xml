Commission commemorates by headstone or memorial the more than 1.1
million British and Commonwealth men and women who gave their lives in
the First World War. This includes those executed for the more serious
of what were called military offences. A memorial initiated by the Shot
at Dawn association at the National Memorial Arboretum commemorates 306
British and Commonwealth soldiers who were shot for serious military
offences during the war. All their names are part of the

that response. Does he agree that the total dead recorded for the First
World War amount to 705,000? I believe that there are at least 10,000
names missing from the war memorials scattered around our country. It
is quite disgraceful that the act of annual commemoration is in effect
not complete because nothing has been done to restore those names. We
should now look to the Government to lead, in line with the church and
hopefully the education system, a national campaign to research and
restore the names of every missing person. Can we please have some
undertaking from the Minister that he will lead the department, with
the co-operation of the church, in  a national exercise to
restore all the missing names by 11 November

Commonwealth War Graves Commission commemorates all names on headstones
or, if they are missing, on the memorials. My noble friend’s
main point is that new names are emerging. One of the interesting
things from the research is that bodies are being discovered and named,

by the Imperial War Museum, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and
the Heritage Lottery Fund. The important thing is that English Heritage

would certainly like to see the 306 more widely memorialised around the
country, but that is best left to the churches and local communities
rather than to the Government. Would the Minister join me in paying
tribute to my noble friend Lord Browne of Ladyton, who five years ago
next month, against much opposition, as the newly appointed Secretary
of Defence, sought and obtained a pardon for the 306? That has brought
great comfort to the families. I know that there is a principle of
other times and other customs, but this was long overdue. It took great

noble friend for his recognition and  the response of your
Lordships’ House to that. I am embarrassed by it, too, because I
was merely the last actor in a long campaign. Many others deserve that
gratitude. They campaigned in much more difficult 
<?notus-xml column=871?>circumstances than I had to work in on this challenging issue.
Beyond<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T11:13:05"></hs_TimeCode> the
pardoning of these 306 who were shot at dawn, there is unfinished
business. We can only imagine the horrors of serving in the front line
of World War I, thank goodness. The Minister is right that all those
who were shot at dawn are memorialised. Unfortunately, they are
memorialised in the context that they were shot at dawn. On memorials
across Commonwealth cemeteries, there is a legend that says that they
were executed for the crime that they committed. They did, however,
also serve, and it cannot be beyond the wit of man to amend slightly
but significantly that beautiful memorial in the National Memorial
Arboretum to record the fact that they served as well as the fact that
they were
executed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T11:13:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Gardiner of Kimble" PimsId="5760" UID="13071862000416" xid="2035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000416">Lord

scenario. It is one that those involved with the Shot at Dawn
association and others would need to consider when deciding how to deal
appropriately and best with changing circumstances and views. One of
the problems is that 60% of all records across the military were lost
in the Second World War blitz, and there are sometimes difficulties in
verifying the records because of that. Indeed, the records of the
Indian Army have already been destroyed, I
believe.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_18_PT_1/6ABF564D3CD30A3B5802CA418218FFE1C5857EC3" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 July 2013">Thursday,

valuable historical source which, if released, would deepen our
knowledge and understanding of one of the most sensational political

suspicion hangs over the Denning report? It has been described as
“the raciest and most readable blue book ever published”.
It has also been depicted as an endorsement of tainted evidence from
journalists and the police used at the trial of one of the principal
protagonists in the extraordinary drama, Dr Stephen Ward. That is the
view of Mr Richard Davenport-Hines, author of the latest detailed
account of the Profumo affair. There was collusion between the police
and journalists 50 years ago on a scale that would make Lord Justice
Leveson’s hair stand on end. Do we not need to see if we can get

giving me the opportunity to go into this fascinating case. There has
been a series of constructive non-decisions. Had decisions been taken
on several occasions, the papers would have been destroyed. Indeed, in
a debate in this House in April 1977, Lord Denning announced that the
papers had been destroyed. The following day the Lord Chancellor stood
up to say that he had not permitted this and that this action had not
been taken. Given, however, the assurances Lord Denning gave to all of
those he interviewed that these records were entirely confidential and
that they would never be published, it seems acceptable that they
should not be published while those who were interviewed by Lord

would not be published are still alive—and some of those who
gave that evidence are still alive. The decision will have to be

exceptional case. The promises given by Lord Denning to those he

this. Did Lord Denning have the authority to give those assurances? I
thought that the release of public documents was governed by various
rules and regulations—there may even be an Act—that there
was a 30-year rule and a 50-year rule, and that that was, so to speak,
part of the governmental fabric. Is the chairman of an inquiry that has
been set up by the Government in those circumstances to inquire into a
matter like this entitled to give an assurance which, in effect, eats
into or may even destroy the purposes of the various rules and

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, this decision has been
reviewed several times. As I remarked, the review has considered
whether the files should be destroyed, maintained or released. As the
noble Lord is well aware, there are a number of cases, particularly
those with security and defence issues, where papers are retained for
more than 50, 30 or 20 years. That has to have the approval of what is
called a Lord Chancellor’s Instrument. It would now be
appropriate to consider whether a formal Lord Chancellor’s
Instrument needs to be applied to these
files<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T11:22:25"></hs_TimeCode>. I will
add that at the time, Lord Denning refused to allow the head of the

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope that Black Rod will now
tell us that the equipment will not require the registration of visitor
names and that the use of equipment by Members at this stage is to be
voluntary, which will obviously thereby render the system of little
benefit in terms of security. If ever it was thought that the use of
the equipment should be mandatory, can we have an assurance that the
House will be fully consulted and allowed to take the final decision on
the introduction of its
use<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T11:23:56"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000030"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Chairman of Committees" PimsId="646" UID="13071862000434" xid="1429" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000434">The

can give that clarification and assurance completely. I am very
conscious that Members often arrange visits at short notice, which
prevents them being able to give advance notice to the doorkeepers.
Therefore Members will not have to pre-book their guests, who will not
be turned away if they are not on the list. If they so wish, Members
will still be able to record only the number of guests without the
names. Furthermore, I assure the House that the system would not be
made mandatory without the House being consulted and the House
deciding. However, I encourage Members to book their guests in as it
makes the processing of guests coming through that very constricted

the issue of security, I partly fall back on the tried and tested
formula that it is established policy not to comment publicly on

introduce a slicker, more efficient service for Members and their
guests. We are trying to modernise a little and replace the pens and
papers with computers. I appreciate that this is one of the challenges

political prisoners and for an end to ethnic conflict. They invited
Burma’s support for the preventing sexual violence in conflict

Nasaka security force, raised concerns about the two-child policy and
pressed for citizenship for the Rohingya minority. On anti-Muslim
violence, they stressed the need for accountability, welcoming recent

Minister take to set out explicit benchmarks by which progress in Burma
will be measured, a specific timeline by which we expect to see
progress, and the possible consequences if there is no such progress?

shows that one of the most difficult periods in a country’s
history is when it is attempting to move away from a highly
authoritarian regime. The question whether it can move from that
without a bloody conflict is, of course, always one of the difficult
ones. We have taken the choice to encourage the moves currently under
way in Burma; things are improving a good deal there but, of course,
they have a long way to go. The opposition, including Daw Aung San Suu
Kyi, have very much encouraged the move that the British have

in dialogue—but also that we must be realistic. During the
discussions with Thein Sein, were limits placed on the new military
relationship that has been announced by the Prime Minister? In
particular, have we raised the Burmese army’s use of child

was to appoint a defence attaché to Burma some months ago. We
are now

country to help them through the transition. Requests have also been
made to assist in retraining the Burmese police. These are all things
that we think will help through a transition—not, of course,
towards full democracy and a perfect resolution of all these problems,

the Written Statement issued yesterday on the visit. It does not
specifically mention the issue of child soldiers, but it touches on a
very large number of human rights issues. I will check and get back to
the noble Baroness on the specific issue of child soldiers. We are
monitoring the situation; we recognise, for example, that the Kachin
ceasefire has been agreed but not yet fully implemented. The President
promised, when he was here, that all remaining political prisoners will

regards the future of the probation service and how individuals joining
that service will have a career which is properly structured to enable
them to gain the expertise to carry out their tasks. Last week, on the
same day that it was announced that G4S 
<?notus-xml column=880?>and Serco had performed tremendously badly in relation to the tagging
contracts, which had been poorly overseen by the Ministry of Justice, I
attended a conference at which probation service staff told me how
little they knew about the plans being made for them. What this House
is deeply concerned about is that a major change to the protection of
the public and the community is being proposed at vast speed without us

initiated by the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State, the outcome of

that no further contracts will be awarded to either company until we
have the findings of that audit and they are satisfactory in terms of
awarding future contracts. As regards the probation trusts, the noble
Lord comes to this matter with great expertise and is fully aware that
the Government are proposing not to abolish the disparate probation
trusts up and down the country but to create a new national probation
trust and open up the market to the private and voluntary sectors to
enable experts to come together to address the issue of probation,

doing it? The MoJ currently spends £3 billion on prisons, of
which £800 million is on probation. The reoffending figures show
that 57.6% of prisoners sentenced to 12 months or less go on

exemplary in that respect. As so much of the community is to be

acknowledged, an additional 50,000. They will increase the number of

combine the expertise of the public, private and voluntary sectors.

for fabric safety, particularly for the flammability of fabrics in

processes to meet these standards. I did this with the help of Bolton
Tech, now Bolton University. At that time, the big market was the US. I
went over there to sell our product but was amazed to find that a
similar product was already available. It had been developed by the US
military and was offered for sale, not only by large companies, but by
smaller ones by virtue of a government assistance

in Britain, we have veered between extremes. When I started in business
in the 1960s, the state had a role through public ownership and the

into a phase in which markets ruled through liberal capitalism. Private
initiative, private enterprise and risk were encouraged. Markets were
left largely to self-correct and self-regulate. The year 2008
demonstrated that that system did not really work. Some still see the
solution in lower taxes, less red tape and less regulation, but an
increasing number of people are calling for an industrial strategy that

small-business administration  of America. A couple of years

the Government or their agencies successfully spot winners? We know
that it is difficult to spot winners, not only for the Government but
for the investment industry, whose job it is. The oldest mantra in
investment, after all, is, “Spread your risk”. The reason
is the difficulty of picking winners and avoiding losers. The

latest example is PAYE. From April 2013, or April 2014 for some small
businesses, RTI—real-time information—has been

and national insurance on pay day. This is necessary to the smooth
working of universal credit. But for the small business with few
employees, some part-time probably, striving to remain legal over the
minimum wage expressed in hourly rates and changing every October

in weekly rates and changed every April, all this is complex and a
complete overhead on top of actually selling things and earning a

have to do to succeed.  It is all desirable, no doubt, and
perhaps it will be simpler in the long run. Technology often works that

economic prosperity associated with them. The idea 
<?notus-xml column=888?>that the role of the state is to stand aside, reduce red tape and let
entrepreneurial instincts flow turns out, through recent research, to
be much of a myth. All the major transformations affecting economic
development have had heavy public involvement, and it is only now that
the research is being done by economic historians to bring that out. My
noble friend Lord Haskel referred to several of them. They include the
most massive one of our age, the internet. We still do not really
understand it, and it has caused an absolute transformation in human
history. However, it has its origins, as is very well known, in state
involvement, although, it has to be said, that was in part for defence
purposes, not for economic
prosperity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000107">These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T12:12:07"></hs_TimeCode>
findings are as true of the US as elsewhere. Noble Lords might remember
the story that circulated a little while ago—it is probably
apocryphal—of a major American leader, who will remain
anonymous, who was looking at the difference between the United States
and Europe and said, “The trouble with the French is that they
do not have a word for entrepreneur”. Well, we do not have a
word for entrepreneur either, expect for that one. However, we do have
a new book by Mariana Mazzucato, <I>The Entrepreneurial State</I>,
which I recommend to noble Lords because it is a detailed study of how
the state is essentially a risk taker. In countries that have an active
state, the state has taken risks that private capital will not.
Whatever private capital breakthroughs have come, they have been the
result of the preparation carried out by active
government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000108">Rather<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T12:13:12"></hs_TimeCode>
than using the examples that Mazzucato offers, I will take the case of
shale gas, which has been studied in detail recently by the
Breakthrough Institute in the United States. In the US, conventional
gas began to decline in the early 1970s, which started a collaboration
between the industry and the federal Government under a Republican
President, Gerald Ford. Everybody knew that there were large deposits
of gas, but the existing techniques of extraction were not up to it.
There was an extensive partnership with federal agencies and,
incidentally, with universities. National laboratories across the
country, such as those in Lawrence Livermore, were crucially involved.
A tax credit for unconventional gas was introduced in 1980, which
lasted until 2002. The Department of Energy and the federal Government
continued the funding of research when no one else at all was
interested<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T12:04:59"></hs_TimeCode>. The
towering figure in the industry, George Mitchell, who I like very
much—partly because he is a very good tennis player, and I
admire people who can do two things really well—came along and
applied the final touch, as it were. He made the final breakthroughs,
but this would have been impossible without state
involvement.</hs_para>

am a supporter of shale gas, as long as it is properly regulated and
coupled with the closing down of gas-fired power stations, but
supporters of shale gas who decry subsidies for renewables should
remember the tale that I am telling, because breakthroughs will come
there too. The trouble with the UK is that they are likely to come in
the United States and China, which are making the most substantial

Lord Haskel, for this important debate. Since I have only a few
minutes, I am going to follow in the footsteps of the noble Lord, Lord
Cope, and focus on small businesses. I think we are all aware that job
growth is no longer going to come primarily from large companies
opening large factories. Those days are over. Small businesses provide
more than half our jobs. Many do not realise that they provide more
than half our exports. Some will have heard of the rule of one in
three. If one in three small businesses added one additional employee,
this would wipe out unemployment. That is pretty much true across the
developed
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000111">All
government policy has been very slow to recognise the need to row in
behind and provide the necessary support for small businesses. I am
incredibly conscious that there is a wide range of programmes, such as
EIS and other tax incentives to invest in small businesses, and the
removal of stamp duty from AIM so that small businesses can raise
public shares. UKTI also has very effective programmes now to provide
support for exports, and the Government are reshaping export finance
programmes so that they suit small businesses. But most small
businesses do not have a clue about what is going on and what is out
there and available to them as
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000112">I
want the Government to look at the whole communication channel to this
complex world of small businesses. It is certainly worth looking at the
German approach, which tells every business that it needs to become a
member of its local chamber of commerce—I do not care whether
they pay only 50p to do so—so that they are in the system and
contact can be made, communication can happen, education can flow
through, and exchanges and networks can be built. We have to get
serious about communication. If it is done through the structures of
LEPs, that is fine with me, but we have to start making sure that there
is an effective mechanism to reach out to that wide net of small
businesses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000113">When
I ask small businesses what is constraining their growth, the answer is
always skills—I suspect that other noble Lords who are better
equipped on this subject will talk later—but it still astonishes
me that we manage to develop a highly sophisticated educational system
at school and university level that delivers people often with
extensive qualifications that simply do not match the job demand that
is out there. Again, with a mechanism of more locally driven
decision-making, local networks can try to counter that, but this
surely has to go to the top of any agenda that we deal
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000114">In
the three minutes that remain to me, I would like to focus on funding
for small businesses. The major banks have long said that they finance
anything—a small business, a large business, whatever
else—that is bankable, but to those of us who have talked to so
many small business and with various trade bodies it is evident that
this is not true. I think that banks are finally facing up to that
reality. They give us two reasons. I am interested less in their
reasons and more in the actuality. One reason is that to work with
really 
<?notus-xml column=890?>small businesses, highly knowledgeable people with exceptional
capabilities are needed, because it is so granular when you work with a
small business. The skills that have to be mastered are way too costly,
given the structure of our banks. It is just not possible, given the

second issue is capital requirements. Banks have to be properly
capitalised. We cannot give on capital requirements in a general way.
Banks tell us that this is highly risky stuff, and that they are
required to hold large amounts of capital, which essentially makes it
uneconomic for them to offer credit on reasonable
terms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000116">How
have other countries that face exactly these problems dealt with them,
and what can we learn from them? As I have only a short time, I shall
look at the US example only. The US Government made a commitment a long
time ago to what they call “the last mile”. How do you
get money out to the small people in a community, much as we have the
Post Office deliver a letter the last mile? The US Government decided
that major US banks were not capable of that activity. You have to set
up a different sector to deliver that, and because making sure that
that happens is a public good, the US has been willing, through its
Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which sits in
Treasury, to put substantial amounts of money into making sure that a
sector exists that can deliver that. The US funds it by billions. As
partners in that effort, it has drawn in its big banks. It has done it
largely through a stick, the Community Reinvestment Act, which most
noble Lords will be familiar with, so I shall not go into the
details.</hs_para>

effect of being required to put money into these entities and to
provide them with knowledge, support and expertise is that it now seems
normal to US banks. I have been talking to those here. They find it
astonishing that it is a reflex action of our major banks to say,
“This is an area we are not going to serve. It is not right for

Monks:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank my noble friend Lord
Haskell for initiating this timely debate. The state has many roles.
Often it has not sought them, but has had them thrust upon it by the
failure of markets in important respects. At the moment, the list of
roles tends to grow as the country’s problems are no longer
masked by the windfalls of the North Sea and booming financial
services; they are not completely over, but they are a lot less
significant than they were. The problems are not new—economic
historians trace them back to the 1870s—but they seem to be
getting worse in some fundamental ways: the shrinkage of manufacturing,
a persistent balance of payments deficit and too few companies still
thinking for the long  term, with a relatively low spend on
innovation and training. Investment in new machinery is
apparently  at a lower level than in Austria, Turkey or Mexico.
The  
<?notus-xml column=891?>low productivity levels that we are experiencing reflect inadequate
skills, low capital investment and, sometimes, poor relationships at
work.</hs_para>

we are proud of our open economy, can we really be so relaxed about the
continued foreign takeovers of successful British companies? The latest
is Penguin Books, which has recently been taken over by a smaller
rival, and it seems that Invensys is shortly to go as well. There is no
comparable traffic in the opposite direction, nor is there a flowering
of new UK companies of the same size and importance. A large part of
what could be called the commanding heights of the economy is now held
abroad. Too many managements and shareholders are governed by thoughts
of value extraction—the price they can get—rather than
adding value to what they have. There is not a squeak from Eurosceptics
or Europhobes about what this means for national sovereignty. A small
proposal from the European Commission sends them into paroxysms of
anger but when this fundamental change is going on, nothing is
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000120">We
also have a systemic tendency for rewards to go disproportionately to
people at the top and for them to outstrip performance. The inequality
statistics are truly frightening. Will the Royal Mail in private hands
follow the same depressing path by charging higher prices and
contracting out delivery services to lower paid, less securely employed
workers? Then will we see the Royal Mail sold off, perhaps overseas,
like so many of our privatised utilities? Must we watch helplessly as
private equity or other predators move in for quick kills? Why are
golden shares so out of fashion in developments of this kind?</hs_para>

stark truth is that private ownership has not unleashed a fresh burst
of investment. Thames Water and BT are seeking government guarantees
for major investments in the super sewer and national broadband; there
is not much appetite for risk among many of these large privatised
companies. Centrica withdrew from the new nuclear power project because
its shareholders wanted higher returns over a shorter period. This
rather frenzied approach to short-term gains continues to enfeeble UK
companies. If you add in the periodic devaluations of sterling, which
make UK assets relatively cheap, you can see the vulnerability of our

are using the term “responsible capitalism”. I use it
myself sometimes; it is a nice thought. However, there is a risk of
many in the citadels of deal-making seeing it as an oxymoron and
treating it risibly and not seriously at all. We have good economic
models among our neighbours, particularly on the other side of the
North Sea. Why do we not learn more from them and build, as others have
said in this debate, a stronger training culture, foe example,
comparable to their economies? Why do we celebrate so much a
deregulated labour market while our northern European neighbours reject
easy hire and fire, zero-hour contracts and the trend towards making
jobs less secure? They are relaxed, even enthusiastic, about collective

what about our management cultures in this country? We claim some of
the world’s leading business schools. I declare an interest as a

often seen as transmission belts to put people into financial services

How can they be transformed to become the staff colleges to make the UK
a new, North Sea-style economy? The noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, has
sought to address some of these issues and I believe that the Business
Secretary recognises the problem, but as yet we are well short of

thank the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, for introducing this debate and

the title and suggest that the role of government is not to generate
economic prosperity and employment but to create the conditions in

by a Government can do that. However, the most efficient, easiest and

emerging economies we should have built a new runway in the south-east

in the real world, while I support the creation of the Davies

immigration, Paris attracts eight times as many high-spending Chinese
tourists as London. Why? Because France is part of the Schengen visa,
on which you can visit 26 European countries but, to add the UK to a
European tour, visitors need to go through the hassle of applying for a
separate visa. I accept that, politically speaking, we are unlikely to
join a single visa system, strong as the business case may be. However,
if we are to acknowledge that political reality, can we please do 
<?notus-xml column=893?>whatever we can to take the hassle out of applying for two visas? Let us
build on the Government’s recent improvements to our visa
process, but recognise that incremental improvements will deliver only
incremental increases in visitor numbers. The step change will be

a similar vein, the practice of treating international students as a

turn to an area in which positive government intervention can make a
real difference, albeit at a cost: investment in infrastructure. I pay
tribute to the Government on their recent spending review. A five-year
settlement for Transport for London’s capital investment

the Northern Line extension has enabled the redevelopment of the iconic
Battersea power station, paving the way for up to 26,000

real progress on vital projects such as the Thames tideway is to be
made before the next general election. If creating 9,000 jobs to build
this new sewer is not enough of an incentive, then the Government might
also consider the benefit of allowing the residents of London’s
thousands of new homes to flush their new toilets. I am confident that
the Government will do the right thing and give the
go-ahead.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000133">Finally,
I must mention Europe. The UK is one of the most successful global
trading nations. We are the third highest exporter of services and the
sixth highest of goods. The global companies that base themselves in
London do so as a centre for Europe. They have no interest in or
understanding of the UK breaking away. While they certainly struggle
with aspects of European regulation, particularly of our financial
services post-credit crisis, they understand the need to address
failures in regulation and for intensive negotiation to find solutions
that balance stability, reputation and growth. I have not met anyone in
any of these companies who is looking for an exit. Indeed, for most,
talk of a referendum suggests a trigger-happy approach to sensitive
diplomatic
matters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000134">There
is, though, the need to reassess the relationship between those inside
and outside the eurozone, and to do that the Government need to fully
engage and negotiate as an equal partner, rather than with one hand on
the escape hatch. While there are political realities, therefore, there
are also economic realities, and if the Government are serious about
prosperity and employment, there are occasions when they need to
recognise that government itself is the problem, rather than looking
for new, politically easy

answer to that is yes. The role of government is to generate economic
prosperity through untying the wealth-creation potential of enterprises
and allowing them to flourish; to maintain a tight fiscal control on
the costs and operations of government, through the avoidance of waste
and unnecessary regulation; to construct the tax and benefits system in
a way that rewards those who work, cares for those who cannot and
incentivises the risk-takers while protecting consumers and upholding
fair competition; to provide a stable monetary policy which creates the
right balance between borrowers and savers in the economy; to provide
the investment in the physical and intellectual infrastructure that we
will need for the future; and to maintain and develop strong
international trading relationships. In short, the role of government
is to prepare the ground and regulate the climate for economic
prosperity and employment while recognising that, ultimately, it is
enterprises which will actually build and maintain it. That would be my

Party should be proud of those achievements. There are problems, of
course, but real successes too. For example, the importance of the
science budget is reflected in the current Government’s decision
to protect that funding. Naturally, there is a need to go further. We
have already heard about the need for infrastructure spending as a

decade. This approach creates a framework for long-term growth,
encouraging business investment and increasing the likelihood that jobs
created by these businesses will be sustained over a period of time.

Bradshaw:</Member></B> I, too, add my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord
Haskel. I am going to take a rather different line from some noble
Lords. I have worked in industries which employ engineers. Engineers
were my colleagues. They were highly respected. Over my career I have
seen that respect for engineers go down and down so that now the
engineer is lucky if he sits at the top table because it is crowded out
with people qualified in finance, human resources and other things,
when it is the engineers who actually drive our businesses
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000152">Several
noble Lords have referred to the list of apprentices and how the number
is increasing. I ask you to look very carefully at who these
apprentices are. They are not technically trained. There are people
with apprenticeships in things like catering, business services and
law, but those are not the skills which drive the economy forward in
the way that I think we all want. I also want to comment on our
professional institutions. The professional engineering institutions
went through a period where they insisted on graduate entry, yet many
of my colleagues started their careers as premium apprentices, took
their higher national certificate, got practical experience and then
qualified as professional engineers. Fortunately, that approach appears
to be coming back—at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers,
for example—because people need to know what they are doing. I
want to draw to your Lordships’ attention the paucity of maths
and physics teaching in schools. It is awful in many schools and there
are so few students actually studying these subjects. Without an
understanding of these subjects, we are not going to be able to provide
the engine for the growth which all of us
desire.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000153">I
was struck by the question that the noble Lord, Lord Bhattacharyya,
raised about evaluation. Many large infrastructure projects of the sort
which are being discussed here are judged on the values of time. This
is an old system that was invented to evaluate rival road schemes in
the 1970s. It was overseen by an organisation called the Standing
Committee on Trunk Road Assessment, and it forms the basis of a lot of
Treasury thinking. If you can prove that you can save 10 minutes going
to Birmingham or a few minutes by putting an extra lane on the
motorway, that will often be the deciding factor. However, if you build
an extra lane, say on the M25, and at the end of three years you still
have congestion as bad as when you started, I 
<?notus-xml column=898?>cannot see that that value of time is delivering a measurable quantity.

his summary of the debate the Minister acknowledged the importance of

The worst environment for innovation is rampant economic insecurity and
excessive inequality. The private sector will not invest in jobs and

particular sectors. Once again I apologise for being the only

us consider two arguments. After the Thatcher-Reagan revolution,
politicians and economists no longer believed that government policy
should aim directly to influence the level of employment. Noble Lords
will remember the new doctrine announced by the noble Lord, Lord
Lawson: government should concentrate on controlling inflation and
leave employment to the market. Let us see how well the market has
done. Between 1950 and 1973—the period when economic policy was
influenced by the Keynes doctrine—UK unemployment averaged below
3%. Since 1979, when the Lawson doctrine held sway, the average has
been almost 8%. Today, Britain’s unemployment rate of 7.8% tells
only half the story. The widest indicator of joblessness, which
includes unemployment, part-timers seeking full-time work and those who
are economically inactive but who nevertheless want a job, is estimated
at about 12%, or 6.4 million people. On top of that you have to add the
much higher level of youth unemployment.

second revolution that has been associated with Lady Thatcher was the
abandonment of any commitment to equality. The ideology of the 1980s
was that undue compression of incomes brought about stagnation: get
taxes and welfare benefits down in order to increase the incentives to
work and innovate and the result would be a more dynamic economy and
one in which wealth would steadily trickle down without any need for
obvious redistributionary policies. The trade-off has not
happened—growth was slower than it was in the Keynesian period
and we are waiting for the trickle-down to happen. In the past 30

Hunt of Chesterton:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome this debate, which
was introduced by my noble friend Lord Haskel, and the remarks made by
the noble Lord, Lord Cope, following him, which very much set the tone
for the importance of SMEs, which I will touch on. I declare an
interest as a director of a small scientific consulting company in
Cambridge and former director of the Met Office. I did a quick
calculation while listening to the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, of what
the ratio was of the highest and lowest paid people in those companies
and it was somewhere between three and four, which is perhaps a bit
less than in the City.</hs_para>

Nevertheless, many smaller companies, as the noble Lord, Lord Cope,
said, find dealing with the TSB and BIS quite difficult, and the
general view is that it is often easier for these companies to work
through European Commission projects, which are much easier to enter

can the UK learn from the industrial and technology policies of
Germany, France, and the USA, which we have been hearing about? One
matter that we have not discussed is industrial democracy, which is no
longer a very fashionable term. There was a great report by Lord
Bullock in the 1970s. One of the important roles of the supervisory
board in Germany, as some leading businessmen have told me, is its
considerable breaking effect on the business of buying and selling
companies. It sometimes seems that companies in Britain are just a
higher form of gambling—buying and selling and buying and
selling. The Evening Standard gets frightfully excited when there is
more buying and selling. For the workers, however, this is not always
brilliant, and in Germany there is a clear way of looking at
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000177">Nevertheless<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:06:50"></hs_TimeCode>,
despite the normal Manchester economic liberalism of the Treasury, it
is now looking at the idea that industrial democracy, or employee
partnership, might have some advantages. Everybody knows that when
companies have strong employee involvement—notably, John
Lewis—they tend to use UK suppliers, and they help to support
other British companies. If a company is bought by an overseas company,
it might put together cars, for example, but a lot of the research is
often done abroad. I note the example of my noble friend Lord
Bhattacharyya, who has been very successful  
<?notus-xml column=903?>in getting excellent research by incoming investing companies, but this
does not always happen, as we have seen with the utilities and other
companies.</hs_para>

feature of the question whether business is a provider provide services
for the community or a higher form of gambling is that there is now a
tendency to think that high-tech science is also a form of high-tech
gambling—you find a company, its shares shoot up, it goes on the
stock exchange, you sell it, then poof, off you go. I am afraid to say
that we have seen a lot of that in the UK. If, in receiving government
money, these companies had to ensure a much clearer relationship with
the community and the Government, we might very well stop this
gambling. I have friends now living in rather exotic places around the
world because their companies went whoosh, and off they went. This is

Willetts also learnt through government laboratories, in his

saw annual reports of research on the shelves of that laboratory, he
said, “Why do you do that?”. Of course, Sir Keith Joseph
went to Oxford and did not understand science. There are brilliant

despite these trends, we have world-famous laboratories. The Met Office
has a world-famous laboratory, and we have others run by the

have lost many of our laboratories in electricity, hydraulics, gas and
so on. What are we going to do? We need a stronger effort to work in
partnership with Europe, which has the world’s greatest
laboratories, as we have seen with CERN and the European weather
centre—and I helped to set up a thing called Ercoftac, which
brings together all the aerospace companies and universities across
Europe. This is the kind of networking approach that we need. I hope

reason why the Games were so special was the extraordinary success of

business, would have made that a foolish gamble. Instead, it was
sustained by an active government programme that provided practical

remedy one of the chronic weaknesses in British business—a lack
of investment and a lamentable achievement in productivity. From the
1970s onwards, investment has been lower in Britain than in most of its
competitors. The fall in investment after the financial crash has been
greater and longer lasting than for any comparable recession since 1973
or 1990. Without radical change, there is a danger that any economic
recovery will be based upon a consumer take-up, rather than an

Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow
the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, in his interesting and powerful speech,
with which I entirely agreed. This is an important and timely debate.
The thing that I am picking up from the debate—I hope that the
Government are picking it up —is that things are really
seriously changing, not just economically but technologically, in a way
that is often hard to grasp. Governments need to make plans on the
basis of a much longer-term perspective to try to accommodate some of
these changes. We have heard that from the noble Lord, Lord Monks, with
whom I agreed, the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, with whom I agreed as
well, and the noble Lord, Lord Giddens. All of them made important
analytical speeches and all were looking forward and trying to
understand the significance of  
<?notus-xml column=906?>the extent of the change that we have seen. I certainly think that
investment banks and digital revolutions are part of that consideration
and
analysis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:19:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000192">The
role of Government is twofold. First, we need to start thinking about
managing expectations better in terms of what the future is
realistically likely to hold. As part of that discussion, we need to
consider how sustainable growth will look and can be provided in the
middle to longer-term
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:19:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:19:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:19:14"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:18:54"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:18:04"></hs_TimeCode>.
I have real fears that the rather loose assumption that we are going
back to the trend levels of growth that we have known in the past is
likely to be wrong. The Government need to be brave enough, if they
believe that the analysis justifies it, to start discussing these
issues in a grown-up way with the public and shaping people’s
expectations about wages, growth and living standards over the middle
to longer term. That is a very important role for the Government at the
moment because of the exponential levels of change that we may be
witnessing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:20:21"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:20:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000193">Secondly,
the Government need to plan a little more coherently and systematically
what the future policy framework is. We had some powerful speeches from
colleagues earlier about the need for continuity. Two or three
colleagues mentioned the importance to SMEs of continuity. I agree with
that. As a foot soldier in the modern coalition Government, I struggle
sometimes to understand what the growth policy is. I understand what
the austerity policy is because that hits me in the face every time I
turn a political corner, but I struggle to understand exactly where the
five to 10 year programme is heading. I am a little surprised that the
important work of the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, <I>No Stone
Unturned</I>, has not been referred to more often today. I wonder
whether the Government are founding their thinking on that. Many of the
recommendations of the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, are correct and
should be

are all of these major programmes—whether it is <I>No Stone
Unturned</I>, the European structural funds, apprenticeships schemes or
the Work Programme—melded into a vision that the coalition
Government can put forward with confidence at the next election in
answer to the middle and long-term challenges? That vision is absent at

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord
Haskel for introducing this debate and for the way in which he did so.
Of course, the Government have a major role in generating prosperity
and the employment prosperity should promote. The problem is that, as
many of us see it, the present Government appear to believe that it all
should be left to market forces, even though experience indicates that
this is mistaken. We are told that there are “green
shoots” and that things are improving, but I have doubts about
that. Living standards are continuing to fall. Vital benefits are being
cut or frozen. Housing is in crisis, particularly in London. I have
said repeatedly in this House that rents are too high and wages are too
low.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000199">It
is said that employment opportunities are improving. Only a little, it
seems to me, and not for young people—or older. Those over 50
have great difficulty getting other employment if they are made
redundant. All this indicates that the Government’s policies are
not working, and we have yet to feel the effects of the public service
cuts due to come onstream in the
autumn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000200">Meanwhile,
the Government are proceeding with their policy of cutting back
employment rights. Access to tribunals is being made more difficult and
will now be charged for. Changes in the law will make it more
difficult, if not impossible, for an injured worker to claim
compensation. Whistleblowers intent on drawing attention to dangerous
situations are to lose some protection. The ridiculous
scheme—defeated in this House but endorsed by the
Commons—whereby workers can give up all employment rights in
return for shares has nevertheless been introduced by the Government,
although I think without much success. The Government seem to believe
that all this will increase employment opportunities. I do not think
so. The Government should understand that an enthusiastic, committed
and well paid workforce is a major asset. SMEs have already benefited
from a low-paid workforce, and this has not produced an economic
revival: quite the
contrary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000201">The
role of the unions should not be underestimated. My own union has
recently drawn attention to the work being done in the automotive
industry, which is currently very successful. There is an industry
committee, 
<?notus-xml column=908?>on which unions participate. The union has drawn attention to the very
successful arrangements in Germany where the workforce is involved
through workplace committees. Unions are not enemies, although some
newspapers insist that this is so. Their contribution in the field of
education and training should be encouraged and respected. The TUC
programme, Unionlearn, is well known and
successful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000202">Investment,
however, is of course the key. There are many areas of the country
which were once thriving but where the factories and workshops which
once employed the local population no longer exist. As a result, the
local economy is stagnant. There is a need for area development. It is
now generally agreed by speakers in this debate this afternoon that our
economy needs to be rebalanced; we cannot rely just on financial
industries, which we have done in the past. There needs to be an
investment bank under government direction so that appropriate
investment can be made.</hs_para>

ourselves as individuals within government, in generating prosperity,

self-knowledge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000206">I

you are globally responsible you must strive for self-knowledge, and
with self-knowledge you must be globally responsible. The founders of

to the theme of my noble friend Lord Haskel, we have a duty of care to

pragmatic regulation and enabling government, we must also consider a
mindfulness strategy for Britain. I was delighted when David Cameron,
the Prime Minister, introduced a well-being measure into the Office for
National Statistics, and said that it was not all about GDP. This is a
cross-party issue. Mindfulness is the path leading back to the
individuals who comprise our society and handing responsibility back to
them. It is an energy model based on self-knowledge that is designed to
increase productivity. When people are more self-aware, they become
more aware of the contributions they make in business and in society as

Shipley:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Haskel,
for enabling me to say that I count myself as a progressive capitalist.
I understand the importance of profit and the private sector to drive
growth and tax revenues and the central role of government to intervene
in market failure and to prevent abuses of capitalism when it consumes
excessive wealth rather than creating it. It is for the public sector
to provide leadership in infrastructure, education and training, public
research and particularly leadership in business and innovation,
identifying and helping to finance growth areas that will increase our
competitiveness<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:34:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000213">It
is, of course, a fundamental task of government to redistribute wealth
to reduce social and regional inequalities, otherwise capitalism cannot
be progressive. I therefore support the concept of the enabling state.
Are the present Government enabling? We have low interest rates,
competitive tax rates, an increasing emphasis on science and technical
subjects in education, significant investment in infrastructure and
increasing access to finance. The Government have, among other things,
supported innovation, seen the creation of 1 million private sector
jobs and made major investment in roads and railways. There is the
Green Investment Bank, the business bank and improved access to
superfast broadband. This is all happening as we pursue the rebalancing
of the economy away from an overreliance on London and financial
services. In this respect the Regional Growth Fund, which is now worth
£3.2 billion, is helping to drive that change, so,
yes, I think that the present Government are an enabling

are three areas to which I wish to draw your Lordships’
attention and to which I hope my noble friend the Minister will
respond. The first is skills. Employers in manufacturing, processing
and engineering have problems recruiting right across the UK. It
is  a sad reflection of all the money that successive
Governments have put into skills that we still have major skills gaps
in our economy. Local growth funds may well provide an answer as they
can require skills providers to be locally accountable for failures to
meet demand, and much better forward planning should result. The
concept of local growth funds is drawn from the report by the noble
Lord, Lord Heseltine, <I>No Stone</I>

the Government are doing well on apprenticeships but we need to do much
more. Fifteen per cent of our under-24s are unemployed but only
5% of graduates are unemployed. As the noble Lord, Lord
Bradshaw, pointed out, we need more high-quality apprenticeships in the
right high-level skills. Rightly, we compare ourselves with Germany,
where there is much greater structural coherence between the private
and public sectors in creating apprenticeships that turn into
sustainable jobs. The Higher Apprenticeship Fund is an important
contributor but we need to  learn much faster from the German
experience than we have
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:37:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

third thing that I would like my noble friend the Minister to respond
to relates to public procurement policy in the construction sector. We
seem to be developing a procurement system between national and local
government that favours big national construction companies at the
expense of mid-sized regional ones. This is potentially damaging to
regional growth. Building firms working up and down the country have
recently bid for a place on a national procurement panel for the
Priority School Building Programme. While 12 firms have been selected
for the north panel and 12 for the south, nine of the firms selected
are on both panels. We talk a lot about a lack of competition in the
banking and audit sectors, but are we heading in the same direction in
the construction sector with the big nine? It is impossible for
medium-sized firms to qualify for a place on these procurement panels.
Even as a joint venture with a combined annual turnover of £250
million, they are still ineligible even though they may have done
excellent and relevant work in the past. Since all these firms ask for
is the right to compete and to tender, it is hard to see what public
interest is being served in preventing them doing so. There are serious
implications for the prospects of regional firms because they will lose
the opportunity to grow bigger and generate more jobs and wealth in
their local
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:38:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000217">Then
there is the Scape framework used for procurement by some local
authorities, housing associations, some parts of the NHS, some police
authorities and universities. This framework requires contractors to
have an annual turnover of more than £500 million to be eligible
to carry out jobs starting even as low as £2 million. Very few
mid-sized regional contractors can meet this turnover requirement but
they could carry out the work just as well. There is a requirement to
take into account local supply chains and subcontractors because they
are supposed to be used by national contractors, but it seems that this
is frequently not the case. That is an erosion of job opportunities for
local people, often in areas of high unemployment.</hs_para>

there is the question of the reinvestment of profits. Ten of the
contractors on the northern panel that I referred to are headquartered
in the south. Do the surpluses made on the projects undertaken in the
north of England get reinvested in the place where the work was done,
or do they get siphoned off to spend elsewhere? We need to know. The
Government accept the need to boost the regions but I ask the Minister
to look very closely at regional procurement so that local people can
get jobs, skills can be maintained and enhanced in all regions and cash
surpluses can be reinvested locally to train the workforce of the

start from the importance of manufacturing industry in those days when
it was all about manufacturing. From the 1970s onwards we lost about
30% of our manufacturing industry. It was not fashionable to talk about
manufacturing industry then; it was all about the service industry. My
noble friend Lady Turner and I know this perfectly well, as service
industries were a recruiting ground for our trade union activities. We
have to have a balance and do all that we can to help the manufacturing
industry to succeed. Manufacturing industry went down from 32% in 1970
to 11% in  2010 but, despite that, 46% of our exports are from
manufacturing industry. That is why we need to look at where the growth
areas are in those fields. We would all agree that the one great
manufacturing industry that remains is the aerospace industry, where
our success is quite remarkable. I could mention the defence industry
but we have to be very careful, given the press reports on some of the
countries that we are exporting to—that is a debate for another

everything said by my noble friend Lord Mitchell. There is a need for a
business investment bank to help to promote industry and small industry
in particular—a business investment bank that leads and, as my

all that we can and I hope the Minister will agree that the Government
ought at all times to favour British industries in its procurement if
they possibly can. In this way, and by going for research and
development, we can begin to reverse the decline that has occurred in
manufacturing industry. If we do that, we have a great future in this

Davies of Oldham:</Member></B> My Lords, the House owes a debt of
gratitude to my noble friend Lord Haskel for introducing a debate that
has produced so many varied but constructive speeches about the
circumstances in which we find ourselves. My noble friend emphasised
the advantages to be derived from business and Government working
together, and identified the way in which this co-operation was
essential if we are to get out of our present difficulties.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071862000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000226">Two
speakers also put the present position into a more general perspective.
My noble friend Lord Giddens stressed the fact that the crisis is very
far from being over. No country has successfully re-established itself
from the crisis which obtained in 2007 and 2008. In any case, Britain
is well down the list. That helps to explain why there are so many
difficulties right across our economy and puts into perspective the
anxieties of noble Lords such as noble Lord, Lord Cope, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Kramer, about SMEs. The reason why the banks have been
reluctant to lend is because they have been at the centre of this
devastating crisis. That has presented them with problems so great that
the state had to step in for two of the major ones, and huge sums of
money are at stake.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071862000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000227">The
noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, also indicated that if the Government took
no responsibility for restoring demand in our economy then it was
likely that we would continue in the present difficulties, which are
not to be underestimated. Real wages are lower under this Government
and, when they go out of office in 2015, will have fallen by 2.4%. We
all know about cuts in benefits, so that section of the community is
paying the price. So wage-earners and those on benefits are suffering,
and we all recognise that unemployment goes right across the economy
and affects a very large number of
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0001.htm#13071862000228">In
its economic survey of the UK economy, the OECD made the nature of the
problem quite clear: productivity underperforming in relation to the
rest of the OECD countries. We had fallen, at the onset of the
recession, by more than other countries in the OECD. The noble Lord,
Lord Bates, indicated successes with regard to exports, but we have an
increasing balance of payments deficit. Despite a 20% sterling
depreciation, Britain is still nowhere near earning its way. That is
the depth of the crisis into which we must put the context of what we
need to do about policy, particularly in relation to
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:49:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

has been argued that we are making clear success in some areas, and
indeed we are. The noble Lord, Lord Bhattacharyya, speaks with great
authority about the relationship between science and research, and the
fact that we have high-class universities that help our industry.
However, the noble Lord emphasised that we need to identify the results
of such investment. That 
<?notus-xml column=914?>surely must be critical because we can live in a fool’s paradise
if we think we are doing the right things but have no measurement of
the outcome of policy.</hs_para>

is crucial in one area that emerged in this debate and was raised by
many speakers on both sides of the House; I refer to the skills gap and
the skills dimension. Successive Governments have addressed themselves
to this and gone in with great intentions to invest. Certainly, the
previous Labour Government invested greatly in colleges and the
Learning and Skills Council, and addressed the skills deficit. We have
not solved the problem; indeed, far from solving it, as many noble
Lords have identified, we are well behind other European comparators.
It is not easy for the British economy and society to adopt German
perspectives on how to run industry and develop skills. The German
apprenticeship system is very different from the situation that
confronts British industry. However, we certainly need to address our
minds to the level of skills, which is palpably too low to serve the
needs of the
nation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:51:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

other question is what can be done to invest in infrastructure to
promote jobs and demand, as the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, mentioned.
One can only say that the Government are acting late on this. They have
so far done nothing of any merit with their programme, and it will
still be the case that capital investment will be lower in 2015 than it
was in 2010. That is not a recipe for success or for the development of
our economy. That applies to schools policy and particularly to
housing. After all, there should be investment in the construction
industry to give some stimulus to the economy but, of course, the
Government have done little about it. It is therefore not surprising
that the noble Lord, Lord Cope, and the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer,
can identify the difficulties faced by small and medium-sized
enterprises in obtaining
resources<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:52:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

our side, although we have faint hopes on this, we think that the
Government ought to do what my noble friend Lord Mitchell first
referred to, as did my noble friend Lord Hoyle, and establish a
business investment bank. We need a bank with a network of regional
banks because if there is one clear casualty of this crisis it is the
complete collapse of our regional infrastructure. We all know that the
Government dispensed with the RDAs and then discovered that the noble
Lord, Lord Heseltine, had some pretty sharp advice for them on the
problems and how the RDAs actually produced investment in the regions.

noble friend Lord Haskel and other noble Lords—generally those
on my side, including my noble friend Lord Monks, who was
emphatic—raised the issue of how we tackle short-termism in
British business. “Quick results reflected in share
value” is the nostrum of how our businesses work, and it is not
therefore surprising that if one is faced with potential takeover bids,
to which the only defence is to enhance share value, that becomes the
issue rather than investment in research, skills and development of a
longer-term perspective for
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:54:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble friend Lord Haskel referred to the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury,
whose absence from this debate we greatly regret. He is concerned to
see how we can build a business model in which shareholders have 
<?notus-xml column=915?>greater strength to hold boards to account. If anyone wants an
illustration of why boards need to be held to account, just consider
the salaries of chief executives, board members and
directors over the past 20 to 30 years. The enormous
disparity between them and the people who actually do the work in
industry and companies is a reflection of the power of the boards,
which we do not challenge effectively.</hs_para>

may have to go some way before we follow what my noble friend Lord
Stone suggested in relation to Marks and Spencer or the illustration
given by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, in terms of John Lewis Partnership.
It may be a considerable time before we are able to engender a
framework within which businesses can be organised on those bases.
However, at the very least, surely the other side, having preached for
so long that the Government must lay off business and let it pursue its
own objective, must recognise that the cost of the short-termism of
British business—particularly the absurdity of the short-termism
of British banks—is that it has contributed to the crisis that
we are all facing, which we desperately need to

conclude with some questions. I wish to come off the macro and step
down a notch. My noble friends Lord Mitchell and Lord Hoyle mentioned
the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. It is a Treasury
Minister who is responding to this debate but if we are to make a
change to business structure, the Department for Business has to be
reformed also. The department is being reduced in size; its staff are
recruited increasingly from the south-east, where it concentrates its
resources; and it has very little representation in the regions. It is
small wonder, therefore, that we have real anxieties about the

Lord Sainsbury, in what he calls progressive capitalism. They are the
importance of institutions, which he says need to be market-supporting
rather than directed, the need for an active and competent state and
the need for fairness. We have been talking very much about the first
two today and I shall concentrate on
those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:58:20"></hs_TimeCode>. I should

terms of raising the game, I agree with the requirement of the noble
Lord, Lord Haskel, that Whitehall must raise its game. The noble Lord,
Lord Mitchell, also talked of games—the Olympic Games. He
commented on how much was achieved by the Government working well with
high achievers. There are lessons to be taken from that, and the
Government have taken one of them in appointing my noble friend Lord
Deighton, who oversaw the Olympics, to bring some of the disciplines
that he used there to government, not least in terms of the way in
which we manage infrastructure. Everybody agrees that Governments in
this country have been poor at delivering infrastructure projects to
time and on budget. He is focusing his attention on getting government

developing trade links with some of the countries that we have

I agree with him. He may be right in saying that companies will find it
simpler in the long run to adopt the latest technology. With regard to

noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, talked about funding, particularly the
challenges in getting new forms of funding into SMEs. I very much agree
with her. One of the leitmotifs of this debate has been people drawing
on experience from elsewhere in Europe and North America. We can learn
from these countries but it is quite difficult, as the noble Lord, Lord
Sainsbury, says in his book, to replicate exactly their institutions.
The American community development and investment funds work very well
in the States, but it is not easy simply to transpose them here. On the
question of new sources of funding for SMEs, one of the key things to
have happened is that the PRA has in effect torn up the old methodology
of the FSA in terms of getting new banks going. It was virtually
impossible to start a new bank in the UK and we clearly need a raft of
new banks, not least business banks. I believe that the PRA’s
approach to this will prove to be extremely beneficial. In the
meantime, the Government have introduced the Funding for Lending
scheme, which should help small business funding and is in the process
of establishing a business
bank.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000247" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000247">The

that he would like us to do. He talked, for example, of shale gas and
whether we could take that opportunity quickly enough. As he will know,
when the spending review was announced, we announced that we were
taking a series of steps in the very near term to move forward on the
development of shale gas here. These include developing technical
planning guidance for shale gas exploration and looking at how we can
put in place a generous community benefits scheme so that those
communities that will be affected will be fairly recompensed. We are
also consulting on tax incentives to encourage exploration. Hopefully,

considerable time, “the commanding heights”. It used to

concerns was that too many UK companies have been bought by foreign
companies and that foreign owners have different priorities from
domestic ones. That is right, sometimes. However, we must have a more
nuanced view. One of the most impressive success stories in British
industry in recent years is that of Jaguar Land Rover. Does anyone
think that there was a company in Britain that could have taken over
Jaguar Land Rover and made the success off it that Tata did? I do not.
It has been a phenomenal success. The Kay review, looking at
short-termism and long-termism, will play a part in trying to redress

funding to sexual violence and sexual abuse services for women has been

people very much enjoy participating in local activities, helping those
more in need than themselves. However, those people who are in need of
help deserve to know that the assistance given to them comes from
professional and experienced advisers. The volunteers working in local
centres or agencies also deserve the support of those with professional
know-how. I look forward to listening to the contributions of noble

I go into my remarks, I have what the police would call
“form” on this matter and need to declare some interests.
I chaired a task force for the Government that produced a report,
<I>Unshackling Good Neighbours</I>, which sought to look at what
stopped people volunteering and giving money and what stopped smaller
charity and voluntary groups growing. My reward for that was to be
appointed the official reviewer of the Charities Act. I produced a
report a year ago and here I have to chide my noble friend on the Front
Bench somewhat. The report, which contained 100 recommendations, was
deregulatory and generally welcomed by the sector but has yet to
receive an official response from the Government. It is 12 months now
and I have to say to my noble friend that I do not think that that is
quite good enough. The sector is anxious to hear whether any of the
ideas which I proposed, after consultation, are going to be proceeded
with, and the Government need to hurry up. In producing those two
reports, I visited many parts of the country and saw at first hand 
<?notus-xml column=924?>what wonderful work was being done by men and women, often in small
groups and with very limited resources, tackling some of the most
deep-seated and intractable problems of our society. They deserve our
support and
encouragement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:31:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000287" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000287">I
said that I wanted to congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Prosser, on
introducing this debate. I do so, but she will not be surprised to
learn that I do not really agree with her analysis of the situation. I
will not go through a point-by-point rebuttal but I will say that she
completely failed to mention the appalling economic situation that this
Government inherited from the previous Administration. There is no way
that the charity and voluntary sector can be insulated from that.
Indeed, the Government are to be congratulated in many ways on what
they have managed to achieve.</hs_para>

draw the House’s attention to three important aspects of
government policy. The first is the coming into force in January of
this year of the Public Services (Social Value) Act, which for the
first time imposes a duty on commissioners to consider the social,
economic and environmental benefits before commissioning a contract.
That is a really important way of getting local input and commitment to
projects<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:32:50"></hs_TimeCode>. The
second aspect is the changes in gift aid, which have simplified the
whole process considerably through the Small Charitable Donations Act.
The fact that no donor declarations are needed for smaller amounts of
gift aid is really important and helpful to small charities in boosting
their ability to raise money and cutting down the amount of paperwork
they have to
undertake<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:33:17"></hs_TimeCode>. Last,
and most important, is the development of the social investment market,
which recent reports suggest grew by 25% last year. This is a win-win
situation: more funding for the voluntary sector and the emergence of
the UK as a world leader in this whole area of social investment and in
the way in which we can carry it out. Those three aspects are
extraordinarily important and the Government are to be congratulated on
having pioneered
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:33:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000289" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000289">My
noble friend would not expect me not to have a shopping list of things
that the Government should be going on to execute over the remainder of
this Parliament. I offer him two or three that he should get his
officials to look at with expedition. The first is the rather technical
issue of trustee duties. Our trustee law currently makes no distinction
between trustees of an ordinary trust and those of a charitable trust.
Preservation of capital is exceptionally important in an ordinary
trust—you need the capital preserved in your pension
fund  in order to pay the pension. However, it is perfectly
possible for trustees of a charity to spend some capital in pursuance
of their charitable objectives. That is an important difference and I
hope that the Government will persuade the Law Commission, which is
beginning its review of charity law, to begin to undertake a really
serious look at this in order to draw a distinction in law between
these two types of trust in the future. It would have substantial
practical implications and benefits for
charities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:34:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000290" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000290">The
second issue is volunteer and trustee liability. I discovered that
there is a perception of risk out there. It is true that some of it is
based on myths and some of it is based on completely counterintuitive
outcomes to 
<?notus-xml column=925?>legal cases, which have been well publicised. However, we live in a
litigious age and we need to offer our volunteers, trustees and workers
in charities and the civil society sector protection and the
understanding that the law is on their side when they are acting
sensibly. I hope that the Government will continue to look for ways to
provide that reassurance. I am sure it will have a great benefit in
terms of the readiness of people to
volunteer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:35:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000291" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000291">The
third issue is commissioning. Commissioners tend to be risk-averse. If
we are going to find a way to encourage the voluntary sector, we are
going to have to provide commissioners with some air cover so that they
are prepared to chance their arm, so to speak. We could establish
yardsticks that the Government would help promulgate as best practice.
The Government would not have to enforce them, but they could be there
as a yardstick. These could relate to, for example, the number of
tenders that you call for in relation to the size of the contract. You
can have only one winner. If you have six or seven tenders, you have to
have five or six losers, and all the work and cost that has gone into
preparing those tenders is wasted. You could also have yardsticks about
the cost of preparing a tender and the cost of monitoring in relation
to the size of the contract. All these things would help the charitable
and voluntary sector compete more effectively, as it would not be put
under undue or unfair competitive
pressure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:36:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000292" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000292">The
last issue is that we are clearly going to see voluntary groups and
charities begin to have to form syndicates. They are going to share
services with other charities that are providing different expertise to
that syndicate, which, of course, brings in the issue of VAT on shared
services. Value added tax regulations are a bourn from which no
traveller returns and are exceptionally complicated. The Government
could do a great deal to help the development of syndicates and to help
consortia of smaller groups compete in the brave new world if the VAT
situation could be
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:37:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000293" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000293">Finally,
I should like to address the question of failure. We should be prepared
to expect and accept that some charities and voluntary groups will
fail. The voluntary sector is tackling some of the most difficult and
hardest-to-reach areas of our society and not all plans are going to
succeed. My noble friend Lord Cope referred to the high failure rate of
commercial enterprises and the charitable and voluntary sector is not
exempt from similar ratios. Failure is not the same as fraud, but
sometimes in the voluntary sector the two are confused. I hope the
House will agree that this is not a matter to be defensive about.
Indeed, some might argue that if there were not failures that would
show that the sector had lost some of its dynamism and its
entrepreneurial
instincts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:38:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071862000392" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000392">2.38

Rooker:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lady
Prosser on introducing the debate and welcome the opportunity to say a
few words. Before I set out an example of civil society, I want to do a
tiny bit of scene-setting. As we saw this week, the UK is home to three
times as many banker millionaires as the whole of the EU put together.
The RSPCA has 
<?notus-xml column=926?>raised the pay for top executives into the £150,000 a year range,
despite falling donations, and, in my view, is wasting money on
prolific private prosecutions. Under the austerity regime that we are
experiencing  at the moment, when civil servants have been on
an effective pay cut due to the pay freeze and pension cuts, the very
top Civil Service levels have continued to receive eye-watering
five-figure bonuses. I am as annoyed as Eric Pickles is at CLG at the
failure to tackle the runaway local authority chief executive salary
trough and the perks that are added to it. The Charity Commission, as
it appears from the recent BBC “File on Four” programme,
is busy certifying non-charities as charities. Seven out of 10
commissioners on the board are new and only one of them has any
significant experience in the sector at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000295" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000295">That

is—it has nothing to do with austerity in many ways—who
picks up the pieces?</hs_parafo>

effect of local authority funding being decimated is having a real
negative effect on some of the frontline civil society organisations.
On the one hand, local authorities are retreating from work by raising
the bar of intervention—say in social services—and on the
other cutting support to the private and third-sector operators in
those areas. A young woman I met recently in one of our large northern
cities works for an organisation that helps young people who are either
homeless or in danger of becoming homeless. Her case workload left me
staggered. It did not compare with what I had experienced during my 27
years in the Commons when qualified social workers carried out the work
that she described. Social services have not even contracted out the
work. They have simply raised the bar, saying that they do not do this
any more,  and their intervention comes only at the crisis
level and then after lots of chasing up. This young woman had recently
taken on supporting a very vulnerable female teenager who had run away
from home several times and no one knew where she had gone. She had a
drug history and was associating with much older men. For the princely
sum of a pay rate that was a few pence above the minimum wage, this
young woman worked over and above the call of duty in hours, support
and liaison, and at levels which I know from experience qualified
social workers did in the past.</hs_para>

cannot be the way to pick up the pieces. As my noble friend said, it
will end in tears. I fully appreciate that agencies at the centre and
locally are having to make savings. I do not complain about that. I
fully understand it and do not wish to be involved in a party-political
dialogue about who is to blame. The fact is that that is the reality.
It is obvious that the desire to replace services and shrink the state,
which is certainly a central policy, is leaving gaps in areas that are
difficult at the best of times. These areas were difficult when there
was plenty of money. That is the point. By definition they are
labour-intensive—very labour-intensive if one gets into the
support of families. They are very challenging and often very
sensitive. In short, they are the stuff that makes big headlines and
calls for public inquiries when something goes tragically wrong in a
specific case. That is the reality that we will be called to account
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000300" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000300">Slow
growth and austerity are here for a while. I accept that. It would be
ridiculous to work on any other basis. The population is ageing. More
families are moving away or being moved away from social networks.
These types of case will multiply. We need somehow to find a way
properly to support the voluntary organisations. They are the bedrock
and I am in favour of their not having as much red tape as local
government. We need to do this not only with grants—finance is
one area—but also with better routes into and support by the
existing, remaining public services that can no longer fill their
traditional roles. We have to accept that traditional roles are not
being fulfilled by the statutory services, but they remain there with
expertise infrastructure. We must find a way of enabling the voluntary
sector, which is providing these services, to link in. We do not have
that at present. It will end in tears if things simply carry on as they
are at the moment. This is not all a call for more money. There has to
be a better way of operating in the civil

report is an analysis of the giving of the top 550 corporate givers. It
uncovers that companies play an important part in political and social
development, but there is little evidence about what they do. They give
approximately £700 million to £800 million, though it is
a bit difficult to tell, because some multinational companies do not
declare. That represents 2% of all charitable income, and 20% of
companies give 90% of the cash that is given to charities. Cash
donations to charities make up about 77% of the donations and the
balance is gifts in kind. The average donation by a company is about
£1.1 million. There are 73 companies that give more than
£1 million. As far as we can work out, the total contribution as
a proportion of pre-tax profits is 0.3%. Does that not say
something?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000305" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000305">In
England, the biggest beneficiaries of charitable corporate donations
are in Greater London, which gets about 33%. The West Midlands gets 1%.
As far as we can tell—where it is possible to tell—the
giving is totally unrelated to need. Corporations give where their
offices are. They give primarily to community and social welfare
charities, to education and to children’s charities; more than
50% of all giving goes to them. Causes such as human rights and
women’s issues are far less popular. They get less than 10%.
Arts and culture are traditionally seen as the domain of corporate
givers rather than of
individuals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000306" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000306">Despite
everything that has happened since 2008, the financial sector is still
the top sector for charitable giving. It gives about £245
million in cash. The least charitable sector, with an average spend of
just about £300,000, is technology. I am glad that the noble
Baroness, Lady Lane-Fox, is now in her place. There are also corporate
trusts, and they provide about half a billion pounds in grants, 50% of
which goes to three causes: education, community and social welfare,
and children. This is the first report of its kind and it has set a
benchmark in reporting. I hope that it will be possible to repeat the
exercise and grow the statistical basis. We know that we need more

Economic Forum. I draw to the House’s attention the report
published at the World Economic Forum in Davos this January. I retain
that position  for a further two years. The essence of the
report, which contains 80 expert interviews and insights from
200 analysts, including those from the charity,
not-for-profit, business and government sectors, is that there is a new
and very different paradigm for civil society going forward. It is far
too easy to think of civil society as the domain of NGOs, charities and
foundations and to miss the point—I am not suggesting that the
noble Baroness, Lady Barker, did—that there is a lot beyond
corporate giving that the private sector actively, persistently and
continuously does. We need to see civil society not in purely cash
terms but also in engagement
terms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000311" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000311">I
will give one or two examples and then try to draw a point. I was
pleased to have a short conversation in the Bishops Bar with the noble
Lord, Lord Livingston, who was introduced into the House this week. He
will be the Government’s trade envoy, although he retains his
position of chief executive of BT. For the past nine years, I have sat
as a non-executive member of the BT responsible business board. The
noble Lord and I spoke about BT’s Net Good ambition, which the
noble Lord announced the day before the Prime Minister announced his
responsibilities in this House and as trade
envoy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000312" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000312">BT’s
Net Good commitment is that for every  tonne of carbon it
consumes as a result of its activities, it will replace that
effectively. Instead of putting carbon in the atmosphere, it will
remove 3 tonnes from the atmosphere—a 1:3 ratio—by
working alongside its stakeholders, suppliers and customers to help
them learn about not just energy efficiency but different lifestyle
approaches. This is not something BT needs to do. As one of the largest
consumers of energy in the country, from a profit base it need only pay
its bills, but the opportunity to engage the public in a responsible
civil society approach to environmental responsibility goes way beyond
merely the corporate saving of carbon or the massive contribution of BT
to multitudes of charities and voluntary organisations around the
country. That is part of the business/civil society
engagement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000313" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000313">Another
example is another organisation to which I am connected, as a trustee:
the Vodafone Foundation. 
<?notus-xml column=930?>At a board meeting last Friday, we agreed to continue the active support
that Vodafone is giving to the establishment of communication hubs in
emergency centres around the world. The latest is being established in
Goma in the Congo this very week. It will allow refugees to communicate
closely with their families and in doing so not only retain those
communications but benefit from the opportunity of a life beyond
disaster. Again, this is not something that a mobile phone provider
needs to do, nor is it CSR. It is the active collaboration of three
sectors: the humanitarian relief sector, which would traditionally be
seen as civil society; the responsibility of government; and the
opportunity of the private
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000314" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000314">Let
us get a little more grainy. Just over a week and a half ago, I visited
Wormwood Scrubs as a trustee of the Vodafone Foundation and in
connection with the charity Only Connect. Only Connect was established
by the great man Danny Kruger, who has written many speeches for David
Cameron. It is a great charity that we all respect. It helps offenders
and ex-offenders learn how to bring their lives into coherence by using
the arts and by connecting to one another in prison to enable them to
work together outside prison. During a meeting with the governor, we
heard that one of his express desires was to help prisoners begin to
build their own groupings of communication connectivity so that they
can establish family networks and not be isolated individuals who
return to repeat crime. We approved a grant on Friday to enable Only
Connect to create its own LinkedIn-sourced connecting system for
prisoners within the British system. That is not something that a
mobile phone provider needs to do. It is not in the P&amp;L and it is
not CSR. It is the combination of all the factors that civil society
now represents: the responsibility of government, the opportunity of
the charitable sector and the privilege of profit to serve the
interests of the
public.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071862000315" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071862000315">In

an open stance to involving the private sector, government, NGOs and

Lord Bishop of Derby:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble
Baroness for securing this debate. I shall pursue the definition that
the noble Lord, Lord Hastings, began to open up in his speech with the
notion of the three legs of the stool and what civil society means. I
start from the presupposition that we live in an age of liberalism in
the technical sense; that is, we are very concerned for the individual
to be free, and to be liberal about all those freedoms. Those freedoms
are very good things, but any good often creates a problem.</hs_para>

want to preface what I am saying with some words from TS Eliot. He said
that the danger in liberalism  is that it releases energy
rather than accumulates it. It releases energy and then it is difficult
to gather it together, because everybody is free, to make the building
blocks of a civil society. He said that it relaxes rather than
fortifies. The more we create rights, the bigger the problem with what
we call cohesion. The more we are concerned about individual good, the
bigger the problem with the common good. The more people have
individual freedom, the more chance there is of becoming isolated,
lonely and
marginalised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:00:14"></hs_TimeCode>. It
is very important to debate the civil society at this time when we
desperately need energy to be accumulated around people for their
well-being and flourishing and not dissipated into people being
atomised on their own. The Government want to work with civil
society—for the state to co-operate in accumulating energy for
good things to happen. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations
defines civil society as

think, however<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:01:06"></hs_TimeCode>,
that we have to remember the historical context in which we seek to
reaccumulate energy for human flourishing and public well-being, and I
suggest that there are a couple of layers of civil society. The
historic one is the institutions that existed between the individual
and the state: the family, where there was a negotiation around gender
and generation; the nation, which was a mix of kinship groups and
regions; and the church, a spiritual hinterland that people explored
and shared. Those three sites of civil society—the family, the
nation and the church as a symbol of a spiritual hinterland—were
not something that anybody chose; you were just born into them and
negotiated your way within those frameworks. You started off with an
accumulation of energy, in Eliot’s 
<?notus-xml column=932?>terms, through the family, through kinship groups and regions, through a
spiritual hinterland.</hs_para>

energy has been so liberated that civil society is now an elective
exercise: people have to be persuaded to join together to create the
energy and the momentum for human flourishing. The traditional bits of
civil society—the family, the nation and the church, which gave
a big framework—have got very weak. The Government desire a big
framework for us to operate in so we are scrabbling about to bind
people together for a common energy in something about which it is very
difficult to persuade people, certainly beyond the

own experience in Derby and Derbyshire, where I work, the Government
are inviting elective groups in civil society to co-operate with, as we
have heard, the provision of services and well-being in the community.
National charities are coming into our local area to bid for contracts
and do the dealing—because they are organised, like the private
sector, in a large way—and local charities are suffering,
withdrawing and retracting, and the energy is dissipating. On the
private model you need big-scale operations and the large charities are
coming in to take the ground. That is very dangerous. The local is
where you are in touch with people enough to understand what is going
on in their lives, to listen to the stories of the homeless or whoever,

flourish and have the care and support they

is a real danger that in trying to reduce big government we may be
setting up big civil society. Civil society needs to be quite local and
small-scale in many ways. If we set up a big civil society of big
successful groups which can bid and deliver contracts all the local
voluntary energy and connection is going to be marginalised and
disappear. That would be catastrophic in many local communities. We
need to encourage local civil society—small-scale civil society
that people can elect to join. We need to remember that that kind of
activity is committed to human flourishing, not to the delivery of
services. It is a big framework, like the one that the family, the
nation and the church stood for. People who get drawn in to civil
society through their own choice want to share their values with
others. They want to improve life on a big scale; they do not just want
to deliver services and get a good return so that they can keep doing
it. The Government somehow have to create an atmosphere of encouraging
aspiration and idealism as well as instrumentalism in the design and
delivery of

want to raise three issues for the Minister to comment on. First, how
will the Government endeavour to fortify the foundations of civil
society—the traditional ones of the family, a sense of a nation
and a sense of a spiritual hinterland? That is a big aspiration that
excites people. They want human flourishing for themselves and for
others and not just a narrow service delivery. Secondly, how will the
Government help to encourage the smaller, more local agents of civil
society and not dissolve big government into big civil society?
Thirdly, how will the Government help civil society to be about human
flourishing—the accumulation of goodness, in Eliot’s
terms—and not about a more 
<?notus-xml column=933?>pragmatic, problem-solving exercise in trying to pick up the problems in
society, rather than about raising human spirits in the way that civil

Women’s Resource Centre, the Fawcett Society and other
organisations for sending me information based on their own experience
and research. Nearly 1,300 women’s voluntary and community
organisations have been established since the early 1970s with the aim
of challenging inequality and empowering women to overcome
discrimination, building on the many initiatives of the then Labour
Government. While the organisations vary in size and income,
collectively they are a family of volunteers, providing holistic and
integrated services, with a mission to ensure that women and children
improve their life chances and lead independent lives. These services
meet the needs of a diversity of women, young and old, some with
multiple and complex needs, some who have experienced domestic and
sexual violence, alcohol or drug misuse, or have mental or physical
difficulties. These timely interventions improve mental health and
well-being, improve financial inclusion, reduce reoffending, improve
independence and social and communication skills and provide a pathway
to educational and vocational development. For BME women they reduce
social exclusion and introduce community
cohesion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000017">In

crime, could provide lasting solutions to their problems. A

equality has somehow arrived and they are not needed any more. Maybe

these organisations, the income stream has come from a combination of
public donations from charitable trusts and grants by local authorities

have spiralled down to reducing support for the women’s
voluntary organisations. Research by the North East Women’s
Sector Network showed that half of the women’s organisations
have lost funding, with those working on violence against women and
girls facing cuts of over 40%—this is replicated across the

reserves, leaving no buffer for the future, which could lead to
ultimate closure. All the research shows that this is a reality. I was

limited number of available income sources has severely affected

Prosser, and the right reverend Prelate said, many of the
women’s voluntary organisations are too small. They rely solely

families and communities, we must start supporting women as the primary
care-giver. Equally, it is important that women’s voluntary
organisations are recognised as partners in meeting local needs, be it
the police and crime commissioner, the clinical commissioning groups or

Tyler of Enfield:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Prosser, on securing this timely debate when the
combination of public spending cuts, decreasing charitable donations
from the public, and sharply falling trends in corporate giving have
pushed the sector into a fragile financial state. I declare an interest
as president of the National Children’s Bureau, vice-president
of the charity Relate and co-chair of the parliamentary inquiry Growing
Giving.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071872000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000025">As
other noble Lords have already said, civil society does not limit
itself to the voluntary and charitable sectors but runs across all
aspects of public life. However, it differs in one key respect from
other sectors, in that it has a mission statement that is focused on
the benefit of society and the collective good. Today I will be
focusing my remarks on charities and the voluntary sector,
concentrating particularly on three issues: the overall funding
situation, the reduction in individual donations and improving the
impact that the corporate sector can
have.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000026">On
funding, a recent Charities Aid Foundation report on UK giving found
that there had been a 20% fall in individual public giving,
leaving charities £1.7 billion worse off. According to NCVO, 43%
of charities’ funding is provided by individual
donations—the sole largest contributor—and
this has left many charities struggling to find other
sources of funding. Indeed, one in six charities said recently that it
is likely that their charity may have to close in the next 12 months.
Other charities, as we have already heard, are having to make heavy
cuts to frontline services at precisely the time when the need for the
crucial services they provide is going up, particularly for the most
vulnerable. The second biggest funding contributor is the state,
providing 37% of charities’ income. This is a dangerous balance
at a time when, as we all know, public funding is in short supply and 
<?notus-xml column=936?>approximately 50% of local authorities are cutting charitable grants
disproportionately to the rest of their public
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000027">So
the problem is very clear, but what are the solutions? Many charities
are adapting to a new climate, and I know from my own experience that
many have been doing this through mergers and collaborations,
developing new business models such as social enterprises, and seeking
new sources of finance, including the newly emerging social investment
market. It is also important to remember that the vast majority of
charities—the figure is thought to be 75%—do not receive
funding from statutory sources and so look to the general public for
money. However, there is a clear need for the Government to assist
charities in this major change, and I look forward to hearing from the
Minister what the Government are doing and what more they plan to do in
this
respect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000028">I
turn to individual giving. The cross-party parliamentary inquiry,
Growing Giving, chaired so ably by the right honourable David Blunkett
and of which I am a co-chair, has highlighted a reliance from charities
on support from older people and is looking into new innovative ways of
getting younger people involved and excited about giving their time and
money to charity, with a particular focus on the importance of
charities providing volunteering opportunities and helping young people
to get involved as youth ambassadors, young trustees and so on. The
inquiry has highlighted the need for charities to be more involved in
the current citizenship curriculum in secondary schools in order to
highlight the issues that they tackle and to give students as much
information as possible.</hs_para>

organisations that young people feel passionately about, but also
trying to match that with charities that are in greatest need of
support. Perhaps it is unsurprising that charities that affect children
in particular were found to be the most popular among children, with
some 35% of 9 to 11 year-olds selecting those as the type of
charity they would most like to support. It is vital that charities can
clearly demonstrate the impact of their work to children and the wider
public, and I think that this is easier when their involvement is
local. What are the Government doing to encourage schools to develop
partnerships with local charities, to enhance not only the immediate
prospects of those charities but also the long-term benefit of
educating children from a young age about the impact that their money
and time can make—something that can then take root and
translate into more sustained giving in later life?</hs_para>

corporate sector? A recent report by the Directory of Social Change,
referred to by my noble friend Lady Barker, found that companies are
keen to encourage giving in the workplace by their employees, including
by providing volunteering opportunities through company foundations and
associations with charities, as other noble Lords have said. Simple
initiatives such as Movember—the competitive growing of
moustaches for donations to testicular cancer in November—have
proved very popular with employees who enjoy showcasing their
charitable efforts. The introduction of payroll giving, which takes
place in a relatively small number of companies, has 
<?notus-xml column=937?>certainly helped in the giving of money to charity by providing an easy
way for employees to give money every pay day. It has proved a popular
scheme. However, it would seem many companies are missing a trick. A
recent Charities Aid Foundation report found that one in three
employees would be likely to give through payroll giving if they had a
chance. That same report, however, showed that only one in 34 employees
in Britain gives regularly through the payroll giving scheme, showing
the huge margins by which this scheme could be
expanded.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000031">Like
my noble friend Lady Barker, I was fascinated by the recent report
showing the new data on corporate giving, particularly the fact that
big private companies, in terms of reinvesting pre-tax profits, are
nowhere near the 1% benchmark set, and that the top 420 companies are
giving somewhere in the region of 0.3% in terms of cash,
making up some 2% of charities’ income.</hs_para>

solution is? I think one solution would be to encourage companies to
match the charitable giving of their employees. This has been suggested
as one way of increasing the amount donated by companies. Matching
schemes, while having the positive effect of the overall company
giving, could also galvanise the workforce, giving employees the
feeling that they have more power to make a difference if what they
donate will be doubled. Perhaps the Government could look at ways of
incentivising corporate giving, perhaps through the tax
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000033">It is
important that we do not forget the roles of smaller businesses in the
UK, which are also vital players in civil society, often at a more
grass-roots level. The sponsoring of sports teams, giving to local
charities and paying greater attention to the environment are all

geographic spread they have managed a much wider reach than some of the
big corporations that are largely London-based. I conclude by also

Gibson of Market Rasen:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, wish to thank my
noble friend for instigating this debate. Today I want to concentrate
most of my speech on voluntary organisations so it follows on quite
well from the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler. Like my noble
friend Lady Prosser, before I came into your Lordships’ House, I
was a national official of a trade union. In my case it was the
Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union, one of the forerunners of
Unite. Like my noble friend Lady Prosser also, at one time I had
responsibility for our members who worked in the voluntary sector, both
full and part-time, in organisations and charities such as the NSPCC,
the RSPCA and the National Children’s Bureau. I stress that
these were and are workers, not volunteers, whose pay, pensions and
working conditions are paramount to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:24:11"></hs_TimeCode>. I always
marvelled at our members’ dedication and commitment to those
with 
<?notus-xml column=938?>and for whom they worked. These were and still are people on whom
society relies every day to care for those least able to help
themselves, such as children and adults, and especially the elderly and
those with disabilities, or to take care of animals others no longer
wanted or wanted to care for.</hs_para>

in voluntary organisations often carry out the jobs that others do not
want to do. I worked as a national union official in the 1980s and
1990s. Over the years views about the role of voluntary organisations
have changed quite significantly, and Governments’ attitudes
towards them are certainly very different today. Successive Governments
have veered towards the voluntary sector and have wanted to work with
it in developing political agendas—for example, in the health
service, the education system and even in the criminal justice
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:25:14"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:25:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000036">More
involvement with government and business has inevitably meant that the

Government, business and the voluntary sector to work together sounds
fine. As the NCVO has

the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Derby said earlier, civil
society is where people come together to make a positive difference to
their lives and the lives of others for mutual support, to pursue

is both encouraging and to be encouraged. However, it must be
remembered that if the new formations in society are to work, voluntary
organisations must be funded well enough for them to operate properly,
to respond to the new challenges facing them and to ensure that their
independence is not compromised. Unfortunately, in many cases this is
not happening. Stephen Bubb, of the Association of Chief Executives of
Voluntary Organisations, recently expressed his worries about the
possible impact of public spending cuts on this sector.</hs_para>

are reasons for
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:26:39"></hs_TimeCode>. I was
recently contacted, as I am sure other noble Lords were, by the
Charities Aid Foundation, a charity that works to improve the
charitable giving environment to ensure that donations are used as
efficiently as possible. Over the past year it has investigated the
charitable sector and found some interesting but daunting facts.
Donations to charities fell by 20% in real terms in 2011-12, the public
having given £1.7 billion less than in the previous year. As the
noble Baroness, Lady Tyler, said, 17% of charities believe that they
may face closure in the next 12 months, 26% of charities
have already cut frontline services and 25% said that they had already
made staff cuts. These are just a few of those findings. The effect on
the viability of the organisations concerned is
obvious<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:27:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000040">Of
course, these were national statistics, but the effects of cuts on
local people and services are also important and are vital to civic
society. The best way of finding out about these is to read local
papers. I have recently seen two good examples. In my own area, Essex
County Council is closing a centre in a little town near Colchester
because it wants to sell the property. It has given a month’s
notice to the organisations 
<?notus-xml column=939?>that use the centre, which include a local school of dancing and a youth
centre. Needless to say, the local people affected are very worried. In
Lincolnshire, where I was born and brought up, the county council wants
to cut staffed libraries from 40 to 15, and to cut their opening hours.
The small market towns and the villages surrounding them will suffer
most if this
happens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:28:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000041">In
the Charities Aid Foundation paper there are some proposals for
government and employers to consider to encourage charitable giving
which have proved successful. These include reminding people that money
can be left to charity in wills and encouraging employees to give to
charity by including in a company appeal a photograph of an employee
who already gives to charity. It also suggests encouraging effective
ways of giving such as payroll giving, as mentioned by the noble
Baroness, Lady Tyler, encouraging businesses to maintain or increase
their support for charities and getting the Government to work with
charities to modernise and improve fundraising. Do the Government have
any plans to encourage employers to guide their employees towards
charitable donations and will the Government be taking positive steps
to assist charities, such as modernising and promoting payroll
giving?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000042">Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:31:14"></hs_TimeCode>,
I turn to another phenomenon brought about by the economic
circumstances in which we find ourselves. Last week somebody asked me
about food banks and I explained that when those of us who can afford
to give to food banks do our weekly shopping, we buy an extra item to
place in the food bank boxes, which can now be found in many
supermarkets and local shops. That item could be a tin of soup, a
packet of biscuits or a box of breakfast cereal—anything that
would be useful to a family struggling with its finances. A local food
bank then collects the boxes from the shops and families go to the food
bank as and when they need to. The food banks are usually established
in premises that are convenient to local people, such as a shop that
might have closed down on the high street. The person to whom I gave
that explanation thought it was an excellent idea as, of course, it
appears to be. However, it is a sign of how times have changed and how
we as a society assist those who would once have probably been helped
by charitable organisations or by the Government. I wonder what the
Minister feels about food banks and what they signify for the civil
society in which we

welcome this debate for the obvious reasons that many others have
already mentioned. Times are difficult for a great many individuals and
families and, at such a time, a strong, active, innovative civil
society has a vital role to play in addressing social and economic
needs. I agree with those who have said that such a civil society has a
real role to play at any time and I 
<?notus-xml column=940?>associate myself with the remark of the noble Lord, Lord Hastings, that
this is a partnership between government, business and civil society.
In a world where Governments cannot do everything, charities, social
enterprises and NGOs can take risks, innovate and go to places at the
cutting edge, where publicly funded bodies may not go. If times are
hard for individuals, as others have pointed out, times are also very
hard for civil society. Charities and voluntary-sector organisations
are struggling to make ends meet and several others have already drawn
attention to the remarkable figure that funding for charities fell by
20% in 2011-12. We need to recognise that this is a sector under severe
pressure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000045">Against<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:33:48"></hs_TimeCode>
that background, I will focus on one aspect of encouraging philanthropy
in support of civil society—as one report had it, encouraging
more people to give and people to give more. When
it comes to giving, it is not all doom and gloom. As many commentators
have often observed, the British people are extremely charitable and,
to quote the Charities Aid Foundation, research suggests that when
times are difficult, donations to charity are often less
likely to be cut back than other forms of spending. There are, as
others have mentioned, signs that young people
are very positive about giving time and money, and I
associate myself with the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler,
about how important it is to encourage this.</hs_para>

becoming easier<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:34:56"></hs_TimeCode>,
through social media or online giving sites; as in so many other ways,
technology is transforming the ways in which we do things. But my point
in speaking today is not only to draw attention to the importance of
philanthropy and to give credit to those many people who give
generously to all sorts of causes, but to urge that we continue to look
for ways in which to encourage more giving at every level, many of them
mentioned already, including individual, corporate and
governmental.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000047">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:35:20"></hs_TimeCode>
the individual level, among other things, we need to support those
campaigns that encourage people to give in different ways. I draw
attention to the Give More campaign, which encourages people to give a
little more this year if they can, and a little more than they did last
year—a simple idea and a good campaign. I also suggest that we
need to sort out how better to recognise generosity. Some donors do not
want it, but others shun it because they fear unwelcome consequences.
That is a pity. The honours system is better focused on giving
recognition to philanthropy, but I hope that more can be done to
recognise those who are generous, particularly in the media and at
local

encourage payroll giving. Many organisations have effective schemes,

progress with, for example, Legacy 10, encouraging people to leave more
to charity in their wills, and a willingness to look at ways of
streamlining Gift Aid. There is also the stated aim to look at tax
incentives to encourage social investment, which is undoubtedly an
exciting and important area where the UK is a world leader, as others
have said.</hs_para>

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my noble

first is about the value of civil society. That is not a term invented
by any Government, it has been around for a long time. We all think
that we understand it, but we all interpret it differently. A key part
of civil society is the voluntary and community sector, but I think it
is a much broader, a much wider and a much more inclusive concept. When
the current Government replaced the Office of the Third Sector with the
Office of Civil Society, they relied on the more traditional definition
of being synonymous with the voluntary and community sector. They
announced that government policy would concentrate on three issues, all
related to the voluntary and community sector. The noble Lord, Lord
Taylor of Holbeach, in a parliamentary answer, stated that the Office
for Civil
Society,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13071872000279" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000279">“will

now rarely hear about the big society, but my point is that those
government definitions miss the point. It is not about structures. As
important as the voluntary and community sector is, I will offer a
different definition. Civil society is the glue that unites and
connects society: the notion that we are not just individuals, but that
by coming together and working together we can improve the lives of
others, improve our own lives, improve society and contribute to our
communities, however local or global those communities may be. It is
not part of state
institutions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000055">My
second point concerns the role of civil society. I am coming to regret
that the role is too often seen as just third-sector
delivery of services. I am certainly not against contracts or
third-sector commissioning. I declare an interest since I chair the
board of trustees of a not-for-profit organisation, Resolving Chaos,
and am involved with a number of charities and voluntary organisations
that provide services. Some are commissioned, some funded and some are
provided voluntarily. I am slightly disconcerted by the
Government’s publication yesterday of the lobbying Bill, which,
taken alongside comments made before the last election, could fetter
and curtail the activities of such organisations in a way that could
work against the benefits that civil society
brings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000056">In the
previous Government, I was the Cabinet Office Minister with
responsibility for the charitable and third sectors. I made it clear

the most disenfranchised, disengaged and vulnerable in our
communities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000057">To

will go further. I will give a hypothetical example of a charity that
supports homeless people. It may have some contracts; it may have some
funded services. It will raise funds and have supportive donors. If
there is an area of council or government policy that in its
professional opinion, at the sharp end of service delivery and support,
is exacerbating the problem, surely it has a duty to its supporters, to
its donors and to civil society to campaign to try to address that
issue. It cannot turn away from its campaigning role and its
responsibilities in that regard. It has an obligation to the homeless
whom it is seeking to

third and final point concerns financial issues. We have heard a
considerable amount about the impact that cuts are having on
organisations that support the community. I have genuine concerns that
the future of civil society is being undermined by funding problems.
The previous Labour Government had a number of programmes, including
one I particularly liked—the Grassroots Grants
programme—that directly supported more than 130,000 local groups
to make a real difference in the heart of
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:45:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000064">A
report from the NCVO and research by Compact Voice show that the
voluntary sector at the heart of civil society is facing an
unprecedented level of cuts and further threats to income. Funding is
not the only way of supporting civil society, but we need to take care
that funding, whether through contracts, subsidies or grants, provides
value for money in both financial and social terms, and the impact on
civil society must be taken into account. My community is in
Essex—as is that of my noble friend Lady Gibson. When Basildon
borough council announced a cut in the subsidy to local community
centres for pensioners’ hot meals, local residents were shocked
and appalled. They understand the social benefit to civil society of
the centres. Perhaps what made that cut particularly shocking was the
fact that the responsible council cabinet member declared that the
meals were not good value for money while her cabinet colleague
defended spending £150,000 on consultants to measure
grass—that is bizarre but it is true—as being good value
for money, so measuring grass was more important than providing hot
meals. I am convinced that the public see that as nonsense and
understand that value for money is not just a purely economic judgment.
They make those same judgments in their own personal spending. They
understand value judgments, not just economics. It is about common
sense, communities and the value that institutions of government at
whatever level place on
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:47:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000065">Too
often, it seems that local authorities find it easiest to impose cuts
on the voluntary sector. I strongly believe in the power of
volunteering for the volunteer and those being supported. As we heard
from my noble friend Lady Prosser, some volunteering grows organically
but needs structure and support to obtain the best value from it. Like
many others, my local volunteer centre in Basildon has now closed. Due
to funding cuts, it could no longer sustain its work. I have sincere
worries about the impact that will have on civil society.</hs_para>

want to make a few points about a particular aspect of civil
society—Muslim organisations. As a Muslim I think that this is
the right moment to discuss civil society; it is the ninth day of the
fasting month of Ramadan, which focuses on the Islamic understanding of
community, civic duties and equity. During this month Muslims are
encouraged to fast from dawn to dusk—an 18-hour stint at
present—and share, forgive and show solidarity with those less
fortunate than themselves. They are also encouraged to give
alms—zakat—and to be aware of the needs and rights of
those around them regardless of their ethnicity, culture and
religion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000069">Ramadan

about enjoining good and forbidding evil, to encourage and facilitate
virtuous, practical deeds. This month, British Muslims dedicate their
energy and money to benefit their communities. A civil society is the
backbone of Muslim communities and is the glue that bonds British
Muslims’ lives together. It ranges from street-level self-help
groups to the delivery of services. It is as diverse as drug
rehabilitation programmes, fatherhood circles, supporting families,
women fleeing violence, arts projects, sports clubs, community centres,
mosques—masjids—Sunday schools and study circles.
However, it is an ad hoc development that has taken place in the face
of racism and Islamophobia and in spite of weaknesses in strategic
planning and a serious shortage of formal financial
support.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13071872000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000070">As
a result, the Muslim leaders who are actively heading these
organisations within the civil society sector are struggling and under
severe strain. The Muslim-led third sector is unable to consolidate,
risks being reactionary in nature and continues
to work in silos. Sadly, it is not in a strong position to implement
and share some of the core teaching of our faith, which is
pertinent and much needed in dealing with some of the social ills
facing our society and the vulnerable communities
of today. We need to learn more about those who are working in
organisations within this sector, have a vision to encourage
them and courage to invest in their development.</hs_para>

used only to support those who are in need abroad but also to

estimated that nearly £200 million will be collected this
Ramadan alone. The potential here is incredible but it is unregulated

Britain, more than anywhere else, have a unique opportunity to
rediscover and share their unparalleled historical precedent in
creating civil society institutions. The pragmatism, wisdom and vision
that created the Islamic ideal community in Medina during the life of
our noble Prophet have many lessons for us all. The community brought
together the generous and the persecuted, men and women, nobility and
slave, people of faith and those with no faith. All British Muslims
within the UK aspire to the ideals of such harmonious communities,
especially during Ramadan, and this is a difficult ambition. Perhaps
the most important challenge facing Muslims today is how to recreate
this civic society after more than two centuries of colonialism, bad
governance and social systems, not to mention migration. Civic society

debate on civil society. However, I must say that at this stage of a

about sin, stood up, said that he was against it and sat down again. If
I am asked about civil society I can say, just as simply, “I am
for it”. Similarly, when asked about the future of civil
society, I can say, “There is one”. However, we are
concerned to examine the current situation, the potential difficulties
and the role that we expect civil society to play, although there are
many different interpretations of what constitutes civil society, and
we have heard them today. The single common factor that we should
remember is that it is about participation in decisions about services
in your community, in how services in your community are shaped, in
delivering those services and, particularly, in

let us not forget that, as we have heard, a quarter of civil society
organisations rely on government for most of their funding, and that it
is a drastic change to go from encouraging voluntary organisations to
become service deliverers—encouragement which has been given by
successive Governments—to finding that the funding is no longer
there. As we have heard today, who is it who suffers when that funding

may be filled by crime and gangs, as well as by civil society

<?notus-xml column=947?>the gaps, as seems to be expected by some in government. Even the best
community organisers and the most enterprising social entrepreneurs
need support.</hs_para>

Government seem to have a suspicion of the infrastructure that exists
to support the charitable sector, and they are right to point out that
that infrastructure may need reform and rationalisation—far be
it from me to argue that we should not expect existing mechanisms to
change and develop. As a veteran of two mergers I am an active advocate
of mergers and collaborative working—and we have seen some very
effective ones, such as the recent one between the NCVO and
Volunteering England. However, we must not throw babies out with
bathwater. Many of these infrastructure bodies are delivering through
their local organisations exactly the kind of innovations—such
as time banks, community pledge banks, social enterprises and civil
action—that the Government and society need. Let us not forget
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000081">I turn
to social investment. I was a member of the original Commission on
Unclaimed Assets, which released the money in unclaimed bank accounts
into the social investment sector, and am now a trustee of the Big
Society Trust, which oversees Big Society Capital. There is no doubt
that this field is developing. Social impact bonds are increasingly
popular. They are designed to transfer the risk of social programmes
from the public sector to the private sector. An interesting one was
launched just yesterday. Developed by the Consortium of Voluntary
Adoption Agencies and Baker Tilly, this social investment bond has
raised £2 million from Bridges Ventures and Big Society Capital.
The money is going into a fund called It’s All About Me, which
is designed to invert the market so that a child seeks out adoptive
parents, not the other way round. It is a very innovative and
interesting approach. I recently saw another such social investment
project in south Wales. It helps children who are normally very
disruptive in class not to be excluded through intensive intervention.
These are excellent initiatives and very welcome
developments.</hs_para>

a note of caution. There is a long way to go before the concept is
proved. Many would-be investors are having trouble finding
investment-ready projects. I do not think that these can ever entirely
replace the funding lost, about which we have heard so much today,
although they certainly can be part of the funding mix. I would be glad
to have the Minister’s view of what proportion of voluntary
sector funding social investment will eventually
provide.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000083">I
will say a final word about volunteering. The statistics about
volunteering are always absolutely stunning. The proportion of people
volunteering at least once a year has increased from 65% of the
population a couple of years ago to 71% recently. The Olympic and
Paralympic Games, as we know, inspired volunteering on an
unprecedented scale—as is always quoted. However, we must
remember that that particular type of volunteering was a pretty easy
gig. It was fun, you got to see events, there was a nice
uniform, a link with people who were volunteering alongside
you and so on. However, it bore little relation to the kind of
volunteering that goes on throughout civil society: bringing people
back 
<?notus-xml column=948?>from suicidal intentions, driving people to hospital who are pretty
difficult and often not grateful, sitting with people with dementia who
are doubly incontinent so that their carers can have a break. I am
sceptical about what the Olympics can teach us about volunteering,
except for the fact that a lot of trouble was taken with recruitment
and selection and fitting people into the right slots. There was a lot
of emphasis on supporting those volunteers—investment was made
in them. I hope that the Minister will reiterate that the Government
continue to see that volunteering needs investment. Volunteering is
very good value, but it is not cost free. I think that that is also a
pretty good description of civil
society.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_18_PT_1/CA4CD38BF2C7846BA0124ED21A63ED20479102AF" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 July 2013">Thursday,

your Lordships’ House, where so many Members draw on their

their work environment. It is a good in itself: it should not be part
of—in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker—the
shrinking of the state. While it can deliver state-funded services,
that should be because the Government recognise the importance of

bidders and commissioners is estimated at £300,000 per tender.
That is money that is not going to beneficiaries. Contracts are often
one-sided, allowing cancellation with three or six months’
notice. There are often minimum turnover requirements of £5

than 100 years ago, Beatrice and Sidney Webb set out their belief that
the state and civil society should play different but complementary
roles. According to them, the proper role for government is to take
care of basic needs, guarantee rights and security, ensure a minimum
standard of life and provide education and preparation for work. The
role of civil society is to operate above this basic minimum and to
ensure that citizens participate as full members of society. I could
not put it better. Civil society contributes to a healthy, vibrant

we can at least start by welcoming the fact that we have in this
country a thriving civil society alongside the state, but not too
dependent on the state. It seems that we are moving towards a consensus
in the United Kingdom that the state cannot provide everything that we

strong and diverse of network of civil society institutions alongside
the formal institutions of state and government at local and national

the other hand, as the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, warned us, some
free-market radicals believe that there is no such thing as society,
that we do not really need local government, that the only individual
motivation we are talking about is economic and that the search for
profit and financial gain is what drives everyone. I would say to him
that it is not the aim of this coalition Government to radically shrink
the state. There are some free-market radicals around who would love to
do so, in the Institute of Economic Affairs and elsewhere, but we all
recognise that we cannot shrink the state very far, given the enormous
demands that we all face. I think that we all share, across the
parties, a basic emerging realisation that, first, the state cannot
provide all that our society will need in the coming years,
particularly as the number of people over 70 continues to grow, and as
the demands on the National Health Service, on social services and on
other services will continue to grow exponentially. I remember an
article by Polly Toynbee in the <I>Guardian</I> a few years ago, in
which she said that the NHS budget would have to rise at a compound 2%
above the rise in GNP, otherwise it would fail. That is part of the

we are discovering that the public will not pay for the state to
provide everything that we want. That, again, is a problem which all
political parties now have to recognise. We have to persuade the public
that these things are worth paying for. I am afraid to say that almost
all of us find on the doorstep that the <I>Daily Mail</I> tells people
every day that the state should cut taxes and raise benefits, but that
is not possible. I think we also agree that financial gain and
individual profit is not what drives everyone, and that altruism and
community spirit also motivates citizens and provides, as has already
been said, the essential glue that holds our society together. We have
to find a way of building the strong local institutions—they

recognise the tension that has been spelled out in a number of speeches
between national voluntary organisations and local civil society
organisations. My experience in Yorkshire is certainly that some of the
best voluntary organisations are those that are rooted in their
communities, but they are very often too small to attract the attention
of national commissioning authorities. The Cabinet Office and other
sections of government are struggling with the issue of how you get

course, part of that has to be that we devolve more decisions and
eventually more authority to local government. The City Deals will help
us in that respect, as will double devolution, which we have much
talked about but not sufficiently carried through, to re-empower local
communities. We also recognise that the character of the sector is in
some ways difficult to pin down. Many of the most impressive voluntary
organisations that I have met exist as they are because they have a
small number of charismatic people driving them along. They can be
impossible. Indeed, they succeed partly because they are impossible.

of this has to take place at the local level. I am conscious that the
loss or the weakness of the church networks, and particularly the
nonconformist ones that did so much, is part of what has gone wrong in
many of these areas. I am conscious of this in particular because I
live in a village, Saltaire, that has a historical society, a festival
committee, an arts trail, a Friends of Roberts Park society and two
allotment societies, and frankly does not need anything more by way of
local civil society. Three or four miles away from us, in Bradford,
there are a number of areas that have very little going on and in which
the community organisers, who are part of the Government’s big

together and do things themselves, rather than sitting around being
deeply bitter that someone else is not doing something for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000109">I am a
strong believer in the big society and there are a number of
initiatives that are also pushing us in that direction. National
Citizen Service is going into its third summer this year. I was
entirely converted last summer by taking part in one or two National
Citizen Service schemes in Bradford. We helped show teenagers what they
could do for themselves and what they could do together for others,
thus teaching them the principle of community service, including how to
organise things together, raise money and work together. It is a
similar case in local schools around the country. Primary schools and
others are learning about how you work and help people in the
community. This is all extremely
desirable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000110">I
am also a great fan of community foundations as a means of diversifying
sources of funding for local activity. I would like to see the
Community Foundation Network given a great deal more support. I say to
the noble Lord, Lord Hastings, that part of the problem with community
foundations and other local activity 
<?notus-xml column=953?>is that it was the local entrepreneurs and companies that provided local
charity. As we have moved towards multinational companies, how you get
them to think not only about London but about what happens in York,
Bradford and Leeds, all of which have lost so much of their local
corporate leadership, is a problem with which we all have to struggle.
We are doing our best to learn from the process that is going on. I say
to my noble friend Lady Barker that this morning I printed out the
Institute for Government report on making public service markets work
and it is one of the things that I intend to read at the weekend if my
wife allows me not to pick all of the soft fruit on the allotment. I am

number of other major points were raised in the debate. The noble Lord,
Lord Hodgson, expressed his regret that the Government have not yet
published their response to his extremely useful report last year. The
Government thought that it might be preferable to wait for the report
of the Public Administration Select Committee that came out on 6 June
and was in many ways not just a post-legislative scrutiny of the
Charities Act but a commentary on Lord Hodgson’s report. I
assure him that the full response to both of these will come out
shortly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000112">A
number of noble Lords talked about the problems of a large drop in

this point that part of what we all have to do in this country is to
change the moral atmosphere from that which was around, in a way, in
2010—the corporate pursuit of individual gain and the City

in London who earn so much more than I do, that they are living in a
society to which they should pay not only their taxes but their other
dues. As we are all part of a national society and, within that, of
various local societies, part of our responsibility is to contribute in

sector organisations, I have on occasion been horrified to discover
large charities that are entirely dependent on state contracting. That

her career. From then on, she poured her enormous energy not entirely
into her children—thank goodness—but also into doing good
works wherever she was living. We all know now that the transformation
of the role of women means that that dimension of civil society has
half disappeared as young women attempt to combine careers, children

the nature of the debate has demonstrated the huge variety of subject

suffering slightly and in need of some assistance; and others that are

between solutions which are suitable for service provision and those
which are suitable for what I would call community development. The
Minister gave as one such example the people on a housing estate in the
north, and that was my experience as well when working in community
development in the London Borough of Southwark, where precisely the
same issues and difficulties arose. In that project our role was to
enable the local people to find their voices and to speak up. <I>The
Likes of Us</I>, by Michael Collins, is an excellent book based around
some housing estates in Southwark which records how the people there
had said that they had been done to, but never given the opportunity to
put their own point of view. It is an important point to make. The

Hollins:</Member></B> My Lords, this is such a timely and important
debate, coming the same week as the Keogh mortality review, the
Neuberger report and the latest report from the Health Service
Ombudsman. Our focus tonight is on health inequalities for a group that
comprises some 3% of the population. Our focus is on the remit and
findings of the Confidential Inquiry into Premature Deaths of People
with a Learning Disability. The inquiry’s report was published
in March and the Government’s response was released last Friday.
The House will wish to be reminded that I have worked as a psychiatrist
with people with learning disabilities for over 30 years and that my
adult son has a learning
disability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000136">The
institutional discrimination and health inequalities suffered by people
with learning disabilities come as little surprise to many of us. For
me it is a throwback to some of my own research from over 20 years ago
when I reviewed the age and causes of death of people with learning
disabilities in three London boroughs over a 10-year period. I found
that adults with a learning disability were 58 times more likely to die
before the age of 50 than the general population. Over half died of
respiratory disease—which I presumed to be a final common
pathway—compared with only 15% of the general population. The
problem was that I could not get the results published. The <I>BMJ</I>
and other medical journals said that it was not of wide enough
interest. It was eventually published in a specialist disability
journal. Government began to show leadership, however, with the White
Paper, <I>Valuing People</I>,<I> </I>and Chapter 6, which addressed
healthcare, accepted my suggestion that a confidential inquiry should
be included as a
recommendation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000137">In

report and it told the stories of six people with a learning disability
who had died in NHS care. It triggered an independent inquiry which was
led by Sir Jonathan Michael—I should mention that I
was a member of the inquiry team—and the Parliamentary and
Health Service Ombudsman conducted an investigation into the six
deaths. The Michael report, <I>Healthcare for </I><I>A</I><I>ll</I>,

is a confidential inquiry? It aims to identify common causes of deaths
and to make recommendations to improve clinical practice. There are
many in existence, some going back more than 50 years, with varying
degrees of effectiveness. They involve the systematic review of cases
with the identity of patients and clinicians remaining confidential and
only aggregated findings being made public. Several of these inquiries
have resulted in long-term monitoring and regular reports and one of
these is NCEPOD, the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome
and Death. It started with a pilot study of mortality related to
anaesthesia but steadily expanded into a wider inquiry to cover all
hospital specialties, now including near misses as well as deaths.
NCEPOD distributes reports on very specific mortality concerns and if
it feels that 
<?notus-xml column=958?>important recommendations are not being met, it lobbies at both local
and national levels. It is this ongoing monitoring and national

the confidential inquiry that we debate today Dr Pauline
Heslop and her team have recommended the establishment of a national
mortality review—basically a beefed-up confidential inquiry.
This would guide detailed local reviews but also include a national
overview panel. Its wider remit and role would provide an oversight of
core data relating to all deaths of people with a learning disability.
It could monitor and direct where more detailed reviews need to take
place and, vitally, it would make recommendations for changes in
practice. A longer-term commitment to this vulnerable patient group is
needed for a real impact to be seen. The United States started similar
mortality reviews and over the past 10 years it has seen an increase in
life expectancy among people with a learning disability. The
confidential inquiry we are discussing today was only
established for three years—effectively as a pilot. It looked at
the deaths of 233 adults and 14 children across five PCT areas in the
south-west. Its focus was to determine whether the deaths of people
with learning disabilities were premature. The principal aims were to
detect factors which contributed to death as well as gaps in health and
care
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000140">The
results expose the gulf that still exists between the care received by
people with a learning disability and that received by the rest of the
population. It found that 37% of deaths would have been potentially
avoidable if good quality healthcare had been provided. It found that
on average, men with a learning disability died 13 years earlier and
women 20 years earlier than the general population. Mencap says that
this means that over 1,200 deaths each year across England could have
been avoided with good-quality non-discriminatory
healthcare—almost 25 children and adults per week. That is a
shocking figure, which equates to the number of people thought to have
died needlessly over a four-year period at the Mid Staffordshire
hospital.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000141">I am
sure that other noble Lords will address some of the findings in more
detail, but I will focus on the wider picture for a little longer.
While Mid Staffs rightly hit the headlines, as did Sir Bruce
Keogh’s report earlier this week, the avoidable deaths of people
with a learning disability, some of the most vulnerable people in our
society, go largely underreported and consistently fail to feature
prominently on the parliamentary

people with learning disabilities. Unfortunately in the latest
NOF—national outcomes framework—for 2013-14, this
indicator is still in the inactive “development” stage.
Will the Minister advise when the Government will give it live status
and assure the House that the threshold will be reviewed year on year

problems is the difficulty that we still have in the identification of
people with learning disabilities in health and care records. This was
one of the recommendations of the Michael inquiry and, again, the
confidential inquiry notes it as being of critical importance. Dr
Heslop explains that concerns would never have been raised about many
cases reviewed by the confidential inquiry had their care not been
scrutinised. I agree with her that professionals learn more and change
their practice more by being reflective and reviewing cases using a
root-cause analysis approach. Merely telling a professional to do
something rarely works, as is evidenced by the lack of adherence to the
Mental Capacity Act and the Equality

response which acknowledges the findings that health inequalities exist
but contains no set goals or timescales and no ways of measuring
improvements. They could instead have followed the structured style of
response they made to the Winterbourne View hospital scandal by working
with stakeholders, including families and carers—many of whom
are listening to the debate today, and whose presence I welcome. Will

evidence that this is the right thing to do, a decision will not be

of the report that deals with annual health checks. Such checks for
people with learning disabilities are an excellent way for doctors to
pick up early even more serious problems than the patients themselves
realise they have or are able to articulate. In some cases, if a person
is not medicated, it could be the only time in a year when a GP sits
face to face with them.</hs_para>

check with health action plans is extremely important. The regular
screenings that the rest of the population almost take for
granted—because we are reminded that we are due a certain
screening and we welcome this preventive and early opportunity to check
whether there is a problem—is something that people with
learning disabilities may lose out on because, when a letter arrives
telling them it is time to phone for an appointment for a particular
screening, they may simply throw away the letter and never have the
screening. The annual health check therefore provides that
opportunity.</hs_para>

inquiry found that the weakest link in the chain of the care pathway
for people with learning disabilities was problems with diagnosis. It
is very easy to misinterpret or ignore something from someone who is
unable to articulate their symptoms or pain. I believe that it is key

functions to ensure that it is used to provide a much more
comprehensive look at, and a holistic approach to, that person’s
health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:52:40"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government have accepted that there is inequality in healthcare
investigations. They have detailed how NHS England will address this
through working with clinical commissioning groups, and I understand
that they will set out the details later in the year. That will be a

learning disabilities in particular, and—the House will not be
surprised to hear me say—for those on the autistic spectrum,
many of whom also have learning disabilities, communication is a major
issue. It is important for primary care services to understand the
patient; if that person needs to attend a GP or nurse appointment
accompanied by someone who can interpret their mood, behaviour and
articulation, the primary care services must take into account that
this can be quite painstaking and time-consuming. If people with a
learning disability are to be treated equally, it is very important
that the primary care service, and the services in hospitals when
investigations often take place, allow for the fact that there may need
to be a person in support who will help the clinicians to interpret how
the other person is

gives us the opportunity to discuss this issue. The report makes for
sobering reading. Many noble Lords speaking in this debate have far
more expertise in these matters than I have—in fact, looking
around the Benches, I think that they all have—but the first NHS
trust board that I sat on more than 15 years ago was a community trust

some
understanding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:05:50"></hs_TimeCode>. I
commend the work in this area by both the noble Baroness who, during
her tenure as president of the BMA, sought to raise the profile of
learning disability, and the noble Lord, Lord Rix, a long-time advocate
of those with learning disability, and president of Mencap, which I
thank for producing an excellent

the past, there have been plenty of situations and reports, and we have
heard about some of them today, that should have given successive
Governments a wake-up call regarding poor provision for people with a
learning disability—Budock Hospital and Winterbourne View, to
name two, both of which point to the inevitable health inequalities.
For many years now we have known that the health commissioning of
learning disability services has been poor. Many PCTs wrote a cheque to
providers and effectively asked them to get on with it. Indeed, there
is a historic similarity with mental health service commissioning.
Mental health now has parity of esteem status with physical health, but
it does not feel as if the same can be said for learning disabled
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:07:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0002.htm#13071872000177">The
history of a lack of communication between health and social care in
this area is well known, too. It was as if, after the move to take
people out of large establishments and put them into domestic settings,
commissioners and providers decided that the job was done, the

forgotten. I must acknowledge that there are some splendid services,
but that standard is not yet universal.</hs_para>

services? Here I have to thank Professor Jim Mansell of the University
of Kent for the list from his 2010 report, <I>Raising Our Sights</I>.
Good services should be individualised and person-centred, treat the
family and carers as expert, focus on staff relations with the
individual, sustain the package of care and be cost-effective. In
addition, they should be supportive, use appropriate advocacy and be
predictive and well implemented. I do not wish to belittle the work of
the professor but none of this list should come as a surprise to the
House. The surprise and shame is that this list is not part of
universal practice.</hs_para>

to cover all aspects of the report so shall focus on information,
staffing and the Mental Capacity Act. The report puts the spotlight
back on mortality. As we have already heard, it is particularly
appropriate that we are discussing the mortality of people with a
learning disability in the week when the Keogh report did just that for
the total population served by 14 hospitals. Sir Bruce was able to do
that because he had the data. This report is based on a dataset that is
not normally collected for people with a learning

report’s first recommendation is that people with learning
disability should be clearly identified on the central NHS registration
system and in all healthcare systems. Although outside the scope of the
report, this information should be recorded on social care records too.
A learning disability flag should be part of a standardised dataset and
I would hope that a combined, patient-held record would be a reality in
the not too distant future. Not only does this make identification
easier, it would aid audit and research, make joint strategic needs
assessments far more accurate and easier to produce and make reasonable
adjustments easier to flag, thus improving commissioning and
contracting. This is not an unreasonable request, it is an issue of
equality, and without it people with learning disability cannot be
treated equally. I would like the Government to commit to a clear
timeline for this work, so would the Minister tell us what that is, or
when we might know what it
is?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0003.htm#13071872000181">Moving to
staffing, the report calls for a named health worker to be allocated to
those with complex or multiple health needs, and I welcome the

I turn to the Mental Capacity Act, which the noble Baroness, Lady
Browning, has covered well. As she has said, it is currently under
scrutiny in your Lordships’ House and is pivotal to people with
a learning disability, as it is to any vulnerable group. Advice under
this Act should be available at all times and easily accessible. That
will pose challenges in delivery, and I ask the Government not to
forget or ignore patient involvement and engagement in this. Members of
the sector are very good advocates, but there is a real need for people
with learning disability to be consulted and involved in improving

has set out very clearly, the figures are shocking and should rightly
make us very angry indeed. The fact that 37% of deaths
investigated by the confidential inquiry could have been prevented with
better healthcare should rightly motivate us to do all that we can to
tackle the startling health inequalities that people with a learning
disability face. I share her concern that the Government have not gone
far enough in order to bring about the change we really need to see. It

2006, I was a commissioner at the Disability Rights Commission and
worked on the formal, 18-month investigation into healthcare given to
people with mental health problems and learning disabilities. It was
then that I first came across the findings of the work undertaken by
the noble Baroness, Lady Hollins, that those under 50 years of age with
learning disabilities or mental health issues were 58 times more likely
to die from medical conditions not associated with their disability

likely is a staggering

DRC’s resulting report, <I>Equal Treatment: Closing the Gap</I>,

England and Wales, examined several million health records and found
that people with learning disabilities and mental health problems were
more likely to have a major illness, to develop a serious health
condition younger, and to die sooner than the rest of the population.
Despite this, the same group of people were less likely to have routine
tests and screening to pick up signs of a problem at early stages. For
example, people with learning disabilities who have diabetes have fewer
measurements of their body mass index, while those who have had a
stroke have fewer blood pressure

of the aims of the work was to see which areas of the NHS would need to

clear that GPs needed to make reasonable adjustments in order for
people with a learning disability to access healthcare effectively.
This included simple things such as making appointments by e-mail,
providing treatment information in alternative formats or sending text
or phone appointment reminders. Also important in terms of reasonable
adjustments was raising awareness and understanding among both GP

is demonstrated powerfully through the story of Susan. Susan
died on 1 February 2011 in St Christopher’s Hospice in Sydenham,
having been transferred the previous day from Lewisham Hospital. She
was 59 and had cancer. Although Susan had been diagnosed with breast
cancer some years previously, she had lived happily with her sister
Brenda. Both were actively involved with their local Mencap in Lewisham
and Susan often volunteered at events and outings. Susan was admitted
to Lewisham Hospital on 15 January 2011 with vomiting and jaundice.
Like so many other family members and carers, Brenda visited Susan
every day and made herself known to staff as Susan’s main carer.
As there was no learning disability specialist nurse available on the
ward, Brenda found herself regularly explaining to staff about
Susan’s care needs and becoming increasingly frustrated by the
general lack of understanding and awareness about learning disability,
which seemed to permeate the hospital. At one low point, Brenda was
told by the matron that her staff, “don’t encounter
people with learning disabilities in hospital that often”.
Consequently, no adjustments were made to accommodate Susan’s
needs, leaving Brenda fearful and anxious for Susan’s treatment
unless she was there on an almost round-the-clock basis. Despite a
complaint to the hospital by Brenda about a potential breach of the
Equality Act for a failure to make reasonable adjustments to
accommodate Susan’s learning disability, progress was slow, and
a year after Susan’s death, the hospital had still failed to

there was no excuse, the duty having been there since 1999. In order to

Tyler of Enfield:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my congratulations to
the noble Baroness, Lady Hollins, on initiating this critically
important debate. As the title of the debate states—it bears
repeating—we are today discussing the health inequalities of a
particularly vulnerable group, highlighted by the confidential inquiry
into the premature deaths of people with learning disabilities. I speak
today not because of any specialist knowledge but because of my
interest in health inequalities, of which this is such a stark example,
and I am grateful to the National Development Team for Inclusion for
its

am sure we can all agree that many of the findings of the report were
horrifying. I will not repeat the statistics that many other noble
Lords have already given the House. Suffice it to say that nearly three

<?notus-xml column=970?>times as many people with learning disabilities die avoidably than die
among the general population. Like many noble Lords, I find this
shocking. Surely the issue should be treated with the same seriousness
and urgency as responses to the appalling events at both Winterbourne
View and Mid Staffs. The latter led to the highly influential Francis
report and the immediate implementation by government of some of its
key
recommendations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:28:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

points on the factors leading to this vulnerability and these premature
deaths. The confidential inquiry found that a fifth of people with
learning difficulties experience significant difficulty or delay in
diagnosis of their illness and that, as a result, there is often too
little proactive care for this group and too many crisis-driven
responses. It found a lack of reasonable adjustments to help
healthcare, particularly in basic things such as attendance at GP
surgeries and clinics; that GP referrals often do not mention learning
difficulties; and very limited hospital flagging systems. Additionally
it found that poor record keeping is creating problems and that, in
some instances, even “do not resuscitate” orders in
patients’ records have been found to be inappropriately or
poorly documented. As others have said, there was poor adherence to the
Mental Capacity Act and, finally, the inquiry identified poor
co-ordination of care across and between different disease pathways and
service providers, which failed to understand the episodic nature of
care provision. That is only a
few<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:29:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0003.htm#13071872000207">We
know a great deal about the problem and we cannot continue to allow one
group of people, those with learning disabilities, to experience such
drastic healthcare inequality. It is because I know that the Government
have such a strong commitment to reducing health inequalities that
today I ask the Minister to consider immediate action in the specific
areas on which I will focus my contribution. I am encouraged to do so
in the knowledge that the Care and Support Minister, my honourable

they could identify those people with learning difficulties who are
afraid of seeking medical assistance and provide them and their carers

treatment arises. Secondly, they could offer a named healthcare
co-ordinator to all people with learning difficulties with two or more
long-term conditions and to those who live unsupported or with minimal
support in the community with one or more long-term conditions. This
would be akin to the Government’s recent proposals to refresh
the NHS mandate, including by providing a co-ordinating clinician for
the non-hospital care of another very vulnerable population—the
elderly. This is something I very much

Emerton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Hollins
for this timely debate and for her contribution over the years on the
issue of learning disabilities. I declare an interest as a retired
general nurse. Not holding any qualification in mental handicap, as it
was then referred to, I have limited experience 
<?notus-xml column=972?>with learning disabilities, mainly associated with
relocating patients from the large hospitals in the 1970s until the
late 1980s. However, that experience was one that has stayed with me in
terms of demonstrating that people with learning disabilities and their
families are a group who require a range of specialties to come
together to ensure that their quality of life is the best
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0003.htm#13071872000217">Although
this debate is asking the Minister what steps the Government are taking
to address health inequalities, it is difficult just to debate health,
as has already been illustrated today, because so much is dependent on
the part played by education, social care and families. The opportunity
has now been given to us, with the new Health and Social Care Act and
the Care Bill, to develop healthcare pathways further. We should take
this opportunity to ensure connection and communication through the
education system, social care and specialist mental health care and
that learning disability staff are involved in the total well-being of
the individual and the family. Otherwise it is likely that there will
be gaps which, in turn, may be detrimental to the general health of the
individual with the learning
disability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0003.htm#13071872000218">It
is now 65 years since the NHS was introduced with the assurance of free
care for all at the point of delivery. During those 65 years, we have
seen many developments for those suffering a learning disability, which
have come step by step and usually following the unfortunate findings
of inquiries into poor care, such as in Ely, Farleigh and
Whittingham—all large hospitals that were found wanting in the
delivery of care. In the 1970s, we abolished long-stay large hospitals
and moved patients into the community, which was a big step towards a
pathway for each individual that set a programme of care according to
their needs. However, even within the 20 years since that move, we have
cause for concern about small units that have failed in their delivery
of care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0003.htm#13071872000219">This
confidential inquiry into premature death provides the opportunity to
address the pathway for learning disabilities and for health and social
care professionals, support workers, educationalists and families to
contribute to the development of a meaningful, holistic pathway for
every individual person with a learning disability. This surely demands
a culture change and leadership, as well as offering a learning
opportunity for all health and social care professionals and general
educationalists to understand the philosophy of caring for those with a
learning disability. It requires good communication links between all
of those, with each of them understanding the overall philosophy and
strategy of an integrated pathway for the individual. It is clear that
this would be a large piece of work and would take time to be achieved.
It will require all of the disciplines to be involved, as well as the
families, who we know have had to fight a long battle to break down the
barriers between all the involved agencies. There needs to be shared
ownership of that responsibility—everyone has to ensure that the
pathway is high quality and leads to people living as normal a life as

confidential inquiry, I would make four points. The first is about
health records, which has already been mentioned in detail by the

beyond the wit of any of us to see that it would be possible to get a
health record that can not only integrate the issues relating to the
handicap but attach a personal profile to the health action plan that
could be implemented and given quickly to the person and to the

there is advanced healthcare planning. I suggest that the Government
need to give further guidance once long-term problems are diagnosed.
There should be a trigger for the plans to be instigated and a risk
assessment and a crisis-point plan drawn up. These health plans could
easily be put together as long as there is communication between all
aspects and that the medical side is aware of the way
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0003.htm#13071872000222">My
noble friend Lord Rix has already mentioned palliative care and the
dreadful time that the patient in Lewisham experienced. The
confidential inquiry identified some problems with end of life care. It
is clear that palliative care teams need to be supported during the
time that palliative care is being provided to a learning disability
patient. A specialist learning disability nurse should be
available to those teams when this is required.
At least two patients in every hospital have a
learning disability. Of these some may have profound
multiple learning disabilities. The role of the registered learning
disability nurse is important in giving guidance in hospitals on the
specialist support of patients. Can the Government ensure that
workforce planning outcomes include a calculation for the roles of
nurses qualified in learning disabilities to be available for such
teams?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0003.htm#13071872000223">If the
noble Earl agrees that this should be the way forward, what steps will
the Government take to ensure that that NHS England, Public Health
England, local authorities and professional regulators develop the
curriculum and standards for health and social, social care
professionals and general educationalists, Healthwatch, well-being
boards, and charities such as Mencap to meet the requirements for the
best possible pathway for healthy living within the capabilities of the
individuals suffering a learning disability and their families? This

taken forward in the light of the report by the noble Baroness, Lady
Neuberger, will be an opportunity to look specifically at the needs of
people with learning disabilities to ensure that they are captured
within the new approach. I hope it is something that the Minister may
be able to take on
board.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0003.htm#13071872000230">The
noble Baroness, Lady Tyler, spoke about the employment of specialist
staff in hospital. My trust has recently employed two people to do
that. If one looks at the recent seminar that the noble Baroness, Lady
Hollins, chaired under the auspices of the BMA, it is noticeable that
many of the recommendations coming from it are about communications;
training staff to identify and understand the needs of intellectually
disabled and mental health patients; changing the culture of the NHS
from unfounded, ill informed judgments about mental health and
intellectual disability patients; and ensuring those patients are
subject to the same access standards as physical health patients. Given
all the problems over the past few years, there is no doubt that
specialist staff within hospitals have an important role to
play.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000231" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0003.htm#13071872000231">Given
all this, it is difficult to know why the Government seem to be
dithering over establishing a national confidential inquiry.
The noble Baroness, Lady Hollins, described the
national confidential inquiry into perioperative deaths.
Over the decades, it has done outstanding work in indentifying patterns
of 
<?notus-xml column=975?>death that have led to improvements in services. The noble Baroness may
recall Mr Brendan Devlin, one of the great pioneers of the ECEPOD, who
never achieved the recognition that he ought to have received for his
work; I suspect that at the time he was not popular with his colleagues
in the profession. I remember talking to him and seeing the results of
those inquiries and the reports that were issued. I hope that the
Minister will be able to say something a little more positive about the
Government’s intentions. The benefit of a permanent confidential
inquiry is that year after year, in report after report, evidence will
be brought forward and statistics will be made available. I am
convinced that it is a very powerful way to drive up standards in
future. The great risk is that if we do not have another inquiry, the
issue will go away and will be forgotten in the health service. That is
why one needs permanent machinery to enable it to be
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000232" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0003.htm#13071872000232">If
it is a question of finance—I have to be very cautious about
what I say on funding issues—comparisons concerning the cost of
a permanent national confidential inquiry into the deaths of people
with learning disabilities could only be minimal in terms of the human
cost to those people and their families of the premature deaths that
are caused by the current problems in services.</hs_para>

have two final comments. My noble friend Lord Touhig raised an
important issue about the role of general practitioners and some of the
failings in our primary care medical services. The Minister knows now
that the responsibility for contracting with GPs lies with
NHS England. It would appear that NHS England also has a big role to
play in ensuring a continuous and permanent confidential inquiry. Is
the Minister satisfied that NHS England has the capacity to develop and
drive policy in this area? Surely it is in its hands. It has the
ability to fund and organise a national confidential inquiry. It also
has the ability to ensure that the issues my noble friend raised about
access to GP services are dealt with effectively in contracts with
general practitioners. I hope there will be further opportunities to
debate these important issues in the future and that the Minister might
be prepared to take back the pressing question of a permanent
confidential
inquiry.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_18_PT_1/F0B59E124CEADD831A6905D2A1A84BDB7ECAC2F8" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 July 2013">Thursday,

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all the speakers in this
excellent debate for their very powerful contributions, not least the
noble Baroness, Lady Hollins. I want to start by paying tribute to
Mencap, which has 
<?notus-xml column=976?>been campaigning vigorously against the preventable deaths of people
with learning disabilities. Mencap has revealed fundamental failures in
communication between care providers, on the one hand, and parents and
carers, on the other, as the main cause. However, it has also concluded
that the only other explanation for these preventable deaths is
prejudice. The disturbing reality is that this prejudice, although
rarely revealed in words, finds its expression in deeds, sins of
omission and neglect. Any failure to understand what should be a
fundamental tenet of NHS practice is shameful: every life is different,
yet every life has the same value.</hs_para>

opportunity to make the Government’s position clear.
Mencap’s report, <I>Death by Indifference</I>, marked the start
of six years of shocking revelations of inhumane and degrading
treatment, culminating in the recent publication of the <I>Confidential
Inquiry into Premature Deaths of People with a Learning Disability</I>.
We established the confidential inquiry in 2010 and funded and
supported it for three years. As Sir Jonathan Michael’s report,
<I>Healthcare for All</I><I>,</I> recommended, it was time limited. Its
purpose was to provide evidence on the relevant issues and guidance on
preventing premature deaths. It has done this very effectively and I
thank the confidential inquiry team for its excellent
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071872000237" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-0003.htm#13071872000237">This

they are not getting the right care, and noble Lords have cited some

makes for sobering reading, it gives us a clear indicator of the areas
that need to be tackled, preparing the ground for the
Government’s response to the confidential inquiry which was

eradicate substandard practice and to work in partnership across the

learning disabilities. We expect local organisations to use local
mortality data to inform joint strategic needs assessments and joint

disabilities, who will help improve the experience of people with
learning disabilities in care. Local areas can set up their own
arrangements to review mortality in people with learning disabilities.
Some are already doing so, working with the confidential inquiry team.

the capacity payment or all the other bits that make up energy market
reform; it is about energy market reform as a whole. Clause 5(2)

thing that everybody has agreed, particularly the Secretary of State
and Ministers at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, is that
as this Bill has been considered in its draft stage and by the informal
group of this House, it emerged that it had a bias towards supply. That
may have come from old thinking from many years ago and had not caught
up with a new way of looking at the overall issue of energy
provision within the United Kingdom. I very much welcome the fact that
the Secretary of State and the Government have started to take this on
board and there are a number of mentions within the Bill of the demand
side of the equation, in terms of both demand reduction and demand-side
response. Of course, the previous Energy Bill was all about energy
reduction in terms of the Green Deal so this is an agenda that
is live.</hs_para>

Minister might say that I am absolutely right, and that the United
Kingdom is one of the most energy-efficient economies in Europe and
indeed the world. Part of the reason is that we have a relatively small

energy-intensive industries, but we rely on our service

the other hand, we have a housing stock and a building stock which are
still very inefficient: in fact DECC estimated in its energy-efficiency
strategy, which came out towards the end of last year, and which I
welcomed at the time, that 14 million homes were not insulated to an
acceptable standard, from a stock of 27 million. For those of you who
can do maths—even if they could not do the equation we dealt
with earlier this week—that is just over 50% of total
housing stock. In fact around 40% of total housing stock was
built before the end of World War II, and a significant proportion of
that before the end of World War I. That shows the issues we have
around energy efficiency in this country, some of it being dealt with,
we hope, as the Green Deal becomes more effective as time

intend to do here is to rebalance this Bill in a key area of
electricity market reform, where we set out what we are trying to
achieve. We are not removing the supply side; we are adding demand as
an equal factor. We are saying that there should be a preference for
not 
<?notus-xml column=327?>spending rather than spending, but only where that
makes economic sense. In the cost abatement curves shown in the many
multicoloured DECC documents, energy efficiency always comes0 out on
the left-hand side of the graph, which means it is the most
cost-effective way to attack our energy needs and to shape how the
energy market works in the future. I beg to

improving this Bill we are drafting the law. The law has to be
unambiguous. The law places obligations on the citizen; the citizen
needs to know precisely what those obligations are if the law is going
to be effective, dignified and respected. This provision could not
possibly from part of a law in that sense. The phrase
“economically appropriate” is so vague that it is almost
impossible to know what it might mean and where one would need to
decide, using this principle, between an energy-saving investment and
an energy-generating investment. I notice that the noble Lord, in
introducing this amendment, did not actually refer to
“economically appropriate”: he used the term
“economically sensible”, which he perhaps feels is a
synonym. However, the use of a different word only adds to the
vagueness and uncertainty, which should not come to rest in the corpus
of the law of the
land.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13071871000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000016">I
suppose that what the noble Lord might have had in mind with the phrase
“economically appropriate”, or even “economically
sensible”, is the solution that has the highest economic return,
but even that would be a very vague phrase to place in a Bill in the
corpus of law. After all, in choosing between one particular project
with a relatively high capital cost and a relatively high return and
another with a lower capital cost and a lower return, or between a
project with a high capital cost and a long payout period and another
with the same capital cost and a different payout period, which one to
be chosen would depend on the cost of capital, on which one was
discounting the projected cash flows. If you wanted to make this a
precise obligation, you would have to specify what the cost of
capital would be. It would be and should be, of course,
different according to the different risks for different types of
energy projects, because they would have different risks. Therefore, I
do not see any prospect here of reducing the unambiguous guidance that
is necessary in law so that the citizen or, indeed, the Secretary of
State would know precisely whether he was observing the law or
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:11:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000017"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Roper" PimsId="452" UID="13071871000145" xid="1155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000145">Lord
Roper:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 55ZA in this group is in my
name and that of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of London. As
has already been 
<?notus-xml column=328?>mentioned, when the draft Bill was published in May
last year, there was a great deal of criticism that there was nothing
in it on electricity demand reduction. Indeed, those of us who sat on
the informal group with the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, drew attention to
this in the document that we produced and suggested that it ought to be
included. When this Bill was published last November, there was still
no reference. Fortunately, at the same time, the department started a
consultation into demand reduction, and on 21 May it published its
response to that consultation. At the same time, it tabled an
amendment, which was then proposed new Clause 12 and is now Clause 37
in this Bill, the clause that I wish to
amend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:12:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000018">The
interesting point in the response to the consultation is that the
department suggested that its preferred route to delivering reductions
in electricity demand is via a capacity market—I am talking here
not of a demand-supply response but of permanent reductions in
electricity demand. I have always had some difficulty in seeing how
that could fit in to a capacity market. I therefore grabbed the
delivery plan last night to read the section on the capacity market in
order to discover how it should occur. I am extremely sorry to have to
tell your Lordships that, having read that whole section overnight, I
found no reference at all to electricity demand reduction, not even to
demand-side response. I sometimes wonder whether there are two DECCs,
one writing one thing and one writing another. I hope that I am not
misleading the Committee in that
view<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:13:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
important thing is that Clause 37, which was introduced in the other
place, suggests that a pilot scheme should be developed to look at
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:13:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000019">In
our amendment, the right reverend Prelate and I suggest that we should
aim it rather more widely. There ought to be a number of different
pilot schemes and, if it is possible to envisage how it could be done,
they ought to be included within the capacity market. Alternatively, we
could look along other lines, including those discussed in Committee in
another place, of finding some sort of premium for this. There are
quite a number of problems with the use of the capacity market in
dealing with the permanent reduction of electricity demand. There is of
course uncertainty as to how big a capacity auction will be. Therefore,
people who invest in permanent reductions are unclear from time to time
as to what sort of return they will get for that
reduction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:15:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:14:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_18_PT_1/8ED179CBB9CF1D60BFA4BB4E9DE804AE55587806" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 July 2013">Thursday,

permanent reduction may on some occasions be done on a fairly
substantial level but may very often be done, as we heard from the
right reverend Prelate in his Second Reading speech, by individual
parishes, which could perhaps be aggregated in some terms but also
could be undertaken by SMEs or other bodies. How they would fit into a
capacity market auction is by no means easy to see. It seems to me,
therefore, that it would be helpful if the Government could give us
some sort of
assurance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:15:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000021">The
other important issue is that, if we are going to have some sort of
auction eventually, probably it should be a separate auction from the
general capacity market auction. We will come back to that in our
discussions of later clauses today. But the question of 
<?notus-xml column=329?>whether there should be more than one auction obviously has some
importance here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:15:53"></hs_TimeCode>.
We need to have some sort of clarification on the way in which the
Government see these pilots being run, including how long they will
last, when the results will be reported, and how large the pilots will
be. I understand that the current indications from the department are
that a demand reduction pilot will not be up and running for a number
of years, which is extremely unfortunate. Reduction in demand is an
extremely good way to solve some of the problems we are discussing
today. Therefore, I very much hope that in replying to this discussion,
although this amendment will not be pressed, the Minister will give an
indication of the way in which this is to be
explored<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:16:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Cameron of Dillington:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the
theme of these two amendments, particularly the latter one. It is
widely recognised that energy demand reduction is one of the cheapest
ways to achieve decarbonisation of our economy. I have seen
figures—I am not sure whether they came from DECC—which
state that energy saving could reduce demand by 26% by 2030. I imagine
that that 26% is not from where we are now but from where we would be
if we did not have any form of energy demand reduction schemes in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:17:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000023">It
worries me, as the noble Lord, Lord Roper, was saying, that DECC
originally said that it would be implementing energy demand reduction
via the capacity market. Perhaps I am quite glad that the noble Lord
did not find any reference to it in his reading last night because
maybe we have got that wrong. To be honest, it makes absolutely no
sense. Why wait for the capacity auction next year and implementation
in four years’ time before introducing demand reduction schemes?
Why wait for a capacity crunch before introducing them? We need these
schemes to start now or as soon as possible. As the noble Lord, Lord
Teverson, said, we are not talking about energy security or even
capacity margins; we are talking about emission reductions across the
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:18:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to accept that the Government might want to run pilots here, although
the noble Lord, Lord Roper, was absolutely right that we need to put
details in those pilots; for example, when the results will be, what
will happen afterwards and so on. We have seriously to get on with
this.</hs_para>

of opportunities are available. Smart meters are the first that come to
mind. A supply company can run machines within a business or a
household that are very expensive on electricity—tumble dryers
and even dishwashers can wait until the smart meter tells it to turn
itself on. Obviously, it should be allowed to be overridden by the
householder but the householder must know exactly what cost there will
be if he or she overrides the meter. There will be certain
times—obviously, when people come home from work and turn on the
kettle, or when they get up from watching a film or “Coronation
Street”—when the electricity companies know intimately
when the peak demand will be. The prices should be allocated
accordingly.</hs_para>

in future, smart meters could—nay, should—be sensitive to
the amount of supply available. If a large proportion of our supply
such as photovoltaics or wind turbines is dependent on the 
<?notus-xml column=330?>weather, a smart meter should know what the weather is to be tonight at
6 pm when the peak demand is coming and therefore what the capacity
margin will be. For instance, in Germany last week—and probably
this week as well—at certain times, 33% of the national
electricity supply came from photovoltaics. Clearly, at those times
there was no shortage of power in the country and no need to restrict
demand at all by
cost.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000027">The
noble Lord, Lord Teverson, also said that demand reduction could be
encouraged by better energy rating in housing. I could not agree more.
Again in Germany, 360,000 homes have been brought down to near zero
emissions by lending money to householders at 1%. Perhaps a pilot could
be encouraged on those lines; as we all know, the Green Deal has not
been very effective as
yet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:21:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000028">However,
the most important move, because it throws down the gauntlet
to the entrepreneurial flair of industrialists, business people and
householders themselves, is to pilot and introduce as soon as possible
energy efficiency premium payments. Those schemes have worked very well
in the USA and, I believe, could work in the UK if bundled together
with grants for capital investment. That could, incidentally, include
hundreds of household or office-based batteries linked to the smart
meter—so electricity is going in and out of those batteries.

scepticism. I am sorry if that sounds strong, but if we analyse a great
many clauses in detail and think of the circumstances in which they
would be applied, we realise that they impose non-binding constraints
and impose no particular behaviour by the Government that might staunch

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> I follow on from my noble
friend’s remark and say that Amendment 51N is pretty vacuous. It
is giving us the excuse to have a debate, but it will not come to
anything. It is certainly the case that the Government have been
reasonably successful in demand reduction because of their economic
incompetence over the past three years. We have been in recession, we
have seen emissions fall and we have seen the demand for electricity
change. That is the first point which has to be made.</hs_para>

will come out of this recession—and when we do, we are going to
need far more than Amendment 51N would do regarding capacity changes.
We are, I hope, going to have an economy growing in a manner which, in
its early stages, will probably not be the most attractive for energy
efficiency. In some respects, we want to get out of the recession as
quickly as possible. Having to chase around for the most
energy-efficient way of doing that when we are trying to find economic
prosperity for our people would be questionable in the eyes of the
public and their sense of priorities. Frankly, the quicker we move on
from this amendment the better, because it is a waste of time, although
the other amendment has a degree of merit. I am also always dubious

That is a bit like trying to compare last week’s weather with

lies rather more out of the three years that we are completing. It has
a great deal to do with what went on before, but that is not what I

explain that there was a time, quite a number of years ago, when I had
the ultimate responsibility for the complete built estate owned by
Essex County Council, which is a major operation. Among the things that
we had to do, there was the little matter of energy
efficiency. There was also the question of the quality of buildings,
because there were some truly appalling buildings around in those days.
It was a constant balancing act as to what we did. Two factors were
vital. In those days interest rates, which fortunately we do not have
to consider today, went up and down rather like a yo-yo so that schemes
went into and out of our plans depending on those rates. The other
factor was of course the price of energy itself. If your Lordships want
people to take an interest in economising 
<?notus-xml column=332?>on energy, the quickest way to do it is to put the price up. That is a
brutal reality and we should not forget it. Price will always be an
important factor.</hs_para>

question of demand management, I have my own view on smart meters.
First, they are not very good at demand management; what they do is to
move the demand around so that you can reduce the peaks and troughs on
the supply side, to a certain degree. However, they do not actually
reduce demand in total. We may as well bear that factor in mind.
Secondly, we have to bear in mind that the idea that we might somehow
reduce demand for electricity is unreal in the present context. We are
looking at a period when we have to decarbonise the whole economy, in
effect. That means that everything has to go down to zero emissions at
the end of this period. In order to do that, we will be obliged to have
an electricity generating market which is probably twice as big as it
is today, if not even bigger. The idea that we are going to reduce
demand for electricity, bearing in mind this evolution, is completely
unreal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000039">My
last point is that the same person has to pay, whether it is for energy
or for the economy measures. There is only one customer. We do not want
to fool ourselves that the Government have a fund of money to do this
with. The Government have our money, and one way or another the
customer is going to pay. It is a question of balance. I am all for
getting all the efficiency that we can into the generating system and
into the demand system. However, we should not fool
ourselves—whichever way the equation goes, it is still the case
that one person is paying. I am slightly pleased about the initial
criticism of these amendments, because introducing a phrase such as
“where economically possible” into the equation puts a
bit of sense into it. If it were not there, you could start taking some
very rash decisions which in fact were not economically
sensible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:30:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_18_PT_1/EC0AAAC332EEA3590F236C9CF4ADEC69E9664E67" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 July 2013">Thursday,

Teverson, for his introduction to the debate on the demand side of
energy. He is quite right to draw attention to this. Although other
noble Lords may have been teasing in their remarks, the Second Reading
debate highlighted that the Government are coming rather late in their
thinking to these subjects, and our later amendments will explore all
the different technicalities on the demand-side
responses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:31:00"></hs_TimeCode>.

new paragraph in his amendment on making the efficiency measures
EU-compliant. Again, we note the position that we are in at the moment
and that the directive requires member states to set an indicative
national energy efficiency target based either on energy consumption or
on energy savings, or indeed on energy intensity, as the
noble Lord, Lord Teverson, suggests in the amendment. We wonder how
that might take account of the decarbonisation challenges that we will
be facing. Also, we will be monitoring more than one change at a time
to take into account GDP changes. Therefore, we would be very
interested in knowing how the Government view this measurement of
energy

to Amendment 55ZA, which concerns pilots, once again we note that the
Government are coming rather late in their thinking to the demand side
and that they therefore want to make provision to help their
thinking to progress by running a pilot scheme. Clause 37
gives the Government powers to run a pilot scheme for electricity
demand reduction. While the clause does not specify that this pilot
scheme should take the form of a pilot capacity auction, it is clear
from the consultation response that that is what DECC is
considering<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:32:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

market is primarily designed to ensure capacity throughout troughs in
supply, and it will therefore reward only demand reduction projects
that reduce the amount of generating capacity that is needed at such
times and not those that reduce demand at other times. A capacity
market therefore rewards energy efficiency only for its security
benefits and not its other, much larger benefits in terms of emissions
reductions and
affordability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:33:26"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, we are aware that an additional policy is needed to enable
small businesses and households, and not just large infrastructure
projects, to be rewarded for saving energy.</hs_para>

be welcome.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:33:52"></hs_TimeCode>Therefore we
support the call on Her Majesty’s Government to clarify whether
DECC should bring forward multiple pilot schemes to include premium
payments, a capacity market and perhaps other forms of incentives. This
would demonstrate which scheme or schemes were most effective in

mentions how these pilots might be financed. Clause 37 states that it
will be paid out of government funds rather than through consumer
prices. However, following the spending review, a figure of £75
million for investment in innovative energy projects was mentioned. I
understand that DECC suggests that only about £25 million of
this will be available for the
pilot<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:34:45"></hs_TimeCode>. In any
event, those sums are dwarfed by DECC’s own assessment of the
cost for full capacity auction. Amendment 55ZA would allow pilot
reduction schemes to be funded at least in part from capacity payments
either in advance or during a capacity auction period. Will the
Minister clarify to the Committee where the Government have got to in

highlight the importance of demand reduction and the fact that this
Bill came rather late to it, as has been said by others. I was somewhat
confused by some of the earlier comments from those who said that they
were in favour of energy efficiency but were not sure about demand
reduction. If you increase energy efficiency, you reduce demand. That

were to take something like that forward, we could have a demonstration
about which scheme or schemes are the most
effective in 
<?notus-xml column=334?>delivering permanent demand reduction. In a sense,
that ties in with the amendment of my noble friend Lord

efficiency a general consideration when carrying out key functions of
electricity market reform. I also welcome the cross-party support

I support the sentiment behind the amendment, we consider energy
efficiency to be more than just about the efficient use of electricity,
on which the amendment appears to focus. Therefore, the danger of this
amendment is that, in focusing on efficiency of electricity use, it
risks diverting attention from the wider importance of energy
efficiency, on which we are already committed to progressing. When
exercising capacity market functions, proposed new paragraph
(f) would require the Secretary of State to give priority to demand
side management and demand reduction measures over increased
electricity generating capacity wherever this was economically
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000051">The
capacity market is being designed to allow demand side response and
permanent electricity demand reduction measures to participate in the
capacity market. This is a proven way of delivering electricity demand
reduction and is already working successfully in the United States. The
auction process is a fundamental pillar of the capacity market and all
resources that can contribute to security of supply. Demand side
response, permanent demand reduction and generation, are able to
compete against each other for support in the long term. This will
ensure that demand side measures that deliver the same level of
security of supply benefits as generation at a lower cost will always
be rewarded at the expense of generation. Accordingly, I hope that my
noble friend will see that proposed new paragraph (f) will not add to
the practical effort of what is already envisaged for the capacity
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:39:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000052">Proposed

European policies, to which my noble friend referred, in the recently
adopted EU energy efficiency directive, which is aimed at driving
improvements in energy efficiency across the EU and contains, among
other measures, two key targets for member states, to which my noble

<?notus-xml column=335?>The first is a non-binding national energy efficiency target for 2020,

Article 3 of the directive. Under the target, the UK is projected to

In terms of domestic action, this Government have shown their
commitment to supporting every opportunity for energy-efficiency
measures. The policies that we have put in place, such as the Green
Deal, will help households and businesses reduce demand by installing
energy-efficiency improvements, with some or all of the cost paid for
from the savings on their energy bills. In addition, the energy

55ZA in the name of my noble friend Lord Roper, which aims to make an

come up a number of times at Second Reading: namely, that multiple

support my noble friend’s aim of ensuring that we test
variations of the key elements associated with demand reduction

37 is simply a spending power to authorise the spending of money for
such a purpose. I appreciate the concern that this amendment
demonstrates about ensuring that sufficient funds are available for a
demand reduction pilot. However, since it depends on the arrangements
for the capacity agreements made in Clauses 22 and 24, funding the
pilot in this way would have to wait until the affirmative regulations
implementing the capacity market are in place. We considered this
option but discounted it because the process would delay considerably
the start of a pilot, and, as I have said, the Government are committed

friend to withdraw his amendment, I will refer back to a few points
raised during the debate. First, the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, referred
to smart meters. I agree with him that increasing developments in new
technologies—and the smart meter is one example—will
ensure that consumers will have more control over how energy is being
used. It is one of a number of measures that we are taking. He also
asked why we are not getting on with a pilot. At the moment, there are
a number of uncertainties. We are working out how a pilot would lead to
a better understanding of the potential benefits of a financial
incentive and of the market appetite for such an approach. We are
considering detailed elements of how the design of that pilot, its
monitoring and its 
<?notus-xml column=336?>location would work. The noble Lord also mentioned
that Germany has 33% of its grid powered by solar. I respond to that by
saying that Germany also has much higher energy costs than the UK, of
both gas and electricity. We are delivering a low-carbon energy mix, at
least cost to the consumer: this is at the heart of what we are trying

this amendment forward, because it is fundamental to what we are
talking about. The electricity supply industry, over recent years, has
operated at an average of 50% efficiency. It only operates 50% of the

energy mix. That is why there is a problem and why we cannot, or should

generate is decarbonised and is produced and dealt with in a balanced
way to try to make that demand reduction. That is why those two new

amendment in a moment, but before I do, I ought just to say that it is
perfectly clear that greater competition is at the heart of what the
Government are aiming at. I have a letter here written by the former
Minister for Energy, my right honourable friend John Hayes,
to a company that has been seeking to break into the energy

that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13071871000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000126">“a

one looks back to the Electricity Act 1989—I see that an
amendment in the name of those on the Labour Front Bench
which has been grouped with mine refers to it—Ofgem is obliged
to protect the interests of consumers and promote effective
competition. However, there is nothing there or in the Bill which makes
it clear that that, too, has to be a duty of the Secretary of State.

moving to discuss the capacity market now, which, interestingly, used
to be called the capacity mechanism. Happily, “market”
begins with the same letter, M, so it has been transmuted into the
capacity market. Even its name suggests the market has to be a
competitive institution. Of course, we now know that there will be
auctions rather earlier than had originally been envisaged. The
auctions will happen next year but they are seen by many in the
industry as a way not only to ensure greater security of
supply—and there is no doubt that right at its heart, the
capacity mechanism is all about making sure that we have the generating
capacity to meet the demand from time to time—but to provide a
way in for independent producers to join the market and to compete for
contracts under the capacity

goes a little wider than I indicated when I gave notice that there

much consultation with firms which are anxious to play their part in

the wholly predominant role of the big six, all of which operate in one
way or another with a vertically integrated operation that goes all the
way from generation to supplying the final consumers. Other amendments
on the Marshalled List seek to break into that and I shall be

capacity mechanism is one of the ways in which the authorities intend
to intervene in the market. Indeed, having seen to what extent this is
under the control of the Secretary of State—certainly in the
initial years—one might say that it is more than intervening; it
is, in fact, running it. However, this is one of the ways in which the

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lords, Lord
Jenkin of Roding and Lord Roper, for tabling their amendment. We have
tabled a very similar amendment—great minds must think
alike.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000085">Our
Amendment 52A seeks to do almost exactly the same as Amendment 52,
which is to make it a requirement for the Secretary of State to have
the same duties as under the Electricity Act 1989, in which the
protection of “existing and future consumers” is
enshrined through the advancement of competition. We will discuss this
in more detail when we come to the amendment in the name of the noble
Lord, Lord Berkeley, who has come up with a much more precise way of
tackling this problem.</hs_para>

amendments seek to ensure that the Secretary of State has a duty to
advance competition. Much has been said, very eloquently, about the
need for that and how, if we are going to rely on a truly competitive
market, that needs to be enshrined in this Bill. So much of this Bill
relies on competition to deliver efficiency. There are many
complexities in many aspects of this Bill, particularly in Part 2,
where you have contracts for difference and capacity mechanisms, the
interplay between them and the effect that that has on investment
decisions, all of which is very complicated. The more transparent the
market is, the less opportunity there is for gaming and the more
successful this Bill will be in meeting its objectives. I fully support
the amendment tabled by the noble Lords on the other side, and our own
amendment seeks to do something
similar<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:06:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000087"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord O'Neill of Clackmannan" PimsId="4858" UID="13071871000159" xid="1875" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000159">Lord
O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> I remember the birth of the 1989
legislation. At that time, due to what were deemed to be the
fundamentals of competition, generation was split from distribution in
England and Wales. In Scotland, the companies were vertically
integrated. Throughout the 1990s it became a kind of adventure
playground for takeovers. We are where we are now in large measure
because a number of interested foreign companies, usually American,
took over the distribution companies; they subsequently sold them and
they were picked up by various people at different times. So we have
six players, which by and large are vertically integrated, as well as
Centrica.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000088">A
lot of wise words are being spoken about competition but I am not sure
if these amendments go far enough. As soon as a company becomes big
enough to be a threat or to be of interest to the large players, the
oligopolists of the present structure, they are gobbled up. We have
seen this fairly recently with the takeover of Ecotricity, a very
interesting, predominantly Irish company that engages in renewable
generation. I am not sure that these amendments are going to make an
awful lot of
difference.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000089">When
we go further and look at the break-up of the vertically integrated
companies, there is the likelihood of the two remaining companies being
taken over by other foreign players that have money that they wish to
expend in the United Kingdom. Therefore, I am very sceptical about how
we are going to achieve anything meaningful in the way of
competition.</hs_para>

six players—seven if you include First Utility, but that is
rather special because it is exclusively in the retail
market—and by and large they do the same as each other. They
confuse the tariffs, introduce difficult pricing schemes that we do not

understand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:09:04"></hs_TimeCode>—</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000091"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Roper" PimsId="452" UID="13071871000160" xid="1155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000160">Lord

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> I could not agree more with the
noble Lord. The point that I am trying to make is that, while First
Utility has had very dramatic growth—I have spoken to some of
its senior executives, who paint a very interesting picture—I am

<?notus-xml column=342?>not quite sure what the life expectancy of the
organisation would be if the main shareholders were given an offer that
they could not refuse by one of the big six. I do not think that there
is really anything in the competition legislation of the United Kingdom
or within the powers of the Secretary of State to do anything about
that. That is why I am a wee bit sceptical about us jumping up and down
and waving our arms on this issue because somehow there is something
intrinsically attractive in a new form of competition. I am not sure
whether it will be any different from what we had post-1989 and defy
the laws of economic or financial gravity that have been applying in
the intervening period.</hs_para>

I wish my colleagues well in promoting the amendment, I am not very
optimistic. In five years’ time, we might well be debating the
same issue and trying to secure a greater degree of competition because
of the inexorability of the forces that have been at work. I am not
overdramatising it or going into neo-Marxist stuff. I am merely making
the point that the six main players, who are big and who are not always
as nice as they appear, certainly like competition as it is and do not
seem to want anything else, and I am not sure whether many of the
ambitions of this Bill will actually change the status quo that
much.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071871000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000094">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:12:12"></hs_TimeCode>
are other options, which are not on the table, and I will not waste the
Committee’s time discussing them this afternoon. However, we
have to be perhaps a wee bit more realistic than we are. In the light
of past experience, even if it British companies did not want to take
over some of these smaller successful players, I am sure that there
would be international players, who would have a bit of financial elbow
room. They might even come in to see how a competitive market works, as
the Americans did in the 1990s—they thought they were going to
have liberalised markets in the United States, as the Germans thought
they might have liberalised markets. In fact, what they have is a
market with a number of players, but each of them is a regional
monopoly. Therefore, when we talk about competition, we have to be
quite clear that Britain is the exception as a competitive and
liberalised market, not the rule, as far as energy utilities world wide
are
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:12:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000095"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deben" PimsId="5754" UID="13071871000162" xid="2031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000162">Lord
Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, I am driven to get to my feet by the wise
words of the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill—he may be
embarrassed by this. They lead me to believe that this is a very
interesting and important amendment simply because it reminds the
Government, at a crucial point, of their responsibility to the
marketplace, where we are of necessity intervening in order to give it
a sense of time. After all, what we are really saying is that these
decisions are made not just for today and tomorrow; they have to be
made, given the problems, over a very much longer period. That is why
we are intervening in the market-driven mechanism. However, we have to
think about some of the fundamentals of the market as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:13:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071871000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000096">I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill, when he points to the
oligopoly in which Britain is. He is right to say that other countries
are in a worse position, but that does not mean that we should not try
to improve our own position. One of the odd things about oligopolies
and, indeed, large businesses in general is their lack of enterprise.
The bigger a company becomes, the less 
<?notus-xml column=343?>likely it is to produce intelligent and quick-footed
answers. What worries me is that we also take for granted that bigness
is better. I have seen no evidence whatever that that is true; indeed,
I see a good deal of evidence that it is the opposite. Bigness is
convenient, and that is a wholly different
concept.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:12:38"></hs_TimeCode> I think
that the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill, pointed to that when he
showed how, over the years, people have taken on companies which would
otherwise, in competition, be embarrassing, inconvenient and difficult,
and have forced them to think differently—all the things that
one needs to ensure
happens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:15:18"></hs_TimeCode> in a
market.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13071871000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071871000140">3.15

just want to say to my noble friend that there are many people who come
from an essentially free-market base who do not think that the market
automatically remains free—in other words, we are concerned
about regulation and intervention not because we like regulation or
intervention but because, if we do not have them, we end up with a
market which is not free. The market does not operate because the
people in it have established for themselves a quasi-monopolistic
position, which is what they would like to have. I thought that this
was an opportunity to say to my noble friend that the whole point about
capitalism is that every capitalist wants to be a monopolist. That is
the nature of life. I admit to it in myself and in my attitude towards
my own businesses. I should like to be the only person providing those
services across the board. I am of course the best person providing
them—that goes without saying—but I should like to be the
only person because I think that the price structure might change
rather radically in those
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:16:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

want to make is that we have a very difficult moment here regarding the
relationship between government and industry. We have an industry
where, whatever one says, the amount of competition is limited and,
although I am sure that no cartel-type activities take place, the
nature of a market in which there are six large and powerful members is
that it tends to move in one direction. There is little to ruffle the
positions taken up by those major businesses. I very much hope that the
Minister will be able to convince us that the Government really do have
this right at the forefront of their mind while they are
putting through this legislation. It is not contrary to the concept of
thinking far ahead and of having a structure that encourages investment
in renewables and so on. I think that it is a necessary part of that,
otherwise we will not get the proper restrictions that a lively,
exciting and embarrassing market brings to
enterprise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:17:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Deben, and my noble friend Lord O’Neill both
hit the nail on the head when they emphasised the problems that we are
facing in the market. However, whatever else we do with other
amendments, it is important that we have an amendment such as Amendment
52, which puts a duty on government and regulators to promote
competition and look after the interests of consumers. There is similar
wording in 
<?notus-xml column=344?>legislation relating to water and the railways but
it is the principle on which all other negotiations and discussions are
based. It may be meaningless but it is there. There have been many
occasions when I have used the railway principle against a particular
Government who seemed to do something stupid or something that I did
not like, but it is a very important principle. Whatever we do later as
we go into more detail, it is very important that we have this kind of
policy right at the top to show where the Government and the regulator

amendment and I shall do so extremely briefly, mainly because I have
been moved by the words of my noble friend Lord Deben and the noble
Lord, Lord O’Neill, to say that I heartily agree with them. As I
do not always agree with them on everything, I suspect that that is
terrible news to them, but I think that this little outbreak of what
one might call “free-market anti-capitalism” is a very
good point. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:14:59"></hs_TimeCode>
point of competition is to drive co-operation between producers and
consumers—to cause producers to do things that help consumers
both by innovation and by the lowering of prices. I shall not go on any
further; I just wanted to record that
fact.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_18_PT_1/E6745C3D5999F1CD73A9816F586EDC4C4C0108FE" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 July 2013">Thursday,

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my
noble friend Lord Jenkin and the noble Baroness, Lady
Worthington, for their amendments and for the opportunity to debate
some of the important issues that they have raised. In relation to
Amendment 52, Clause 5 sets out the matters to which the Secretary of
State will have regard when carrying out specific EMR functions to meet
the objectives of EMR. Effective competition is fundamental to
delivering the Government’s energy policy objectives of having
energy security, keeping consumers’ bills affordable and
decarbonising our energy sector. EMR will deliver the greener energy
and reliable supplies that the country needs at the lowest possible 
<?notus-xml column=345?>cost, which is good news for the consumer, by reducing exposure to
volatile and rising fossil fuel prices and securing electricity
supply.</hs_para>

in the electricity market drives down prices and promotes
innovation—hence competition will be considered in the context
of the requirement at Clause 5(2)(d) to consider the likely cost to the
consumer. For example, we are designing the capacity market in a way
that promotes competition —in particular, between incumbents and
the new entrants that my noble friend Lord Jenkin is anxious to see. By
providing a steady revenue stream in place of dependence on volatile
scarcity prices, the capacity market will help to ensure that we can
enable broad participation. Furthermore, we are incentivising new
investment in plants by offering longer-term contracts to new plants,
which will enable the costs of capital to be spread over longer
periods. This will be important in ensuring that new independent
entrants can compete with incumbents, as they would be likely to find
it difficult to access finance with a short-term contract.</hs_para>

important to note that independent generators are a broad mix. They are
not just medium or small-scale firms. Some are large European or
international utilities, such as GDF Suez, which do not currently have
a major presence in the UK wholesale or retail market. To ensure that
we capture the interests of this broad group, we have been working, and
will continue to work, with the independent generators’ group on
the design of the capacity market.</hs_para>

addressing problems affecting competition within the market. This
includes poor liquidity in the wholesale electricity market and tariff
complexity in the retail energy market. We are working with Ofgem to
tackle these now, and have taken back-stop powers in relation to both
areas in this Bill to ensure that reforms can still be driven forward
if Ofgem’s proposals are either frustrated or delayed.</hs_para>

important to help independent generators to secure access to the
market. We are aware of their concerns that it is becoming more
difficult to secure a power purchase agreement and that terms have
declined. We have been working to gain a better understanding of the
complex PPA market and the investment issues for independents. Since
last year’s call for evidence on access to markets, we have
undertaken analysis of the issues and the potential options for
addressing them. I hope to provide further information to the Committee
on this very
shortly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071884000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071884000008">The
ultimate aim of electricity market reform is to allow all forms of
electricity generation to compete fairly, and therefore to enable the
least-cost mix of generation and demand-side measures necessary to meet
our decarbonisation targets, ensure security of electricity supply and
keep costs to consumers as low as possible. I hope that noble Lords
will be reassured that competition is therefore at the heart of the
design of all EMR functions. Consequently, it is the
Government’s view that my noble friend’s amendment to
Clause 5 is
unnecessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071884000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071884000009">Turning
to Amendment 52A, throughout the development of EMR we have been clear
on the objectives of these reforms. They have been set out in our
published documents, from the EMR White Paper 
<?notus-xml column=346?>of July 2011 onwards, and the objectives set out in
Clause 5 reflect these. The amendment would add the duties set out in
Sections 3A to 3D of the Electricity Act 1989 to these objectives in
Clause 5. However, the Electricity Act 1989 relates to the operation
and regulation of the market, which is a different purpose from the new
mechanisms that we are introducing through EMR. Contracts for
difference and the capacity market are designed to complement the
existing market structure and have been developed with the specific

those who have contributed to this very important debate. As I listened
to the noble Lord, 
<?notus-xml column=347?>Lord O’Neill, voicing his warnings about
this, my mind went back to when I instituted the privatisation of
British Telecom in 1982. The chairman of BT was Sir George Jefferson,
who sadly died earlier this year. He was constantly in and out of my
office, very much supporting the privatisation. However, when I had to
say very firmly that BT was not going to be allowed to take a majority
position in any of the new mobile telephone networks that were coming
up, Sir George was extremely angry. He felt that it was a very unfair
restriction on BT. I said to him that he had a virtual monopoly of land
telephony and perhaps he ought to concentrate on that, and that in the
mean time the new mobile telephone industry should develop without BT
having a monopoly position in
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071884000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071884000017">Years
later, when I attended a farewell reception for Sir Christopher Gent,
the retiring chairman of Vodafone, which by then was worth some
£82 billion, somebody asked him, “To what do you
attribute the huge success not only of the mobile telephone network but
of your company in particular?”. He said, “That is very
easy. It was one thing: the decision of the Secretary of State at the
time that BT would not be allowed to compete”. I went up to him
afterwards and said, “I don’t know if you are aware that
it was me who took that decision”. He said, “Oh,
that’s very interesting”. I said, “Where’s
my dividend?”. Of course, no such dividend was
forthcoming.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071884000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071884000018">I

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, in speaking to Amendment 52B,
I shall speak also to the other amendments in this group. They deal
with the distribution network operators, which very little of the rest
of the Bill explicitly does. In a formal sense, the distribution
network operators look very similar to the structure both pre- and
post-privatisation but, in a real sense, they have been through exactly
the process referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and my noble
friend Lord O’Neill. Formally speaking, there are about
13 companies which actually are limited to six, most of
which are part of vertically integrated monoliths. I am not sure
whether in this context competition is operating effectively. It is
also true that DNOs are the part of the structure which has the most
direct link with business consumers and household consumers. They are a
key part of Ofgem’s universe in terms of its price regulation
and have a vital role in delivering what most consumers would regard as
security of supply—that their own lights do not go out. They are
also an important part of making the whole electricity market system
more
efficient<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:37:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=349?><hs_para UID="13071893000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071893000002">However, DNOs largely
are a passive part of the system. They are a conduit for electricity
rather than a lever for policy and innovation, and simply pass
electricity from, say, the national grid to the ultimate user.
Therefore, to a large extent they are a regional monopoly in each case
but not entirely. They have hardly been mentioned in this debate and
are hardly explicitly referred to in the Bill or in our discussions in
Committee. The role of DNOs in the policy objectives, which the reform
is intended to deliver, and the other outputs we have sought to achieve
in this debate, is vital. They will be vital in terms of moving to
smart grids, and in what we have just discussed in relation to
electricity demand reduction and in demand response mechanisms. They
also are vital in relating the whole of the system to an increased use
of decentralised energy, decentralised generation, district heating and
other forms of embedded energy. They therefore need to be seen as a key
aspect of the capacity system and of the delivery of energy to
consumers. Reducing demand and increasing the efficiency of the total
distribution system plays its part in the inefficiency referred to by
the noble Lord, Lord
Teverson<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:39:12"></hs_TimeCode>. Yet
that dimension hardly features
here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:39:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071893000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071893000003">In
a different part of the jungle, things are going on. Ofgem is
conducting a price-related review of the DNO structure. It requires
strategic business plans in the context of RIIO, which a year or so ago
Ofgem was always using as the term for the brave new world. It uses a
slightly different system now but it is part of that approach from
Ofgem. In March this year it issued a strategy document for the
DNOs—which, incidentally, I think I am right in saying implied a
serious move away from the kind of RPI minus X approach, which the
noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, was extolling just now—and
that process has been going on. Only at the beginning of this month, on
1 July, did it issue a consultation paper about the
strategic business plans that were required under that previous
strategy. Incidentally, that strategy extends the period of the review
from five to eight years and is therefore dealing with the
period from 2015 to 2023. In terms of what the Government
and the industry are intending to deliver and the changes that we are
intending to require, that period is absolutely vital. The
consultation was six pages long but it cross-referred to the individual
strategic business plans of each of the companies, some of which
amounted to 400 or 500 pages, if not more. However, the
deadline for the response to that was 2 August—that is, the
paper was issued a fortnight ago and a reply is required by tomorrow
fortnight<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:41:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

dealing with the broader aspects of capacity mechanisms and the whole
of electricity market reform. Presumably Ofgem, after the close of that
consultation, will finalise its view of the DNO structure for a period
of eight years. Although all the DNO companies seem to have produced
strategic plans, it is somewhat difficult to see how they could have
done so for that eight-year period without knowing what was coming out
of the process that we are discussing here today and have discussed
over the past few sessions, and indeed what is going to come in the
statutory instruments and the follow-through after the Bill has passed
into
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:42:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that we should move to an eight-year period when other aspects of
electricity market reform may well have different time periods attached
to them. The only conclusion from that would be that the department and
Ofgem do not expect everything in the Bill, as well as all the
intentions and strategies laid out under the Bill, to have much impact
on the way that the DNO sector operates. That cannot be right and it
cannot be the Government’s intention. In fact, whole new
capacity mechanisms, including those that we have debated in connection
with energy demand reduction, must have an impact on the DNOs’
operation. This document on the market reform delivery plan ought to
have a dimension which is specifically related to the DNOs, but I
cannot see it in there—it is 70-odd pages of big print and I did
try to flick through it last night. However, it must have serious
implications for the
DNOs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:43:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

tried to look at one of these business plans. My own company, Western
Power Distribution, supplies consumers in the south-west and has a good
level of consumer performance, although it has since merged with some
other companies. It has produced a plan totalling 704 pages which sets
out everything about its investment, its expenditure, its price
approach, its customer services—some of it is quite good,
although some of it is a bit unambitious; its carbon saving, for
example, is only 5% over those eight years, which is slightly less than
we are expecting of the system as a whole—its approach to
leakages and other environmental considerations, and its social
obligations, including a worthy reference to fuel poverty. However,
what it does not do is to say anything about its place in the
restructuring of the electricity market as a whole. That I find very
odd. There is nothing, for example, on the demand reduction side; there
is nothing about the effect of smart users at the user end; and there
is nothing about the move to smarter grids at the other end.</hs_para>

quite apart from the process started by this consultation on the

52B places a requirement on the Secretary of State to ensure that the

As I have declared before, I am vice-president of National Energy
Action, which has been working with Ofgem on this because there is the
potential to reduce prices for vulnerable customers in fuel poverty. As

ways of reducing the cost. There is quite a lot of work going on here.
Indeed, NEA has been working with Ofgem on some of these proposals. I
give my strong support to this and I hope that the Minister can
indicate that the Government recognise that this is an important part
of what we are all trying to

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and
the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, for tabling these amendments,
which highlight the important role that the distribution network
operators play in our electricity system, including in supporting
electricity demand reduction. Amendment 52B seeks to ensure that
distribution network operators take account of government policy as set
out in Clause 5. Amendment 55ZZC would insert a requirement in Clause
37 for the Secretary of State to take account of the role of
distribution network operators in a pilot scheme to permanently reduce
electricity
use.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071893000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071893000013">Ofgem
regulates through a licensing system and electricity distribution
network operators need to obtain licences from Ofgem to participate in
the energy market. An important aspect of this system is Ofgem’s
power to set regulatory price controls, and its price control
framework. This, as the noble Lord pointed out, is known as RIIO, and
is well aligned with the Government’s energy policy, including
the requirement for network companies to invest efficiently to ensure
continued safe and reliable services, to innovate to reduce network
costs for current and future consumers, and to play a full role in
delivering a low-carbon economy and wider environmental
objectives.</hs_para>

debated, the Government are providing even greater clarity, as Clauses
119 to 126 will enable the Secretary of State to introduce a new
strategy and policy statement for Ofgem to help improve alignment with
government policies. In addition, my department works closely with DNOs

specific issue of efficiency and reducing demand, DNOs have a licence
condition on them to 
<?notus-xml column=352?>reduce losses, and they have been required to set out in their business
plans how they will reduce losses, and to publish annual reports on
what loss reductions they planned and what they actually achieved. A

future price control reviews, when more reliable data may be available

reiterate the points made in our earlier debate on the electricity

37, as I said earlier, is simply a spending power; it authorises the

noble Lord, Lord Whitty, asked why we cannot deliver eight year-old DNO
plans without details under EMR. We have set out clear policy

certainly true that there have been general indications of the
Government’s direction. No doubt they are taking into account
the DNOs in drawing up their plans. It still strikes me as very odd
that we have here a piece of legislation, the capacity mechanism bit of
which we are discussing now but the detail of which is not yet known,
and it will require considerably more explanation before we finish this
Bill and some serious delegated legislation thereafter. If it applies
to DNOs—as the Minister rightly says in a sense it
will—it must have implications for how DNOs operate. The outcome
of the demand reduction must have implications. The way in which the
capacity mechanism brings other people into play in the grid, and
ultimately down the distribution system, must have implications.
Therefore<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:54:25"></hs_TimeCode>, I
still find it very odd, even if they have read all the

am not necessarily objecting to the eight-year period, but that period
has to relate to something that is operating under the wider
electricity market reform. Instead, we are going to have the approval
of the DNO strategic plans within the next two or three months before
we know how the capacity mechanism is working, before we know how the
demand reduction mechanisms are working and before we know a lot of
other detail that will emerge from this Bill, which will eventually be

am not trying to be awkward with the Government. I just do not think
that they have the pieces in the right order or in the right place.
Before we complete the consideration of this Bill, we need to be a bit
clearer on how the distribution structure will operate in the new

which it will have before it in a couple of weeks. In the mean time, I

Berkeley:</Member></B> My Lords, to some extent, we started discussing
the issue of fair competition in the debate on Amendment 52. I
certainly welcomed the comments from the Minister in her response, but
I think that this issue, which is designed to require the big six
generators—those who own both generating and retailing—to
separate, is probably separate from all the other discussions about
pricing, who gets what, guarantees and everything else. However, unless
we achieve the separation, I do not believe that we will get fair
competition.</hs_para>

reason for saying that is that I believe we will have higher costs, a
lack of transparency, which one can widen out to cover a lot of things,
and added risk for the independents in selling to the retail market. I
am sure we have heard it before but when the big six, according to
Ofgem, are producing something like 72% of the generating capacity and
a percentage in the high-90s of the domestic retail, it is quite a
challenge, as my noble friend Lord O’Neill mentioned
earlier<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:57:45"></hs_TimeCode>. He also
mentioned that there is a similar experience in Germany, with the three
major suppliers inhibiting competition, and the comments that I get
from Germany indicate that there are similar high prices and a lack of
choice.</hs_para>

find it very interesting that on the railways—I declare an
interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group and I am on the board of
the European Rail Freight Association, which is an association of
small, independent operators—we are finding exactly the same
problem. At the moment, the European Commission is trying to drive what
it calls the “fourth railway package” through Parliament
and the Council, and Germany is again opposing any attempt to remove
vertical integration, which Germany has at the moment. It has got to
the stage where the Commission has accused the German Government of
allowing the infrastructure manager to make a profit on its access
charges and transfer the profit up to the holding company and down to
its own train operating company. In effect, independents who want to
run trains on a line are paying an access charge, an element of
which—the profits—may well be going to subsidise their
competitor. The two parties to it in electricity are different, but I
suggest that it is the same problem. It is resulting in a loss of
competition because the smaller operators get swallowed up by the
bigger ones, which happens in France as well, and it is difficult to
know what can be done without insisting upon this total
separation.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13071895000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000178">4

political pressure from the German Government was exemplified earlier
this year when the chairman of Deutsche Bahn went to the Chancellor,
Angela Merkel, and said, “If you don’t sort this out, I
shall resign”. So she phoned the President of the European
Commission, Mr Barroso, and said, “You’d better change
the draft legislation otherwise we will do this, that and the
other”, and he was forced to do this. This is the power of big
industry. It is exactly the same in the electricity industry: the
companies are big and powerful. On top of that, a new entrant coming
in—whether big or small, foreign or British—is going to
have a job selling its power to the retailers, the big six. That is a
big risk, which I believe is going to dissuade new
entrants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000009">How
can independents—large, small, renewables, biomass or
whatever—get in in a fair manner so that they can raise the
finance they need with some better comfort, not just with regard to the
revenue they will receive from selling their electricity but in terms
of the trouble they may have in selling it? I understand that
independent companies cannot always sell their electricity, regardless
of price, to the big six unless the big six cannot produce it
themselves. Total separation is a prerequisite for a fully functioning
market, with all the 
<?notus-xml column=355?>other changes that are proposed, so that the majority of generators
participate on a fair and transparent basis.</hs_para>

mentioned the <I>Which?</I> report, which we got yesterday and which I
thought was really supportive of this amendment. It suggests that the
consumer will not benefit unless there is this separation and a good
volume of trading in the market, and that the level of competition,
which is widely recognised as being too low at the moment, needs to
increase.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000011">Ministers
will say that there is no need to change and that the industry is
happy. Well, it would be, wouldn’t it? The same thing happens in
France and Germany. Ministers and the regulators are advised by the
industry, with people seconded mainly from the big companies because
they have the resources to supply people. However independent these
people may seem to be, their advice will naturally go in a particular
direction, and the small companies cannot provide anybody because they
cannot afford to. What is great on the railway side is that this little
organisation, ERFA, is supporting the Commission and the Commission is
supporting liberalisation, as are the British Government. However, we
still have the big beasts around Europe saying, “We can’t
have any change”. It really is not a way forward.</hs_para>

business is huge, but if the Government really want to protect the
interests of consumers and at the same time encourage new entrants to
come in in a fair and profitable manner, there has to be transparency
in competition, which I believe can come only if there is total
separation. People will complain that it is all very difficult, but it
can be done and I believe that everything would work very well if it
were done. However, I suspect that more things will be needed in the
future to achieve it. The Government could bring forward further
amendments on this. I hope that they will look at this amendment
seriously because I do not think that this big switch will really
happen without such divestment. I beg to

O’</B><B>Neill of Clackmannan:</B></Member> I have some
questions for my noble friend. What he is suggesting has been tried
before. We used to have the separation—I shall not say of
powers—but we did not have vertical integration at the time of
privatisation. That position prevailed for about 10 years. My noble
friend has to show us whether things were better then. Were prices,
independent of exterior energy costs, cheaper than now? Certainly the
degree of obfuscation of tariffs was not as sophisticated as it is now,
but whether that is down to the character of ownership, the nature of
the industrial organisation or just the badness of some of the people
involved in setting the prices is for others to decide.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071895000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000014">The point I am getting
at is that this is not new; we have had it already. I am not sure that
consumers were any better protected then than they are now, or that
prices were that much lower, when we take out the externalities that
determine the price. I am not sure that when we take out the impact of
the price of oil and gas on the energy market there is that much of a
difference.</hs_para>

one of the first things that the Labour Government did in 1997, which
attracted no opposition at all, was to introduce the windfall profits
tax because of the way in which a number of the utilities had been
screwing the country as a whole. The Select Committee that I chaired
thought that we made a sizeable contribution to a better understanding
of the abuse of utility power at the time. Indeed, I always worried
that such was the universal acclaim for the Labour Government’s
windfall profits tax that they had probably got it too low. They
probably could have got far more out, because people knew the degree of
pain and had prepared themselves for
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000016">That
is not the point that I am trying to get at here. If there are abuses
of the kind that my noble friend suggests, would it be better to go
through what might be a lengthy and costly process—I can imagine
the lawyers salivating at the moment over the prospect of what they
would get out of it—or would it not be more appropriate to try
to deal with that market abuse by a radical reform of the regulatory
process? The selective choice of international examples made by my
noble friend is not really relevant, because in the case of France and
Germany, we are dealing in the main with regional monopolies. Their
markets are not like ours. We have an oligopolistic system where there
is fantastic loyalty to the old electricity boards, and people still
talk about them in that way. The reluctance of people to switch has
been one of the great frustrations of the regulator and the advocates
of the market, because people, by and large, like to stay with the
devil they know and choose not to move, for whatever
reason<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:08:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

am not sure that the international comparison is that relevant because
although the companies are vertically integrated, they are operating in
different market structures. While this is an interesting debate to
engage in, I am not certain that it will come up with the answers that
my noble friend is looking for. In the 1990s, when we had something
like this, it did not really work that well and there were an awful lot
of other forms of market abuse. Indeed, that is why we had
market reforms—the previous Labour Government had two bites at
the cherry during their 13 years. I understand where he is coming from
but I am not sure whether he would get where he wants to be by the
mechanism he suggests, short of having a radical, tough regulator
prepared to have a go, unlike the overly cautious regulators that we
have blessed with in the energy markets over the past 20-odd years. The
Opposition have said that they would like to change drastically the
character of regulation in this area, and that might be a more
productive way of going about it.</hs_para>

reference to the example provided by the French electricity industry.
Although the dominant French company Électricité de

is state-owned, excepting a very small proportion that is attributable
to shareholdings which are predominantly in the hands of other
companies closely allied with the French state.</hs_para>

a friend of Électricité de France. A testimony to its
success is the fact that, apart from being one of the aforementioned
big six companies dominating the English market, this company owns
virtually all of Britain’s nuclear generating plant. Over many
years, Électricité de France has worked in close
collaboration with the French Government to realise the latter’s
strategic objectives regarding the provision of the nation’s

Hollande, has there been any significant difference of opinion between
the politicians and the management of EDF regarding the investment

investment strategy is precisely what the Bill is about. The danger we
face is that the industry’s dominant firms will have no interest
in providing the investment in the UK that would serve to avert the
risk of a serious electricity shortfall. Although the free-market
economists might deny this reality, the fact is that these are
multinational companies, often with head offices in other countries.
This implies that their primary interests and loyalties are not with
the UK. When they are seeking profitable investment opportunities, they
are liable to look much further

are some minor players in the UK electricity market that are based
predominantly in this country and have few interests abroad. These are
the independent electricity generators which are concentrated in the
renewables sector. It is perhaps inevitable that the Government should
look to these companies to provide a substantial proportion of the new
investment in renewable generating capacity. Notwithstanding the fact
that they currently account for only a small proportion of the
generating capacity, it is hoped that they will provide something
between 35% and 50% of the new investment in renewable plant.</hs_para>

is that these companies are in trouble. They are being squeezed out by
the big six, which have an increasing proportion of renewable capacity
in their own portfolios and a declining reliance on the independent
generators to fulfil their renewables obligation. The eventual
suspension of the renewables obligation in 2017 will spell the doom of
these companies, unless measures are adopted to safeguard their
position. This is what the present amendment and subsequent amendments
being spoken to today propose. It may well transpire that the measures
proposed in subsequent amendments represent the only viable ways to

Boyne in the north of Ireland. You would not expect to find that people
were talking about the same event. Happily, we have not come to blows
about it but perhaps I may suggest that there were few industries as
incompetent, useless and pathetic as the British electricity industry

have to alter the new structure to make that more likely. If I may say

Oxburgh:</Member></B> My Lords, I will make two quick points. First, I
point out that many Governments would salivate at the thought of having
six roughly equipotent competitors or participants in a regulated
industry in competition with each other. For my information, I am not
clear how you decide when you have enough competition, because six
participants is quite a lot. It is popular to bash the big six,
probably because they do not handle their consumers very well and they
have all been associated with unpopular price rises. However, I would
like to hear this aspect explored a little more.</hs_para>

second point is quite separate, which is to draw attention to the
second subsection of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley.
Regardless of whether the amendment is accepted by the Government, it
is very important that the Government take note of that second
subsection. It covers a lot of small businesses—I declare an
interest as a director of 2OC, which does this—that use
renewable energy on a particular site and deliver it to a particular
business or a very small range of customers locally. They generally
combine generation and transmission to one or a limited number of
customers. The Government should make sure that that is protected in
the Bill, whatever the final
outcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:23:41"></hs_TimeCode>.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:24:36"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000038"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Hanworth" PimsId="832" UID="13071895000194" xid="2155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000194">Viscount
Hanworth:</Member></B> Perhaps I may make a few more comments, some of
them addressed to things that have just been said. A great deal of
negative propaganda accompanied the privatisation of the electricity
industry in the UK, but many studies indicate that the industry was far
more efficient than another national industry with which we should
compare it, the American industry. There is no question about that. Yet
many people tendentiously denied these
realities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:25:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

nuclear industry, it will be in the hands of a state-owned foreign
monopoly. That is a reality that sits very ill beside the fantasy of
perfect competition. If we are to have a competitive environment or,
indeed, any competition in this environment, perhaps the competition
should come from a British state-owned nuclear industry. We have to
think somewhat outside the box and not revert to the paradigms of
perfect competition versus state industry, which seems still to
dominate people’s thinking in this respect. The only
countervailing force that I can imagine that could really survive in
the British electricity industry to induce competition is if a fraction
of it lay in the hands of the
state<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:26:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000040"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Worthington" PimsId="5934" UID="13071895000195" xid="2144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000195">Baroness
Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord Deben,
when I read this I thought that it was a very elegantly phrased and
simple set of provisions that are very easy to understand and could go
a long way to sorting things out. Having thought about it a bit more, I
am still quite attracted to it, but that is not to say that it is
necessarily the only way in which the problem could be
solved—or, indeed, the right way. What we really want is an
acknowledgement from the Government that, rather than thinking about
the past— 
<?notus-xml column=361?>sadly I do not have the benefit of those many years of
pre-privatisation—we should really be thinking about the future
and acknowledging that the Bill signifies a massive change of
direction. As a result of that, it is appropriate that we think again
about our competitiveness regime. It will come as no surprise that,
from our side, we believe that we need a new regulator to do
that—one with real teeth and independence, and one which is not
scared to hear from the incumbent, saying, “You don’t
like that? We’ll change it for you”. That is the modus
operandi of Ofgem, I am sad to
say<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:27:29"></hs_TimeCode>. There are

answer to the question from the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, about how
much competition is competition, six companies might be appropriate if
it were not for the fact that the vertical integration of generation
and supply gives them an enormous advantage in this market. That is
what needs to be looked at—and that is why the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley, can be congratulated on his precise and laser-like vision in
getting to the nub of it. It is possible to force the integrated
companies to operate in a less integrated way, but it is what they do
with the DNOs, as my noble friend pointed out. Many of the big six are
owners of DNOs. But there are regulations and laws that mean that they
have to have a very firm Chinese wall between those parts of their
industry, which is precisely because they are natural monopolies and
will gain enormous advantage by knowing what is going on in the other
parts of the business. So there is a precedent for keeping the
corporate structure the same but having clear delineations between the
different parts of the
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:28:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000042">Why
is this more important in future? One reason that has been oft-cited
for allowing vertical integration to continue is that it keeps the cost
of capital low. If you are a vertically integrated company and you have
a supply base of millions of customers, you can borrow against it very
easily and get nice low-cost capital. That was true until this Bill,
which completely removes the risk of new generation and potentially
gives companies a many decades-long contract against which they can
borrow. So the old arguments for vertical integration are falling away,
and we should now be reconsidering the logic of allowing it to
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:29:32"></hs_TimeCode>. There
are many examples where vertical integration can act against the
interests of consumers and of more plurality, competition and lower
costs in the market. I shall choose just two.</hs_para>

Lords will have heard me speak of my concern about the existing
coal-fired generation on the system. The coal stations that still exist
are equally distributed among the big six, and there are a couple of
independents. We hope that some form of carbon pricing will force them
off the system. It is clear that if the big six—it is the big
five in this case because Centrica is immune—opt in to one of
those coal-fired stations, internalise the carbon price and pass it on,
they will not be disadvantaged relative to their competitors, so they
can simply ride rough-shod over that pricing signal and keep those
assets open. They will do that because those assets have made them a
lot of money and will make them a lot of money. They were built in the
1960s and are simply cash cows now. There is a failure of competition 
<?notus-xml column=362?>in the generation market. Such is the vested interest in those existing
assets and in sweating them for as long as possible that generators are
now acting in an almost monopolistic way and will keep those assets as
long as they can and squeeze out as much as they can any competition
that would force them off the
grid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000044">My
other example is perhaps more relevant to the discussions that we will
go on to on the capacity market. We are introducing a massive
intervention into this market. The normal rules of competition are
being swept aside in the interests of keeping the lights on. I am not
saying that that is wrong, and we will discuss it in detail. Let me
give the Committee an example of how this could change the way the
electricity industry operates. Owners of capacity will receive a
payment from supplier. In many cases, that will be the same person. How
much you pay will be determined by the proportion of consumer demand
that you represent as a supplier at the point of the highest peak. At
the point where the system is under stress, you split it according to
the percentage of consumers that you represent, and you have to pay for
that amount.</hs_para>

you did not have vertical integration, so that supply companies were
just supply companies, there would be a natural incentive to smooth out
that peak to bring down your percentage of demand during those periods.
That would be a fantastic solution and would help to solve the much
pondered-over problem of how you get supply companies to see a
financial incentive for reducing demand. It will not happen because we
have vertical integration. That price signal, that incentive, that
almost brilliant natural market for demand reduction will be
counterweighted by the fact that supply companies own the generating
capacity too, so why is it in their interest to reduce the capacity
when they are getting capacity payments on the other side? That is an
illustration of how this Bill fundamentally changes the market
conditions in ways that I do not think the Government have thought
through. I do not think the industry has probably thought them through;
in fact, it cannot because it does not have the
details.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000046">I am
not exaggerating. This is a huge shift in the way the electricity
market works. If we do not do anything, we will lose out on some
potential excellent gains in efficiency for the consumer. We must
address competitiveness in this market. The time has come to split the
vertical integrators, to create a wall between generation and supply
and to bring in a new regulator to deliver that. I am very supportive
of this amendment. I do not know whether it is the only way, but I am
looking forward to the Minister’s

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley, for his amendment. Amendment 53 is aimed at the abolition of
the vertically integrated business model in the energy industry. I have
listened carefully to noble Lords and I have some comments to make
after I have gone through my speaking notes, which I hope will address
some of the issues the noble Lord has raised. I reassure him that the
coalition is committed to driving competition and choice in the energy
market.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071895000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000048">In
considering the merits of this amendment, we must be guided by what
will most benefit consumers, deliver competition, affordable energy and
better customer 
<?notus-xml column=363?>service, and secure the investment we need for the future. We must
acknowledge that the vertically integrated business model delivers a
range of benefits for consumers through lower capital costs, efficient
risk management and economies of scale. Simple prohibition of certain
business models could lead to higher prices for consumers and trigger
lower investment in the market.</hs_para>

that consumers will get the best deals when suppliers face much tougher
competition. Wider competition and more diversity are key to a
competitive market and securing investment. We must ensure that the
market is open to all business models to provide them with the ability
to compete on a fair basis. That is what the Government and the
regulator are working to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:35:09"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
why we have made concessions on the threshold for the small-scale
feed-in tariffs and the route to market for independent renewables
generators. These will help to open the market to community energy
projects and smaller independent renewables developers.</hs_para>

wholesale market remains a key barrier to entry for independent players
and Ofgem has recently announced a package of reforms to address the
low levels of liquidity in the wholesale electricity markets. This is a
positive step forward and the Government welcome Ofgem’s
announcement. We want to see swift and effective implementation of its
reform package<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:35:53"></hs_TimeCode>.

Government are also looking at other barriers, including independent
generators’ ability to secure bankable long-term contracts that
will allow them to finance their projects. The Government are taking
back-stop powers in Clause 44 to enable them to act quickly to address
this issue if necessary. I know that this will be of particular
interest to the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:36:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000052">Finally,
Clauses 127 to 131 will give statutory backing to Ofgem’s retail
market review proposals. This will ensure that energy companies place
consumers on the cheapest tariff that meets their preferences, thus
simplifying the market and enabling consumers to shop around for the
best deals. Bringing greater transparency to the retail market will
also make it easier for innovative small suppliers to compete with
larger established players in the
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:37:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, to ensure that consumers get the best
deal in a fair, affordable and competitive energy market. However,
requiring the energy companies to divest and reorganise is not the most
effective way of delivering the outcomes that I know we both desire. It
is likely to create unnecessary disruption at a time when we need
significant investment in our energy infrastructure, and we are making
real progress in introducing greater competition in the energy
markets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:37:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000054">I
query also whether this would improve liquidity in wholesale markets,
at least to the degree suggested. Poor liquidity relates to a lack of
availability of products or buyers for products, and poor transparency
of prices. Removing vertical integration will not necessarily address
these issues fully, whereas Ofgem’s reforms to 
<?notus-xml column=364?>the wholesale electricity market are focused on making more power
available to buyers while ensuring that generators can sell their
electricity, and on increasing price transparency. We therefore believe
that reforms by government and Ofgem offer the quickest, most effective
and most reliable way to increase competition and boost consumer
confidence in the energy
markets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:38:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000055">We
have a real opportunity through the reforms we are making in the Bill

harsher penalties if generators and suppliers do not provide the choice

I may pick up on a couple of the points that the noble Lord, Lord
O’Neill, made about the flaws in the amendment of the noble
Lord, Lord Berkeley. I refer back to what the noble Lord and the noble
Baroness, Lady Worthington, said about Ofgem. When he was Energy
Secretary, Ed Miliband said that Ofgem was a regulator fit for purpose.
Through supporting Ofgem and strengthening its powers, we are trying to
deal with the fears that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Worthington, have. It is not about creating another new
body but about ensuring that the body we have has the powers to be able
to deliver what a regulator is supposed to be delivering; that is, to
be quite tough on energy suppliers. We have seen examples of that.
Between April 2011 and March 2012, Ofgem set fines of more than
£19 million for licence breaches and anti-competitive behaviour.
It imposed fines of more than £500,000 and £4.5 million
in redress.</hs_para>

but about ensuring that we empower a body. It would be really
interesting to know what sort of body the noble Baroness, Lady
Worthington, would put into place and what it would do that Ofgem is
not doing. It is not clear to me that banning vertical integration
would in fact improve liquidity in the wholesale markets, at least not
to the degree suggested. A lack of available products and poor
transparency is what needs to be addressed and on that basis, I hope
that the noble Lord will see that what the Government are doing in the
Bill is right, and withdraw his
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:41:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Worthington:</Member></B> In response to the Minister’s direct
question, we would have a regulator which, when it is asked,
“Why can’t you split vertical integration?”
answers, “That is a good idea and we will look at it in more
detail”, instead of “Because the industry doesn’t
like it”. Quite frankly, as I said earlier, when it did a review
into liquidity and competition in the market, eight recommendations
were made but I think six of them were dropped and the two that were
moved forward were watered down. As soon as Ofgem goes and consults its
friends in the industry, it gets told, “That’s too
difficult—we couldn’t do that”, so things get
watered down. That is what we have to break.</hs_para>

Baroness quoted the suggestions that Ofgem has come up with for solving
this problem. The market-maker proposals are frankly ludicrous. They
are so complex and so against a normal, natural market that I really

I can believe it since it

Berkeley:</Member></B> I am very grateful to all noble Lords who have
spoken in this debate. We have had a very wide-ranging debate with a
wide range of opinion. It is really good that we have been able to air
it. We have not all agreed but at least we have discussed it. I will
not respond to every noble Lord who has spoken—to whom, many
thanks—but the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, asked particularly how
one decides whether six generators are sufficient for competition.
There is no number bigger than three where it matters very much, in my
experience. The key is that they are all able to act fairly, simply and
transparently.</hs_para>

moment, and whether they are in a cartel is not for discussion tonight.
That is something for the regulators and the Competition Commission, if
there is a complaint. However, what motivated me to put down this
amendment is the problem of having a complaint from some of the other
generators, which do not have retail outlets, that the system is not
fair. They have to be convinced that it is fair because otherwise they
will not invest. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating, but
will the lights have gone out before we see the answer? On competition
generally, my belief is that it is much better to have a simple
structure than devising all kinds of rules and regulations to make sure
that a mixed structure will work.</hs_para>

Worthington suggested Chinese walls as an alternative to complete
separation. Chinese walls work if they are properly policed, so that
may be another answer which we should discuss later on. To me, the key
is to have a strong and effective regulator that is not captured by the
industry. I am not saying that the present one is captured, but the key
will be whether we end up with a system where all the independent and
other new generators that do not have retail outlets feel so
comfortable that they will continue to invest. I hope that they will
also multiply rather than what happens on the other side, when they all
get bought up by one or two big ones and there is no actual
competition. I shall read the Minister’s response with great
interest.</hs_para>

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> I just want to make the point to
my noble friend that, of the six companies that currently exist as
vertically integrated companies, two of them started off as vertically
integrated companies because of the difference between the
jurisdictions in Scotland and England and the desire of the Secretary
of State for Scotland to have vertical integration. Therefore, we have
always had that vertical integration for two of the companies. The
interesting thing is that one of the two is still British-owned,
whereas all the other companies are now in the hands of foreign owners.
Scottish and Southern Energy is located in Perth; it may have major
shareholders across the world but it is still a Scottish company, or a
UK company based in Scotland, which is something that we tend to lose

Berkeley:</Member></B> I am grateful to my noble friend. He is
absolutely right. It is good to have Scottish companies. It is also
good to have companies that all pay their tax, wherever they are based,
although that is probably a slightly separate subject. My concern is
whether the companies, whether they are Scottish, English, British or
whatever, are behaving fairly with the generators that do not have
access to the retail market. As I said, it would be perfectly possible
to have a Chinese wall rather than total separation if that could be
worked. I am not sure what the disadvantage of that is but it is only
one small cog in the whole jigsaw puzzle—I am mixing the
metaphors nicely—of making fair competition that works and which
is for the good of the consumer. I beg leave to withdraw the

Davies of Stamford:</Member></B> My Lords, I will deal briefly with the
first of my amendments, which would replace “may” with
“must”. I think that there is far too much use of the
word “may” in this Bill. If Parliament thinks that
something is important, it should, in my view, be decisive about it. If
we decide that we ought to give an instruction to Ministers, we should
give them a clear instruction and not just a vague exhortation, such as
is encapsulated in a subjunctive word such as “may”. In
fact, as I said earlier in a different context, it is very important
that the law generally should be precise and unambiguously
comprehensible. If you give someone an instruction which is not an
instruction, you are not producing good law. That is the simple reason
why I want to change “may” to “must”, and
it is a theme that applies to many other instances in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:48:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

substantive second amendment. By way of introduction, when I read the
Bill I was quite surprised to see in Clause 21 the capacity market
dealt with jointly with the issue of demand reduction. Of course, the
whole Bill is really about demand reduction—how you can get the
price 
<?notus-xml column=367?>mechanism generated by concepts such as the decarbonisation principle
and contracts for difference and so forth to force people to be more
efficient in their use of energy and to bring down our carbon
emissions. That is the whole purpose of the Bill.</hs_para>

capacity market is rather specialised; it concerns how we provide
ourselves with a margin of safety over periods of peak demand so that
there is not a serious danger of the lights going out. I thought that
that would require and deserve separate treatment in a specialised
section of this Bill. There is an aspect, of course, of demand
reduction that is intimately related to the capacity market. It is
intimately related in an inverse sense, in the sense that when you have
more of one, you have less of another. That is the
issue of demand reduction in the sense of modulation of
demand—or what I prefer to call intelligent management of demand
so as to reduce the aggregate volatility of demand for energy,
particularly for electricity, in the economy—to reduce the
peaks, and reduce the peaks that perhaps raise the troughs; to reduce
volatility. There are many ways in which modern technology enables one
to do that, which was extremely well described by the noble Lord, Lord
Cameron, as regards dealing with smart meters and so forth. I do not
need to go back over
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:50:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000070">The
Minister has already referred to this approach several times and the
Government in principle are entirely signed up, which is why it is in
the Bill. There is a certain logic in dealing with the capacity market
and demand reduction as reciprocals in the same part of the Bill.
However, it would be a great mistake if we held up progress on
intelligent demand management and demand reduction until we have a
capacity market up and running. I should have thought that we should do
things the other way around. It will be very difficult to know how much
additional capacity we will need—that is, what we need by way of
a capacity market and a definition of what the task of a capacity
market is—unless we know the potential for demand reduction and
specifically for the reduction in the volatility of electricity demand
in the economy. Until we have experimented with some of these new
systems, and have seen whether people and the market respond to these
intelligent meters and so forth, we will not really know how much we
need in terms of additional capacity as a safety margin in the
electricity

is clear that the general principle is universally acknowledged. My
amendment would make sure that we do not neglect smaller businesses and
households in all this. From what I can gather, all the discussion up

is extraordinarily important that we do not ignore, on grounds of
fairness and economic rationality, smaller businesses or private
individuals and families. If the Minister says that the Government are
not ignoring them at all and that they are absolutely in the front line
of their concerns, the substance of my amendment very largely would be
achieved. That is why I am very explicitly putting forward
this matter

deliberately mentioned that there are two principles behind my
amendment. One is fairness and the other is economic efficiency. The
fairness point is that unless small businesses are encouraged to have
equal access 
<?notus-xml column=368?>to these new smart meters and other means of monitoring price in the
market so as to make sure that they can modulate their consumption of
electricity to maximum advantage from their point of view, there will
be a terrible distortion between the smaller people and the larger
people. It will be much more difficult for small businesses, which have

may be required in order to make sure that they get an equal crack of
the whip. That is the way in which I want the Government to think about
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:53:31"></hs_TimeCode>. Certainly,
small businesses should be equally sensitive, or perhaps more
sensitive, to the price of energy than big businesses. They need this

fairness point in terms of households. I thought that most of us in
this country were concerned—although I am not quite sure about
this increasingly Thatcherite Government, with the invention of the
bedroom tax and so on—about the potential impact of the very
necessary decarbonisation targets and increase in energy prices on
poorer households in this country. In so far as that is the case, we
should want to make absolutely certain that these new technologies of
the smart meters and so forth are available to all families and
households, but particularly to poorer families. Poorer families will
have what I think would be known technically as a very high price
elasticity of demand for energy. That is to say, their demand will vary
quite a lot depending on the price.</hs_para>

graphic, the demand curve will be sloping—everybody requires
some electricity for cooking, heating or what have you—but not
too steeply. At the other end of the spectrum, I do not suppose that
bankers, lawyers, Premier League footballers, movie stars, Russian
oligarchs or Arab sheikhs are at all sensitive to price in their
consumption of electricity. Their demand curve is almost certainly
vertical or as close to vertical as makes no difference. Between those
two extremes, there is a vast number of people with different demand
curves. Overall, there will be very substantial opportunities for
people to save on energy if they are given the opportunity to do so and
if it is clear to them where the price advantage of doing so
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000075">On the
grounds of both fairness and efficiency, in maximising this process of
intelligent demand and consumption of electricity in the future, we
need to ensure that households and small businesses are kept to the
fore of the attentions of the Government, the regulator, the big
beasts—the big six generators—and all the other players
in this market. Without some very specific regulations, I suspect that
things will not work out that way. That is the purpose of my amendment
and I hope that the Government will be able to assure me that my
amendment is unnecessary because they have already embarked on that
very necessary course. I beg to

Earl of Caithness:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble
Lord, Lord Davies of Stamford, on producing an amendment that is
probably the most regular identical amendment to come before your
Lordships’ House. It is not an amendment that he would have
found in the other place but “may” to
“must” was something that I defended hugely for 10 years
against attacks from the Opposition. As soon as the Opposition got into
government and I put down a “may” to “must”
amendment, they defended it with exactly the same arguments that I had
used. I expect my noble friend the Minister to repeat those arguments
of 30 years ago, and we will listen, as we have always listened, and
come to the conclusion that “may” is still the right
answer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000081">I hope
that my noble friend will dismiss the second amendment. The principle
is absolutely right but it is completely otiose. It is already
well covered in the Bill. In fact, Clause 21(3) covers the
point fairly adequately. It was pointed out to us in
Sub-Committee D when we prepared our report on energy that
the best way to reduce energy demand is energy efficiency.
It is not just for households and small businesses, it
is for all businesses. To identify small businesses in the Bill
would be quite wrong and give a totally wrong

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I briefly signal the support of our
Front Bench for the amendments. Although I am familiar with—and
may even have been one of the Ministers who rebutted the noble Earl,
Lord Caithness, in—long arguments about “may” and
“must”, it is slightly different here because it is not
so much about parliamentary counsel’s sensibilities on these
matters. “Must” is here a statement of fact. The clauses
on the capacity mechanism are wide and vague—understandably, at
this stage. The Minister and everyone else have 
<?notus-xml column=370?>accepted that we will have to translate them into secondary legislation.
If we do not do so, we will not have a capacity mechanism. In that
sense, there is a stronger argument than there is sometimes for
substituting “may” with “must”, because
otherwise the whole point of this section of the Bill
disappears<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:01:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000083">On
the second point, although the noble Earl is correct to say that there
have been repeated references to the interests of households and small
businesses, that is in the context of the demand reduction provisions
within the capacity mechanism. It is not obvious from first principles
that mechanisms will be involved which benefit the small users of
energy, whether they are households or small businesses. I therefore
think that it helps to insert that at this point. It will help to guide
the drafting of statutory instruments, when we come to that. I hope
that the Government will show some sympathy to the
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:01:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord
Davies of Stamford, for his amendments. Like my noble friend Lady
Maddock, I say from the start that we are putting consumers and
fairness to new entrants at the heart of the Bill. It is important to
note that the Government confirmed on 27 June our intention to initiate
the capacity market, with the first auction taking place in 2014 for
delivery from 2018, which would provide an insurance policy against any
future blackouts. I reassure the noble Lord that it is the
Government’s clear intention to implement the capacity market
through regulations as laid out in this chapter. That can be delivered
without a statutory requirement in the Bill, so the may/must argument
does not need to be fought at the
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:02:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000085">On
Amendment 53ZZB, although the noble Lord’s intention behind the
amendment is laudable, we believe that the Bill already makes
sufficient provision for driving energy efficiency. The Bill lays out
how the capacity market is intended to involve permanent electricity
demand reduction in Clauses 29 and 37. The inclusion of electricity
demand reduction in the capacity market is of course complex and, as
such, its impact needs further examination and assessment. Because of
that, we intend that an electricity demand reduction pilot will be
carried out to assess the viability of
incentivising demand reduction in the capacity market.</hs_para>

the Government are already doing a large amount of work to encourage
increased electricity efficiency of homes and small
businesses—for example, through the Green Deal energy company
obligation and smart meters. I urge the noble Lord to consider those
measures available to low-income and vulnerable families. I also remind
him of how the number of tariffs rose under his Government. When they
were in power, it rose to 4,000 tariffs. Fuel poverty nearly
doubled during the last five years when they were in power. We are
addressing a long-term, deeply embedded problem. Passing the
amendment without the result of the pilot being known would risk
duplicating existing policies for the promotion of energy
efficiency and could lead to contradictory or inefficient
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000087">Although

“may” versus “must”, nothing has been said
to persuade me that I was wrong. On the contrary, everybody who has
spoken has persuaded me that I am right to make a point about this. If
a nonsense is systemic, that is no reason for not combating it and
trying to get it right. I shall now feel even more emboldened when the
word “may” comes up. I shall feel very sceptical about
it; I shall look at it and may very well—not just in this Bill,
but in others—put forward amendments of the kind I have today. I

free society permissive legislation is otiose. Anything in a free
society which is not specifically prohibited is allowed. Therefore,
there is no purpose in passing a Bill with a clause saying somebody
“may” do something. The issue is whether they must or

to the more substantive issue, I reiterate that I was in no way
suggesting that people had not been talking about the requirements of
small businesses or of families and households. I am well aware that
the Government have addressed, as the previous Government did, the
issue of fuel poverty. We are all conscious of the importance of that,
given that energy prices are bound to rise in real terms as a result of
our very necessary policies. However, it is extremely important to draw
the attention of everyone in this debate to the need to make sure that
these new smart methods of monitoring the price of energy through the
day, from minute to minute, are available not just to big sophisticated
companies and energy users, but to households and small businesses.
Only in that way will we get the full benefit of these new
technologies, reduce energy demand in the way we need to do, and
address the fairness problem and the lack of a distinction between
smaller and larger businesses which are substantial consumers of
energy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000093">On the
relationship between the capacity market and demand reduction, all I
say to the Government is that they had better get on with it. They have
got the timing the wrong way around: I repeat, they cannot know what
additional capacity they need to meet peak demand, plus a safety
margin, until they know how successful the demand reduction efforts are
likely to be. The two things are related all the way along: they are
reciprocals, as I have said from the beginning. 
<?notus-xml column=372?>They need to get started with these energy demand methods and pilots

message to the Government.</hs_para>

Teverson:</Member></hs_speaker> I completely agree with the noble Lord
over this. However, one thing which happened quite recently was that
the National Grid set out to really get moving in this area of demand
management in relation to major companies. Smaller ones have, if you
like, to be aggregated. That process has started to some degree. The
sad thing about it was that the press reported it as being a necessary
response to what they saw as a symptom of the crisis in energy supply,
rather than as a positive move to get the mental side of supply in line
with demand reduction at certain times. That was combined with a number
of other government moves at that time. It is not quite as black as
that, but the noble Lord is absolutely right to press for even
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000095"><hs_speaker><Member ContinuationText="Lord Davies of Stamford" PimsId="5785" UID="13071895000215" xid="2057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000215">Lord

by a considerable amount of research commissioned by the City of London
Corporation on future power supplies for the capital. Some pretty
high-level discussions have also taken place in an electricity
regulation working party, which includes Westminster City Council,
London First, the Greater London Authority, the Mayor of
London’s working group, the City Property Association and
Westminster Property Association—it is an impressive array of
sources. The message that they have all delivered is that long-term
strategic planning needs to be enhanced to ensure new electricity
connections to key development sites in central London, and that this
must be available as projects are
completed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000101">To
give that assertion a little context, some office developments in the
City have extremely large electricity requirements, which can take the
electricity network operator for London, UK Power Networks, up to three
years to plan and build. The problem that my amendment is intended to
address is that the City of London Corporation has been advised in
discussions with Ofgem that the regulatory framework actually prevents
strategic investment ahead of need; in other words, when it comes to
electricity supply, it is very much a question of providing for what is
currently required as opposed to what is going to be
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000102">It
would be quite wrong for me to give the Committee the impression that I
think that the need for forward planning is somehow not accepted by the
Government; of course it is. There has been a very productive exchange
of correspondence, of which I have seen all the copies, between the
City’s policy chairman, Mark Boleat, and my noble friend Lord
Deighton, Commercial Secretary to the Treasury. The City has a way of
going to the top. I entirely accept that we must avoid a situation in
which supply need is assessed by reference to purely speculative
projects which do not come to fruition. But to have a situation in
which forward planning is so legislatively constrained seems to lean
too far in the opposite
direction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0001.htm#13071895000103">My
Amendment 53ZA proposes that electricity capacity regulations under
Clause 21 should include provision that takes account of projected as

period, which is based on technical advice. It is a halfway point in
the 20-year horizon that is generally adopted by the Mayor of
London’s London Plan, which deals with planning and development
as well as other high-level strategic matters, but it is certainly a
timeframe that should enable the necessary electricity distribution

and industrial needs of London, but there are also the housing needs.
It is estimated that we could build 2 million homes in
London with the aim of dealing with our housing shortage. There is no
doubt that the sustainable way of development is to use land that has
already been used, that we really should try not to build on greenfield
sites and that we should do our best to ensure that our cities are
increasingly the centres that they ought to be of people living
together and of great enterprise. It is very difficult to say whether
cities or civilisation came first, but there is no doubt that the two

would not like the Minister to be concerned not merely with the
commercial activities, although they are very important, but with what
most of us think ought to be the way in which we develop housing in
future, rather than across green fields. That means that we have to
make it possible to develop on once-used land. One problem that is
always brought to me when this comes up is the availability of
utilities in general and, of course, electricity in

when we decarbonise our electricity system, the availability of
electricity becomes even more important, as someone said earlier,
because that is what we are trying to shift to. Unless we can put in
place what is needed in advance, we will not be able to carry through
the whole purpose of decarbonisation. When one looks at the present
circumstances, we really are an 11th hour nation. We really do things
at the very last moment. I have every sympathy with those who object to
the present circumstances, in which nobody does anything until the
situation is so disastrous that something has to be done or the whole
thing will collapse. That is not a way to plan anywhere. Although no
doubt my noble friend will tell me that it will all be dealt
with—and here I declare an interest in that the consultancy I
chair gives advice on sustainable development—my experience is
that is not always like that. It is not always easy to have ready
access to electricity supplies, in particular.</hs_para>

taken in a wider sense—this is not just about London, there are
other great cities where similar circumstances exist. We do not want
people to build, develop and grow in places which are much less
suitable simply because the electricity supply is not immediately

amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, on the future capacity
question, because it is the first to address that. This may be a good
opportunity for the Minister to provide us with some detail about the
capacity mechanism and how it will operate, and to address the
important issue raised by the noble Lord of the need to have a
long-term
view.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000112">Perhaps
this is the time to say that this part of the Bill seems to be lacking
an awful lot of detail. We have tabled some amendments later which
respond to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee’s comments, which were quite damning on this aspect of
the Bill. It is lacking a huge amount of detail; a lot of questions
still need to be answered.</hs_para>

will not ask all of them here, but this discussion may be an
opportunity for the noble Baroness to talk about how long the review of
the capacity market is. The implementation plan is pretty useless when
it comes to providing detail on this part, but if anyone is interested,
I have discovered that it is all in the June document, <I>Electricity
Market Reform: Capacity Market—Design and Implementation
Update</I>. If noble Lords want even more detail, I suggest that they
read the memorandum submitted to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee, because that has even more detail. Why that is not in
the implementation plan I do not know, but we are where we are, we have
to gather all this information and try to make the best of
it.</hs_para>

would be helpful if the Minister described the length of time for which
the Government consider that the capacity market needs to operate and
precisely how it will enable new investment. One of the key challenges
is that the capacity market means everything to everyone. If you are an
owner of an existing power station, you see it as your opportunity to
keep that station open. If you own a mothballed gas plant, it will be
the opportunity to get that back on the system. If you want to build
new CCGTs, it is your opportunity to get those built. If you are a
demand-side response producer, it is your opportunity to get that done.
It is not clear how this broad set of measures will manage that
conflict between existing owners, owners of mothballed plant, new
owners and demand reducers. We as a Committee, representing the wider
two Houses, deserve more information. I look forward to the
Minister’s

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Jenkin for
his amendment. Amendment 53ZA proposes that providing capacity should
take account of projected growth over a 10-year period. I understand
that he has proposed it because of concerns about the 
<?notus-xml column=376?>long-term capacity of electricity networks and the ability of
distributive network operators to make strategic, long-term investment
decisions. I should make it clear from the outset that the capacity
market is not intended to drive investment in network capacity. Rather,
it is designed to ensure that there is sufficient longer-term
investment in electricity capacity, including generation and other
forms of capacity, such as demand-side
response<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:24:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000116">In
March, Ofgem published its strategy decision for electricity
distribution network price control. That explained that price control
had been designed to encourage distribution network operators to
provide a high level of service for connections while maintaining a
reliable network and delivering value for money for existing and future
customers. The decision also explained that flexibility has been
provided for DNOs to submit a case for strategic investment in their
business plans on a project-by-project basis. Similarly, the
Electricity Act 1989 already provides some flexibility for early
investment—for example, the distribution network operator and
its customer can make an agreement that allows an upfront user
commitment agreement between the DNO and a customer who wants strategic
investment. I understand that, in the case of UK Power Networks and its
customers in the City of London, this is already
happening.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000117">It
is vital that investment in our networks continues at a pace that
supports our future energy needs. None the less, we must be mindful
that there will be a balance to be struck to ensure that consumers do
not pick up the costs of unused or underused assets. For this reason,
it is right that Ofgem and the network companies continue to consider
carefully where investment ahead of need is proposed.</hs_para>

noble friend also makes an important point about ensuring that
decisions on capacity of electricity supply are made with due regard to
the long-term outlook. As such, for the capacity market, the Government
have committed to publishing a delivery plan every five years and
producing annual updates to that plan. These plans will include
long-term forecasts of electricity demand and supply, and will inform
the amount of capacity contracted through the capacity
market.</hs_para>

hope that my noble friend finds my explanation reassuring. Before I ask
him to withdraw his amendment, I shall respond to the noble Baroness,
Lady Worthington, on her questions about how the capacity market works
and how it is envisaged. A forecast of future peak demand will be made
for four and a half years ahead of the delivery year in which it must
be available. The amount of capacity needed to ensure security of
electricity supply will be acquired through a competitive central
auction four years ahead of the delivery year. Generation and
non-generation approaches such as demand-side response will be able to
participate in the capacity auction. All generation plant, including
existing plant, will be eligible to participate in this auction with
some exceptions such as low-carbon plant receiving
CFDs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:27:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

successful in the auction will enter into capacity agreements
committing to providing electricity when given notice in the delivery
year in return for steady capacity payments or will face financial
penalties. The costs of the capacity payments will be

year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:27:36"></hs_TimeCode>. That is a
brief outlook of how it will work but I hope that the noble Baroness is
reassured that there is plenty of detail. She also referred to the
Delegated Powers Committee. As she is aware, we have submitted extra
information to the committee and it is now looking at that. We will
then look at its recommendations but until that point it would not be

additional costs on consumers unnecessarily. I hope the discussions

provisions in the Bill. We spoke earlier today about how this element
of the Bill has been quite a late afterthought from the Government.
Indeed, it was all initiated by the Government’s response to the
consultation this May regarding some of the demand-side initiatives.
Amendments have been introduced only on Report in the other House. From
this, it is easy to deduce that DECC is developing its thinking on
these matters and has perhaps been too dogmatic in trying to insist
that the department’s design of the capacity market should be
maintained. As evidence of this, I 
<?notus-xml column=378?>contend that new documents are arriving with ever increasing ferocity on
our desks, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, surmised. We on this
Committee are endeavouring to keep up with the DECC officials who are
trying to keep up with the thinking, and it is a fair challenge. We
have put down these probing amendments just to try to understand
whether DECC has more to contemplate during its enjoyment of the

capacity services to the market and gives powers to the Secretary of

from the Government that demand reduction is not simply an afterthought

large-scale plant but is prioritised in any capacity auction. There is
also the question of determining what capacity is required once demand

Minister is indeed correct to identify the role and experience of the
demand-side response in the United States. The US experience is
important, as the inclusion of DSR in a capacity market for PJM, a
major US utility company, is credited with saving consumers $11.8
billon in a single delivery year; that is, approximately $200 per

transitional arrangements the Government have brought forward are
intended to allow the system operator and market participants to gain
experience of how DSR will operate in a capacity market and allow for
improvement in the market’s design when it is eventually rolled

proposals put forward by DECC risk losing the UK’s decentralised
generation capacity participation in the transitional arrangements of
the capacity market. This is because it appears that enduring

risk to the trading of small volumes of electricity capacity within the

megawatts. The whole system appears to be based on plants responding to
electricity market price signals. However, demand does not operate in

or two issues remain unresolved. One of these is proposing the
“baselining” of on-site capacity. Current proposals do
not consider on-site generation as providing capacity to the system

storage on our current system, as licence conditions generally restrict
activities in more than one segment. Distribution network operators can
own electricity storage. However, presently, some operators may
infringe their distribution licence conditions, which restrict

will make a comment later in support of the amendment of my noble
friend Lord Hanworth but I conclude with a few questions. First, as the
Government have said that they consider DSR and storage to be a part of
the future capacity market, can the Minister say what level of DSR and
electricity storage within the capacity market the Government would
deem a success? I remember asking the Minister, when we were welcoming
the final provisions on the Green Deal, whether she could perhaps map
out to us what success looks like. What I am trying to get at is: can
she be more specific than saying that she wants it to happen or that
she thinks it will be a success? Perhaps I can challenge her to try to
be more specific in mapping out to the stakeholders, who will take note
outside, how she views this part of the Government’s
operation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:42:49"></hs_TimeCode>. A
supplementary question to that is: do the Government recognise the need
for a separate set of rules for DSR within the capacity market? In
recognising that, it is imperative that they undertake a review of the
current rules, as there is widespread industry concern that they do not
facilitate
DSR<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:43:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000138">My
second question concerns the design of the capacity market and these
trial auctions, which do not provide any long-term income stream for
new electricity storage to be planned, installed and operated. The
Electricity Storage Network and the Liquid Air Energy Network say that
their members will not be able to

Hanworth:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, this amendment is the result
of a representation to us by the Combined Heat and Power Association.
It is designed to allay the impression that a demand-side response is
simply a matter of staunching demand. It points to the fact that much
wasted capacity can be saved by rescheduling the demand for electricity
within the days, within the weeks, and even more widely within the
year, so as to diminish its
variability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000141">A
proper definition of what constitutes a demand-side response is
provided by this amendment, whereas as it stands the Bill lacks such a
definition. In the course of being alerted to this lacuna, we have also
been advised of some of the hazards that might arise. The association
fears that in the process of assimilating demand-side responses to the
capacity mechanism, there is a risk of creating a mechanism designed
around a traditional large-scale generation plant. Such a design risks
limiting or even excluding the demand-side response of small-scale
embedded
generation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000142">Traditional
large-scale generation comprises baseload generation by large power
stations running at or near capacity, accompanied by intermittent
generation by peaking power plants—“peakers”, as
they are known colloquially—which run only when there is high
demand. The power that they supply commands a much higher price per
kilowatt hour than the baseload power. The peakers are typically run
with much lower thermal efficiencies than baseload plants and they
often use obsolescent equipment that is close to its
retirement.</hs_para>

generation, which the Bill is in danger of neglecting, is carried out
by small businesses, hospitals, university campuses, et cetera, and not
by sophisticated electricity-generating companies. Small organisations
have fundamentally different needs from the large-scale generators. If
they are to participate in the capacity market, the system must be
designed around their requirements. At present there are no proposals
to support the trading of small volumes of electricity capacity within
the market. The provisions cater to large plants, which typically trade
hundreds of megawatts of power, and these provisions risk excluding
those who trade, as we have heard, just 2 megawatts or 3 megawatts. We
alert the Minister, therefore, to these facts, in the hope that they
will be accommodated within the primary or secondary legislation in
this Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000144">I
will take this opportunity to describe some of the realities of
electricity demand. The statistics of electricity usage are readily
available. The leading page of the National Grid’s website
displays graphically the electricity demand over the preceding 24
hours. It also shows 
<?notus-xml column=382?>demand over the previous eight days. At the lowest point last week,
Monday night, the demand in Great Britain was 56% of the highest
demand, which was recorded in the late afternoon or early evening of
Wednesday. This kind of variation is greatest in winter. In September
the minimum demand, at around 4.30 am, would be a mere 50%
of the peak demand, at around 3.30 pm. These figures point to a huge
potential for flattening the profile of
demand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000145">Other
interesting facts can be garnered from DECC’s literature. The
report from the Building Research Establishment on the impact of
changing energy use patterns in buildings on peak electricity demand in
the UK is particularly revealing. It points to the surprising fact that
50% of our electricity is consumed within buildings for heating and
lighting, and by appliances of one sort or another. Apart from being
fascinating in their own right, such pieces of evidence convey an
important message: if we are to manage our electricity demand in a
meaningful way, we must do more than simply assimilate the large-scale
generators to the capacity market by means of differential tariffs and
incentives. We need to study in detail the components of electricity
demand in order to understand the scope for demand reduction, and more
particularly for demand smoothing. That is another point we want to
emphasise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000146"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:49:23"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Roper" PimsId="452" UID="13071895000229" xid="1155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000229">Lord
Roper:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very sympathetic to the first three
amendments and, to a more restricted extent, the fourth because they
cover quite a number of the points that I raised earlier with regard to
Amendment 55ZA. In moving his amendment, the noble Lord, Lord
Grantchester, pointed out the complexity of the range of topics that
come under the slightly blurred title of demand-side
reduction and electricity demand reduction. For instance, in
Amendment 53B, the idea of having a separate auction for the demand
side is very interesting. It is easier to involve classic demand-side
reduction into the general auction; on the other hand, it is still
rather difficult to see how what one might call permanent demand
reduction is included in any normal auction. One may need to look at
some other market principle to cover

I may draw attention to one other aspect of energy demand reduction. At
a lunch two or three weeks ago, I learnt about the significant
contribution of the work of the voltage management and optimisation
industry group. It does a rather specific thing in enabling people to
reduce their demand permanently by introducing important technologies.
That is done in universities and hospitals, and in quite a number of
areas of social housing. I hope that when we are thinking about this
general area, we do not overlook that important

Teverson:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome any amendment that
emphasises the demand side of this issue. I particularly like the fact
that we have started to bring in the factor of energy storage. Whenever
you talk about energy storage, the technologies are always just about
going to be there but they never get down to the commercial level by
quite a way. But I hope that that will not be the case in the long
term. This is an important point that needs to be taken into

point is around capacity auctions and the ability of the demand side to
compete equally with that. I would be interested to hear from the
Minister whether she is confident that the demand side will be able to
compete or bring forward sensible bids at the early four-year period.
While I understand entirely that there is a fallback to the previous
year, a lot of the market has already gone. Clearly, the best solution,
the nirvana solution, is that all capacity payment is filled with
demand-side reduction. That is the best outcome that there could be. I
am sure that that will never be the case but it is how we make sure
that we do not restrict it. I am interested in the Minister’s
views on how the Government feel that the demand side can effectively
come forward four years in advance. It would be very useful to

53B is intended to ensure that demand-reduction providers are given
priority over other providers in the awarding of capacity agreements

Government do not see this approach as desirable. First, the capacity
market seeks to encourage genuine competition by placing all forms of
capacity provision on a level playing field. This is the best way to
ensure value for money for consumers, and the reason why no capacity

debated, the Government are also proposing an electricity
demand-reduction pilot 
<?notus-xml column=384?>to inform the future entry of EDR into the capacity market. Holding an
auction four years out ensures that there is sufficient time to build
and commission new generation plants as necessary. However,
demand-reduction providers have told us that opting into capacity
agreements so far in advance of the delivery year would not be possible
for most of their projects. This is why we are giving demand-side
response and storage the option of participating either in the auction
held four years out or in a further auction held one year ahead of
delivery.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000155">It
is currently risky for demand-side response providers to predict the
amount of demand reduction they will be able to provide four years
ahead of a delivery year. This risk is significantly reduced in a
one-year auction and we would expect them to be awarded capacity
agreements at this stage. This is because we envisage them being able
to provide cheaper capacity than generating
plants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000156">In
summary, this amendment would not be compatible with a
technology-neutral approach. Furthermore, it risks either forcing
demand-side response providers into taking on unacceptably large risks
to align with the timescales required for building new generating
plants or negating the possibility of new plants participating in the
capacity market, risking a significant shortfall in electricity supply
and the very real possibility of regular
blackouts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000157">Amendment
53C would require the Secretary of State to modify the Electricity Act
1989, adding an additional licence condition authorising a person to
store electricity. Storage of electricity is not presently an activity
that requires a separate licence, although some storage providers may
be generation licence holders. I therefore reassure the noble Lord that
electricity storage would be able to participate in the capacity market
without this amendment. The Government have already confirmed its
eligibility and this is irrespective of its licence status. This is
because Clause 22 does not restrict participation in the capacity
market only to licence holders. It also allows the Secretary of State
to define further who may be a capacity provider in
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000158">The
noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, also mentioned electricity storage. We
agree that storage technologies are still developing and further
innovation is needed to bring down costs and find ways of scaling up.
We are supporting two innovation competitions, the first winners of
which were announced in May. In the large-scale storage competition, 12
winning projects were given £17 million of funding for the first
feasibility phase. Decisions on which projects will proceed to the
demonstration phase are expected in September. The component research
and feasibility study competition has four projects so
far.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071895000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-gc0002.htm#13071895000159">The noble
Lord, Lord Grantchester, asked about a separate set of rules for DSR
within the capacity market. We do not envisage a separate set of rules.
We envisage that the rules and regulations will cover all technologies
eligible to participate in the capacity market, although the
transitional arrangements for DSR will be incorporated. He also asked
about baselining for on-site capacity. This will be covered in the
detailed capacity market regulations and will be the responsibility of
the national system operator.</hs_para>

what I visualised as success, given his previous question on the Green

Lord Grantchester, we have announced that those technologies will be

will deliver a new cap of £72,000 on the costs of meeting
eligible needs, additional financial help for people of modest wealth
with less than £118,000 in assets including their home and, from
2015, a scheme to prevent anyone having to sell their home in their

including:</hs_para><hs_WAIndent>- for people
entering a care home, their property will not be included in the
assessment of assets if a partner or dependent still lives in the home.
In this case if a person has assets of less than £27,000

the total cost of meeting someone’s eligible needs,

how and what people pay for their care intends to bring a number of
benefits. Currently, a fear of high costs and lack of good information

certainty and through the backing of a long-term contract. Generators
are paid the difference

key part of the challenge our market faces is in ensuring secure
electricity supplies. The Capacity Market will give investors the
certainty they need to put adequate reliable capacity in place,
protecting consumers against the risk of supply shortages. It does this
by providing a predictable revenue stream to providers of reliable
capacity, including both generation and non-generation measures such as
Demand-Side-Response and storage. In return, they must commit to
provide capacity when needed or face financial penalties.</hs_para>

Government’s intended reliability standard for the Capacity
Market – which captures the trade-off between the cost of
providing additional back up capacity, and the level of reliability
achieved. The proposed standard is expressed as a loss of load
expectation (LOLE), i.e. the number of hours per annum in which, over
the long-term, it is statistically expected that supply will not meet
demand, and which reflects the economically efficient level of
capacity. This does not mean that we would have this level of blackouts
in a particular year; in the vast majority of cases, loss of load would
be managed without significant impacts on consumers. But no electricity
system can be 100% reliable. Based on our assessment of the value
consumers place on security of supply, and the costs of providing
capacity, we are proposing that a reliability standard of 3 hours LOLE
per year most efficiently makes this trade-off between cost and
reliability. We are seeking consultees’ views on this proposal
and will finalise the reliability standard in the final Delivery Plan

December.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071868000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-wms0001.htm#13071868000057"><I>Analysis

reason for the additional costs once the Levy is introduced is because
some vehicles currently pay close to or below EU minimum rates of
Vehicle Excise Duty (VED), and so VED cannot be reduced by the same
amount as the Levy, or indeed in some cases VED needs to be
increased.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071868000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-wms0001.htm#13071868000089">However,
as a result of the Government continuing to consider and refine the
analysis for these vehicles, an error in the source data was corrected,
and improvements were made to the methodology used to set the VED rates
that will apply from 1 April 2014. By making this improvement, it is
possible for Her Majesty’s Treasury to amend the VED rates to
reduce the number of vehicles paying over £300 more to just one
vehicle. Even this additional cost represents less than 0.4% of the
annual cost of running an HGV, which is normally in the range of
£80,000 - £100,000.</hs_para>

the outcome of the applications to the Targeted Basic Need Programme.
The Programme was launched in March this year to provide additional
funding for school places in areas where they are most needed. Local
authorities were invited to bid for funding for new schools, or to
expand existing outstanding and good
schools.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071868000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-wms0001.htm#13071868000124">The
Targeted Basic Need funding brings the total amount of funding
allocated to local authorities for new school places over the current
spending review period to over £5 billion - more than
double the £1.9 billion spent by the previous
government over an equivalent period. That funding is sufficient to
provide the 417,000 places we need by 2015. By September this year, we
expect 190,000 extra places will have been created during this

allocations – which go directly to local authorities, and are
based on projections of their need – were issued in March, and
gave authorities funding for the next two years, enabling them to plan
provision. Those allocations totalled some £1.6bn and will
support local authorities to keep pace with projections of
demand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071868000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718-wms0001.htm#13071868000126">On top
of this, we invited applications from local authorities for additional
new places, particularly focused on places in outstanding or good
schools, and on creating new academies sponsored by
organisations with a good track record in educational
success. We are determined that every pupil should not just have a
place, but that 
<?notus-xml column=147?>the growth in the system is, as far as possible, concentrated in schools
that parents and pupils really want to go to. So I am delighted to
announce that the Targeted Basic Need Programme will provide
£820 million to fund an additional 74,000 high quality school
places on top of those already created and funded – all in areas
that face the greatest pressure on places. These new places will be in
45 new schools and in 333 expanding schools that are rated as
outstanding or good.</hs_para>

a mean residence time in the atmosphere as there are a range of
processes that exchange carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and other
carbon reservoirs, operating on a wide range of time-scales. An
indication of residence time can be seen from experiments using the Met
Office Hadley Centre's Earth system model, HadGEM2-ES, in which for the
current climate, the fraction of a pulse of carbon dioxide remaining in

him released and returned to the UK as a matter of urgency. On the
17 June the Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member
for Witney (Mr Cameron), raised Mr Aamer’s case with President
Obama in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister later wrote to President
Obama reaffirming the importance the UK places on the request for
Mr Aamer’s release. Notwithstanding the British
Government’s best endeavours, any decision regarding Mr
Aamer’s release remains in the hands of the US
Government.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13071869000250" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130718w0001.htm#13071869000250">Health:

and Coastguard Agency is responsible for marking and guarding the
wreck. This is done through the identification of a prohibited area
around the wreck which is marked by buoys, on charts and by contract
for 24 hour radar and visual surveillance by Medway Ports. The Ministry

Attlee:</Member> The Government confirmed in the White Paper
“The Overseas Territories – Security, Success and
Sustainability” published last year that we are committed to
promoting the interests of the Turks and Caicos Islands with respect to
international scheduled air services in recognition of the fact that
air services are important to the economic development of the Islands.
The Department for Transport leads on air services negotiations with
foreign Governments and actively involves interested parties from the
Turks and Caicos Islands, seeking to enhance the commercial
opportunities available. Ultimately, however, it is for the airlines
themselves to determine, in the light of market conditions, the number
of commercial services they
operate.</hs_para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2013-07-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_18_PT_1/Index/D606385293FBBF756ABEDECB3BE0AAFE4ED783E5" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="25" cday="Thursday" cmonth="July" cyear="2013" date="18" day="Thursday" issue="38" maxparts="1" month="July" part="1" price="" printing="daily" session="201314" volume="747" year="2013"><tocdate col="WS133">Thursday 18 July 2013</tocdate><title>ALPHABETICAL
