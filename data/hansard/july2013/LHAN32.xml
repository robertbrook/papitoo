Lords<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T14:35:00"></hs_TimeCode>, the
design of local schemes and the assessment of their impact is the
responsibility of local authorities. It is for authorities to design
local council tax support schemes that will minimise the possibility of
anyone falling into arrears on their council tax. Localisation gives
local authorities the freedom to choose how to manage the funding
reduction and they are best placed to understand their local priorities
and the needs of their vulnerable residents. This reform enables them
to take these local factors into account when deciding on levels of
support.</hs_para>

that reply. Does she recognise the additional costs being borne by
local authorities in seeking to collect council taxes from some of the
lowest income and poorest communities in their areas for the very first
time? These costs include setting the support scheme, counselling and
advising, seeking to collect and even, in extremis, taking people to

there is agreement on the costs being borne by them in seeking to
introduce that policy in their communities?</hs_para>

well aware of what the council tax support was going to be. They were
also well aware that their schemes should take into account any
additional costs which came about as a result of the council tax
support scheme. As with everything else to do with local authorities,
we will keep this under review but it would not qualify for any
consideration under new burdens because council tax is always something
that the council has had to deal with.</hs_para>

Government have cut the funding for council tax benefit for local
authorities by 10%, local authorities are having to charge people on
benefit who have never paid council tax before. As a result, chief
executives are estimating that up to 75% of those new payers will not
pay. As it costs £10 to collect £2.50 a week, we are
going to create a culture of non-compliance just like there was with
the poll tax. Will the Minister please think again? It is a very
foolish policy indeed.</hs_para>

implemented now and the noble Baroness will be as aware as I am that
the councils were all offered a transitional grant at the outset if
they set a council tax support scheme which was not more than 8.5% from
zero. A number of local authorities have done that. Nearly 200 took
advantage of that transitional grant and if others had they would not
be in the position which I think the noble Baroness is trying to

had an opportunity to get off the ground but clearly this is something

recent credible research which, using modern climate change models,
found that even a regional war using nuclear weapons between emerging
nuclear-armed states with relatively primitive weapons would quickly
lead to significant global climate change, reduce temperatures, reduce
growing seasons, have significant adverse agricultural effects and then
quite devastating effects for all the world’s populations. Why,
then, did the coalition Government not attend the Oslo conference on
the humanitarian effects of nuclear weapons? Why did they boycott it?

military—unabated, uncondemned and unobstructed by the West? Can
the Minister tell us when this situation was last raised in the United

LeRiche found that civilians in the Blue Nile State were living in

rendering

perpetuating these crimes with impunity had the backing of President
al-Bashir and six other ICC inditees. Does my noble friend agree that

to assume that the United Nations can do too much. The UN has been
actively engaged in this extremely complex series of wars. Let us be
quite clear: there are not just two sides on this, as the noble
Baroness herself well knows. There is conflict within South Sudan;
there is conflict within Sudan itself; there is conflict between groups
which are claimed to be supported from across the border. It is now
10 years since the Darfur conflict started. Things are a
little better than they were. I speak with some direct experience,
having a close friend who has worked both in Darfur and in Abyei in the
past three years. Sadly, there are limits to what the international
community can achieve, but I assure the noble Baroness that the British

Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. The updated MPC remit

me, the Minister quoted the Prime Minister as saying at the G8 that the
UK Government were “supporting … [an] active monetary
policy”. How can he say that when it is not their
responsibility? Is it because the new governor is virtually unsackable
at the moment? Or is it that the Government are simply not interested
at all in monetary policy? The new governor took his first meeting, to
which the Minister referred. During the meeting, unusually for a
governor, he gave some guidance and said that interest rates would be
low for a long time, and could even go a little lower. In those
circumstances, the pound dropped substantially. Some people are very
happy with that. Is the

setting monetary policy to meet a forward-looking inflation target.

comment on one aspect of the asset purchase scheme—quantitative
easing—about which there has been some argument. When the
original document setting up the asset purchase scheme was signed, and
it was made consistent with the Bank of England Act 1998, was it set
down that increases in the scale of the asset purchase scheme required
the agreement of the Government, and that while day-to-day monetary
policy may be the responsibility of the Bank of England, an increase in
the scale of quantitative easing would require endorsement by the
Government? Is that

tricky it is for central banks to give forward-looking guidance without
it having an effect on the market. However, as the MPC said at its
meeting just last week, it viewed the implied rise in the expected
future bank rate as not warranted by recent developments in the
domestic economy. It is trying to be cautious and reduce any potential
volatility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000059"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Vinson" PimsId="4454" UID="13070989000791" xid="1478" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000791">Lord

PIMCO, wrote about four weeks ago, as reported in the <I>Financial
Times</I>, that the new Governor of the Bank of England would have only
one shot in his locker, and that is to let the pound depreciate. Is it
such a bad thing if, after 30 years, a trading nation begins to
consider the rate at which it trades with the rest of the world? Is not
our failure to look at the rate of our exchange in the past one of the
reasons why we have such a high imbalance of
trade?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000060"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13070989000792" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000792">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the pound has fallen in value against
other international currencies by about 20% in recent years and that
has not automatically had a vast impact on the balance of payments.
There are considerable signs of optimism about that. For example,
exports in goods to the EU increased by almost 7% last month. However,
I think that recent experience has shown that devaluation on its own
does not cut the mustard—we also need to have a whole raft of
supply-side measures in place. That is why things ranging from the
additional resources to UKTI, at one end, to bringing more money into
science and apprenticeships, at the other, are necessary if we are to
have a significant improvement in the balance of
payments.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Bill">

other noble Lords, I have received a briefing from the Prison Reform
Trust. While welcoming the amendment, there are a couple of matters on
which they seek some assurance—and I would echo their request.
First, that the Government should require the contractors to
specify—within the contract specifications —what
particular services would be provided for women, and that the tender
criteria, in turn, as part of the contract, would give sufficient
weighting to that element. I imagine that should not present any
difficulties but it would be good if the Minister could confirm it.

point related to women prisoners that is not specifically covered by
this amendment but which has been referred to in the course of our
debates—that is, resettlement prisons. It is a welcome concept
and certainly should help to reduce reoffending by ensuring that women
serve their prison sentences, or at least the latter part of the
sentence, closer to where they are likely to return on release. I
raised a question in earlier debates about the specific position of
women in this respect because, as I understand it, there are only 13
women’s prisons in the country and they are not necessarily
geographically distributed in such a way as to facilitate the
Government’s intentions. I am not asking the Minister to confirm
specifically today, but it would be good to know that that is being
considered and that it is an objective which it is hoped the Government
will seek to achieve. It would largely complete the work raised by the

noble Lords will know, each of the 35 trusts has a volunteer probation
board which is the employer of all the probation staff working in a
trust. Apparently, there is an expectation that board members do not
criticise the wishes of the Government because although they are
volunteers, they are not civil servants. They have been reminded by the
head of Transforming Rehabilitation that they should have regard to the
constraints imposed on civil servants. I have had representations from
board members about the vote which was passed in this House on Report
about the requirement for the Secretary of State to allow us to discuss
changes to be made to the probation service. Apparently, the board says
that planning is going ahead on the timetable which I outlined on
Report regardless of the vote in this House. Probation staff around the
country are, as he described it, lost for words because it was expected
that at the very least the Government would respect the vote of this

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, this is the fourth iteration of the
concept I floated at Second Reading and which we have debated in
Committee and on Report. I can claim no credit for the idea. It was
conceived in the United States in 2008 where it has been applied with
remarkable success in terms of the reduction in reoffending by
ex-service men and women and in promoting their welfare, with courts
now established in every state. It is now seen as embedded in the
justice system and is an integral part of what we in this
country call the military covenant, under which we recognise the
special responsibility we have as a society for those who have served
their country, often in difficult and dangerous
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000084">The
veterans’ treatment courts do not adjudicate on guilt or
innocence. Nor do they deal with those who are convicted of, or plead
guilty to, crimes for which only a custodial sentence would be
appropriate. Their purpose is to promote the rehabilitation and prevent
the reoffending of men and women who often find it hard to readjust to
civilian life, which is so different from the collective
existence—perhaps better described as the regimented
existence—that, of necessity, military service often involves.
Some will have suffered, and may continue to suffer, combat stress or
post-traumatic stress disorders and a number will fall foul of the law,
with crimes of a violent or sexual nature being particularly
common.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070989000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000085">The
courts in America are presided over by the relevant judge. A veteran
mentor is assigned to each offender, who has to attend monthly court
sessions and is helped in a variety of ways to adjust to life in the
wider community, receiving practical, psychological and, where
necessary, clinical support. Failure to co-operate with the treatment
court leads to a return to the sentencing court and the risk of a
prison
sentence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000086">It
must be said that there is no certainty about the numbers that might be
involved in this country were we to adopt the system, even for those
serving prison sentences. The MoD estimates that some 3.5% of 
<?notus-xml column=165?>prisoners at any one time are ex-service personnel. However, other
estimates rise as high as double figures. A survey by Mr Colin Back of
the Regular Forces Employment Association, who has worked extensively
with this group and who attended a recent helpful meeting with the
Prisons Minister, Mr Damian Green, has produced an estimate of those
claiming and proven to have served in the Armed Forces to be an average
of 6% of the inmates in a wide range of establishments, with a lowest
figure of 3% and a highest figure of 11%. It is likely, however, that
these figures are understated because some of those in prison do not
wish to disclose their status to other prisoners or to those who,
like Mr Back, are inquiring as to their position, because of
concerns about how other prisoners will react or fear of loss of
pensions and the like.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070989000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000087">Be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:29:24"></hs_TimeCode>
that as it may, it is clear that the number of ex-service men and women
who come before the courts will substantially exceed the number who end
up in prison. Even 3.5% of those who receive non-custodial sentences
such as probation or community sentences will amount to several times
the lowest estimate of those in custody, which is around 2,500. I do
not find the number quoted by the Minister on Report for this group of
non-custodial offenders of some 5,800 to be particularly
credible, except perhaps as an annual figure. Therefore, over time the
offending group will be quite substantial and the cumulative total must
be considerably higher. We must remember that the figures are but a
snapshot at any one time so the total who will have been in the system
over time, whether in prison or—particularly relevant
here—on non-custodial sentences, will be correspondingly
greater<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.
Moreover, at current reoffending rates, the figure would be further
inflated. Obviously, addressing the general reoffending rate is the
whole point of this Bill. Finally, those who have served in Bosnia,
Iraq and Afghanistan are due to return and 20,000 will leave the
forces, so the potential for an upward spike in numbers is all too
apparent<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13070989000319" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000319">3.30

it is clearly in the interests of those who leave the services and who
face—or cause—difficulties in the civil society to which
they return, to help them avoid reoffending, which after all is the
purpose of this Bill, whose objectives of course we all share. The US
experience is overwhelmingly successful in that respect, with the
original veterans’ court in Buffalo, New York, recording a 100%
success rate. Making every allowance for the differences between our
two countries, their legal systems and their support mechanisms for
veterans, the evidence surely speaks for itself. I pay tribute to the
work of the British Legion and other bodies that offer support to
ex-service men and women, but we need to develop a system

previous debates I mentioned work done in the north-east, the largest
contributor of recruits to the Armed Forces, around the health needs of
the ex-service community, particularly mental health needs. A number of
initiatives have taken place in local authorities in the region,
working with the NHS and NOMS, for example. The Northumbria Probation
Trust—which, 
<?notus-xml column=166?>of course, will be abolished if the Government press
on with their proposed changes to the service, contrary to the
amendment to the Bill carried by this House, to which the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, referred a moment or two ago—has a
veterans’ champion in each of its six delivery units. Local
councils have developed a greater awareness of veterans’ needs
and have been recalibrating relevant services accordingly. It is the
ideal area in which a pilot scheme, as envisaged by proposed new
subsections (3) and (4) of the amendment, might be established and
evaluated. Of course, there might be other contenders. Mr Oliver
Colvile, the Conservative Member for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, who
attended the recent meeting with Mr Green, would be an advocate for
such a pilot in his area, which has a substantial Royal Navy
presence.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070989000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000090">The
amendment does not seek an unequivocal commitment to the establishment
of veterans’ treatment courts. On Report, the Minister was kind
enough to characterise me as a latter-day Lenin. On this
issue, I see myself as more of a Fabian, of the kind with whom
the Minister, in a previous incarnation, would have felt comfortable.
The amendment calls for a report dealing with, but not limited to, a
range of issues and providing for the option of pilots and, if
successful, the creation of a permanent scheme. The Minister has
expressed some sympathy with the proposal but a virginal reluctance to
commit. Mr Green was also sympathetic and mentioned the possibility of
including it, should legislation be necessary, in what he rather
alarmingly referred to as another possible justice Bill in this
Session.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000091">I
cannot see why the Government should be so diffident about the

courts—let alone vastly expensive Titan-type prisons—and
would cost significantly less to pilot than the Chancellor

years ago at Waterloo. Accepting the amendment would both
symbolise our continuing commitment to those who serve and help the
Government achieve the objectives of this Bill by reducing
reoffending, thereby protecting the public and saving public money. I

Ramsbotham:</Member></B> My Lords, I support this amendment, to which I
have added my name. We have spoken about this issue many times before.
Several advantages come with this amendment in the context of the Armed
Forces covenant, for which the Government are very much to be
commended, not least because it requires an annual report to both
Houses of Parliament by the Secretary of
State.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000093">What
has been most encouraging since the announcement of the covenant is the
number of local covenants that have been commissioned around the
country. There is a huge support network for a particular focus on the
multifarious needs of the Armed Forces. Mention has already been made
by the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, of the large voluntary sector which
supports the military and their families. Those organisations are very
capable of carrying out many of the functions that are needed. In
addition to that, a growing support network is being developed for
those suffering from mental health problems—the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=167?>has mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder and other kinds of
fatigue—not least a number of official recovery centres based
around the country which are linked into the military command
structure. This is a diversion scheme, very much on the lines of the
scheme developed by the noble Lord, Lord Bradley, which the Government
have supported. It is poised to go, supporting an element of the
community to which the Government have said that they wish to pay
particular
attention.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000094">I
was present at the very encouraging meeting with the Minister, Damian

we might expect in terms of a government

involved with the criminal justice

we should not lose sight of the fact that the vast majority of men and
women who serve in our Armed Forces go on to lead successful,
law-abiding lives. Ex-service personnel are an important asset to the
economy of this country and any employer should welcome the skills that
they bring to any job. I also pay tribute to all the brave men and
women who serve in our Armed Forces and continue to do so with great
distinction and honour. We pray for them, particularly those who find
themselves on the front line as we speak today.</hs_para>

Beecham, has already mentioned the meeting he had with my right
honourable friend Damian Green, the Minister who sits appropriately in
both the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice and who is ideally
placed to consider the issue of ex-service personnel who find
themselves in the criminal justice system. That meeting was attended by
not only the noble Lord, Lord Beecham—as he has
acknowledged—the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, David Anderson,
the MP for Blaydon, and my honourable friend Oliver Colville, the MP
for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, were also present. Therefore, it is
fair to say that there is support for looking at this important issue
both here and in the other place, throughout the country and across the
political
spectrum.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000104">Also
at that meeting were a number of representatives of veterans’
groups, such as Tony Wright of Forward Assist. I know that my right
honourable friend Damian Green particularly welcomed their input and
the information that they supplied about the experiences of ex-service
personnel. One of the key things that emerged from that meeting is that
the focus is not necessarily on ex-service personnel who are in prison.
It is of course important that we continue to develop services for
those who are in custody, such as the veterans in custody support
officers, and expand the specific guidance that is produced in
collaboration with interested government departments and the important
voluntary sector.</hs_para>

it will be important to have tailored supervision for ex-service
personnel on release, including, for example, mentoring from those with
service backgrounds—a subject that we have talked about
previously. So while we continue to work with ex-service personnel in
custody, we also need to focus on those who receive non-custodial
sentences or those who can be diverted from the criminal courts
altogether. We believe that there are a number of ways to address
offending by veterans at that level. For example, we could look at the
programmes that are available as part of conditional cautions, which
are administered by the police.</hs_para>

Beecham, also mentioned the US experiences. That is something that the
Government are also looking at. For those receiving community orders or
suspended sentence orders, there are powers available to the courts to
review sentences, 
<?notus-xml column=169?>essentially to monitor progress of that particular order. We suspect
that these approaches might benefit some ex-service personnel. However,
we need to know more about the problem of offending at this level in
order to decide what the best solution is.</hs_para>

striking things raised by veterans’ groups is the lack of
detailed information about the scope and nature of offending by
ex-service personnel. That point was well made by the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham. Even in prisons there are significant differences in the
estimates, ranging from 3% of the population to 11%. For those involved
in less serious offending, the information is even less clear. That is
why we want to work with the veterans’ groups to try to
establish a better understanding of the nature and extent of offending.
If we have that information, we believe we can focus better on a
response.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000108">The

available. I am also happy to make a commitment that the Government
will produce an assessment of the issues identified, as raised in this

assessment and share the findings with noble Lords within the coming

I reassure noble Lords that we will continue to consult relevant
groups. We want to discuss the issue with other key government

of other noble Lords in paying tribute to organisations such as Help

“treatment”. It is not designed to refer to clinical

direction by having a clear expression of opinion on the amendment.
Accordingly, I wish to test the opinion of the House. I hope that we

Best:</Member></B> My Lords, we come now to a group of amendments five
of which are in my name and the names of my noble friends Lady Wilkins
and Lady Tyler. These five amendments have the same underlying
purpose—namely to give greater prominence to the crucial role
that housing can play in preventing and reducing the need for health
and social care services. The amendments have been prepared by the Care
and Support Alliance which is composed of more than 70
organisations that support and represent older and disabled people. I
am particularly grateful to the National Housing Federation, which has
helped bring these amendments together and given excellent briefings to
interested Members of your Lordships’
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:02:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=174?><hs_para UID="13070989000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000118">The
Bill has been welcomed by those organisations, and they note with
approval that the definition of “well-being” in Clause 1
covers “suitability of living accommodation”. Also, in
relation to the duty on local authorities to meet needs for care and
support, Clause 8 includes reference to such assistance being provided
“at home”. However, these passing references to the place
where many elderly and disabled people spend almost all their time do
not do justice to the significance of housing to enabling people to
live
independently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:03:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000119">The
Bill takes highly significant steps to integrating health and social
care services, but downplaying the housing element—the third leg
of the stool—will undermine the legislation’s good
intentions. The Age UK report, <I>Stop Falling: Start Saving Lives and
Money</I>, notes that falls cost the NHS around £4.6 million
every day and that around half of the people over the age of 80 suffer
a fall each year. It makes clear that it is accidents in the home, or
on the icy step outside, that so often lead to hospitalisation. Cold
and damp premises are equally likely to be the cause of a deterioration
in health. Once in hospital, if the home to which the patient should
return is totally unsatisfactory, their discharge will be delayed
and/or there will be a swift readmission to hospital when the home
fails them.

carers cannot cope with someone’s care needs if they are
battling with the inadequacies of a home that has unmanageable
stairs or cannot accommodate a wheelchair.</hs_para>

case has been made for the financial benefits of getting the housing
service right. The National Housing Federation’s new report,
<I>Providing an Alternative Pathway</I>, for example, shows that
housing for someone with dementia in a self-contained flat in an
extra-care scheme provided by a housing association can cut the cost of
their care by up to 50%, allowing them to live more independently with
care and support on-site, rather than in a costly residential care
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:05:31"></hs_TimeCode>. Currently,
the UK is spending £9.43 billion on housing those with dementia
in care homes, so housing alternatives can have a huge impact on health
budgets.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070989000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000121">Often<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:07:09"></hs_TimeCode>
the ideal housing solution for so many of us as we grow older is a move
to a more manageable home with very low heating bills, no stairs or
steps, but with high standards, space, light and ventilation. As a
wonderful bonus, when an older person downsizes, a much needed
family home, probably with a garden, comes on to the market for the
next generation. I declare my interest as chair of Hanover Housing
Association, which endeavours to build accommodation of this kind,
which is in turn likely to be best place for care and support services
to be delivered. The housing provider can supply the back-up, not only
through emergency call systems—now much enhanced by new
technology—but in personal terms in acting as helper and ally in
securing care services. Age-friendly housing developments for older
people also protect against loneliness and isolation for the resident
through ensuring a sociable, companionable
environment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:06:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070989000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000122">However, the great
majority of people will stay put in their family home. A joined-up care
and housing service can make this possible. Sometimes very minor
adaptations are all that are needed to extend people’s
independence and autonomy. Handrails that are discreetly 
<?notus-xml column=175?>and strategically placed can prevent falls in the
home. Long-armed “D” taps for people with arthritic hands
can reduce the occupiers need for costly help. Introduction to a
“handy person” service can get these things fixed.
Arrangements to pay for a defunct central heating boiler to be revived
can end the misery of choosing between being freezing cold and spending
a fortune on an electric bar heater which may well be unsafe.

improvement agencies, often called “care and repair”
services, can organise access to disabled facilities grants for items
like stair lifts or the installation of walk-in showers, making life so
much easier for family carers as well as for the person themselves. It
is good to note, in the spending review, the transfer of resources from
the Department of Health to fund a planned 20% increase in the budgets
of disabled facilities grants.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070989000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000124">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:08:14"></hs_TimeCode>
these measures that prevent the need for more costly care services
achieve very rapid payback as well as transforming people’s
lives. If a patient cannot be discharged from hospital for a couple of
weeks because their home cannot take them back, the NHS will incur
costs of well over £5,000—money that could have been so
much better spent fixing the home and preventing a series of
unnecessary and unwanted hospital stays. Avoiding a move into
residential care for a couple of years will save tens of thousands of
pounds<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:08:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendments covers a different clause in the Bill and inserts a housing
dimension to the very welcome measures already therein. First,
Amendment 80 addresses Clause 2, which focuses on preventing
or delaying a person’s need for care. It seeks recognition that
housing is a crucial part of a preventive care
service.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070989000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000126">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:07:09"></hs_TimeCode>,
Amendment 81 is particularly significant. It adds housing to Clause 3,
covering promotion of integration of care and support with health
services. It is interesting to note, in this context, that in Scotland
this holistic view of integration is now taken. The relevant Scottish

says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13070989000299" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000299">“It
will be important that, in bringing … health and social care
closer together, partners ensure that housing services (including those
provided by housing associations and the third sector, as well as by
local authorities) are fully included in the integrated approach to
service planning and provision, and that health and social care
planning and local housing strategies are mutually
supportive”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13070989000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000127">So
says the Scottish guidance. Sadly, our Health and Social Care Act 2012
does not explicitly reference housing, and a framework for engagement
was neglected in that Act’s guidance. This has led to a very
patchy involvement with housing by the new health and well-being
boards. Some are examplars of engagement with housing providers in a
three-way partnership, while others seem blind to the significance of
this element in the

Amendment 86 covers Clause 4 and relates to information and advice.
Again, this is a very important amendment. The Joint Committee that
looked at the Bill strongly recommended that local authorities provide
information and advice on the housing options available in their area.
However, although the Government have incorporated the need for
independent financial advice, the recommendation from the committee to
include housing has not been taken up. This amendment, by 
<?notus-xml column=176?>including housing options in the Bill, should ensure that local
authorities provide the requisite information on specialist and adapted
housing in their area, on ways for people to get their home adapted,
and on the ways in which people can cover the costs of home
improvements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:11:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000129">Fourthly,
Amendment 87 seeks to improve Clause 5, which is concerned
with the diversity and quality of local service. It extends the
definition of care and support services to ensure that local
authorities include specialist housing, accessible housing and
housing-related support in their mix of
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:11:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000130">Finally,
Amendment 88 addresses Clause 9, which relates to the assessment of an
adult’s needs for care and support. It is intended to make sure
that local authorities pick up on whether adaptations to a home are
needed or whether a move to more specialist housing would be best.
Assessing the housing requirements of the individual is a vital part of
the process of seeing what is best for that person and how their lives
can be improved. The amendment seeks to make sure that this
ingredient in the process is covered as a matter of
course<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:12:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000131">I
hope that the Minister will feel able to take on board the kind of
changes to the Bill which these amendments advocate. The report last
year from the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Housing and Care for
Older People, <I>Living Well at Home</I>, spelt out the case for the
three-way integration of health, social care and housing. The White
Paper published prior to the Bill promoted the theme of including
housing more centrally in the future of social care. The House of Lords
Select Committee report, <I>Ready </I><I>f</I><I>or Ageing?</I>,
highlights the housing requirements of older people. The
pre-legislative scrutiny committee, so ably chaired by Paul Burstow MP,
took this forward with strong recommendations for a higher profile in
this Bill for the housing dimension. The 70 organisations
in the Care and Support Alliance, which have a real
understanding of the needs of older and disabled people, believe
passionately that these changes would greatly improve the Bill. I beg

excellent report, <I>Housing</I><I> for People with a Learning</I>
<I>Disability</I><I>,</I> was the focus of a recent meeting of the
All-Party Parliamentary Group on Learning Disability. One mother
described what happens when housing does not form part of the
three-legged stool of the noble Lord, Lord Best. Her son, Sam,
has severe learning disabilities and no speech. Following
school, he spent three years away from home learning independent-living
skills at college, with social services promising that they were
planning appropriate provision for him when he returned home. He
returned home to find nothing—no provision. Residential care was
deemed inappropriate; the only supported housing was for people for
more moderate needs and Sam needed 24-hour support. The housing
department was not even aware of its responsibilities to youngsters
with learning disabilities as a group with supported-housing needs. It
was only by chance that Sam's mother heard of an empty, run-down house
in the borough—empty because it had been left in a legacy to be
used for people with learning disabilities and the council could not
find tenants to fill it. It was about to be sold. The rest of her story
was all too familiar with the hurdles and obstacles placed in her way,
but her son and three other youngsters with severe learning
disabilities moved in on 10 March last year. They are now flourishing
in the community with their health and well-being markedly
improved.</hs_para>

that any Bill dealing with care must deal absolutely explicitly with
housing. After all, noble Lords will remember when the long-stay,
sub-normality hospitals were closed in the late 1970s, the 1980s, and
the early 1990s the very thing that was required was housing. Mencap
did provide the housing in those days, as best it could, with Mencap

allows people with a learning disability actually to own their own
housing with the appropriate support. These provisions are necessary,

Jolly:</Member></B> My Lords, I support this suite of
amendments—this flight of amendments—on housing. As noble
Lords have eloquently said, housing is the third side of the care
triangle. Those of us who sat on the scrutiny committee were absolutely
clear on that. We thought that it had been extended to our report, but
clearly it has not been reflected totally in the Bill. There
was mention of it in Clause 1, the well- being clause, in
Clause 6 on co-operation, and also in Clause 8 on how to
meet needs. The noble Lord, Lord Best, has filled in the gaps, with
Clause 2 on prevention, Clause 3 on integration, Clause 4 on
the provision of information and advice, Clause 5 on market shaping and
Clause 9 on the assessment of needs. In each of these elements of the
Bill, housing is imperative. The anxiety that many of us share is that
if housing is not in these clauses, it will not be dealt with when an
individual is assessed, or when there are issues around
integration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000142">In
the Select Committee, the most compelling witnesses were from the
housing sector. They understood the impact that appropriate housing,
and any adaptations to houses, would have on the lives of the people
living there—on the health and well-being of the individual. The
amendments in this group put housing where it should be. It is core to
assessment and core to integration of care. It is a preventive measure,
and it is also core to the provision of information. There is
no point in having a conversation as a result of your assessment and as
part of the information process if you are not aware of what your
housing needs are, because without housing, the conversation makes no
sense.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070989000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000143">Local

through charities or local authorities, was that it was clearly spelled
out in government policy. I therefore strongly support the need for
this provision to be in the Bill. Without that background, I would have
found the job of closing two large institutions extremely difficult,

Amendment 88, in the wider context of Clause 9, and put an idea to the

assessment of an adult’s needs for care and support. It
states:</hs_para>

struck me as an outsider looking into these matters is that,
irrespective of the changes to which the noble Lord, Lord Rix,
referred, problems still arise where elderly people—perhaps in
their 80s, 90s or whatever—have to transfer out of their homes,
which they may well own, or from hospital into some kind of care
environment, perhaps a nursing home. I wonder whether it would be
possible for that process to be made more seamless in circumstances
where a local authority took on the responsibility of
marketing—I shall come on to what I mean by
“marketing”—the home for sale, clearing the home
and making all the arrangements for the transfer of that resident, be
it from their home or from hospital, into a care environment.</hs_para>

authority could offer a package. At the moment, that package, in part,
is offered by some of the charities. I have spoken to charities, such
as Age Concern, which carry out various components in this process of
transfer but I wonder whether money could be raised by local
authorities through taking a proportion of the commission on the sale
of properties by estate agents. In other words, a local authority would
advertise within its area and estate agents could tender for the right
to handle the properties for which the local authority took

estate agents would not necessarily know whether they would get that
business if it was organised in the wider market, if they knew they
were going to get all the business provided by the local

responsible for carrying out the process of transfer in a particular
district—they might be prepared to share their
commissions

“Where is the money coming from?”. It has to come from

the local authority has to find away of raising the revenue. If local
authorities could somehow attach themselves to the revenue from the
sale of houses, it might well provide an income stream—and what
better way to do so than to provide a package for the seamless transfer

perhaps underoccupying—a four-apartment dwelling, and her
daughter stays round the corner? If the person is moved, the daughter
will not be able to give the support that is needed. The Government may
say that 
<?notus-xml column=181?>it does not apply to pensioners, but what happens if
the person is in their 50s and is not too well, or suffers from an
illness, such as asbestosis, which we debated in this House? If the

stroke or have some other illness. The very fact that that warden can

all right makes a marvellous difference to the families of those with

anti-social behaviour in the tenement I’m living in”. I
went about the business of trying to get her moved, and the local

I can go to work without getting a phone call to say that my wife is in
a terrible situation. I know that my wife can now go to pick up the

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> I want to bring us back briefly to
the amendments that we were discussing. Broadly, housing obviously has
a tremendous impact on people’s lives, but we are talking about
inserting the word “housing” in a number of
clauses that will enable co-ordination between health, social care and
housing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000158">Many
local authorities and well-being boards, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Jolly, mentioned, already have it—that is, if you achieve this
co-ordination, you will make savings and produce better outcomes for
the individuals being helped. Having it on the face of the Bill will
ensure that the leadership of all these authorities has to pay
attention to it, and I think that is important. At the moment we have a
postcode lottery. If you are fortunate enough to live in an authority
that has got it together, your adaptations will arrive; you will have
all your other housing issues sorted out, along with your care package,
and, if you are an old person in hospital, you will be out in a very
short time. If you are a person with a disability, as that disability
increases, or if you have a sudden disability, your adaptations will
appear because there will be that co-ordination.</hs_para>

Wheeler:</Member></B> My Lords, the Joint Committee on the Bill
acknowledged that it had been widely welcomed, but asserted that this
did not mean that it could not be improved—there are gaps and
risks and unintended consequences. The failure of the Bill adequately
to underline the importance of housing not just to well-being but to
integrated care, to prevention and to being included in the provision
of advice and information on quality of care and assessment is what
these amendments seek to address. The interplay between housing and
well-being—the standard of someone’s living circumstances
and their health condition, the appropriateness of their house or flat
and the likelihood of their being able to remain in it and care for
themselves—is long established. However, as noble Lords have
shown, it is overlooked in key clauses of the Bill.</hs_para>

takes forward the vision of specialist houses fully integrated into the
health and social care system which was so comprehensively set out by
stakeholders from across the housing sector in their evidence to the
Select Committee. The quality of that evidence was commented on by the
noble Baroness, Lady Jolly. There are numerous examples of inspiring
best practice where housing is an integral part of care and support and
service delivery. The Bill needs to provide the momentum for good
practice to become embedded across all local authorities and health
providers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000162">The
evidence to the Select Committee from organisations across the housing
sector cites inspiring examples of where housing, health and social
care provision and support join up to provide integrated person-centred
care. However, alongside this, there is huge frustration that progress
across the country has been so slow and patchy. This is especially so
when what stakeholders refer to as low-level interventions, which
really make a difference, are often the services earliest to be cut
back and dispensed with. The Anchor Trust, for example, described the
determination to keep its service-level manager on site at
one of its sheltered housing schemes because it made all the
difference. The noble Lord, Lord Martin, made this point, too. Anchor
said that, in its view, once the manager left, the next steps for
elderly and frail people were usually into residential care. This was
one of the many examples given of the consequences of not having
housing-related support regarded as a key social determinant of health.
I look forward to the Minister’s explanation as to why the
Government have not ensured that this is fully reflected in the
Bill.</hs_para>

case from the noble Lord, Lord Best, and my noble friend Lady Wilkins
for Amendment 81, supported forcefully by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, on
the importance of including the promotion of housing provision in the
duties of local authorities under Clause 3 to provide integrated
services, and of ensuring that there are similar duties
placed on the health service. Our amendment to Clause 6
complements this by reinforcing integrated joined-up working with
registered housing providers, including 
<?notus-xml column=183?>housing associations and registered social landlords, and recognising
these as key, relevant partners under the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000164">The need
to recognise housing as a preventive service cannot be overestimated or
overemphasised. Schemes such as Midland Heart’s reablement
service for the elderly or frail combine social care and housing
association support to enable people to be discharged from hospital
back to their homes quickly and help independence to be regained. They
delay or prevent the need for more intensive care, reduce the
likelihood of repeated hospital stays and can prevent avoidable
accidents. Commissioners need to be encouraged to consider specialist
housing, home-from-hospital services, housekeeping-related support and
adaptations when designing preventive services. Housing is a crucial
preventive service and Amendment 80 is important for
ensuring that this is recognised in the Bill.</hs_para>

important for ensuring that needs assessments include an assessment of
housing options, as is Amendment 86, which underlines the importance of
ensuring that local authorities provide information and advice for
adults and carers on available housing options and the choice of
providers available in the authority’s area. While in Amendment
87 we fully recognise the need for more specialist housing to be built
to meet the needs of care and support, we would be cautious at the
present time of putting this extra burden on local government when it
does not have the resources or the means to deliver. It is the
responsibility of national government to provide the £10 billion
extra investment in infrastructure that the International
Monetary Fund has called for to get the economy moving and make
shovel-ready projects such as housing happen.</hs_para>

National Housing Federation for its excellent briefing, and I refer to

one of its members, the housing association Look Ahead, for a

six-month stay in hospital, it had initially been intended that he
should move to a residential care placement, but instead he was
referred to Look Ahead’s rehabilitation service. The support
that he received helped him with basic life skills, diet management and
managing his condition. After 18 months, he had successfully
moved to his own flat, had been able to reduce his psychiatric
medication and had started a nursing diploma. This service, taking him
from hospital to independence in his own flat in 18 months, was
provided by successful joint working between the housing association,
the local authority and the NHS trust, with an estimated saving of
nearly £250,000 across the three services.</hs_para>

from 40% to 80% the percentage of patients who did not require a
continuing care package after this initial support. However, we
understand that in 
<?notus-xml column=184?>some parts of the country CCGs are expressing
reluctance to enter into joint funding schemes with local authorities
in case the health funding element is leaked into other council
services, given their budget situations—literally, I suppose,

amendments, the noble Lord, Lord Best, brings to the attention of the
Committee the important role that housing plays in both care and
support, and as a determinant of well-being. I have listened with
care to the powerful contributions in support of them. Having
done so, I begin with an observation that I hope is incontrovertible,
which is that simply having a roof over your head will have a profound
impact on your well-being. Having access to suitable housing for those
with care and support needs plays a vital role in promoting not
only their well-being, but their independence. The noble Lord, Lord
Best, brought this point home very well. Properly taking into account
the suitability of someone’s living accommodation could, for
example, help to prevent a frail older person from falling and thus
suffering the pain and trauma of broken bones and an unnecessary stay
in hospital, the need for a greater level of care and support following
discharge, and the costs of this to the public purse. It is
vital that the system actively works to promote independence rather
than waiting for people to reach a crisis
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000170">To

fund organisations to smooth the difficult process of moving house for
older people whose homes have become unsuitable. In going further,

north-west of England, an initiative at Whiston Hospital arranges for
adaptations to be made to an older person’s home, ensuring a
safe and timely discharge after a fall or injury. With that in mind, my

Lady Wheeler. She is right that there is anxiety about funds leaking
out into wider local authority budgets. We believe that the arrangement
we have proposed, whereby local services will have to demonstrate that
the money they are going to receive will directly benefit the patient
or service user in terms of their health or social care needs, will
ensure that there is no leakage in that sense. By including within that

most frequent causes of people having to go into hospital and of their
homes being found totally inadequate was the fact that a central
heating system that was 15 or 20 years old had fallen apart, and they
did not have the wherewithal or the knowledge to replace it with a new
boiler because that would involve a few thousand pounds. That one

I would be comforted by the very full exposition that he gave of how
there is the implication in so many places in the Bill that housing
should be taken on board. I am sure that it is the intent of government
that housing should be there; it is just a shame that it is so well
hidden from so many of us. Although using the spending review’s
£3.8 billion as a ring-fenced sum will require people to be more
joined-up, including in relation to disabled facilities grants, and
although the legal basis is no doubt in the Bill, it would be helpful
if that was more overt and the Bill could make it a little clearer. We
may want to return to this matter when we have heard about the compact

Clause 6(6) specifies the relevant partners of local
authorities, including county and district councils, each
NHS body, the police, prison and probation authorities and others
specified in regulations. Amendment 87ZB would ensure explicit
reference in the Bill to the providers of services being the relevant
partner—that is, those which have been commissioned by the
authority to provide care and support or other services as part of the
individual’s care plan. Subjecting such providers to the
same duty to co-operate as other bodies and services specified in this
clause will improve accountability and bolster safeguarding and have a
major impact in cases where someone has experienced, or is at risk of
experiencing, abuse or neglect. We know all too well that, in a number
of prominent cases, providers have blocked or impeded safeguarding
proceedings by failing to co-operate on request. The refusal of
Winterbourne View providers to share information for the serious case
review is a stark and serious example of failure to be held accountable

the point of view of long-term health needs, if you talk to patients

conditions and their carers are completely new to the social care
system, and discharge takes place into an unknown world of agency and
voluntary sector providers of services and equipment, and primary and
community care involvement. The good practice examples, where patients
and carers are involved in and understand the homecare plan, meet the
people who are going to help to deliver it and have a full picture of
how GP and other community services will support them, stand out.

hospital longer partly for the same reason: that no plan has emerged to
look after them when they come out. It is very bad for them to be in

provision. In education, we all talk about added value. That concept
has a place in hospitals. What will be the added value that will allow
a proper discharge and will, in that process of discharge, ensure that
the patient in question will not return early to hospital? That is the
second reason for supporting the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady
Greengross. The research that I have seen indicates that where
inadequate care is provided—that includes care plans not made at
the point of discharge—the individual is many times more likely
to find themselves back in hospital within the month. It so happens
that I have seen research related to intensive care units, where you
might expect that to be even more prevalent, but it applies across the
board. To be sure that the care is right is to be sure that the care
plan is right. My argument in supporting these amendments is that that
has to include an assessment at the beginning. It helps, too, when a
patient is moved to another more specialised hospital. That happens
quite often as the investigations take place, so there is a great need
for

Barker:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to speak to Amendment 82A, which
is in my name in this group, and to support the amendments in the name
of the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross. For well over a decade, we have
had evidence that the recovery rates for people being discharged from
hospital during the week, through to people being discharged on Friday,
vary enormously. There has been evidence in abundance for the past
decade that the failure to integrate care plans for people leaving
hospital with community services leads to their readmission into
hospital as an emergency—and in some cases, to their death. All
the factors that contribute to that should not be news to anyone who
has ever read about delayed discharge.</hs_para>

failure to really look after older people who go in and out of hospital
is not just the failure to carry out assessments at the proper time but

<?notus-xml column=193?>the failure to share that information with all the
relevant people along a care pathway. It has been interesting,
particularly over the past year, to begin seeing something of a change
taking place both in health and social care. One of the driving factors
behind that are the shared outcomes frameworks to which health, adult
social care and mental health now have to work. The fact that we have
the five overarching domains and that each of them is working to
performance indicators below them is beginning to have a real
influence, not just on high-level strategic planning but on front-line
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T17:17:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that there have been excellent examples of integrated care. Where care
works well, it works fantastically well and where it does not, it is
just a disaster. The trouble is that we can never really pinpoint and
identify where that will happen, other than that the systems that work
well are always those which have the patients at their heart, involved
in the planning process as well as being recipients of
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000212">My
Amendment 82A is prompted, as I think noble Lords will know from last
week, by the Christian Scientists—the people who, as part of
their belief system, wish it to be known that their care should not
involve medical treatment because that is incompatible with their
beliefs. Beyond that small group of people, whose beliefs I do not
share, it is important to register in all this that when we are
building systems that assess the needs of older people there has to be
within them a point at which older people can dissent, particularly if
quite forceful medical decisions are being made about their care.
Sometimes we get incredibly enthusiastic in our support of doctors and
manage to let that take things over completely.</hs_para>

Lady Greengross, has highlighted the key points that we need to focus
on because, at the end of the day, integration depends entirely on
all the different care providers in the pathway working to
common information. If we cannot start now to develop those systems, we
will not achieve what has proved for so long to be that elusive
solution to integrated care.</hs_para>

Wall of New Barnet:</Member></B> My Lords, I also support all these
amendments, particularly in relation to the previous discussion of
getting older people out of beds that they are blocking, as I think the
noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, put it. That is perhaps an
inappropriate word but, in reality, those are the facts. The care plan
that everybody has talked about is important, and hugely effective when
it works. I have to admit that in my own hospital—I declare my
interest as chair of Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals Trust—it
does not always work. Very often, the breakdown with the local
authority can come from the start of the agreement on a care
plan—what will happen to the individual, how many X-rays they
will have, where they will go at the end and so
on.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070989000215" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000215">One of
the good things in the new system—there are several—is
the CCGs. The relationship between clinical commissioning groups and
local authorities is proving, in the very short time that it has been
working in my area, effective. The more pressure on commissioners in
terms of getting hospitals running better, the more interest they have
in making sure that local authorities 
<?notus-xml column=194?>are doing their bit as well. That partnership, in
my view and my experience of the past months, has been
working much better, which, for us, is a very good

I have been listening to people give evidence to the APPG on
Parkinson’s, which I chair and which has been conducting an
inquiry into NHS continuing care. Listening to the witnesses, it has
become very clear that there are often lots of problems with the health
service and social care services arguing over funding. People are
having difficulty accessing continuing care under the NHS and have to
get over lots of barriers. It is quite heartbreaking to hear the
problems that people are
having.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000218">The
wording of Clause 22 still carries a potential risk for those who
self-fund their care. There are various provisions in the clause that
allow local authorities to arrange for health services that should be
provided by the NHS. Once councils start delivering healthcare, when
they traditionally used to deliver means-tested and chargeable social
care, there is a risk that someone—somewhere in the
system—will mistakenly conclude that the council can charge for
those services.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T17:22:56"></hs_TimeCode> is a need
to ensure that self-funders are not exposed if they are found to be
eligible for NHS continuing care, or registered nursing care, and the
package of delivery is with the local authority. These matters were

been

legal terms, local authorities are prohibited from providing anything
authorised or required to be provided under the NHS Acts. This means
that social services cannot provide care home accommodation if a power
or a duty to provide the accommodation exists under any of the NHS
Acts. Clause 22 has narrowed this down to just
“required”, for example by omitting the
“power” or authorisation provision. That leaves local
authorities able to provide accommodation that the NHS has a power to
provide. I believe that disputes and confusion have occurred between
councils and the NHS over continuing care, and this seems to be a
recipe for more. The Bill should be amended to prohibit local
authorities providing a service or facility that is authorised
or required to be provided under the NHS Act
2006.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000220" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000220">My

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, it is vital that care and support, health
and other services are joined up, as this offers the potential to make
measurable improvements in individuals’ outcomes and experiences
of care and support. Clause 3 places a duty on local authorities to
carry out their care and support functions with the aim of integrating
services with those provided by the NHS or other health-related
services such as housing.
Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T17:26:26"></hs_TimeCode> 81C,
tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Wheeler, raises the issue of
co-operation duties on the NHS; I have no issue with that sentiment.
Clause 3 is intended to reflect the similar integration duties placed
on NHS England by Section 13N, and on clinical commissioning groups by
Section 14Z1 of the National Health Service Act 2006, in the context of
this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000224" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0001.htm#13070989000224">Clause 6

22 sets out the limits on what a local authority may provide by way of

prohibitions on what a local authority may provide by way of
healthcare, which are imposed under Sections 21 and 29 of
the National Assistance Act 1948 and Section 49 of the Health and
Social Care Act 2001. This is a matter eloquently raised by

is therefore to simplify the language and to make the boundary clearer

Meacher:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 82B has the effect of
requiring local authorities not only to provide information about the
system of care and support, how to access it and so forth, but also to
take action to facilitate access to that information; that is, to try
to make sure that people know it is available. My remarks also apply to
Amendment 86C, to which I have added my name, which requires that the
local authority must produce or arrange for the production of packs of
information relevant to the needs of individuals with specific medical
conditions and ensure that these packs are provided to individuals
following the diagnosis of a specific
condition—not waiting until much later on, when they
probably need social care or other intervention.</hs_para>

I apologise to the Minister and to your Lordships that I was unable to

is from a Department of Health document; perhaps other noble Lords have
quoted it before me, in which case I apologise. The point is that if
people are unaware that information and advice are available, they are
unlikely to look for them. We can assume that if these amendments are
not accepted by the Government, there will be considerable underuse of
information services and, of course, that the people who will lose out

Alzheimer’s Society tells me that it frequently hears of the
difficulties people face when struggling through the complexities of
the health and social care system for the very first time. Too often,
people with dementia and their carers report that they did not have
access to the information and advice they needed because they simply
did not know it was available. We all know that feeling: if only we had
known that it was available, we would have looked for it, whatever it
was. Sadly, people often come across services by chance and far too
late.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#13070989000243">If a
person in the early stages of Alzheimer’s is aware of
a memory clinic, for example, which can either provide help itself or
refer the client on to organisations such as the Alzheimer’s

for as long as possible in their own homes. These are simple things
like putting a note on the front door that says, “Are your keys
in your pocket?”, and suchlike. With guidance, carers can
gradually increase the home adjustments as they notice the need for
them and thus defer the need for the involvement of social services and

Government have incorporated a key element of the Joint
Committee’s report into the Bill, namely that it is part of a
local authority’s duty to establish and maintain the service for
providing people in its area with information and advice. We must make
sure that advice relating to care and support includes information
about access to regulated independent financial

cost of care fees which, as we know, will be repaid after the
individual’s
death<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T17:43:34"></hs_TimeCode>. As has
been said, however, individuals offered these products may be highly
vulnerable. They expect the same authority to assess fairly both their
eligibility for care and their ability to fund it, as well as providing

competition to FCA-regulated financial products, so, obviously, there
is a potential conflict of interest here. This conflict is exacerbated
if the care for which the loan is made is directly provided by the
local authority and if the level of charges and interest are also
determined by the local authority. It is therefore very important that
people are directed towards regulated financial advice as part of the
decision-making process. This amendment seeks to do that through
regulated, accredited financial advisers such as the people who are
members of SOLLA, the Society of Later Life Advisers. Only in that way
can the development of safe and secure financial products be

stated that where a person has complex or multiple needs, a
proportionate assessment would require an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of those needs—something which we have already heard
about this afternoon. Defining complex needs can be difficult, with the
full extent of needs not always immediately identifiable. For instance,
older people in particular do not always present their needs accurately

the findings of the post-legislative scrutiny committee on the Act, but
I will explain why I felt it necessary to propose a new clause in the

right to advocacy is essential to enable the people who find it hardest
to communicate to exercise their rights, represent their interests and
obtain the services they need. Clearly, if somebody is deemed not to
have capacity, there is already statutory provision for an IMCA to
assist them with decision-making. However, it is also vital that those
who experience substantial difficulty in understanding, retaining,
using or weighing information relevant to an assessment, and then
expressing and communicating their views, should also have access to an
advocate. I referred just now to autism. People on the autistic
spectrum might be deemed to have capacity but their disability might
mean that they would have difficulty on their own, without the help of
an advocate to explain and help them work through the decision-making
process. That group is not adequately covered by the provisions of the
Mental Capacity
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000260" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#13070989000260">Advocacy
is separate from information and advice. It provides support to some of
those who are most vulnerable and most in need of services,
including those with autism. There was a recent commission
on autism and ageing chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross.
Both she and I have had to forfeit the presentation of that report to
be here in the Chamber. The report found that the families of people
with autism frequently act as their advocates. Ninety-six per cent of
parents with a son or daughter with autism recently told a National
Autistic Society survey that they were concerned about what would
happen when they passed away or were unable to support their children.
This fear is common to parents of people with many different lifelong
disabilities, not just autism. Families frequently say how worried they
are about what will happen when they can no longer perform an advocacy
role, and that independent advocates must therefore be
available.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000261" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#13070989000261">If

six amendments in this group are Amendments 83B, 83C, 86B, 86D, 86F and
86G. Before I turn to them, I will say a few words more generally about
advice and the Bill. If the Bill is to do the job we all hope and
expect it will do, information and advice should be not just an add-on
but a central requirement, without which the Government’s plans,
however well meaning, will collapse, and old people and their families
will end up frustrated and angry. This is for several reasons. First,
there is a widespread reluctance among old people and their families to
face up to the problems of care in old age: how to get it, whether to
be cared for at home or in a home, and how to pay for it. It is
marvellous that people are living ever longer, but that does not mean
that the very last years of their life are easy. Not surprisingly,
people do not like to contemplate the years before their demise until
they feel they absolutely have
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000264" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#13070989000264">Secondly,
there is an extraordinary ignorance among older people and their
families about social care. More than one person in two still thinks
that the state will pay in full for the care that they will require.
Thirdly—it is early days, I know—there is even less
understanding of Andrew Dilnot’s solution. For example, many
people—I have even come across a few in this House—think
that once you have spent £72,000 on care, you will be looked
after for free. This is not so. You will have to fund hotel costs of
£12,000 a year. More importantly, you will have to fund the
excess care costs over what a local authority would pay to look after
you. That could cost a further £25,000 a year. If my arithmetic
still works, that means many people will have to pay £37,000 a
year after the cap has been reached, so they should plan for
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000265" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#13070989000265">Different
people in different situations need different advice. Somebody
whose care costs are paid in full needs different advice from somebody
on the means test. Whatever their circumstances, very few people are
capable of navigating these waters without a trusted pilot or pilots.
Local authorities are experienced in conducting assessments of people
and in helping them. The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, made this
point well. They have interests that may be different from, or even
conflict with, those of the people they are advising. For
example, under the existing deferred payment scheme you do not have to
sell your house but can take out an interest-free loan. It is evident
from the figures that many local authorities try like mad to persuade
people not to go down that road because it costs the authority a lot of
money if they do. Even if it would be beneficial to the
individual, they steer them away. It is human nature. That is why it is
vital that when advice is needed on this kind of subject, it should be
independent of the local
authority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T17:58:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000266" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#13070989000266"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Browning" PimsId="5795" UID="13070989000839" xid="2065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#13070989000839">Baroness

that is rarely mentioned but is often a solution for many elderly

Lipsey:</Member></B> I quite agree with the noble Baroness. That is

this underlines the fact that it is crucial that the advice comes from
people who are qualified to give it—not necessarily local
authority social workers, CAB advisers, regulated independent financial
advisers and so on. Nor is it any good the local authority just handing
out a list of people and saying, “You can go and see them and
ask their advice”. For one thing, frequently there are issues of
mental capacity, and the stress on an old person at this time is likely
to be severe, particularly if they are thinking of going into a care
home. For another, there is the general reluctance problem, and people
are also often frightened by the cost of the independent financial
advice that they may be
seeking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070989000269" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#13070989000269">Some
local authorities in these circumstances are performing heroically. I
recently opened a centre in West Sussex which combines the resources of
voluntary organisations, the local authority and independent financial
advisers to offer a comprehensive service. It has recently relaunched
its service and a local radio station, Spirit FM 96.6, has featured it
in its drive time programme every weekday, which is tremendous.
Incidentally, in doing this, the local authority is not acting wholly
selflessly. Many people in West Sussex who have moved out of London to
retire have quite a bit of resources but do not have infinite
resources. If they are not well advised on how to use their resources
they will run out of money and fall back on the council and its
means-tested benefits to pay for their care. However, if they are
properly supported, learn to use their money well and are advised of
the products that are available to help them, they will not fall back
on the local authority. So this, again, is a case where appropriate
advice, properly structured, can save public money, not cost
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T17:29:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

grave problem is that the qualifications required of an independent

knowledge behind them. Those who have the SOLLA qualification—I

regulation in others, but I do not have a dogmatic view as to which is

advice about their options, particularly self-funders. This is advice
provided by properly regulated professionals and needs to take account
of welfare benefits, pensions and all other sources of financial
support available to the individual. The amendments also insist on
local authorities not only providing the list—this deals with a
point I made earlier—but on pointing people towards the adviser

there is still a risk that fear of the costs will prevent people from
taking financial advice. Moreover, it is slightly odd that this, which

conclude where I started. We cannot exaggerate the importance of this

holistic way that is so essential to care. If we do not crack this

listen on this because they have said so repeatedly—and nail
down a system which can provide that holistic advice, this marvellously

decisions that most people make under the terms of the Bill will be
some of the most important that they will ever make and it is obviously
critical that people are able to make them on the basis of proper and

will inevitably be a high degree of uncertainty about how to choose and
about the detailed implications of those choices. People will need
guidance in deciding which, probably complicated, financial product to
buy. This is no less true for these products than for any complex
financial product, with the added emphasis that a wrong or
inappropriate choice could have pretty unattractive consequences. That
is why I strongly support the proposal to introduce regulated financial
advice into the process, as the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady
Greengross, seek to do. Only with this kind of advice can people have
some comfort that they are making the correct choices in a complex and
difficult
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000004">My
amendment in this group, Amendment 86E, also deals with the information

Clause 4(3) simply
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="130709112000336" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000336">“In

sufficiency at Second Reading, when I said that there appeared to be no
test for it. There is no provision in the Bill for local authorities to
have a mechanism for measuring and reporting the success of their
efforts in providing information or on the success of that information
in achieving its objectives. My amendment is intended to address those
concerns. In particular, it would remove the phrase “seek
to”, so that instead of local authorities having to seek to
ensure that the information they provide is sufficient, they simply
must ensure that it is sufficient. The phrase “seek to”
seems to me to weaken the obligation placed on local authorities quite
unnecessarily. It is quite possible that any local authority could
demonstrate that it was seeking to do something without actually doing
very much at all. Arguably, for example, the slow and gradual
implementation of a plan to provide information would fulfil the local
authority’s
obligation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000006">I
am sure that that is not what the Government had in mind or what local
authorities would really want to do. In that case, I see no
merit in having local authorities’ obligations significantly
weakened by the use of the phrase “seek to”. My amendment
would remove this phrase and give the local authorities a clear,
simple, plain-English duty to ensure that the specified information is
sufficient for the purposes set out in the Bill. If it is possible to
have a measure of sufficiency, as I believe it is, it is surely
possible to ensure sufficiency rather than just seeking to ensure it.
Again, in plain English—or in fairly plain English—the
situation is this: we want local authorities to make the
information that they must provide by virtue of subsections (1) and (2)
of Clause 4 sufficient for the purposes set out in Clause 4(3)(a) and
(b). We want them actually to do this, not just seek to do
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000007">That
brings me to the notion of what “sufficient” may mean and
what tests might apply. My amendment would qualify
“sufficient” by inserting the word
“demonstrably” before it. I can probably guess what my
noble friend the Minister will say about the use of the word
“demonstrably”. He will probably ask, 
<?notus-xml column=207?>“Demonstrable to whom?” and,
“Demonstrable according to what criteria?”. The phrase
“demonstrably sufficient” has a clear meaning in the
context of Clause 4(3)(a) and (b). It means simply that local
authorities will have to be able to show evidence that the information
they provide actually does enable adults to identify matters that are
or might be relevant to their personal financial position that could be
affected by the system provided for in Part 1. It also means that local
authorities will have to be able to show that the information they
provide does enable adults to make plans for meeting needs for care and
support that might
arise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000008">Commercial
organisations routinely apply this kind of test to the information they
put out. It is not difficult, time-consuming or expensive to do. Doing
it would have the merit of providing a real test of the meaning of
sufficiency and a mechanism for reporting success in delivering it. I
believe that this is what the Government and local authorities want.
Using the phrase “demonstrably sufficient” provides for
that.</hs_para><hs_time UID="130709112000355" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000355">6.15

briefly to Amendment 86H, to which I have put my name, along with the
noble Baroness, Lady Browning. Social workers on the whole do not get a
good press. They are heard of only when things go wrong. Most of the
time the vast amounts of quiet, patient work that is carried out by
social workers in local authorities, the NHS and the voluntary sector
is ignored. We should give their skills and the vital contribution that
they make to help people find their way around complex systems more
recognition. The noble Baroness made it clear that she is suggesting
that a social worker needs to be involved not in all cases, but just
when present and foreseeable needs are classed as complex. In those
cases we must take into account that people’s ability to take in
information is tremendously variable, depending on their situation and
state of mind at the time. I have lost count of the number of
conversations I have had with service users and carers who are totally
bemused by the information they are given or the access that they have
even when they manage to get hold of some
information.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000011">I
will never forget the carer who gave me a wonderful illustration some
years ago. She said, “I feel as though somewhere out there is a
great mushroom of information. If I could just find my way up the stem,
I’d find out where all this information is, and it would help
me. But I don’t even know where the stem begins, and nobody
seems to be able to help me”. Information in its raw state is
often very difficult to interpret. It is the skill of the social worker
in assessing what information is needed, when and in what form it is
needed in complex cases, and signposting the information and advice
that is required in every case. Those particularly complex cases need
social worker involvement. Such cases are 
<?notus-xml column=208?>not being met and will be even less well met in the

that I chair the APPG on Parkinson’s and that we are currently
conducting an inquiry into NHS continuing care. Continuing care is a
package of care that is arranged and funded by the NHS and is free of
charge to the person receiving it. The decision for eligibility
rests not on a person’s condition but on whether the need for
care is primarily due to health needs. While there are just over 57,000
people in receipt of NHS continuing care in England, it is unknown how
many people may actually be eligible in law and have not even applied
for it, or who have failed in their attempts to be assessed properly
for it. As part of the inquiry into NHS continuing care, I have been
hearing from people about their real problems in accessing NHS
continuing care. We found during our inquiry that people with
Parkinson’s and other long-term conditions are not given
information about NHS continuing care. The impression that I have been
given is that, because it will cost the NHS considerably, people are
not encouraged to apply for it. This leaves people with no option but
to go to the means-tested social care system to have their health needs
met. That situation is entirely
unacceptable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000014">As
Clause 4 introduces a duty on local authorities to establish and
maintain an information and advice service, it is important that all
the appropriate information and advice are provided. With the further
integration of health and social care, it is essential that individuals
are in full possession of the facts about all aspects of the support to
which they are entitled. While the list currently provides some crucial
aspects for people receiving care and support, I believe that NHS
continuing care is a glaring omission. We hear of the two services
arguing the differences between what is a health need, which is free at
the point of use, and what is a social need, which is currently charged
to the individual. This can often lead to the individual either being
forced unnecessarily to pay for their own care while the debate goes on
or being left trapped in their hospital bed. Although NHS continuing
care is part of the health system, it must be included in the
list provided by the local authorities as set out in Clause 4. People
who may be eligible for NHS continuing care are also likely to have
such needs that they could be in receipt of support provided by their
local authority. If their needs change so as to render them
eligible for NHS continuing care, there should be a seamless

read this policy, it seemed to me that it reflected the practice of

years. I am not sure that that model of information and advice giving
is sustainable. It has depended largely on local bodies, many of which
are in the voluntary sector and extremely professional in their
services, but which provide a lot of generic, low-level advice. I do
not think that that is sustainable—I was going to say in the
longer term but, given the way that local authority budgets are going
to have to decrease by a third by 2015, I do not think that this is
sustainable in the short term either.</hs_para>

increasingly be a move towards providing information digitally. New
organisations and new social enterprises, such as IncomeMAX, are
already heading down that path, and a number of local authorities are
increasingly turning much of their provision over to that way of doing
things. That is fine for people who are very well informed and who can
access information in that format. What I cannot see is a sustainable
funding model for the sort of high-level, complex financial advice that
the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, was talking about. This is necessary when
people need to be enabled to go through the process of making decisions
about, let us face it, the biggest asset that they have, which is their

over the past three or four years since Andrew Dilnot first appeared on
our horizons, I have attended many seminars and lectures where people
have tried to work their way around this problem. Two things strike me
as being important. First, we cannot lay all the obligations on local
authorities alone. At least in part, the NHS has to realise that it has
to fund information and advice as part of the overall health and
well-being package. I freely admit that I have yet to come across
people in the NHS who truly understand the basic importance to health
of information and advice. One of the first things that the department
and the Government could do is to work on how we explain to
commissioners in the health service why the outputs of information and
advice services are important to them.</hs_para>

know—the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and I know very
well—that if you ask a group of older people who have assets
what is 
<?notus-xml column=210?>the number one thing that they want, they say that they want independent
financial advice. They do not believe that the people who sell them
products are independent. They are right not to do so. That is a
problem for the providers of those products. The only way of getting
around this that might work is if, in future, some of those products
have an element of money within them that is somehow passed into a
pooled fund of money that comes from the private and statutory sectors
and which can be put towards the provision of independent advice. That
is not a worked-out idea, but it contains within it something of the
ideas that the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, mentioned, which are
the key points in all of this. She is right that there is a need for
regulated advice. I am not quite sure at which point a person needs
that. Is that regulated advice something that they need before they
come to a decision about which financial product to choose? The law
that governs the regulations that exist at the moment usually comes
into play when somebody decides to buy a particular product, so there
is a real problem about when people have access to the right type of
advice. The noble Baroness is on absolutely the right track. Somehow,
in all of this, we need to arrive at a point at which resources are
spent by people with the right knowledge and the right degree of
independence to enable them to come to the right
decisions.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_09_PT_1/E6FEF6B6FF1DA99771E67294868E9188BDE1FAEF" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 July 2013">Tuesday,

vulnerable adults such as people with learning disabilities. They may
benefit from specialist facilitation to access such information. I
should say that I chair a social enterprise which makes information on
health and social care issues easier to understand for people who find

Clause 22, as the boundary between health and social care, is
vital.</hs_para>

would have thought—I may be wrong and obviously the noble
Baroness will correct me—that it ought to be the general
practitioner who advises a patient as to 
<?notus-xml column=212?>whether they need continuing NHS care. During our
deliberations in the Joint Committee there was quite a lot of
discussion about the question of continuing NHS care, and it is obvious
that there is some conflict of interest. The local authority providing
the care may wish to have it provided by the NHS since that would be
free and not its responsibility, so the boundary between the NHS and
local authorities is particularly relevant in this
connection.</hs_para>

the moment, I do not see how it can be for the patient to claim
continuing NHS care. The GP should be able to say to the patient that
they need it and that should be sufficient for it to be provided. The
likelihood is that a patient would have great difficulty in assessing
for himself or herself whether continuing healthcare was needed, so it
must be a matter for professional advice. I think that the advice that
we are talking about in this context is advice about local authority
services, not about the services that the NHS can provide. However, as
I say, the boundary between the two is vitally important. I hope that
the point made so eloquently by the noble Baroness, Lady Gale, arising
from her own inquiry, will be looked at with a considerable degree of
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:35:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Greengross:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope that noble Lords will forgive
me, but I forgot to speak to one of the amendments that is relevant to
this group; that is, Amendment 86C. It is about people with dementia
who have had a diagnosis. I know that the noble Earl will share the
Prime Minister’s view and those of all of us who have
looked at the number of people who receive a diagnosis of dementia. We
now want to ensure that many more are diagnosed, and diagnosed

there are many reports that people diagnosed with dementia and their
carers feel terribly abandoned after they have had the diagnosis. The
Bill’s emphasis on access to prevention services and information
and advice for people, particularly if their needs have not yet reached
the threshold of eligibility for social care, is welcome. But
there are no specific prompts to ensure that people receive the
information they need at the time when it is most useful. The
risk is that although local authorities have set up information and
advice services, the information does not reach people at the right
time. A post-diagnosis information pack tailored to specific long-term
conditions should be given to every individual who is diagnosed with
one of those conditions. It would provide access to tailored
information about the support that is available to them, and it would
enable them to cope with the challenges of living with a long-term
condition. The pack would provide information on the likely impacts of
dementia and contain core information on national and local services. I
think that this would be an important aspect of providing the right
information and advice at the right

noble Baroness, Lady Barker, anticipated precisely the point I was
going to make, which is that this is not just a matter for local
authorities. My principal reservation about these amendments, if I have
one, is that it looks as though the entire burden of information and
advice is to be placed on local authorities whereas of course, as the
noble Baroness rightly said, there are other potential partners who
clearly need to be involved. I scribbled on the grid that is helpfully
provided by those who support the Front Bench on this side the words
“in collaboration with”, and then I thought of a number
of potential partners. Of course the health service is one of them, but
in addition I would suggest that the Court of Protection needs to be
involved. It has a supervisory and supportive responsibility for a
particular group of people and, with the development of lasting powers
of attorney and so on, their deputies as well. I have to say—I
have said it before and I will say it again—that I am not
convinced that the Court of Protection is doing a terrific job in this
area, but that is another reason why it should be looked at as a

partners. For example, in the case of younger people perhaps with a
learning or other disability, there are roles for those involved in
further education, the Department for Work and Pensions and the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Those bodies might look
at their role in terms of what is available by way of education,

Browning:</Member></B> It is important that qualified social workers
are present for the initial assessment. One of the things that might
come out of our scrutiny of the existing Mental Capacity Act is the
fact that the assessment of capacity requires professionals. Social
workers clearly have a part to play in that. Whether the person has
capacity, partial capacity or no capacity at all, at that point some
advice is given and direction is needed. It seems to me that that is

Beecham:</Member></B> That is absolutely true. Neither is the provision
of information and advice. However, it is not necessarily the
role of a professionally qualified social worker or a professionally
qualified health visitor or other person. I agree—it is a point
that the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and I both made—that both
sides, health and social work, must collaborate on this. It is perhaps
the wording of the amendment, rather than the intention, that might be
looked
at<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:44:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000045">There
is a question about how best to proceed with the publicity that should
follow the enactment of this legislation. The Joint Committee advised
that the Government should work with all interested providers to launch
a campaign to raise awareness of and support for the change. I hope
that the noble Earl will confirm that that is the Government’s
intention and bring us up to date on where the Government
stands.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000046">In
the context of such a radical change, it might be desirable for there
to be some pilots on the ground about this issue of information and
advice, working in collaboration with the Local Government Association,
the NHS Confederation and other major national partners, to look at how
these matters can best be explained. There could also be, at a fairly
early stage, some examination of good practice. I am not suggesting
that the whole scheme be piloted but that in a few areas, after a
relatively short period, there might be a process of peer review and an
examination of how it is working on the ground. Given that local
authorities retain their scrutiny role for health and social care, it
would be worth while developing with the Centre for Public Scrutiny,
the LGA and relevant health service bodies, a way for the new system to
be subjected to useful scrutiny at local level, and for lessons
learnt to be disseminated across the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:47:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000047">There
are questions about the advocacy role. There is clearly a case for
advocacy being included. One notes that there is a glancing reference
in Clause 8, which is the reason for the stand part debate. It looks a
little odd situated between Clause 4 and Clauses 18 and 20, as it does
not seem to relate specifically to either. It has been mischievously
suggested that there 
<?notus-xml column=215?>might have been references to advocacy in other
parts of the Bill at an earlier stage that were removed and this was
left behind. Can the noble Earl indicate the Government’s
intention in referring to advocacy in that particular clause? We are
not intending to move that the clause should not remain in the Bill;
this is purely a
probe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000048">We see
most of these amendments as contributing to a refinement of the
Bill’s proposals and we welcome that. However, it is necessary
to reiterate the need for caution about the role of local authorities,
particularly in the context of the financial situation that they are
facing, which will get worse under a very tight regime. The Government
are making provision for this, but we must be careful that the sum is
not divvied up across a range of things without seeing the whole
picture. If we are to give priority to this issue of information and
advice, it would be helpful if the relevant departments, together with
the Local Government Association, could look at the real cost of this
and ensure that it is identified and included within the total package.
It is easy to add desirable things against a budget. We do not know the
extent to which these matters have been costed, for example, in the sum
that the Government have allocated. We know that the demand is
constantly rising, partly as a result of demographic change, and that
the costs are also inexorably rising. This will be a cost. It is a
justifiable cost, but it needs to be identified, provided for and kept
under
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000049">Having
said that, we are very much in sympathy with the thrust of these
amendments and we look forward to the Minister’s reply and to
working with others of your Lordships’ House in ensuring that
the Bill is capable of delivering what it sets out to deliver and that
all relevant players are engaged and financed adequately, so that we
can afford the best possible level of care to

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to noble Lords for
tabling these amendments, which highlight the importance of access to
good information and advice, including independent financial
advice and independent advocacy, for those who have care and support
needs or are planning how to meet future care and support
needs.</hs_para>

Amendment 82B, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher,
Amendment 86E, in the name of my noble friend Lord Sharkey,
and Amendment 86F, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. Clause 4
introduces a general duty to make a universal information and advice
service available to everyone in the local community. I say to my noble
friend Lord Sharkey in particular that we are clear that the
information and advice service must be accessible to all, whether they
fund their own care or get some care and support paid for by the local
authority, and in order to fulfil its duty the local authority will
need to facilitate access. The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, raised the
issue of early information and advice about Alzheimer’s in
particular; this will be one of the vital areas that the services
should cover.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130709112000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000052">The clause deals
broadly with what the information and advice service must cover.
Subsection (2) sets out the essential requirements for the service
but— 
<?notus-xml column=216?>intentionally—this is not a definitive list. With regard to
Amendments 86B and 86H, subject to specific qualifications, it will be
for local authorities to determine the precise scope and manner of the
information and advice that they offer. We expect many authorities to
offer access to independent sources of information and advice, working
together locally with the voluntary, not-for-profit and private
sectors. We set out our expectations and additional funding for local
authorities, which rises to £50 million a year by 2017-18, in
the <I>Caring for Our Future</I> White
Paper.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000053">I
would say to my noble friend Lady Browning that some authorities have
also used qualified social care staff as the first point of contact and
have found that this can be effective, efficient and timely, helping
people to the care and support that will help them most. Others have
provided a first point of access to information through more general
services, which connect information and advice on a wider range of
local authority responsibilities as well as local NHS
provision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000054">I
emphasise that statutory guidance will cover how information and advice
can be provided in an accessible way and be proportionate to the needs
of those for whom it is provided. My noble friend Lord Sharkey
expressed doubts about the phrase “seek to” and suggested
that it was rather too weak. Statutory guidance will set out the clear
expectations of what the local authority’s service should cover
or what it should seek to do in order to ensure that the information
and advice is sufficient.</hs_para>

Browning asked about the number of social workers. More than 1.6
million people are employed in the social care sector, including
200,000 social workers. We do not set out any national targets but we
recognise the need to improve skills, capacity and retention. We are
working with stakeholders, including the National Skills Academy for
Social Care and Skills for Care, to produce new national minimum
training standards, which will further raise standards and encourage
new people to enter the sector. My noble friend referred to my letter
of 27 June. I confirm that this referred to Health Education England.
Health Education England’s remit does not extend to social care;
it covers health and public
health.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000056">Amendments
83ZA and 86A, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Gale, cover
information and advice on health-related areas and information to
people with specific medical conditions. As for many services, there
will be a need for the local authorities to work with NHS organisations
and more widely to provide focused information and advice to those who
would benefit from it. There are already good examples of how
information and advice services from a range of organisations can work
together with the health and well-being of the individual at heart.
Many use the national information provided by NHS Choices as a base. A
lot of local authorities are providing information and advice directly
to those who may have an entitlement to NHS continuing care. In
addition, regulations under the Bill will specify the circumstances in
which the local authority must refer the adult for an assessment for
NHS continuing care. We will of course work with interested
organisations to include such examples in statutory guidance.</hs_para>

to the amendments addressing access to regulated financial advice, the
noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, make
some excellent points about the importance of appropriate financial
advice for those who have or are planning for care and support needs.
This kind of advice may be particularly relevant to people who are
funding their own care and may include a financial adviser who is
regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, but there is no need for
the Bill to set this out specifically. There are other kinds of advice
that may be relevant to such people and, as I have mentioned, we think
it is important to maintain the general terms of Clause 4.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130709112000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000058">I take on board the
concern about the use of the term “independent financial
advice”—that this may cause some confusion with the
term’s general meaning within the financial industry and the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. We are happy to consider this
aspect in more detail to ensure that no confusion exists. However, we
do not believe that taking independent regulated advice should be
compulsory. Whether a person takes advantage of independent
advice is a matter of personal choice. This is particularly important
because some financial advice may be subject to a charge.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130709112000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000059">There will be
individual circumstances in which it will be appropriate to recommend
independent advice from a regulated financial adviser, such as when
people are planning to meet future care needs or when people go into
residential care and are weighing up financial options such as selling
the home. The fact that an organisation or individual is regulated is
in itself no guarantee that the person has knowledge or experience of
wider care and support issues; for example, housing or other
care-related options. All this makes the adult’s choice of an
adviser a vital aspect. The local authority should advise about the
importance of independent regulated advice and signpost the adult to
offer a choice of where they can obtain the best and most relevant
advice. Again, we intend to cover such issues in statutory
guidance.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130709112000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000060">We
will also shortly be consulting on the design and technical
implementation of the funding reforms, including deferred payments.
This will include how the new duties to signpost independent financial
advice will work. The noble Lord, Lord Beecham, asked about an
awareness campaign about the funding reforms themselves. We are
scheduled to discuss amendments on that very issue in a later group and
I hope that the noble Lord will be content for me to cover the issue at
that
point.</hs_para><hs_time UID="130709112000358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000358"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>7

turn to Clause 8. Noble Lords have noted that advocacy is referred to
explicitly in Clause 8 but not in Clause 4. That is not to say that
advocacy should not be considered within the scope of information and
advice in Clause 4—we are clear that it should be, and it is
provided for by reference to types of advice that are
“proportionate to the needs” of the
individual.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000062">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:00:08"></hs_TimeCode>,
Clause 4 sets out a general duty to make available an information and
advice service. Clause 8 relates to circumstances in which an
individual’s needs are being met. In our view, it is important
to clarify that, in such cases, advocacy should be considered as one
type of support to meet ongoing needs.</hs_para>

8 is located in the Bill specifically to set out examples of how to
meet needs, before provisions that begin the adult’s
“journey” through the care and support system. This is
intended to aid understanding and to make it clear that, before
undertaking assessments, local authorities should be aware of, and
consider, the breadth of types of support that they can provide to meet
needs.</hs_para>

name of my noble friend Lady Browning, focuses on access to an
independent advocate. The Bill is clear that, through the various
stages of what might be termed the “care
process”—the needs assessment, care and support plan and
any subsequent review—local authorities must involve the adult,
any carer and any person whom the adult asks to be involved.</hs_para>

Committee’s attention particularly to the fact that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:01:27"></hs_TimeCode> Bill sets
out specific requirements actively to involve people in these
processes, not just to “consult” them. Some people may
require help and support to be as actively involved as we would want
them to be. That might be through the actions and professionalism of
the social worker; it may be through the support of family or a
friend, or through the assistance of an independent peer or support
worker. For some, an independent advocate may be required to make this
a reality. I want to reassure noble Lords that we want to get this
right. I say to my noble friend Lady Browning that we have discussed
this issue with a number of voluntary organisations, including the Care
and Support Alliance and the National Autistic Society—to name
two—and we have committed to further joint work to assess which
groups of people might benefit from advocacy. That discussion will

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister very
much for setting out the Government’s revised approach to
curriculum reform. I am glad to hear that a number of the
representations that we have been making from the beginning have
finally been adopted by the Government. However, it has to said that it
has been a very bumpy ride. The consultation has contained all the
characteristics for which the Secretary of State has now become famous:
first set out an ideological master plan full of reforming zeal; then
rubbish anyone who raises concerns and questions, including educational
academics, teachers and parents; and, finally, carry out a series of
U-turns and admit that your critics might have been right all
along<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:11:05"></hs_TimeCode>. It is,
quite frankly, exhausting and a long way from the thoughtful, grown-up
national debate which should have been conducted from the outset, with
the shared intent of improving young people’s life
chances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:11:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000085">Nevertheless,
we have some areas of agreement. We always said that it was a mistake
to sideline speaking and listening skills in the teaching of English.
This point was echoed by many employers and so we are pleased to see
that this issue has now been addressed. We warned that the ICT
curriculum was not addressing the technology needs of employers. Again,
we are pleased that this has been updated. We welcomed the requirement
for foreign language education in primary schools, but warned that it
was unfair and divisive to limit the range of languages that could be
taught. We are relieved that the Government have finally seen the error
of their ways in this
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:12:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000086">We
argued strongly for citizenship to be included in the national
curriculum; for young people to understand the contribution that they
could make to the UK and 
<?notus-xml column=221?>as citizens of the world. We therefore welcome the
Government’s belated conversion to the importance of citizenship
education and the inclusion of human rights and international law at
key stage 4. We criticised the removal of climate change in the
geography curriculum, as we believe it is essential for an
understanding of physical, social and economic geography. We are
pleased that this has now been reinstated. Along with many eminent
historians, we raised concerns that the history curriculum was too UK
focused and lacked a world view. We are pleased that the programme has
now been
rebalanced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:12:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000087">However,
in this notable and welcome list of U-turns, a festering anomaly
remains, where the Government continue to ignore the best advice of
those dealing on the front line with child health, sex and relationship
issues. All the reasons why the teaching of other subjects should be
spelt out in the national curriculum apply equally to PSHE, yet the
Government seem determined to run away from their responsibilities on
this issue. I hope the noble Lord, even at this late stage, will commit
to reflecting further on this issue before a final decision is
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:13:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000088">Despite
these welcome improvements, we still have a number of concerns about
the proposals. First and fundamentally, the Government have underpinned
all their proposals with a belief that education should be based on
rote learning at the expense of developing young people who can
problem-solve, think for themselves, be creative and work
collaboratively. Young people need knowledge, skills and resilience.
Can the Minister clarify whether he agrees that we need to reject the
false choices that pitch knowledge versus skills and that we need to
foster a more holistic approach in
education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:14:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000089">Secondly,
the new curriculum will apply to fewer than half of the secondary
schools. If academies have the freedom to innovate, does that freedom
not make sense for maintained schools as well? Does the Minister have a
plan for addressing these contradictions?</hs_para>

the timing of the proposals and the implementation date of September
2014 put schools under enormous pressure to be ready for the changes,
including having to provide the old and new curriculum in tandem for
some age groups. Does the Minister recognise that many teachers felt
ignored and ridiculed by the consultation process and morale is at an
all-time low? Can he explain what professional development and
resources will be made available to teachers to help them manage this
transition? Does he accept that the presence of unqualified teachers in
the classroom is a particular cause for concern when high-quality
skills and experience will be required to meet this
challenge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:15:15"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Minister agree that particular support needs to be provided to children
with SEN from a very early age, so that they are able to participate
fully in the curriculum? Can he point me to where this support
and flexibility are spelt out in the curriculum? How will
parents be able to judge the progress of their children against their
peers, particularly at primary school level, if the assessment levels
and level descriptors are removed? Can we be sure that what replaces
them will have the confidence of teachers and parents
alike<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:16:01"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

process of curriculum consultation has been unnecessarily rancorous.
The Secretary of State has shown little skill or interest in managing
the debate to achieve a consensual outcome. While we welcome the
numerous U-turns, we remain concerned that the fundamental educational
philosophy of this Government is backward looking, focused towards an
outdated and divisive exam system and destined to do a disservice to
the next generation of school leavers, who had a right to expect
better. I hope the Minister will address these concerns and I look

Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Jones,
for her support for where we have arrived as a result of our
consultation, if not for her comments on the journey we have taken to
arrive at that point. As far as citizenship is concerned, we confirmed
in February that citizenship would remain, along with other current
national curriculum
subjects<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:17:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

reviewed the national curriculum in England since January 2011. In
February this year, we published proposals that embodied a vision
for a national curriculum that is slimmer, focused on essential
subject knowledge and which—especially in the core subjects of
English, maths and science—compares favourably with the
curriculum taught in the most successful education jurisdictions in the
world. Since then, there has been a vigorous national debate
on the content and purpose of the national curriculum, which we
have welcomed. It is right that every member of society should
care about this. Our formal public consultation closed in April; we
received 17,000 submissions; and we have published a summary of the
consultation findings, as I said earlier.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:19:25"></hs_TimeCode> intend to
finalise the new national curriculum this autumn, so that schools have
a year to prepare to teach it from September

new national curriculum will retain the best elements of the drafts we
published in February. We have, however, reflected carefully on the
arguments we heard during the consultation period. That has led to some
changes. In history, while we are pleased that many eminent historians
welcomed the ambition of the draft, we also heard the concerns of
history teachers that it was too prescriptive. We also acknowledged
concerns that the curriculum was not sufficiently explicit that pupils
should be taught about world history. In response, we have revised
those proposals. They still set out that pupils should be taught a rich
diet of British history within a clear chronological framework.
However, the revised version also makes it clear that teachers will
have the flexibility to design lessons that fire their pupils’
enthusiasm for history and teach the history of other societies around
the world. The response has been very positive, even from those, such
as the Historical Association and Professor Richard Evans, who had
originally been critical of our plans. Similarly, we have revised the
design and technology curriculum to ensure that it properly reflects
our ambitions for teaching in this subject. The consequence of this
revision will be that children are set on a path to be the next
generation of designers and
engineers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:19:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

have made other changes, such as, as the noble Baroness mentioned, the

decided that levels and level descriptors should be removed. We have
also borne in mind the feedback that we heard from many teachers that
levels are unhelpful in that they distract teachers from ensuring that
pupils master essential subject skills and knowledge and instead
require assessments of progress to be made against vague, best-fit

curriculum is designed to give schools genuine opportunities to take
ownership of the curriculum. The new programmes of study set out what
pupils should know and be able to do at the end of each key stage. This
is particularly true at primary level for English, maths and science,
and therefore assessments can be directly based on that rather than on
vague level descriptors. Levels were designed as an assessment tool to
summarise progress at the end of an entire key stage; they were never

Baroness that it is time that we ended the circular debate about
knowledge versus skills. We accept that it is essential that our pupils
learn both these things. Our national curriculum is based on the latest
cognitive thinking and practice around the world, including the work of
Dan Willingham, whose book, <I>Why Don’t Students Like
School?</I>, I recommend to anybody interested in this matter. It is
also based on the experience in jurisdictions such as Massachusetts,
where a knowledge-skills-based curriculum —although it is more
knowledge-based—is followed. In recent years, this has led to

to neglect our duty and to sanction relative decline. We want pupils to

it is also the case that the timetable we are working to means that

the principle that schools know better than government what support
they will need to teach the new curriculum in accordance with their own

<?notus-xml column=225?>ideas to bring to life in the classroom, will,
wherever necessary, be brought fully up to speed so that they can

importance of English and maths is obvious in their needing more space
in the voluminous curriculum document than all the other 10 subjects
put together—rightly so, since English and maths not only
possess the precious content which is peculiar to them but also
comprise the tools, as the Minister has just said, for shaping all else

teachers have the resources to deliver this new curriculum, largely in
the way that I outlined earlier. English and maths will be essential
right the way through the curriculum until the age of 16, and grammar,
punctuation and spelling will feature much more across the curriculum
than they have done in the past. They will not be essential beyond the
age of 18, although we have said that all pupils who have not achieved
grade C in English or maths will go on studying English and maths until

for a long time that we should have a shorter and more focused
curriculum that prioritises essentials. It is interesting to note that
the national curriculum has been reduced from 468 pages to 281. I do
not see it as a U-turn; I see it as a reflection of the consultation

some areas, for example, there are no training schools. Are
we going to see resources go directly to those schools? What is the
position on equipping non-teachers? As we know, in free schools and
some academies non-teachers are taking classes. We also know that in
all schools teaching assistants are covering PPA time and taking

Massey of Darwen:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
repeating the Statement. The document is sprinkled with references back
to the Education Act 2002, with its emphasis on promoting
spiritual, moral, intellectual and cultural development of pupils and
developing a balanced and broadly based wider curriculum. I agree with
that, but I am not sure that the document fulfils it. I agree with my
noble friend Lady Jones that ICT—computing—spoken skills
in English and the subject of climate change are welcome. As a former
foreign language teacher, of course I would say that foreign languages
are welcome. I will come to PSHE later, but I hope that the Minister
realises that some pupils need a basis of interpersonal skills and
self-confidence to be able to learn anything. They cannot simply be
filled with facts and
knowledge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000116">I
am pleased that there was consultation on the original
document. I know that some concerns were expressed there. For example,
36% said that the curriculum was then too focused on knowledge and that
there should be greater recognition of the value of skills. I reflect
on last Thursday’s debate in this House, instigated by the noble
Baroness, Lady Shephard, to which the Minister responded, in
which across the House we expressed concern about careers education and
the development of soft skills such as teamwork, communication and so
on. I am not sure that that is sufficiently covered in this document. I
am also concerned about the space for creativity and the prescription
and progression between
stages.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000117">It
does not seem to be recognised that citizenship and personal education
are taught in a cross-curricular way, with certain formal inputs. I
note that in the document there are 20 lines on citizenship but nothing
on PSHE; there is reference only to sex and relationship education. Sex
and relationship education is part of PSHE; it should not be given
overemphasis. Things such as obesity, alcohol, drugs and smoking are
equally
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000118">Is
the Minister confident that this curriculum will deliver skills of
communication and encourage self-confidence in pupils? Is he confident
that culture, arts and sports are given sufficient emphasis? Is he
confident that personal, social and health education and citizenship
education are given sufficient reference in the document? Perhaps he
can briefly

Nash:</Member></B> I know that the noble Baroness shares my concern
about PSHE being an essential part of any school, particularly
interpersonal skills and self-confidence. I do not think that we are
apart at all on the necessity for all schools to teach that. Indeed,
that is what good schools do; it is all part of a good education. The
difference between us is that we do not feel that we should legislate
for every ingredient of such education to be
statutory.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000120">For
instance, on career education, I was in Norfolk today, where we were
whipping up support for schools in Norfolk, which have consistently
been below national 
<?notus-xml column=227?>standards. One of our meetings was with business leaders. There is no
shortage of enthusiasm from the business community to engage with
schools to help them with careers advice, work placements and so on. I
then visited Wymondham College, one of our top state boarding schools,
where we got into a conversation about careers. I said that I was
constantly being asked whether careers advice should be more
consultancy-based in schools and whether that was sensible for schools.
It was absolutely clear. Everybody in the room—the top eight
teachers in the school—said that a careers session of 50 minutes
at the end of your school life was a very poor substitute for a good
education and that they engaged widely with businesses for careers
advice. They already practise the suggestion from my noble friend Lord
Cormack of career
panels.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000121">That
is the best practice, which we should encourage all schools to do, so
that all schools fulfil the ambitions of the noble Baroness. As I said,
however, what is between us is that we think that to legislate for it
in a box-ticking way would lower expectations rather than encourage all
schools to aim for the
highest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000122"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Phillips of Sudbury" PimsId="181" UID="130709112000399" xid="1827" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000399">Lord
Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I should declare an
interest as the founder and president of the Citizenship
Foundation. I, too, would like to congratulate the Government on the
outcome of their consultation and a lot of hard work all round. To have
17,000 people respond to a consultation must be a high response
compared to some that we have had recently and it reflects the intense
concern of people across the social spectrum—of course,
including teachers and parents. I also recognise the dilemmas that the
Government have in arriving at a curriculum, because so many subjects
today call for inclusion, and there has to be some point at which you
say, “Sorry, no more

particularly congratulate Michael Gove on resisting the advice from his
expert panel and keeping citizenship education in the core curriculum

everybody in the Chamber—that the democratic world of today is

of its Members to grapple with. It is irresponsible of us to the point
of being hypocritical not to give our school leavers the chance,
through a minimum level of competence, to take their part in this
hyper-complex society—in particular, their democratic
part. I fully endorse the conclusions reached that citizenship is part

like to ask my noble friend four questions. The framework document
issued this week starts by saying, of citizenship, that the purpose of
study is a high-quality citizenship education. I would be grateful if
my noble friend would consider the extent to which we need rather badly
to have a much greater quantity and quality of teacher education for
that difficult subject. Secondly, I agree with my noble friend Lord

citizenship education. If it is not within the compulsory Ofsted

his comments. I believe that we have greatly improved the citizenship
curriculum, not least with the helpful advice from noble Lords such as
him that it should be a much less issues-based curriculum, with greater
focus on the political systems in this country. So far as Ofsted is
concerned, I will look at that point in the context of what Ofsted
already inspects for in terms of a rounded conversation and whether we
can do anything further on that. As far as the core subject is
concerned, I rather refer back to my earlier point that some
independent schools teach citizenship very effectively in a much wider
way. As far as teaching quality is concerned, we are doing all that we
can to improve the quality of teachers. I may want to discuss with my
noble friend further his specific points about citizenship teachers to
see whether we cannot do more in this

me briefly set out the rationale by which the Government have
approached this decision. We believe that the UK should opt out of the
measures in question for reasons of principle, policy and pragmatism

firmly of the belief that that the UK’s international relations
in policing and criminal justice are first and foremost a matter for
Her Majesty’s Government. In policy terms, the UK has—and
will continue to have—the ability to choose whether it should
opt in to any new proposal in the field of justice and home affairs. It
is therefore right that we take the opportunity to consider whether we
wish to retain measures that were joined by the previous Government and
to decide on a case-by-case basis whether we are willing to allow the
European Court of Justice to exercise jurisdiction over them in the
future. Finally, the Government are being pragmatic. I have said before
that we will not leave the UK open to the threat of infraction, and
fines which run into many millions of pounds, by remaining bound by
measures we simply cannot implement in time. That would be
senseless.</hs_para>

the measures relate to minimum standards in substantive criminal law.
Even before their adoption, the UK already met or exceeded the vast
majority of these standards and will continue to do so, whether
or not we are bound by them. As people have become more mobile in
recent years, so too has crime. The Government have sought and listened
carefully to the views of our law enforcement agencies that combat it.
We understand that some of the measures covered by this decision are
important tools which they need to protect the British public. The
Government have identified 35 measures which we will be seeking to
rejoin in the national interest.</hs_para>

on which we propose to begin our discussions with the European
Commission and other member states, is laid out in Command
Paper 8671, which is published today. I want to be clear: what must
happen next is a process of negotiation with the European Commission
and other member states. These negotiations will determine the final
list of measures we formally apply to rejoin, but we promised that we
would set out these measures clearly and give honourable members time
to consider them before asking them to vote, and this is what we have
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000136">One of
the measures that we will seek to rejoin, and on which I know many
honourable Members have strong views, is the European arrest warrant. I
agree with our law enforcement agencies that the arrest warrant is a
valuable tool in returning offenders to the UK. Its predecessor, the
1957 European Convention on Extradition, had serious drawbacks. The
arrest warrant has helped us to secure and accelerate successful
extradition procedures—as shown by the case of Osman Hussain,
one of the failed London bombers of July 2005, who was extradited back
to the UK from Italy in less than eight weeks. More recently Jeremy
Forrest, the teacher who was sentenced last month for absconding to
France with one of his pupils, was extradited back to the UK
less than three weeks after his arrest. 
<?notus-xml column=230?>Since 2009 alone, the arrest warrant has been used to extradite from the
UK 57 suspects for child sex offences, 86 suspects for rape and 105 for
murder. In the same period 63 suspects for child sex offences, 27
suspects for rape and 44 for murder were extradited back to Britain to
face charges. A number of these suspects would probably have not been
extradited back to Britain without the arrest warrant. We owe it to
their victims, and their loved ones, to bring these people to
justice.</hs_para>

arrest warrant has its problems too, as honourable Members have
eloquently explained in this House. The previous Government had eight
years to address these concerns and did nothing. This Government have
taken action and today I am proposing additional safeguards to rectify
these problems and increase the protection offered to those wanted for
extradition, particularly British citizens. A number of honourable
Members have explained how European arrest warrants have been issued
disproportionately for very minor offences. I will address this by
amending the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, which is
currently in Committee, to ensure that an arrest warrant can be refused
for minor crimes. This should stop cases like that of Patrick Connor,
who was extradited because he and two friends were found in possession
of four counterfeit banknotes.</hs_para>

other states to enforce their fines and ensure that in future,
where possible, a European investigation order is used instead

honourable Members have expressed concern about lengthy and avoidable

Members, in particular my honourable friend the Member for Enfield
North, will recall the case of Andrew Symeou, who spent 10 months in
pre-trial detention and a further nine months on bail in Greece, only
to be acquitted. The change that I am introducing would have allowed
Andrew Symeou to raise, in his extradition hearing, the issue of
whether a decision to charge him and a decision to try him had been
taken. It would likely have prevented his extradition at the stage he
was surrendered and, quite possibly, altogether. We will also implement
the European supervision order to make it easier for people like Mr
Symeou to be bailed back to the UK.</hs_para>

conduct.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000142">I
also intend to make better use of existing safeguards to provide
further protections, so I will ensure that people who consent to
extradition do not lose their

delays. We propose that the prisoner transfer framework decision should
be used to its fullest extent so that UK citizens extradited and
convicted can be returned to serve their sentence here. Where a UK
national has been convicted and sentenced abroad, for example in their
absence, and is now the subject of a European arrest warrant, we will
ask, with their permission, for the warrant to be withdrawn and will
use the prisoner transfer arrangements instead. This change could have
prevented the extraditions of Michael Binnington and Luke

prevent other extraditions from occurring at all, I intend either to
allow the temporary transfer of a consenting person so that they can be

down on a human-trafficking gang operating in Ilford and led to the

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I have to say that I wonder
if this is the Statement that the Home Secretary really wanted to make
to the other place today. When we think of the rhetoric that we have
heard on this issue, it is something of a surprise to 
<?notus-xml column=232?>hear today’s Statement, because the Home
Secretary’s and the Government’s anti-European
credentials have taken a bit of a battering. The rhetoric is still
there, but common sense has appeared to force some moderation in
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000149">Last<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:54:19"></hs_TimeCode>
October, the Home Secretary confirmed that the Government’s
“current thinking” was that the UK should opt out of all
pre-Lisbon measures and rejoin them where it was considered in our
national interest to do so. An example often used by the Government to
explain this position is the European arrest warrant, as we have heard
from the noble Lord this evening. The <I>Sun</I> newspaper was briefed
on why the UK should reject it, the Prime Minister said it was
“highly objectionable” and, just recently, the
Government’s MPs voted, on a three-line Whip, against the Labour
Motion that would have retained it. However, the Government now have to
admit that it is effective and that, without it, criminals can evade
justice. They could seek to evade British justice abroad and would be
able to hide in the UK to evade the justice of other countries. I
welcome the Government’s U-turn on this issue but there are
still questions to be answered before we will be satisfied that public
safety is not at
risk<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:54:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000150">I
listened carefully to the Statement and have looked at the other
documents but am not 100% clear what we are opting out of and why, and
what impact that will have. I have not had the opportunity yet to read
the 159 pages of the Command Paper but I am confident that the Minister
has—I hope he has—and wanted to ask him a very specific
question about the exact number of practical, workable and working
measures that the Government are seeking permanently to opt out of. Of
the 133 crime, law and order, and policing measures, the Government
want to opt back in to 35. An additional seven have already been
replaced and the Government have opted in. However, of the measures
that the Government are seeking to opt out of: some are out of date and
no longer in operation; some we have never used so we do not have to;
others are agreements to co-operate, and my understanding is that the
Government intend that co-operation to continue; and the Statement
itself refers to measures that relate to minimum standards that we have
already met or exceeded. With all of those, there is no impact or
effect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000151">Other
opt-outs include: a directory of counterterror officers that no longer
exists; a temporary system for dealing with counterfeit documents that
has already been replaced; a bundle of measures applying to Portugal,
Spain and Croatia that do not even apply to the UK; and a number of
measures relating to extinct manuals, specialist handbooks et cetera.
In some ways, dealing with these is a useful tidying-up measure, but it
is hardly an impressive list of repatriation of powers. I have a very
specific question for the Minister, knowing that he has read the
document: how many of the measures that the Government want to opt out
of permanently are relevant to the UK and currently being used, and
what impact will their removal have? I look forward to the answers from
the noble Lord as, having heard the Statement, I really have no
idea<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:56:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000152">The
Government now accept that the 35 measures that they want to opt back
into are essential. If there is an opt-out, there must be a quick
opt-back-in. Can the noble Lord confirm that the Government have 
<?notus-xml column=233?>secured a guarantee that we can opt back in to these important measures?
If not, will the Government still opt out without such a guarantee?
What timescale does the noble Lord envisage from the opt-out until the
process of opting back in is completed? Are the Government seeking to
amend any of the 33 measures, other than the European arrest warrant,
and what are the implications and consequences if we fail to opt back
into any of the measures, including financial consequences? Does the
Minister really believe that the only way of making changes is to opt
out and then opt back in? I find that strange when the Government
refused to implement the European supervision order relating to the
European arrest warrant, which they could have done long before
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:58:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000153">If
any opt-back-in is not immediate, it is essential that there are
transition measures. For example, the European arrest warrant is a
legal framework that allows countries to extradite. Transition measures
would have to be legally robust to ensure the satisfaction of the
courts and lawyers dealing with any extradition. Given that
pre-European arrest warrant transition arrangements have expired, will
there be separate transition measures for all countries currently
covered by the European arrest warrant? How long will negotiations take
and are we at risk of a time gap during which criminals will be able to
hide from UK justice and hide in the UK from justice in other
countries? What will happen to the existing European arrest warrants
where a person has not yet been arrested but there is a warrant out for
their arrest? Will the warrants just lapse with the opt-out, allowing
wanted criminals to evade justice from the UK overseas or leaving
foreign criminals in the UK without the powers to remove
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:59:08"></hs_TimeCode>? The

remain so many questions on the impact and the detail that I will not
detain the House with another list which I could easily provide this
evening. Genuine scrutiny, at which your Lordships’ House
excels, will be so important in this debate. I hope that the Minister
does not say this evening that these issues are for further discussion,
because we are running out of time; he smiles at me, so perhaps that is
the note that he has been passed. A vote will take place in the other
place in less than a week, and the matter will then be brought to your
Lordships’ House. The Government must have worked out the detail
by now. We need that detail to inform our decision-making in your

response to the Statement. I noted that she thought that it had common
sense and moderation. Indeed, there were times during her response to
the Statement 
<?notus-xml column=234?>where there was a suggestion that we had shot her fox, in that all the
disasters to which she was hoping to point—about not taking note
of national security and effective policing—are not there. The
Statement of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary puts those
matters right to the fore, as is demonstrated in the list that we have
put before the House

was hardly a hint that this little problem was left by the Labour

My point when we were discussing this at Questions the other day was
that they are serious issues that deserve proper and serious
consideration. The document published today, Command Paper 8671, is a
sign of the candour and transparency with which the Government intend
to approach this matter. The document contains not only the full list
of the measures with an explanation of the protocol under which they
have been produced, but also six Explanatory Memoranda from various

noble Baroness asked whether foreign citizens charged in the UK would
be safeguarded. Yes, the safeguards will apply to all those subject to
the European arrest warrant. The noble Baroness asked on what basis the
decisions would be taken. The Government believe that we should
exercise the opt-out and then seek to rejoin the measure where it is in
the national interest to do so. The Government have considered the
impact of each measure on public safety and security, whether practical
co-operation is underpinned by the measure and whether there would be a
detrimental impact on co-operation if we pursued it by other
mechanisms. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:05:54"></hs_TimeCode>

asked me if I had done a word count on the various issues. We have said
that we intend to opt in to 35. As she says, a number—we think
abut 14—of the original list have been repealed and replaced.
There are about another 20 measures that retain the minimum European
standards. However, the noble Baroness’s kind of quizzing
approach really misses the point of what this exercise is about.
Through today’s Statement, the Government have sent a clear
message that we have addressed the problem left by Protocol
36—which would have been faced by any British Government and
which the previous Government

discussions, but officials have had technical discussions with the
Commission and the Council, focusing on the legal framework under which
the decision will be made, to ensure a shared understanding of the
legal processes around the 2014 decision. I know that my right
honourable friends the Justice Secretary and the Home Secretary spoke
today to Commissioner Reading and Commissioner Malmström
respectively. There is no doubt that the Commission has responded in a
way that we find constructive. I will cover another point made by the
noble Baroness, about whether there would be gaps and lacunas in this.
That would not be in the interests of any of us; we will negotiate with
both sides to make sure that the move from one jurisdiction to another
is a smooth
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:12:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

consequence of the Statement, which I thank the Minister for repeating,
is that the committees which have worked together on this issue will
now reopen the inquiry and provide the House with a second

this Statement makes, frankly, a pretty good mockery of the
Government’s undertaking to engage with Parliament on this
issue? The original decision was announced in Rio de Janeiro, rather
further away than the studios of the “Today” programme,
which is the normal distance from Westminster at which such things are
said. That was followed up by a Statement in the House which preceded
any consultation with this House, with the other place, with the
devolved parliaments and with the

we have a Statement that simply ignores the views of your

of all three parties and of none and which came to the conclusion that
the Government had not at all made a convincing case for triggering the

refer to that report is perhaps to be explained by the fact that the

hope that as we move forward we do not get bogged down in the niceties
of protocol. The report from the noble Lord’s committee was
influential in the discussions that have taken place. This is a little
bit like a game of three-dimensional chess. In reaching decisions, 
<?notus-xml column=237?>the Government are trying to keep both Houses
informed and to keep relations and channels open to the Commission and
to member states. I hope Members of the House will understand that the
issues covered by the 2014 decision are numerous and complex. We have

second vote will be taken when the outcome of these negotiations are

Davies of Stamford:</Member></B> My Lords, is there not something very
odd and illogical—weird, bizarre, even—about this
Statement? It goes at some length into the merits of the proposals, or
measures, that the Government intend to opt back into, so why opt out
of them in the first place? It does not say anything at all
about the de-merits of the measures that the Government want to abandon
definitively. It is not surprising that the House seems to have come to
a consensus this evening that what the Government have been conducting
is essentially a charade. Will the noble Lord accept that this is a
charade not entirely without cost? There will be the cost of an
unnecessary negotiation. There will be the exasperation caused
to our partners by the fact that we treat them in this particular way.
There is, of course, the risk that we will not be able to renegotiate
in exactly the fashion we want our resumption of the measures to which
we wish to adhere in future—unless of course the Government have
already received assurances in advance about that, in which case I hope
the noble Lord will be frank and tell the House. Is it not also true
that the Government embarked on this quite unnecessary, gratuitous and
risky course simply for reasons of the most squalid party-political
nature—designed simply to buy off their own Eurosceptics and to
keep UKIP from making inroads into the Tory Party

credibility if it did not come from the Benches that negotiated the
specific option with which we are now dealing. The noble Lord cannot
get away from that fact. For heaven’s sake, why was Protocol 36
negotiated in the first place if it was not for the opportunity that
the House is now taking? The noble Lord can score all the
party-political points that he wants, but this was the legacy of the
Benches opposite; the Government are dealing with it—like many
other things. We are dealing with this, as my right honourable friend
has emphasised, with a clear focus on the best assistance we can give
to our policing and the best protection we can give to our national
security. I am very happy that the Government are able to bring forward

rejoice that the Government have decided that, after all, we need the
European arrest warrant, together with Eurojust and Europol and the
cross-border police co-operation. These are on any view the most
important of the 35 measures which are due for retention—if, of

the uncertainty surrounding the opt-in process, and given the fact that
we are already subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of
the European Union in respect of all the many police and justice
measures that we have opted into since 2009, are we not taking an
unjustifiable risk in opting out of what is good, including the 35
measures which are agreed to be in the national interest, in
order to get rid of the other 95 pre-Lisbon measures, which are of no
real importance to us, nor even of great relevance to us, one way or

learned Lord has said. The fact is, however, that we had the Protocol
36 exercise to carry through; we have discussed it inside Government
and with Parliament on a regular basis; and we have listened to the
views of the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and others. We
have suggested a way forward. Is it a way forward with risk? Yes it is.
All such enterprises have an element of risk. However, we can move
forward with a degree of confidence once we get past some of the
nitpicking about who did what, where and when, and get down to the
central issue of whether we can successfully negotiate with our
European colleagues on matters of our national interest and, I
respectfully suggest, of Europe’s interest. What has encouraged
us is that the soft soundings that we have taken have led us to believe
that we can carry out meaningful, fruitful discussions and negotiations
that recognise the risks that the noble and learned Lord mentioned,
but, because we will do this with good will and an intention to
succeed, and with colleagues who have similar good will and want us to
succeed, will minimise those

to specifics. The Statement says that the Government wish to rejoin the
existing Europol measure. It also says that they do not intend at this
stage to opt into the new measure. I regret that because it means that
we will not have a vote in the negotiations, and a future opt-in to the
new Europol provision will depend on certain matters being dropped from

preparing a list of the 35 measures, did the Government take account of
the report to your Lordships’ House on the UK opt-in to the new
Europol regulation that I believe was debated last week, which makes it
absolutely clear that there are four other Council decisions that may
not be repealed and replaced by the current Europol proposal, and which
Europol advised were directly connected—that is, the existing
Europol and a possible new Europol? It follows that whatever happens
with the new Europol, if we wish to stay in the old Europol and are
successful in renegotiating that, we will need the four separate
Council decisions that are listed in footnote 39 on page 10 of the
report. As far as I can see, none of them is included in the 35

quality, which is to be welcomed, and places promoting diversity and
quality in the provision of services in the Bill. However, on behalf of
nurses, the Royal College of Nursing thinks that it is not enough
merely to quote “quality”. Local authorities are
responsible for commissioning services from providers and have a duty
to ensure that these providers and services are effective to meet the
needs of the individual. It does not believe that at the moment local
authorities are fulfilling these duties and responsibilities if they
commission providers who fail to deliver high-quality care and, worse,

was concerned to receive a submission from the Association of Directors
of Adult Social Services, which said that while the intention of Clause
5 in promoting quality and diversity within the market is laudable,
ADASS was of the view that the proposed duty placed on local
authorities is wholly unrealistic. It points to a large number of
providers that have no relationship or contact with local authorities,

restricted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000199">I

is very much concerned with the conditions under which care workers are
employed in the main by the private sector. This is a hugely important
issue. Clearly, we have a growing number of disabled and older people
who need care and support. The people working in the care sector are
vital. We need quality people who are highly trained and who can give
the right commitment to the vulnerable people they are asked to care
for. Clause 5 is important because what we see is a very fragmented
industry delivering care that in many cases is of questionable quality
and employing insecure, low paid, unregulated staff. Amendment 86P is
concerned with the importance of fostering a sustainable workforce to
encourage the acquisition of skills and decent working conditions that
support the continuity and quality of

shocked to see a parliamentary Answer from the Minister’s
honourable friend Mr Lamb recently, showing that more than 300,000
people working in the care sector are employed on zero-hours contracts.
The point that I wish to make is this: how can people who do not have
the security of knowing what they will earn pass on a sense of security
to the people whom they care for? The rise in zero-hours contracts is
bad for service users, many of whom are, of course, extremely
vulnerable. There is another issue. People who are being cared for want
to see the same person to have a continuity of care relationship. We
know that that is severely hindered by those wretched zero-hours
contracts. I believe that secure employment would allow staff to
concentrate on caring rather than worrying about whether they are
earning enough money for themselves and their families to live
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0002.htm#130709112000202">I ought

excellent report, <I>Time to Care</I>, which undertook a survey in 2012

<?notus-xml column=242?>responded had to rush work or leave a client early
to go to another call on what is called call
cramming— in other words, too many calls for a care
worker to undertake—and 56% received between the national
minimum wage and £8 an hour. The majority did not receive set

are poor.</hs_para>

statistic. Nearly 57.8% are not paid for travelling time between
visits. This morning I met a carer in Southwark who works roughly 20
hours on a zero-hours contract. She reckons that, because of the
travelling time, she actually works for 27 hours, but is paid for only
20. The problem is that there is a race to the bottom because local
authorities are, in my view, neglecting their responsibilities for
ensuring that, when they place contracts, they are with good quality
organisations. The companies who are exploiting their workers in this
way are winning contracts at the expense of companies who treat their
employees wisely. No wonder, therefore, that 36.7% of respondents are
often allocated different clients on a daily basis, so that there is no
chance of any relationship being developed.</hs_para>

you think of the thousands of vulnerable people dependent on care

all about quality of care. We know what happens at the moment. There is
the opposite of a monopoly in that there are lots of sellers, but
largely one buyer of care. Many care homes know this. The local
authority is in a very strong position and will tell the care home
managers—in the private or voluntary sectors—that they
will take 20 beds and negotiate a price which is very low.
That means that the care home cannot provide a decent quality of care
at that unrealistic price. This has been talked about and written about
by Laing and Buisson and

self-funders more than the required amount in order to cover the true
costs so that they can provide a decent quality of care. In a time when
we are looking for transparency, this Bill, when it is enacted, will
open up these arrangements to public scrutiny because self-funders and
those funded by their local authority will know what is going on. This
secret tax, as I think of it, on self-funders will then be out in the
open. It is really bad that this kind of thing is going on in this

we have an independent adjudicator who can settle funding disputes
between local authorities and care providers. We must also recognise
that not all care providers are large private sector chains. I have
received a lot of information about this from the Royal British Legion.
It may be quite a large body, but it is a charity. Because of these
arrangements, it cannot manage to provide a decent quality of care at
the sort of price being quoted. There is a great deal of secrecy in
this area, with local authorities not consulting local providers and no
one inspecting the quality of the services being provided before a
maximum tariff is agreed. All of these operations should be much more
open and clear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:46:37"></hs_TimeCode>.
Apart from the appointment of a care providers’ adjudicator, we
have to ensure that the duties on local authorities enable us to be
clear that a consistently high standard of care is being provided in
the area. If we go on otherwise, we will be promoting secrecy, which is
entirely
inappropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:47:11"></hs_TimeCode>.

to propose is that the Government should look at the tasks that a care
worker has to do in order to make a visit to a person needing care
worth while. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, also talked about this. In most
cases, they cannot manage to do everything that is necessary in around
15 minutes, plus make the journey to and from the person being visited.
It is physically impossible. As we know, it is largely a breach of
human rights simply to pop in, try to clean someone who may not have
had a visit for many hours, serve a meal and talk to the person, change
their clothing and the bedding, and do those things that are considered
to make up a reasonable quality of care provision in 15 minutes. That
needs to change. It should be necessary to adhere to specific minimum
standards, not to the length of time taken to make a visit. It should
be the qualifying tasks that matter, not the time it takes to do the
work. We have to change things around so that it is what needs to be
done that matters, not the time taken. These amendments, together with
an adjudicator, would ensure that that
happens.</hs_para>

this objectively, and it has been this way for some time, we have a
situation that would be solved readily in a free market. The supply of
people providing care is going down, and it will continue to go down,
largely because of the Government’s crackdown on immigration;
many of the workers in this sector are immigrants, as can be seen when
visiting nearly any care home. The demand is going up year after year,
if only for demographic reasons. What you would expect to happen would
be for pay to go up, attracting more and better workers to the sector,
thus resolving the situation. However, that is not happening.</hs_para>

Because, in effect, there is a monopoly purchaser: the local authority.
However, the local authority can only buy with the money it is allowed
by the Government. As we know, the amount available for care, which
should have been going up, has been going down. You can call on the CQC
or local authorities to pay more but they are in an impossible
position. If they do not connive in the appalling conditions inflicted
on these workers, they will not be able to provide the services at all.
So they try to get through another year and accept a lower tender or
another company, even though they know that their standards are
appalling. This is not the fault of the local authority. It is the
fault of our national failing to put money into care while we have
continued to ring-fence money for health and

I would say exactly the same thing today. I am supportive of the Dilnot

£1 billion to help richer people not to be wiped out by their
care costs. It is a great thing. However, it is not as great a thing as
it would be if, at the same time, we were providing the money to allow

important debate. As has been said, these amendments are all about
quality and speak to many of the concerns to which the noble Lord, Lord
Hunt, has just given powerful expression. The Care Bill introduces a
number of important new duties and responsibilities to help place the
right values at the heart of our care system. The well-being clause,
for 
<?notus-xml column=245?>example, provides a foundation stone for the
principles that should inform the whole of social care.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:52:27"></hs_TimeCode>, our
social care system is only as strong as the services that are actually
commissioned. With budgets getting tighter and tighter, and demand
getting ever greater, local authorities all too often commission care
and support services based solely on finding the cheapest possible
option. Unless we can ensure that the way in which services are
commissioned drives the quality outcomes that we all want to see,
important changes such as the well-being principle will remain simply a
pious
aspiration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000219">Amendment
86N would oblige local authorities to adhere to minimum standards in
the way that they commission services and would give the Government
power to make regulations for appropriate minimum standards. Amendment
86Q would provide for regulations to ensure that care visits lasted
long enough to deliver the support needed. This would exert an
important influence on the quality of services for disabled and older
people. Focusing too much on cost creates an unacceptably high risk
that care will be of the poor quality that we have heard too much about
of late, which does not meet the basic needs of vulnerable people for
support to enable them to live with dignity.</hs_para>

fantastic examples of high-quality services across the country, despite
severe budgetary constraints, and much can be learnt from how
some local authorities have been able to build quality into
what they do. However, there are also too many examples of people
suffering as a result of poor-quality commissioning and receiving
totally insufficient support, which consists simply of fleeting visits
from carers who barely have time to say hello, let alone get to know

cases of care workers rushing in to deliver care in visits of 15
minutes or even less. Fifteen minutes is not long enough to help people
wash, get dressed, prepare a meal and use the bathroom. It is hardly
long enough to take your coat off. It certainly is not long enough to
promote people’s well-being. Care visits can be the only contact
that socially excluded and vulnerable people have in a day. It is

less.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000222">A
recent survey of local authorities found that 90% still pay providers
according to the time they spend with the service user rather than the
outcomes they achieve. This simply encourages a race to the bottom. The
Bill needs to contain provisions that will help to ensure that quality
of service is a key consideration in commissioning decisions. There
must be checks and balances in the commissioning process and quality
must be part of the equation. If we want a society that provides care

duty is about ensuring that the market meets the needs of local people
with a choice of quality services; it is not simply about promoting a
market for 
<?notus-xml column=247?>its own sake. This focus on quality should be understood in a broad
sense. High-quality services will be fit for purpose and appropriate to
an individual’s needs. Consequently, the important issue raised
by Amendment 86J, of ensuring that local authorities shape markets that
offer people a choice between appropriate services, is already covered
by the clause: propriety is an important component of quality. I say to
the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, that Clause 5 requires local
authorities to shape diverse markets in care and support services. I do
so in the light of her concern that low-paying local authority
contracts might preclude smaller, voluntary sector organisations from
playing a part in the market. The provision will include ensuring that
people are able to choose from a range of providers, including small
and micro
providers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000235" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000235">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:01:11"></hs_TimeCode>
fulfilling the duty, it is vital that local authorities engage with
adults using services, their carers and providers, as Amendment 86K
emphasises. The Bill therefore requires local authorities to consider
how providers can meet current and future demand for services, and the
importance of fostering innovation and improvement in their local area.
Consequently, I reassure noble Lords that it would not be possible to
fulfil the duty as it stands without engaging providers, adults who are
using care and support services, and carers.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130709112000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000236">A number of the
amendments relate to one of the most important ways in which local
authorities can shape local markets: their commissioning decisions.
Local authorities are required by Clause 5 to consider the importance
of ensuring sustainability. This requires a strategic perspective on
the strengths and demands placed on care and support providers now and
in the future. It means that local authorities must consider how their
actions may impact on the stability of their local market. They should
not act in a way which might risk the sustainability of the market.
Looking especially at Amendment 86L, local authorities that set
unreasonable or undeliverable prices which undercut the financial
sustainability of the provider market would therefore not be fulfilling
this duty.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:09:22"></hs_TimeCode>, it is
important to emphasise that the normal and effective operation of any
market includes some providers entering and exiting the market. The
Government do not wish to prevent exit, or require local authorities to
prevent exit. It would not, therefore, be appropriate for local
authorities to promote the sustainability of individual providers
rather than the market in general. For that reason, I cannot support
the amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, although,
of course, I sympathise with her
concerns<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:06:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000237" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000237">The
noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, expressed the worry that low-paying
local authority contracts might lead to the subsidy of providers by
self-funders. The introduction of the cap on care costs will mean that
a person who chooses to meet their own needs will be able to compare
what they might pay to meet their needs with what the local authority
pays. If a person wants to, they will be able to ask the local
authority to arrange to meet their eligible care needs so that what
they pay to the local authority to meet their needs would be the same
as the figure that counts towards the cap. I hope that is

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> We are almost anticipating a later
debate when it comes to the Dilnot cap. This is an important issue. It
is well-known, is it not, that self-funders essentially subsidise those
people funded by local authorities. We know that some homes simply
would not be viable if they existed only on local authority rates. In a
transparent era, will self-funders put up with that? The cap relates
only to local authority rates, so self-funders, in many cases, will
have to pay much more than £72,000 before they can look to the
local authority for support. If they now know that in addition to
having to pay well above the £72,000 they have actually been
subsidising people who have been supported by local authorities, I
think it is going to lead to some severe
problems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000243">I

Howe:</Member></B> Local authorities and individuals can pay different
prices for care. That can be because individuals have consciously
chosen premium facilities or because the local authority has negotiated
a lower price in exchange for buying care for a larger number of
people, which can often happen as well. As is the case now, local
authorities and providers will continue to negotiate arrangements and
fees for providing care and support. This process should ensure that
contracts reflect the market price for providing care. Local
authorities that fail to negotiate properly with providers and do not
have regard to the actual cost risk legal challenges to the care fees
that they set. However, in response to the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours, I would say that in future
the independent personal budget will set out the cost to the local
authority. That is the transparency point that I was trying to get at

Greengross:</Member></B> My Lords, I have mentioned to the noble Earl
another aspect of this which I think needs to be taken into account.
Not only will this funding by some people of other people—or the
“secret tax”, as I call it—become better known but
there will be a strong incentive for self-funders to dispose of their
assets so that the local authority pays the local authority rate for
them, even if they pay in more on top of that. Therefore, I think that
the Government need to take into account the huge extra cost on local
authorities which we have not thought about so far. If self-funders
were to go to a financial adviser and ask for advice, I imagine that
many financial advisers would say, “Dispose of some of your
assets and at least the local authority will pay that rate for
you<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:12:43"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

Howe:</Member></B> But for somebody with assets who is looking to be
taken care of in a residential home the incentive to dispose of their
personal assets is surely going to be a great deal less than it is at
the moment. I would have thought that that incentive was much greater
now than it will be in the future, when we hope that there will be
financial products on the market to enable people to insure up to the
level of the cap. Therefore, I am not sure that I completely understand
the force of the point that the noble Baroness is making. Obviously
there will be some incentive for people to dispose of their assets but
I suggest that it will be less than she has

noble Baroness’s Amendment 86M, there will be a
dispute between a local authority and a provider as to the prices
proposed or other matters. Occasionally, disputes may become
intractable. Therefore, I completely understand why the noble Baroness
proposes through her amendment to, in effect, require a new independent
adjudicator to arbitrate in any unresolvable disputes. However, it is
our view that any disputes arising as part of a contractual negotiation
must be resolved through that process. Appointing or establishing a new
independent adjudicator would be likely to add unnecessary cost and
bureaucracy to the process of commissioning. We also believe that it
will be likely to increase disputes by providing a means of challenge

purpose of Amendment 87H is to ensure that intermediate care and

that a holistic approach to meeting care and support needs is taken. In
the White Paper of July last year, the Government promised that the new
system would,</hs_para>

of their vision for care and support, the Government accepted that they
needed to move away from an approach that saw people as having to wait
for a crisis before they could access care and support. The White Paper
included a number of references to reablement, which the Government saw
as helping people regain their independence at home.</hs_parafo>

needs to be strengthened to take this perspective more fully on board
and so that local authorities are clear about the steps they need to
take to adopt a genuinely preventive approach to meeting needs for care
and support, particularly as regards providing or arranging for
reablement. At present reablement, for all the many promising words in
the <I>Caring </I><I>f</I><I>or Our Future</I> White Paper, remains
conspicuously absent from the Bill. Whether it is enabling someone who
has recently had a stroke to regain through their rehabilitation the
skills they need for independent living, easing a
person’s discharge from hospital, helping people when
difficulties start to arise following a bereavement or after a fall, or
providing aids and adaptations following the onset of sensory loss,
reablement can be crucial in determining whether someone experiencing
acute health problems goes on to develop long-term care needs or, on
the contrary, feels confident enough to go on living
independently.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130709112000262" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000262">There are a number of
definitions of reablement, but broadly it refers to the relearning of
self-care skills following a stay in hospital or the onset of an
illness or disability. The aim is always to reduce the need for
longer-term support. The social policy research unit and the personal
social services research unit at the University of Kent and the LSE
have analysed home care reablement services and found that reablement
is associated with a significant decrease in subsequent use of social
care services. The cost of the services they examined, used by a
reablement group over 12 months, excluding the cost of reablement
itself, was 60% less than the cost of the services used by those in a
conventional home care group who did not receive reablement. To ensure
that needs assessments properly factor in the potential health and
well-being gains associated with a structured programme of reablement,
Clause 9 needs amending to ensure that authorities assess the extent to
which reablement or intermediate care would help people achieve the
outcomes specified as a consequence of Clause
9(4)(d<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:26:06"></hs_TimeCode>).</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000263" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000263">Amendment
88PB is the parallel amendment in relation to Clause 13, on
eligibility. Its purpose is to avoid people who are judged ineligible
for care packages also being denied intermediate care and reablement
services or enduring unnecessary delays, by ensuring that the benefits
of providing this help are considered when a local authority makes a
determination on a 
<?notus-xml column=253?>person’s eligibility for care. Too many
people do not get offered this preventive support, with the result that
many of them are left to struggle on their own. This merely delays the
moment when their needs worsen and they require more expensive
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:26:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000264" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000264">A
lot has been written about reablement over the past five years or so in
Green Papers and White Papers, but not yet in statute. What
intermediate care and reablement have in common is that they are
time-limited interventions that can be provided to a person
independently of their eligibility for longer-term care and support.
Crucially, as we have seen, they are also cost-effective. Curiously,
the Bill does not mention reablement by name, although Clause 2(4)(d)
paves the way for it when it speaks of regulations making provision
for,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="130709112000354" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000354">“services,

or intermediate care can make all the difference between a person going
under and remaining independent. A report produced by Deloitte for
Sense and four other charities estimated a net return of 52% to a local
authority that invested in a communicator guide and a rehabilitation
service for deafblind adults who need help gaining news communication
skills<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:28:02"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
essential that local authorities consider whether, and if so to what
extent, a person would benefit from the provision of these time-limited
but effective services. This does not place them under a duty to
provide intermediate care and reablement services but, at a minimum, it
ensures that they consider the value of putting in place those services
where this would help maximise independence and also save the council
money in the long
run.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000266" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000266">Such<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:28:45"></hs_TimeCode>
a battery of heavyweights have their names on Amendment 88PA that I
hardly need to say anything about it—they will make the case
better than I ever could. The amendment slightly expands the duty on
local authorities to consider preventive support following a
determination on eligibility. It provides that local authorities must
consider not only whether service users would definitely benefit from
the provision of preventive services under Clause 2, or information and
advice under Clause 4, but whether they “would be likely
to” benefit from such services. We have to be wary of placing
burdens on local authorities that they cannot meet but this amendment
is careful not to do that. It just opens the gateway to preventive
services a little wider and makes it more difficult for local
authorities to use unreasonable justifications for refusing to provide
preventive support.</hs_para>

88PC goes a bit further and would provide that a council must provide

understand why the Government do not want to create an individual
entitlement to preventive services on grounds of cost. Clause 2 does
not create an individual entitlement to preventive services.
Individually enforceable rights to preventive services would be a 
<?notus-xml column=254?>bridge too far and would place an unrealistic burden on local
authorities. However, given that £3.8 billion has been announced
for the integration and transformation fund, which includes the funding
CCGs currently hold for preventive initiatives such as reablement and
carers’ breaks, there is funding for providing an individual
entitlement in the circumstances envisaged by this
amendment—that is to say, where the authority determines that a
person is at risk of developing an eligible need, they would or would
be likely to benefit from such services or the provision of such
services would be likely to prevent or delay the development of an
eligible

eligibility threshold is likely to remain broadly equivalent to the
“substantial” level. The Government envisage that people
with ineligible needs will be able to access universal preventive
services covered in Clause 2. However, preventive services are often
not prioritised sufficiently by local authorities. A Scope survey
showed that the vast majority of people whose needs do not meet the
eligibility threshold are not being effectively picked up by universal
services. Among the respondents, 63% with moderate needs, 43% with
substantial needs and 50% with critical needs had to pay for their own
care, leading to financial instability. This is why we need Amendment

Browning:</Member></B> My Lords, I speak to Amendments 88B and 88N in
this group. The noble Lord, Lord Touhig, has added his name to
Amendment 88B, which is about the need to co-ordinate between two
pieces of legislation: this Bill and the Children and Families Bill,
which is also going through the
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:33:01"></hs_TimeCode>. It
focuses on assessment, particularly at the time of transition from
children’s to adult services. That is a very sensitive time, and
the Minister will not need reminding that it was the weakness in the
system of transition that prompted the initiative for the introduction
of the Autism Act. There is much well documented casework about young
people on the autistic spectrum who move from children’s to
adult services that gives us a great deal of cause for concern. As the
noble Lord, Lord Low, has just pointed out, if people do not get their
correct assessment and services at the right time, they simply move on
to more serious deterioration in their condition. Just looking at the
bottom line, it is usually a crisis management situation, which is not
good for the individual and certainly costs the statutory services a
lot more money than it would have done if the transition had been
smooth and matters had been dealt with
properly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:34:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

therefore calls on the Government to consider how this new system of
SEN reforms in the Children and Families Bill will fit with the changes
that are proposed in this Bill. Appropriate planning and support in the
move to adult services is very important, and it is important that
these two areas are co-ordinated. There is a danger that they could be
done quite separately from each other, which would not be in the
interest of the individual concerned. Under the Children and Families
Bill, some young people—for example, those with
autism—will be able to access an assessment for the new
education, health and care plans, which of course will replace what we 
<?notus-xml column=255?>used to refer to as statements, up to the age of 25.
This creates a clear overlap with care assessments under the Care Bill,
which the same young people with autism may be eligible for from the
age of 18. It is very important that the two systems of assessments and
plans talk to each
other<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:35:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000272" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000272">In
particular, that means that when a local authority carries out a needs
assessment, as in Clause 9 of the Care Bill, it must ensure that it is
co-ordinated with any assessment for an education, health and care plan
that may also be under way under a separate piece of legislation. I
have mentioned autism—I am sure that will not surprise my noble
friend—but of course it will apply to young people with other
conditions as well. However, this is particularly important for the
autistic community because we know that it is during that move from the
structure of full-time education in school into adolescent and adult
services that you start to see a great deal of change in the

will speak very quickly to Amendment 88N. I tried with an earlier
amendment to get my noble friend to agree that social work-qualified
staff played a greater role in providing information. I will now have
another go, as when he replied earlier I got the hint that he did not
seem to accept my argument. I will try again in terms of their role of
assessment, which is much more narrowly defined in Amendment 88N. That
amendment ensures that information and advice are not only
proportionate, but that the local authority must employ social
work-qualified staff to provide the information and advice in cases
where present or foreseeable needs are classified as complex. Of
course, this goes into regulation, which is what this part of the Bill
requires.</hs_para>

hope that my noble friend will look more kindly on this particular
recommendation because these are complex needs or—and this is
important—foreseeable complex needs, so you are dealing with
some of the most difficult cases. You are almost certainly looking at
cases where there is some lack of capacity for a start, as well as
people with multiple diagnoses and those with very complex situations.
It is important that social workers are there. I am asking a Minister
with responsibility for health to recognise that unless we in this
House bring social work and healthcare together in statute, whatever
our best intentions, it will not happen. Again, from all that casework
I dealt with—I raised this at Second Reading—as a Member
of Parliament, when somebody sat in my surgery and 
<?notus-xml column=256?>said, “What you need is to get all these
people together round a table”, I, the MP, could never work out
why nobody ever took responsibility for it. By bringing into regulation
the role of the social worker, you make some progress in ensuring that
in these very complex cases things are not only speeded up but that
there is a much better outcome.</hs_para>

Wilkins:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak to Amendment 88A. This
amendment relates to Clause 9, which requires a local
authority to carry out an assessment where an adult may have needs for
care and support. The clause sets out things that the local authority
must consider, for example the outcomes the person wants to achieve in
their day-to-day life. There are similar provisions in Clause 10 in
relation to a carer’s need for support.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:43:15"></hs_TimeCode> is,
however, an anomaly between Clauses 9 and 10. Under Clause
10(6), the local authority also has to take account of whether the
carer works or wants to work, and whether the carer is taking
part—or wants to take part—in education, training or
recreation. That provision is missing from Clause 9, while in other
respects the two clauses closely mirror one another. Surely the same
provision as Clause 10 proposes in relation to carers should apply to
people in need of care and support? While many of those with a need for
care and support may be elderly, or may not be able to—or want
to—work, others will want to. Many will be interested in
education, training or recreation. This is an important gap that sends
an unfortunate message about the ability or desire to work of those
with needs for care and
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000277" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000277">Of

understand that overwhelming evidence exists that carers are often
forced to withdraw from education or employment. That may well be why
the Government felt they should include the emphasis on these things in
relation to the assessment of carers’ needs. Possibly there is
not as much evidence in relation to disabled people, and, as I have
said, many social care users are older people. That does not mean that
they will not be interested in education, training, recreation or even

carers are, of course, children and young people under 18 who provide
regular and ongoing care and emotional support to a family member who
is physically or mentally ill, disabled or misuses substances. The 2011
census identified 178,000 young carers in England and Wales; an 83%
increase in the number of young carers aged five to seven years old;
and a 55% increase in the number of eight and nine year-old children

about a lot of children of a very young age caring for a
very considerable number of hours each

the amendments important? Apart from a concern for the well-being of

only for the family but for the taxpayer and

vital that an assessment of an adult includes the identification of a
young carer—often these young people simply are not
identified—and the impact on them of the care needs of the
parent. The frequent failure to identify many young carers, and the
risk that children are left caring for an adult because the parent has
unmet care and support needs, are the main concerns of the National
Young Carers Coalition, which is behind these

identified that a young carer is involved, the amendments seek
to ensure that an adult will then meet the eligibility criteria and
have their care and support needs met so that children will be
protected from inappropriate caring. Essentially, there should be no
burdensome unmet care and support needs that have to be met by the
child or young person, to their own

rationale for tabling these amendments is that the Care Bill does not
ensure that adult needs are met sufficiently to protect children. The
amendments go further than the draft eligibility regulations, which
state that an adult should be eligible if they are unable to fully
carry out any caring responsibilities they have for a
child—which on the face of it sounds perfectly fine. This will
help ensure that parents with care and support needs receive support so
that they can carry out parenting and other family responsibilities,
and will remove the risk that a child will not be cared for
sufficiently. However, it is also vital that an adult should become
eligible for care and support so that a child is not at risk of having
to meet the adult’s needs.</hs_para>

is one thing to support an adult to parent a child, but even if a
parent fulfils their parenting responsibilities sufficiently, there
could still be care and support needs for which the child may assume
responsibility. It comes down to a definition of parental
responsibility at a particular age. You could say that 11 year-olds can
look after themselves, essentially, and that parents just have to be
loving and kind. However, if the 11<Sup> </Sup>year-old is doing all
the shopping, cooking, washing and washing up, and spending 40 or 50
hours a week doing that, clearly the fact that the mother is loving and
caring will not be adequate. That is the point we are

well illustrated by a comment made by a young person who cares for his
mother. When asked how his mum’s needs should be assessed so
that the family got the right support, he said, “I am the main
person looking after my mum, but the question that needs to be asked
is, ‘What support would be provided to mum if I wasn’t
there? Would mum get more help if I wasn’t there to look after
her? Would her needs be met quite differently?’”. Really,

short, the eligibility criteria do not go far enough. I had to have
this explained to me because, on the face of it, it sounds fine. I
understand that the Government have committed to look at how the Care
Bill, in addition to the Children and Families Bill, might be changed
to protect young carers. I would welcome firm assurances from the

support of Amendment 88B. Certainly, I very much welcome the
opportunity to improve access to the right support for young people
with autism. I have met many young people with autism who have found
that times of change, such as the transition from school to adulthood,
are very challenging. It is the time when families need the appropriate
planning and support to move from children’s services to adult
services. In recent times I have talked to quite a few young people and
their families who tell me that life at the time of transition, as they
move from young people’s services to adult services, is like
standing on a cliff

overlaps between this Bill and the Children and Families Bill. It is
important that these two systems talk to each other. They must not
operate in silos or we will never, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Browning, said, ever get round the table and sort these things out.
That makes common sense and I hope the Minister will recognise
that—although, when I was growing up my mother used to say to

children services proves a real structure barrier, in my experience, to
supporting young carers. Simply improving guidance and the other
methods that have been tried before will not ensure the clear
accountability that is needed for supporting the whole family. I know
that the Minister has spoken before in Committee about the importance
that the Government attach to the family approach—a view that I
share—but a recent evaluation carried out by the
Children’s Society found that the professionals involved believe
that the law must be changed so that there are clearer levers for the
provision of care and support in a way that sustains the whole family,

amendments are needed in the Care Bill to ensure that adults’

distinction between an assessment being about what the needs are and
the ways of meeting them because they look at how needs can be met
other than through the provision of services before any decision about
eligibility has been made. They also raise concerns that a carer might
be pressured into providing care that they do not feel able to
provide—or even that the adult may be pressured into receiving
from a family member. I hope that the Minister will recognise the

want. Clause 25 deals with the care and support or support plan for
people eligible for support, and our amendment again would ensure that
the individual’s capabilities and social or community resources

assessor. The intention of Amendment 88PA is to tighten the duty on
local authorities to consider preventive support following the
determination of eligibility. We want to ensure that local authorities
do not use 
<?notus-xml column=261?>unreasonable justification for refusing to provide or arrange for
preventive support and consider what preventive services would or would
be likely to benefit an
adult<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:57:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000306" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000306">The
current guidance recognises the need for flexibility in certain
circumstances on who undertakes the assessment, and this needs to be
retained. For example, my local authority is in the last processes of
undertaking effectively new assessments of existing clients under the
transfer to self-directed support and personal budgets. As noble Lords
will know, I am a carer and my partner has long-term health and care
needs after suffering a major stroke. Our recent assessment was
undertaken by a very competent member of the personalisation team who
is not a qualified social worker but a former care assistant, so she
fully understood home care support. However, she had access to a
qualified social worker care manager for advice to whom we could also
refer if we needed. I stress that this was an assessment of a care plan
in operation for six years, and under a process that was not
originating the plan but viewing it from the personalisation
perspective. We both found the new, but demanding
process— 44 page forms, as I might have mentioned
before—very helpful in giving new perspectives on issues, such
as risk when I am not at home or contingency arrangements if I am
hospitalised, or fall under the proverbial bus. Most carers just cross
their fingers and hope that it would never happen for their own and the
cared-for person’s sake, but the assessment experience was a
positive opportunity to take stock and a worthwhile experience, which I
hope we are still feeling good about when the personal budget
allocation comes.</hs_para>

my point is that the original assessment was conducted by a qualified
social worker with full understanding of care requirements for major
stroke recoverers, and that assessment has stood the test of time six
years on. Had this assessment been a first time assessment, however, it
would have been vital to have had a qualified social worker, plus any
specialist advice on stroke, if needed. Amendments 88A and 88DA tabled
by the noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, require the local authority to
involve the relevant health practitioner in the needs assessment for
adults and carers under Clauses 9 and 10. We agree that they should be
involved where their specialist skills are needed and that this will
help ensure better integration of health and social care, and overall
better patient
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000308" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000308">I also
support Amendment 88 from my noble friend Lady Wilkins, which provides
for the local authority to have the same duty under Clause 9 for adult
assessments as is given in Clause 10 for carers’ assessments.
This is a logical amendment and I hope the Minister will recognise
that<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

important amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, which
have been added to this group and which we support. These reinforce our
messages in the debate in Committee last week on young
carers—namely that adult assessments need to meet the needs of
the adult, so that children are protected from inappropriate caring.
The noble Baroness has stressed how important this is and I look
forward to the Minister updating us on the developments 
<?notus-xml column=262?>over the interface between the Care Bill and the
Children and Families Bill in respect of young carers and parent

I would stress how important the assessment process is. The
Government’s discussion document on eligibility recognises that
they are an integral part of the system. As we have seen, there are
many separate aspects related to assessments, and it is a pity that, in
this instance, we have had to lump them all into one big debate. I
would therefore urge the Minister, even if he does not agree with the
very strong case presented by noble Lords for including these matters
in the Bill, to undertake to take the issues of concern away
and review this part of the Bill so that there can be full
confidence in the legislation underpinning this important

Lady Wheeler, is quite right that assessments will remain an integral
part of the reformed care and support system. However, rather than
acting primarily as a gateway to the adult receiving care and support,
the future system will place more emphasis on supporting people to
identify their needs; understand the options available to them; plan
for meeting care and support needs, and reduce or delay needs where
that is
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T22:01:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

by the noble Lord, Lord Low, Amendments 87H and 88PB, rightly point out
that intermediate care services, such as reablement, can play a vital
role in helping people regain their independence and in preventing
avoidable re-admissions. Under this Bill, local authorities would be
expected to consider how the provision of reablement and other types of
care and support could contribute to the achievement of an
individual’s desired outcomes as part of the assessment process.
Clause 13(2)(b) makes it clear that, in determining eligibility, local
authorities must consider if the person would benefit from preventive
services—whether or not they have eligible needs. This would
include reablement
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T22:02:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000314" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000314">Amendments
88PA and 88PC, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Low, look to build on the
measures in Clause 13(2) about prevention. Amendment 88PC raises the
issue of individual entitlements to preventive services, facilities and
resources. I hope he would agree that Clause 2 is an important step
forward in itself, capturing prevention in primary legislation for the
first time. It will require local authorities to provide or arrange
prevention services and actively to consider the steps that they should
take. The Bill makes clear that prevention is a core part of care and
support provision, not an optional extra. This duty is only one part of
a broader approach throughout the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T22:03:32"></hs_TimeCode> to
preventing, delaying and reducing
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130709112000315" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-0003.htm#130709112000315">One of
the aims of the pooled budget, to which the noble Lord, Lord Low,
referred, is that local authorities and CCGs should spend it on
preventive services. However, individual entitlements should be built
around people with ongoing needs for care and support—as
they are now. We do not think it is necessary, or
would 
<?notus-xml column=263?>it make sense, for there also to be individually enforceable rights to
preventive services which would be too broad, and therefore carry a
very significant cost burden for local authorities. I took note of the
comments of the noble Lord, Lord Low, on that point but, despite these,
our view is that any enforceable right in this area would almost
unavoidably lead to very high budgetary
pressures.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_09_PT_1/1B9E61C6AC223CAA657CAE74F2A571C8C20EC658" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 July 2013">Tuesday,

turn now to Amendments 87J, 88D, 92ZZF and 92ZZL tabled by the noble
Baroness, Lady Wheeler. We heard during consultation that assessment
processes should look at what an individual wants to achieve and what
they can do, not just at their “deficits” or what they
cannot do. Assessments should help the person to identify their needs,
strengths, goals and aspirations, and consider what type of
proportionate intervention might support them. The purpose of Clause
9(4)(d) is not to suggest that such matters should replace more formal
types of care and support. The clear purpose of the duty is to assess
an adult’s need for care and support. However, it recognises
that in order to make the connections to the variety of support
available in the community, the local authority should consider how
these matters, along with more formal care and support provision, could
be of benefit in achieving the adult’s outcomes.</hs_para>

which the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, spoke so powerfully, raises the
question of employment, education and training, and in doing so repeats
Clause 10(6). This re-enacts specific existing provision for carers in
relation to such issues, which the Law Commission recommended should
remain. We recognise that these areas are of equal importance to adults
receiving care and support. However, it is not necessary to recreate
this provision as local authorities must already consider during the
assessment process the adult’s aspirations in relation to work,
education, training or recreation when considering the outcomes they
wish to achieve.</hs_para>

agree with the principle of joining up assessments when it is sensible
to do so. The provisions in the Care Bill are compatible with those in
the Children and Families Bill, and both Bills allow for joint
assessment. I am satisfied that the Care Bill includes the legal
framework to enable a co-ordinated approach. My noble friend Lady
Browning asked how the Children and Families Bill will fit with this
Bill in relation to care planning, and particularly in relation to
those with autism. The Children and Families Bill will improve
co-operation between all the services that support children with
special educational needs and their families. This will require local
authorities to involve children, young people and parents in reviewing
and developing care for those with special educational needs. Local
authorities will also need to publish information about what relevant
support can be offered locally. The Care Bill and the special
educational needs provisions in the Children and Families Bill require
that there is co-operation within and between local authorities to
ensure that the necessary people co-operate, that the right information
and advice are available, and that assessments can be carried out
jointly. We are in discussion with the Department for Education about
the links between both Bills.</hs_para>

Lady Emerton, proposes in her two amendments that assessments must
involve health professionals. In our view, this would not be
proportionate because not everyone would have health needs or need to
involve a health practitioner. The Bill already allows the individual
to decide if they wish to involve a health professional, and Clause 12
includes a power to allow authorities to carry out a joint assessment
with other bodies such as the NHS.</hs_para>

Browning and the noble Baroness, Lady Wheeler, made important points
about the appropriate training and skills of assessors. Stakeholders
have told us of the importance of having appropriately trained

noble friend Lady Browning asked why we have not specified that a
qualified social worker should carry out assessments on people with
complex needs. The social care workforce, as she well knows, is a
mixture of qualified social workers and care managers who have been
trained to carry out tasks such as assessments. It is, we believe, for
local authorities to determine the mix of their workforces. Local
authorities should also make a professional judgment on who has the
appropriate skills and training to carry out assessments, and I really
do not think it would be appropriate to do this from the
centre.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_09_PT_1/BA1DC788E4F5B1D26080F829522AEEA514085E3E" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 July 2013">Tuesday,

Lady Meacher, raises an important point through Amendments 88SA and
88SB about the eligibility criteria for adults with care and support
needs helping to prevent young carers from taking on inappropriate or
excessive caring responsibilities that can impact adversely on their

for care and support will be eligible if, because of mental or physical
impairment or illness, they are unable to carry out fully any caring
responsibilities for a child, or need support to maintain family
relationships. Our policy intention is to encourage local authorities
to take a whole-family approach, both in assessing and supporting an
adult needing care and support, meaning that an individual adult is not
seen in isolation from their family circumstances. That would include
having to identify the

92ZZCZA follows the same principle, but seeks to add to the duty to
meet eligible needs. As I have set out, we see the appropriate way of
dealing with the issue of avoiding inappropriate young caring roles to
be through the eligibility criteria. We would not wish to create a new
stand-alone duty in this regard, which may have a distorting effect on
the duty in Clause 18, but rather to ensure that such matters are
reflected in the determination of eligible needs. However, as I
indicated in debate last week, we need to ensure that the developmental
and educational needs of young 
<?notus-xml column=265?>people are appropriately considered in the context of children’s
legislation and services. We will work with stakeholders, including the
National Young Carers Coalition, to ensure that, for their part, adult
care and support services make appropriate provision in supporting an
adult’s needs for care and support to prevent inappropriate or
excessive caring by a child. However, we also need to keep in view what
should be provided through children’s services and that is what

this Bill is enacted, people cannot begin accruing costs towards the
cap until 1 April 2016. That does not mean that preparation cannot be
made locally before that time. We believe that it is appropriate for
local authorities to begin assessing people ahead of 1 April
2016. To ensure that local authorities can take advantage of this
opportunity, we have provided £335 million to fund the
implementation of our reforms. This should enable local authorities to
begin assessing people’s needs for care and support around six
months before April 2016, if they choose to do so.</hs_para>

Hanworth:</Member></B> Clause 113, which makes provision for the sale
of the Government’s pipeline and storage system, is the central
clause of an extraneous part of the Bill, which should not exist and
which the amendment seeks to remove. The provisions in Part 4 are
enabling clauses designed to ensure that the future sale of the asset,
were it to occur, would not be subject to any further parliamentary
scrutiny but would be entirely at the discretion of the Secretary of
State. As such, it is an affront to the rest of
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:31:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000004">We
are told that the purpose of the sale would be to raise cash and to
avoid the burden on the state of the costs of maintaining and investing
in the pipeline system. Parenthetically, this declared intention of
burdening the purchaser with the costs is liable to make the asset
virtually unsaleable except at a knockdown price unless, of course, the
purchaser can expect to extract exorbitant monopoly
profits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:31:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000005">I
should say briefly what the Government pipeline and storage
system—the GPSS—consists of. It is a pipeline system run
by the Oil and Pipelines Agency in the Ministry of Defence. The network
consists of 2,500 kilometres of pipeline and some 46 other facilities
and is interconnected with several private networks. The pipeline was
originally built before World War 2 and was used to supply oil for the
Normandy invasion via Pluto, the pipeline under the ocean. Nowadays, in
addition to supplying fuel required for defence purposes, it supplies
fuel for civil aviation, which takes as much as 40% of the
supplies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:32:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000006">The
GPSS is what economists describe as a natural monopoly. It might be
helpful if I were to supply a definition of a natural monopoly and
provide further examples. A monopoly is a situation in which the
majority of sales in a market are attributable to a single firm. A
natural monopoly is a circumstance in which the technology of an
industry and its associated costs imply that the most efficient form of
production is to concentrate it in a single firm or organisation.
Examples include the road and rail networks, the postal system, the
provision of gas, water and electricity, the nation’s ports and
much else
besides<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:33:18"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:33:15"></hs_TimeCode>.
It is commonly 
<?notus-xml column=36?>agreed that in order to ensure the integrity of a natural monopoly and
to ensure that it does not generate exorbitant profits, the state
should play a leading role either by owning the monopoly or, at the
very least, by regulating it closely.</hs_para>

ideology of free market enterprise and the programme of
denationalisation have come into conflict with the realities of the
structure of industries, and there have been some absurd outcomes.
Through the programme of denationalisation, which began under the
Thatcher Administrations and which was intended to engender free market
competition, the Government have succeeded, in the main, in creating
collusive oligopolies. The electricity industry, for example, which is
dominated by six large firms, is nowadays best described as an
oligopolistic
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:34:10"></hs_TimeCode>. In the
most misguided instances of denationalisation, the Government have
created monopolies that are in the hands of foreign state-owned
enterprises. A case in point is the British nuclear industry, which is
in the hands of a French state-owned monopoly.</hs_para>

of the motives of denationalisation, which I have already touched on,
is the desire to remove the capital costs of state-owned industries
from the Government’s net borrowing requirement. In Britain, we
have been exceedingly inept at what should be a simple exercise of
corporate structuring and accountancy. A previous Labour Government
proposed to overcome the restrictions on the borrowing requirement by
encouraging the formation of public-private partnerships. The outcome
has been that in return for providing a share of the investment
capital, the private sector partners have reaped exorbitant returns
and, in doing so, run rings around public
servants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000009">The
successor Government should have endeavoured to find better ways of
achieving the desired ends. Instead, they have reverted to an atavistic
ideology that impels them eagerly to sell anything that amounts to
public property. Governments in other countries have been far more
adept than ours in the business of separating the finances of their
state-owned industries from the finances of central government. A
relevant example in the context of the Energy Bill is provided by the
French state-owned electricity industry. The principal electricity
companies of France, EDF and AREVA, work in close collaboration. They
also work with central government to fulfil their strategic policies,
but they have considerable commercial freedom. This freedom is
exemplified by the fact that our Government have been relying on EDF to
raise the capital from the financial markets for the construction of a
new nuclear power plant at Hinckley
Point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000010">I return
now to the prospective sale of the GPSS. This should never be allowed
to happen. One ought to consider the hazards that could arise from
putting the network into private hands. The Bill would do nothing to
constrain a private owner from abusing the monopoly position by reaping
exorbitant profits, nor does it compel the private owner to undertake
the necessary maintenance and investment. The consequences of the
system falling into disrepair are obvious. Let us leave aside for the
moment the consequences for our national defences to consider how this
would affect the civil aviation industry. It would mean that aviation 
<?notus-xml column=37?>fuels that are presently pumped through the system would have to travel
on our roads in tankers, which surely implies a major
hazard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000011">Let us
consider the possible private owners of the system. Who would they be?
I am sure that we agree that we would not wish the owners to be venture
capitalists intent on reaping major short-term rewards. We might prefer
them to be enterprises that already have commitments to and experience
of such aspects of fuel supply. In that case, the likelihood is that
the owner would be a major oil or gas supplier or producer and, most
probably, given the state of the ownership of the UK industry, it would
be a foreign-owned enterprise. It could be Qatar Petroleum, for
example, or the giant Russian Gazprom company. If it were the latter,
we can imagine a fanciful scenario: there is a conflict in the eastern
Mediterranean or the Middle East and various NATO allies have decided
that the only viable intervention is to create a no-fly zone in the
area. If we were to participate in this, the GPSS would be called upon
to provide large quantities of aviation fuel to our Air Force, which
would be a contingent of the international force. The owners of the
erstwhile GPSS could then threaten a major embarrassment if we were to
proceed with this interventionist military policy. They could threaten
to bring our civil aviation to a halt unless we relented.</hs_para>

a scenario is not beyond the bounds of possibility and surely we would
not wish to expose ourselves to such hazards. Were these hazards to be
recognised and understood by the usual electorate of the Conservative
Party, I am sure that there would be outrage. For this reason, I would
expect that the proposal to sell the GPSS will go into
abeyance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000013">I see

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> I would not perhaps go quite so
far as my noble friend on these matters but it is important that we get
from the Minister an indication of the regime under which a privatised
gas storage and pipeline system would operate. Given that this will be
a natural monopoly, as has been clearly explained, it ought to be under
the regulatory scrutiny of Ofgem. If it is to be a natural monopoly, it
should be regulated. At the moment, who owns it and for what purposes
we leave other people to worry about. However, those of us who attended
the talk last week by Peter Atherton might find it difficult to
identify a potential purchaser of this system because it seems that it
is a kind of secondary purchase, given the dire nature of a number of
the obvious potential purchasers. They have far greater strains on
their balance sheets than acquiring an asset like this, no matter how
profitable it might
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:42:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000015">We
may be worrying needlessly that this power will be granted as the
Government may not do anything about it. However, were they to do so,
it is important that an asset of this nature should not fall into
monopoly 
<?notus-xml column=38?>hands of an unregulated character. Therefore, I certainly want to be
given a clear indication from the Minister this afternoon that if this
asset is to be privatised it will come under the scrutiny and
regulation of Ofgem. I am not certain that such a move would raise
sufficient money. It may be just another burden that DECC has to carry
at present, and it feels that it would be simpler to transfer it.
However, that is not the issue in question here: it is whether the
people who buy the asset have unlimited powers to do whatever they wish
with it or whether it should be subject to some kind of regulation. It
need not necessarily be draconian but, rather, light-touch
regulation—the kind which, in some respects, the regulator
applies to National Grid and the wires and the pipes it owns and

the time of the fall of the Soviet Union I was approached by a Russian
general who asked whether I or anyone I knew would like to purchase a
fully integrated Russian military pipeline system throughout the
Russian Federation, which he thought would become available and would
be sold by the Soviet army. Therefore, the noble Viscount can be

words to what my noble friend Lord Howell has said. I congratulate the
noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, on his imagination which allowed him to
stray into paths that upset even so stalwart a Labour supporter as his
noble friend. The privatisation programme was hugely successful. I was
responsible for launching the first one—the privatisation of
British Telecom. If you talk to the people who use that company and
work for it, they will tell you that the whole picture has been utterly
transformed. There have been a number of others, so I do not agree with

the Minister tell the Committee today by what means Parliament will be
able to assess the analysis and ask for certainties beyond the bland
assurances already provided by the Minister of State in the other

recognised that a sale contract would be a private matter and not
wholly for Parliament. No doubt the Public Accounts Committee may also
scrutinise any sale. However, nothing in the clause deals with the
contractual nature or goes beyond any theoretical possibility. Will the
Government explain why they want to sell and whether they may limit the
sale or lease to the use of the pipeline and retain the fabric or even
vice versa? Any transfer would want to pass over as many liabilities as
possible while retaining as many benefits. Is there any comfort in
Clause 113 providing that it must be for valuable consideration? I
presume that the Minister can qualify this as positive valuable
consideration and will exclude negative valuable
consideration—that is, someone is paid to take it away or it is
part of a larger transaction as an uncosted supplement. Will the
Minister also clarify what conditions the Government consider
appropriate when asking this Committee to acquiesce to this

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Astor

because it allows for the sale or lease of the GPSS or a part of it. At
the current time, the rights to operate and maintain the GPSS and to
access land for this purpose are personal to the Secretary of State for
Defence. This clause allows the Secretary of State for Defence to
transfer these rights, thereby enabling the system to be sold or
leased. A decision on sale or lease will be made once further analysis
has been undertaken and we have engaged with the market. The clause
also allows the transfer of
liabilities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000033">Having

the strategic importance of the GPSS was raised, including the need for
it to provide assured fuel supply to certain sites. Through the work
conducted to date, we are confident that we will be able to put a
contract in place to meet the continuing requirements of the Ministry
of Defence and the United States visiting forces, which will offer the

Similarly, the potential impact of sale on commercial customers has
been raised. The Department of Energy and Climate Change and the
Department for Transport have jointly reviewed the implications of a
sale of the GPSS on the market, including access and charging, and
concluded that while it transports a significant proportion of fuel to
the major airports, existing regulatory provisions, particularly the
Pipe-Lines Act 1962, are sufficient and no further regulation is
required<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:05:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000035">On
physical security, I reassure noble Lords that we do not believe that
the sale will make the GPSS any more vulnerable to terrorist attack
than other equivalent infrastructure operated by the private sector,
such as the electricity and gas distribution networks, particularly
since the pipeline and storage tanks are predominantly built
underground to make the system less vulnerable. Officials at the Oil
and Pipelines Agency regularly discuss, with appropriate external
organisations, measures to best protect the GPSS, including from the
risk of cyberattack. We would expect a purchaser to continue these
measures
post-sale.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000036">Questions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:06:32"></hs_TimeCode>
were also raised regarding the impact on safety and the environment
following the sale of the GPSS. Any owner has an inherent interest in
running the system in a safe manner and would need to comply with the
same legislation and regulations as the Oil and Pipelines Agency does
at present, such as the 
<?notus-xml column=42?>regulations under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Pipeline
Safety Regulations 1996. Therefore, it is not believed that a sale
would have any adverse impact in these
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000037">Lastly,
and quite rightly, the value for money of a sale has been raised. A
final decision on sale is dependent on being able to strike the right
deal with the private sector, and value for money is a key
consideration. Work is ongoing to update the initial value-for-money
analysis that was undertaken in 2011 and which underpinned the impact
assessment published alongside these clauses. To refine these financial
figures, we have appointed external advisers to undertake a forensic
examination of the GPSS costs and revenues, including any potential
liabilities associated with the ongoing operation of the system. This
work will inform a final decision on sale, which we aim to make by the

monopoly. The GPSS does not supply Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester
directly—this is done via third-party pipelines. The GPSS

However, most of us are agreed that in the drive to reduce greenhouse
emissions by increasing the amount of electricity generated from

whereby we are irreparably damaging the environment by siting
infrastructure inappropriately in vulnerable landscapes. I should at
this point make it clear that I am honorary president of the Campaign

greenhouse gas emissions. In this respect, is it perhaps arguable that
commercial interests are being allowed to have too much influence on
government policy? To achieve our emission reductions, we have become
reliant on public money through direct and indirect subsidy and a
planning system that remains weighted in favour of development. There
is far less focus on energy conservation and research into new
technologies. Meanwhile, cost-benefit analyses of wind installations
need to be more rigorous, for example, by taking into account the total
cost of conveying the energy from the generator to the consumer or the

to say that the ECC has made it clear that the Government intend wider
public consultation in drafting the strategic policy statement. The
Government have recognised that consultation will be
important in order to ensure that the priorities and outcomes are well
chosen and do not have unintended effects. As well as the statutory
requirements for consultation, I gather that the Government will expect
to engage informally with a range of stakeholders to ensure that the
draft is based on good-quality information. This is crucial. Surely it
will be vital to ensure that the right stakeholders, including
technical experts, consumer groups, land managers, planners and NGOs
concerned with environmental impacts, are involved. The amendment to

other strategic national  
<?notus-xml column=47?>policies, including, for example, transport and communications. The
Government’s policy on energy is clearly complex and is set out
in a number of documents. It would greatly assist the understanding of

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Judd, for
tabling these amendments, which are important and relevant at this
stage of the Bill and I was pleased to add my name to them. I approach
this part of the Bill with memories of the discussions that we have had
in various planning Bills in recent times, particularly the Planning
Act 2008. This Bill is clearly mainly about the promotion and
regulation of energy, whereas from the planning perspective it was
about the relationship of the town and country planning system to
energy production. It is right, particularly when we are talking about
high-level policy statements, that we should come to how the two
systems interact, and I am grateful to the noble Lord for introducing
these amendments that allow us to do so.</hs_para>

statement proposed in this part of the Bill is about the strategic
priorities in UK energy policy, the intended policy outcomes and the 
<?notus-xml column=48?>roles and responsibilities of the people involved in implementing them.
There has been a lot of discussion already on the Bill about
environmental objectives, and the Bill is crucial, but the main debate
is about the high-level environmental objectives of tackling climate
change. Indeed, some noble Lords have suggested that the
Government’s policy on this is unnecessary, wrong or over the
top. The question that the noble Lord’s amendments raise is an
important one: how far these high-level climate change environmental
objectives should be at the expense of the local environment. This is a
tension, it is a clash, and there is no point in running away from it.
There will have to be balance and compromise, as there always has been,
and it is right to discuss it now.</hs_para>

sacrifice a considerable amount of local ecology and biodiversity in
the interests of the global environment, but the further question that
the noble Lord raised is how far we have to sacrifice the amenity

subjective but, as I think the noble Lord said at the beginning of his
speech, vital for people’s well-being—their spiritual
health, I think he called
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000071">We are

powers to be given to the Secretary of State—whoever that

responsible for compiling the statement of policy and strategy. He is
already responsible for compiling the planning policy statements. Okay,
those come through Parliament but he is still responsible for them. He
is responsible for determining applications for development consent for
all but the smallest energy-related planning proposals. It seems that
he is the legislator, prosecutor, judge and jury, and no doubt when
proposals are agreed he will be there urging them on as, I assume, not
quite a clerk of works—but who knows?—and chief cook and
bottle-washer. That really seems, in planning terms at least, an
astonishing concentration of decision-making within one department and
one Secretary of State. The checks and balances of good planning, and
of good investment decisions, may be there if it all goes okay. If it

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, from the outset I
acknowledge the long-standing interest that the noble Lord, Lord Judd,
has in the countryside and the impact of energy infrastructure on the
landscape. The noble Lord referred to this matter at Second Reading. I
know that my noble friend Lord Greaves also has a lasting interest in
wild

a countryman who cares about all these things very strongly, I
understand where noble Lords are coming
from<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:46:59"></hs_TimeCode>. This is an
important issue, and one that the Government recognise, which is why we
have already put in place various safeguards within the planning and
regulatory system to ensure that visual amenity and other
sustainability issues are taken into account before decisions on
infrastructure are made. Ofgem has a clear duty to contribute to the
achievement of sustainable development; it must have regard to the
effect on the environment of activities connected with the conveyance
of gas through pipes and the generation, transmission, distribution and
supply of electricity. It is also required to carry out impact
assessments for important decisions, which would include consideration
of sustainability implications, including local environmental
impacts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:47:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000086">Amendments
41 and 46 would require the Government to undertake sustainability
assessments of the policy set out in the strategy and policy statement
before it is either designated or amended. Of course, it is important
that the impact of regulatory decisions is assessed, but the intention
of the strategy and policy statement is to reflect existing policy; it
will not be a vehicle for the introduction of new policy or duties, nor
will it contain any regulatory or planning decisions. The more
appropriate time for consideration of the potential environmental
impact of energy policy proposals is when they are being considered by
the planning authorities—and I entirely understand what my noble
friend Lord Greaves says about balance. Existing legislation, including
in relation to the energy national policy statements, already provides
the framework to ensure that this is
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:49:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000087">Amendments

that it will increase the accountability of the regulator. That is also
reflected in the requirement to report annually on its contribution to
meeting the strategy and policy statement’s policy outcomes.
Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Judd, referred to the question of the
requirement to demonstrate compliance with Ofgem’s environmental
duties. Ofgem will be required to report on how it contributes to
meeting the policy outcomes in the statement. Existing duties will
still apply and we would expect Ofgem’s report to take account
of those and how they impact on relevant regulatory actions. I would
also expect both the work plan and the annual report to cover the

that the noble Lord, Lord Judd, made. That duty is imposed by the Gas
Act and the Electricity Act and will still apply even if the guidance
were to be repealed. As I have pointed out, nothing in the strategy and

noble Lords and I will read the Minister’s speech very
carefully. There was some helpful stuff in it. I have two questions.
First, given that we will have the whole summer before we return for
Report, might it be possible to firm up the kind of thing that might be
in the SPS referring specifically to social and environmental issues as
the replacement, which it says that it is going to be, for the stuff
repealed by Clause 126? Secondly, does the Minister accept that,
despite the fact that the NPS and SPS have different roles and
therefore different purposes, if they were in conflict in any way, even
in quite detailed ways, that might cause problems because people would
pick up one and quote it against the other? If the SPS is to reflect
existing policy, in those areas where it covers the same areas as the
NPS on energy—and it clearly will in some areas—does it
mean that it will follow the NPS, that the NPS will be the superior
document and that the SPS will simply reflect the NPS or is it more
complex than that? If it is more complex than that, we might want to
come back on
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000096"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Judd" PimsId="1230" UID="1307101000307" xid="1143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000307">Lord

reply. It is very characteristic of him. Secondly, I thank the noble
Lord, Lord Greaves, for his support, and I thank my Front Bench for the
general good will in this respect. I hope this is not regarded as a
point that is to be dismissed because it is seen as partisan. I was
formed in the war and immediately afterwards, and I have always been
very glad that the post-war Labour Government, whom I hold in high
esteem, were pioneers in fighting for a lot of what I have been talking
about today: the importance of countryside to people and the well-being
of the nation. That flag was immediately and without controversy picked
up and warmly endorsed by many in all parts of British politics, and
that is Britain at its best. We must be very careful that we do not
inadvertently let it erode to the point that what we leave to our

the Minister. As is always said, the devil is in the detail, but my

They should be central to all parts of government. From that

doing things and I want to see effective arrangements for achieving
results. That is why I strongly associate myself with what was argued
from this side of the Committee earlier about the need for targets and
all the rest because we need to make effective progress. If we are
successful in that, there will be tremendous drive from industry and
others to get in on the act and play their part, and all credit to them

where I have anxieties. This is not a partisan view because I had the
same anxieties under the previous Administration. I want to see this
issue become a driving force alongside the rest. People in specialist
organisations take these issues seriously. I mentioned the John Muir
Trust. I hope that noble Lords will get hold of its briefing, which I
have used extensively, read it for themselves and meet people such as
the personnel and staff of the John Muir Trust and others who argue
their case well. Genuine officials and deeply committed public servants
are putting their point of view from one angle and highly qualified
deeply committed people in other parts of national life are as
concerned about this issue as anybody else. I do not think that we take

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment speaks to the
setting of the strategy and policy statement required by the Bill. Part
5 is an interesting aspect of the Bill because it moves away from
purely electricity and considers all energy matters. It requires that a
strategy and policy statement be maintained and formulated for Great
Britain’s strategic priorities in relation to energy policy. I
stress that because, as we all know, energy policy is far more than
simply electricity or gas but encompasses all the primary energy used
to supply energy to businesses and consumers for heat, electricity and
transportation needs. This may seem academic but it is important to
stress this because time and again Governments have been tempted to
equate energy with electricity. They often extend that to include gas
but it is rare for there to be a holistic view of all energy. The
establishment of the Department of Energy and Climate Change created a
structure in which I had hoped that a more holistic view of energy
could be
developed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000104">However,
there are still departments of government with responsibility for
energy that sit outside the DECC framework, most notably the Department
for Transport, and it is not quite clear how the Department of Energy
and Climate Change relates to other departments that have an impact on
energy policy. That is true at a departmental level.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1307101000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000105">At the regulatory
level—this part of the Bill also deals with the independent
regulator Ofgem and its duties—there is clearly a gap. I am
encouraged that the setting of a strategic policy statement will, I
hope, create a much clearer framework of who is doing what and who has
responsibility for what. We have a regulator for electricity and gas,
but it is not an energy regulator. The powers do not extend to the many
consumers who are off the gas grid network and rely on unregulated
sources of energy. Periodically there are concerns, which often reach
the media, about people who have been forced to purchase from other
suppliers and be completely dependent on that fuel in the winter
months. There is no price regulation there.</hs_para>

place have raised concerns over how non-domestic consumers are
represented by our regulator. We tend to equate the regulation as being
on behalf of consumers but that is a broad definition and there is a
subset of consumers, the small and medium-sized enterprises, which are
facing considerable issues. I hope that Ofgem’s remit will cover
them and that we hear more about how they can be protected.</hs_para>

amendment to force the Government to consider the gaps in current
regulation. That will become increasingly important, not least because,
as 
<?notus-xml column=56?>we move forward with a low-carbon agenda, the three major energy
markets—electricity, heat and transport—are starting to
merge and cross over. The noble Lord, Lord Flight, last week tabled an
amendment on the interplay between biofuels being used in the heat
market and transport markets. These issues are becoming increasingly
apparent. It is not just that fuels can be diverted into different
markets but a process of electrification of transport and heat is
underway. I do not know what all the issues will be as we go down this
path but we should certainly have a regulator capable of looking across
all the energy markets.</hs_para>

that we hope the SPS will address is the creeping lack of clarity about
the relative roles of the department and the regulator. I give just two
examples. At the moment, there is a tendency for Ofgem to be involved
in policy. Perhaps the most notable example of that is Project
Discovery, Ofgem’s foray into the murky world of security of
supply, which takes it well beyond the role of a price and market
regulator into a policy arena in which the department should operate.
On the other hand, the department is starting to act like a price
regulator, with the Prime Minister starting to make policy on tariffs.
We are shortly to hear a lot more about those proposals but it is clear
that there is an increasing crossover and complete lack of clarity
here. I hope that this SPS will help to address that.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1307101000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000109">My next point relates to
how the commodity markets are regulated. This is an important issue
because, as we have seen in the press in a number of cases, where there
is potential for market abuse there needs to be a clear regulatory
framework. In the commodity fuel markets, there is a lack of clarity on
the distinction between where the FCA is involved in regulating markets
and where Ofgem’s role starts. This will become a very important
issue, not least because we are now considering a Bill in which we are
placing quite a high degree of emphasis on reference prices against
which we will be comparing strike prices. I have raised this in the
very helpful briefings we have had in the run-up to the Bill. I was
referred to the implementation of REMIT, a Europe-wide move to prevent
abuses in the wholesale energy market, but I am not fully reassured by
that. I have a number of questions in relation to it. Has it been
implemented in the UK? When will it be implemented? The deadline for
the introduction of penalties for abuse was 29 June. Have we
implemented the penalties? Are we compliant with that European
requirement?</hs_para>

When we are looking at a system that is highly dependent on
market-based prices, I am concerned about who is going to ensure that
the data that go into that process are comprehensive, holistic and not
subject to abuse. In the oil market, we have heard of abuses by oil
companies and about rating agencies colluding to provide only a small
part of the information, not the full picture. If that is possible, do
we not need to look at statutory underpinning for this information? How
can we develop robust reference prices if the information provided to
rating agencies is done on a voluntary basis and has no statutory
underpinning? What are we doing to ensure that we have full and
complete transparency in the data that are provided to develop these
reference prices?</hs_para>

surprise that our party is very critical of Ofgem. I have said that I
do not think that the role of Ofgem is broad enough and have talked
about the lack of clarity and the confusion about where the
FCA’s role starts and where Ofgem’s role starts. The most
worrying criticism of the regulator is that it is failing in its
current remit. It is not acting to enforce fairness. Its process of
reform started in 2008 and was evaluated in 2011. Of the 16 benchmarks
set to compare progress against, 12 showed no improvement. That is
simply not good enough. From 2008 to 2011 is a long period, and there
was no improvement in 12 of those benchmarks. Ofgem is clearly failing
in its stated purpose of enforcing fairness in the market.</hs_para>

up to expectations about transparency in the market. I know that this
will come up in later parts of the Bill as we talk about access to
markets and liquidity. In 2011, the accountants BDO issued a report, I
think at the behest of the Government, looking at what could be done to
improve transparency in the market. Eight recommendations were made. Of
them, six were quietly dropped; only two were pursued, and they were
varied from the original advice. This is a serious issue, and this is
the part of the Bill where we talk about the authority and the role of
regulation. We have very serious concerns about Ofgem’s remit
and its ability to deliver on its current functions. Our policy would
be to replace this regulator with a regulator fit for purpose to
deliver proper regulation and to protect consumers now and in the
future across the whole energy market.</hs_para>

true that matters such as the supply of heating oil or liquid petroleum
gas do not fall within the energy regulator’s remit, but there
are good reasons for this. A chief component of Ofgem’s remit is
to regulate the monopoly companies that run the electricity and gas
networks. No equivalent natural or structural monopolies for
distribution or supply exist in other energy sectors, so the Government
do not consider that there is currently a case for them to be regulated
by Ofgem or a new energy regulator. We need to bear in mind that
increased regulation would be likely to increase the costs for
businesses operating in these sectors, which would probably be passed
on to their customers. This of course would be a concern to domestic
and non-domestic customers. I entirely agree with the noble Baroness;
we must think of non-domestic customers and small and medium-sized
businesses, which are so much part of the economic recovery.</hs_para>

amendment would require that the reporting of the current annual energy

requirement. If I am wrong and this Bill has some tough provisions for
the Government to report on progress, I apologise and look forward to

saying that the Government will now amend this definition  of
fuel poverty; instead of having 4.5 million in fuel poverty, we have
only 2.5 million, so that is all right then. The second thing was the
price of fuel having doubled in the past seven or eight years and the
prospects of it doubling again in the near future. The third thing was

I am encouraged that that there are reporting requirements of which I

statutory requirement on Ofgem to report does not do what the annual
policy statement on energy strategy does because, as we have just

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I will also speak to the other
amendments in this group. We now come to what is probably, in the
outside world, the most important part of the Bill. We had a huge
discussion on nuclear regulation and a very substantial discussion on
issues relating to carbon targets but the millions of people out there
are concerned about—I agree with the early part of the noble
Earl’s remarks just now—the very rapid doubling of prices
for fuel and the more than doubling, on the old measure at any rate, of
the level of fuel poverty. That is what the consumer dimension and the
consumer objectives of energy policy, among all the others, need to
address.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000142">The
original Bill did not include Clause 127. It is a fairly hefty clause,
with three clauses after that follow it through, but it is nevertheless
a pretty thin part of the totality of the approach to energy policy
represented by the Bill. It owes its genesis almost entirely to a
remark by the Prime Minister in October last year when he effectively
promised that everybody would be on the lowest possible tariff. There
was some consternation at the time in the noble Baroness’s
department and Ofgem about what the Prime Minister actually meant by
that. Ofgem rapidly engaged in some internal work, some of which was
very welcome. It is now engaged in two consultations on how to put that
into effect. Clause 127 gives effect to some of the issues covered and
recommended in the Ofgem
consultation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000143">However,
the clause does not really deliver the Prime Minister’s
objective. It probably delivers some greater transparency and certainly
delivers a very welcome requirement on reducing the extraordinarily
confusing number of tariffs that consumers face at the moment. But
underlying it, it betrays—as my noble friend implied just
now—a huge lack of trust in Ofgem to deliver 
<?notus-xml column=64?>this. Clause 127—probably correctly given Ofgem’s present
state and record—is full of subsections allowing the Secretary
of State effectively to intervene and tell Ofgem what to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000144">There are
delicate issues of independent regulation here. There are important
issues as to where policy lies in terms of the department as against
the regulator and where legislation lies as against secondary
legislation and Ofgem’s own rules. It is an odd approach in many
ways. However, given the deficiencies of regulation in terms of
consumer benefit, it is not one I entirely reject, but if we are to go
down that road we need to be clear why we are giving the Secretary of
State such powers of intervention. In another context, and in relation
to, for example, the statement of policy, the Government wish to step
back and give the regulator, in this sector as in others, a general
framework to act on for five years. This clause gives the Secretary of
State the ability to intervene at all sorts of points on all sorts of
issues in all sorts of ways, but does not really explain for what
purpose. Subsections (5) and (6) of Clause 127 lay down the way in
which the Secretary of State could intervene, but no part of Clause 127
explains for what
purpose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000145">My
amendments today are to try to establish that purpose and thereby to
achieve what I think was behind the Prime Minister’s
intervention, which is that that every household should, as far as
practicable, know the most appropriate tariff for their circumstances
or that there should be an obligation on their supplier to ensure that
they know it. Whether that is always the cheapest tariff depends a bit,
but it is certainly not delivered by Clause 127 as it stands or by
current Ofgem
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000146">In a
sense, I am taking the Prime Minister’s text and trying to give
the Secretary of State basic objectives for intervention which would
help to achieve the objectives we seek, in particular, the ability to
intervene in order to ensure more economic use of energy in terms of
energy conservation, energy efficiency and decarbonisation and to
ensure that tariffs are more affordable, at least for domestic
consumers—there are also industrial consumers who do not really
feature here, even microbusinesses, which also need to be
addressed—in terms of affordability in general and fuel poverty
in particular.</hs_para>

had time to absorb the full impact of the Secretary of State’s
intervention on fuel poverty strategy today. As the noble Earl said,
redefining a problem does not make it go away. However you redefine
fuel poverty, it is always a very big number. At the moment, it is
going up seriously. While some of the changes in definition that
underlie John Hill’s recommendations, which the Government seem
to have adopted, are quite sensible—there is a total income
gateway to being defined as fuel poor whereas on the previous formula
some very rich people could have been so defined—that is a
relatively minor point. The problem about the redefinition, which the
Government, Ofgem and all of us who care about fuel poverty will have
to address, is that whereas the previous formula was arguably far too
sensitive to price movements, the present formula is very insensitive
to price movements, yet price movements are what define whether you
fall 
<?notus-xml column=65?>in or out of fuel poverty. With insensitivity to price,  it is
going to be quite difficult to shift that new total  so the aim
of reducing fuel poverty will prove more
difficult.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000148">I am
trying to help the Secretary of State here, at least to have some
clarity about what powers of intervention he has on fuel poverty and
other issues. Clause 50A allows the Secretary of State to require Ofgem
to put a requirement on a supplier licence to require tariffs aimed at
reducing fuel poverty, for example, tariffs aimed at low-income
households or associated with energy-efficiency measures to reduce the
totality of the bill, probably funded via the ECO. My amendment also
allows for tariffs aimed at low users or at low-income, high-use
households. These tariffs would be options. They would not be mandatory
over the whole range of tariffs and therefore they would allow Ofgem to
require and the supplier to allocate people to the most appropriate
tariff for their circumstances, which must be the aim of this
policy.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307101000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000149">There
are all sorts of ways in which you could require a tariff which
encouraged energy efficiency, in aggregate or in timing of energy use.
For example, you could have a different range of tariffs where the
marginal cost of the next unit of electricity was higher than the
average cost. In almost all tariffs now the opposite is true. You
could, as the Select Committee on which I sit heard from the Belgian
authorities a few months ago, make it so that the opening tranche of
initial units was free until you hit a certain minimum usage, and then
there would be very high disincentive if you went beyond that level.
You could have the whole structure of rising block tariffs, which is
one way of doing it. All those methods would encourage behaviour and
energy usage that reduced total energy usage and bills.</hs_para>

also have tariffs that were designed to shift the time at which you
used the energy. In earlier debates, other noble Lords and, indeed, I
referred to the situation in California where a 5% reduction in peak
usage leads to a 50% reduction in the total cost of the system. I have
no reason to believe that GB usage is much different, and we need
tariffs that seriously encourage use at non-peak times, with lower
rates at night and lower rates taking you away from peak usage. The aim
to achieve all those options would be a reason for the Secretary of
State to intervene if, and only if, Ofgem were not already requiring it
or supplier companies were not prepared to do it.</hs_para>

other possibility for a need for intervention would be if tariffs were
discriminatory, and this amendment would deal with discrimination by
method of payment. It has always seemed absurd to me that the cost to
someone paying via a prepayment meter has been hugely
higher—slightly less high than it used to be, but nevertheless
still higher—than to someone who pays by direct debit. The
security of income to the supplier is almost the same; if anything, in
fact, it is slightly less secure because you can always cancel a direct
debit whereas you have already paid for the usage on a prepayment
meter. That discrimination by method of payment has always seemed daft
to me, and there ought to be a 
<?notus-xml column=66?>general provision over most tariffs, if not all. The lack of that could
be another reason for the Secretary of State’s
intervention.</hs_para>

discrimination is covered in Amendment 50F, which is, in effect,
between different fuels. As has been mentioned previously in Committee,
this is discrimination against electricity consumers who bear the full
brunt of the ECO—and other add-ons, but particularly the ECO in
this context—as against gas consumers or, to some extent,
dual-fuel users. The Secretary of State could intervene to
remove discrimination between types of
fuel.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000153">Amendment
50D would require the Government to provide information. Ofgem and the
Government have gone some way down this road. The proposition is that
there should be a transparent price mechanism,  a TCR. I cannot
remember quite what TCR stands for and I cannot read my writing at this
point, but the proposition from Ofgem is that we should have a
comparison process that compares the average payments so that the
consumer can look at the average rates on different forms of tariff. I
know that the consumer groups feel that this is still a fairly
confusing basis for comparison and that, despite the profusion and the
useful help that comparison sites provide in most cases, a lot of
consumers do not understand how to use it. This process could require a
direct unit price comparison by tariff or by tranches of usage per
tariff. That seems to me probably the only way of comparing price which
a lot of consumers will understand. The suppliers will be required to
provide this. They recently carried out a survey which shows that
two-thirds of people understand that system whereas less than 30%
understand the TCR process. That could be another reason for the
Secretary of State to intervene. I emphasise that this intervention
would occur if the system was not working: that is, if the regulator
and the suppliers were not working, or if the Secretary of State
considered that a particular tariff structure had to kick in, which I
accept is an important change, and had to set it out from the outset.
These options still allow a choice of tariff with the ultimate aim of
ensuring that every household is on the tariff that is most appropriate
for
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000154">We do not,
of course, want the Secretary of State intervening every five minutes.
I would prefer us to move eventually to a system whereby a five-year
framework was set and the independent regulator operated within that,
as was the Government’s original intention. Unfortunately, the
structure provided in the Bill does not guarantee that. Therefore, I
suggest that where there is an intervention by the Secretary of State
for whatever reason, and under whichever subsection of Clause 127, or
those subsections in bulk, that should stand for at least three years.
If that is not the case, consumers and suppliers will have no certainty
that that tariff will remain available during that period. I am
speaking to Amendment 50E which was not originally included in this
group, as my noble friend
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000155">The final
amendment in this group, Amendment 50H, deals with
consultation. Even if nothing else changes, you need a system of
consultation. Clause 128 does not specifically require
consultation with consumer 
<?notus-xml column=67?>groups. That is rather a grave omission in the rather thin passage
dealing with consumers. Therefore, Amendment 50H attempts to include a
specific reference to consumer
groups.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000156">This
group of amendments attempts to give purpose and effect to a Secretary
of State’s interventions. It does not require the Secretary of
State to intervene or say that the best way of dealing with this is for
him  or her to intervene every five minutes. However, if we are
to adopt a new strategic approach to the structure of tariffs we have
to be clear what our objectives are: that is, a regulator who has to
operate on a rather different basis from that operated during the past
15 years by Ofgem and its predecessors and a structure of
tariffs at the far end which is clear, transparent and understandable
to the consumer. The amendment we shall discuss next in the name of the
noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, says that in rather fewer words.
Nevertheless, that is a key outcome underpinning everything that I have
said. Only if we do that can we begin to tackle the dual problem of
rising and unclear bills which are often based on the mis-selling of
different tariffs—we have had a good number of scandals on that
front—the outcome of which is that all consumers are disgruntled
and mistrust energy supply companies and a very large proportion of
them are in dire fuel poverty. I beg to

Lord Whitty, for tabling these amendments and have a great deal of
sympathy with the points that he made. One of his opening questions was
on why we are having to change the system and give the Government more
powers, and perhaps change the role of Ofgem. The answer is because
competition has not worked in the interests of consumers. That is what

grateful to the noble Lord because, when these amendments were
introduced in the Commons, they were accepted with little or no debate.
Therefore, it is important that the Minister here is given more
opportunity to tell us how they will work. I wish to ask one or two
questions. Interestingly, some of them, and the points that I shall
make, arise because I was speaking in Newcastle last Friday morning at
a conference of CAN, the Carbon Action Network, which grew out of the
HECA organisation that came from the Act of Parliament that I got
through.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000160">Some
interesting points were raised at the conference. One of them, made by
a lady, was that people think that we are asking energy suppliers to
offer the cheapest variable rate; but she also made the compelling
point that some customers would like the cheapest fixed rate. This lady
works with clients trying to help people get a better deal. She said
that since last winter, which went on for ever and during which we all
burnt more 
<?notus-xml column=68?>fuel, older people in particular have become even more concerned than
before about their bills. She thought that we should have a measure on
this point in the Bill. I am not a lawyer and cannot always understand
the jargon in the Bill so I am not clear whether it enables that to
happen. I hope that the Minister will explain whether it
does.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000161">The
lady tackling me on these issues on Friday is the energy and affordable
warmth officer in Redcar and Cleveland. The other interesting point
that she raised was how the change in demand for certain types of
tariff will work, particularly the warm homes discount. She spends a
lot of time working with clients, many of them in fuel poverty, trying
to help them get a better deal. She said that this year there were huge
differences in the criteria that the energy suppliers were using to
decide whether people would get the warm homes discount. She has found
that the big six have all changed their criteria. Some cover low income
and others means-tested benefits only, such as income support,
jobseeker’s allowance and employment and support allowance. Some
look at non-means-tested disability benefits or personal independence
payments while others look at things such as eligibility for school
meals and maternity and medical exemptions. Again, I would be
interested to know how the Minister sees these proposals working with
other things that the Government have proposed such as the warm homes
allowances under ECO. At the conference there was somebody from E.ON
who tried to explain how this worked. I am hoping that either today or
at another point the Minister will be able to help us understand
exactly how these proposals work with other
things.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000162">From
what I have managed to look at in the fuel poverty booklet that I
picked up today, it may be appropriate to discuss some of these issues
when we come to discuss the fuel poverty amendments because some of
those issues are mentioned in the booklet. One of the things that the
Secretary of State is looking at in proposing to take fuel poverty more
seriously is the way that everything interacts together. I did not know
before we had this debate today, or in what happened on Friday, that
today we would have a whole booklet about fuel poverty so I am quite
happy if the Minister does not answer all the points now because there

Whitty and I have spoken about fuel poverty on all three Energy Bills
produced by this Government. We both feel the same: the Government need
to do something to address this. Unfortunately, the Government just put
it in the “too difficult” file and nothing has been done
about it up to now. If fuel poverty has doubled over the past seven or
eight years and the prospect is that it will double again over the next
few years, it really is time that we did something to address it. We
cannot just leave the increasing number of people in fuel poverty to
stew in their own juice. I see that there are amendments on fuel
poverty later. I hope that they will help address the situation.

certainly read it with great interest.</hs_para>

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> Given the large sums involved and
our positions as members of that body, we must do that. There are
various elements involved in fuel poverty: the condition of the house,
the circumstances of the individual householder and the nature and size
of the energy tariffs that the individual has to pay. Very often,
people in fuel poverty are in comprehensively complicated social
circumstances and the complexity of the tariff system just adds to
their confusion. Quite often, they do not know what they are paying
for. Quite often, they do not understand the bills. Invariably, they
are unable to make full payment. If they are on the payment meter
system—as has already been said—they pay rather more for
the privilege of paying as they go but that normally enables them to
self-disconnect, in the sense that if they cannot afford to pay they do
not use
electricity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000167">One
of the statistics that is never given proper examination in arguments
about privatisation is that we say there are not the disconnections
that there were under public ownership. That is because nowadays people
self-disconnect. There was a time when, certainly as a young Member of
Parliament, I had a succession of cases where I would intervene with
the nationalised industry, the utility, to ensure that the gas or
electricity was restored and some kind of proper payment system
introduced. In some respects, you might say that for a Member of
Parliament that is a chore they no longer need to carry out but it was
certainly one that enabled people to come to terms, at least for a
period, with the straightened circumstances of fuel poverty. What we
have to do here, regardless of the off-the-cuff remark from the Prime
Minister, which I am sure he regrets having made—not because he
did not believe in it but because of the complexity of the issue; this
is a classic case of unintended consequences—is to take
advantage of the legislation to make the tariff system for electricity
intelligible, simple and, I hope, more affordable. My noble friend has
addressed a number of the challenges that that remark presents to
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000168">We
know that in some respects there has been a major shift. There has been
the publication of a report, which I confess I have yet to read, and
amendments, in which we will all take great interest. It is fair to say
that the Hills report was a wee bit of a curate’s egg, but there
are always problems with the oversimplistic definition of the 10% rule.
Perhaps we can get a change in the definition that enables us to target
and prioritise. I know that those are the kind of words that people
like to use in these circumstances. In the previous debate, we
discussed having an annual report on energy. We will be looking very
carefully, maybe not next year but the year after next, when a number
of these amendments will have kicked in.</hs_para>

have a debate like this and that we get from the Minister a clear
picture of the Government’s thinking in relation to tariffs. The
remedies for fuel poverty in a broader sense will be debated later, but
people know well enough that serious near-criminal activities have been
undertaken by the oligopolies. People say that the market works, but it
has not worked; it has been abused consistently and methodically by
cynical people who at the end of the day pay the fines in the certain
knowledge that we as consumers then have to make our contribution to
the compensation of the poor shareholders, who have been happy to have
these chancers running these businesses. That is where we are coming
from on this; a group of cynical manipulators of the tariff system have
made the plight of disadvantaged people even more disagreeable. The
rest of us can probably say, “It serves us right—we
should be looking after ourselves”. However, a lot of vulnerable
people have not been given any protection by the market, and we are now
looking to the Minister and her response to this debate to tell us how
we are going to get tariffs that people can understand and perhaps pay
a little more easily than they have been able to in the

every noble Lord in this Room is passionate about. Providing
statistical backing to the Energy Bill has served to focus minds on
avoiding delay in the implementation of the retail market reforms that
Ofgem is introducing. Ofgem has committed to reviewing the RMR package

50A would give the Secretary of State power to require licence holders

and energy consumption and to encourage consumers to use energy at
off-peak times. We have a competitive energy market and we are looking
to increase competitive pressure through these reforms. I understand
the noble Lord’s desire to see the issues set out in Amendment
50A addressed, but I assure him that the Government are doing so,
though through means other than mandating suppliers to provide
particular tariffs. I shall quickly run through them. We are increasing
energy efficiency and conservation though ECO and the Green Deal. We
are facilitating consumers to change the time profile of their
consumption through the rollout of smart meters. We are already

outside it. We do not think that mandating particular tariffs in a
competitive market is the way to do it because ultimately the market
has failed to provide that, as the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill,
said. We need to make sure that we place a duty upon suppliers to
ensure that consumers are able to generate the competition that
suppliers need to be working towards to be able to give consumers the

helping consumers engage with the market, and that includes providing
information about unit costs. However, the improvements that Ofgem is
delivering through its retail market review will ensure that consumers
have all the information to

to Amendment 50E, which seeks to link the use of the powers in Clause
127 to reform the retail market to a strategy and policy statement

backing to Ofgem’s retail market review proposals to ensure that
these important reforms are not frustrated and consumers benefit from a
clearer and more competitive retail market as quickly as possible. The
context for the strategy and policy statement is somewhat different. As
I explained earlier, the new strategy and policy statement provides a
long-term strategic framework within which Ofgem will carry out its
regulatory functions.</hs_para>

reform powers have been developed to address a specific set of issues.
The two are not directly linked. The tariff reform powers can be
exercised appropriately without the need for a strategy and policy
statement to be in existence. Indeed, I do not believe that conditions
that lead to the expiry of the SPS should lead to the tariff reform
powers falling away. The tariff reform powers will, in any event, fall
in 2018 as a result of Clause 128(7). We do not believe that ensuring
that consumers get the best energy deal should be dependent on the
existence of the strategy and policy statement.</hs_para>

ensure that consumers are offered the same tariffs at the same prices,

separate suppliers, the same supplier, or are electricity-only

what Ofgem is proposing in the retail market review. This amendment

First Panel, and used this extensively to inform its retail market

taken part in this debate, and particularly for the interventions by
the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, my noble friend Lord O’Neill
and the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart. I think we all recognise
that this is a difficult area. The proposals today, which I have not
yet read and which we will no doubt be able to look at on Thursday when
we come to the Government’s fuel poverty amendments, have a
significant bearing on this area.</hs_para>

although that is an important dimension. It is about consumer
confidence and understanding and making what ought to be a competitive
market, even though it is run by oligopolies, actually work for
consumers—for the average bill as well as the bill of the
poorest families. The fact is that neither actually gets the best deal
at the moment. The objective of trying to ensure that every household,
whatever its income, status or pattern of energy use, can relatively
easily understand what the best tariff is for it and that there is an
obligation on the supplier to ensure that they do so is an objective
that we all share, but it is not an objective that is operating in the
market at the moment. That is not an outcome of years of regulation,
nor of the I do not know how many energy Bills I have sat through from
various Governments, nor of how the supplier companies are actually
behaving.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307101000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000190">This
is a very important clause. It must be a very important part of the
Government’s armoury in explaining energy policy to consumers,
and we have to get it right. The Minister explained that we do not need
the three-year limitation on Secretary of State interventions because
this is all going to finish by 2018, by which time we will somehow
reach Nirvana whereby the regulator is working and the outcomes that we
all wish to see are being delivered. I have to be a bit sceptical and
go back to what my noble friend said on an earlier amendment: the
record of Ofgem in this area and the relationship between Ofgem and the
successive departments has not been good. A radical change is probably
needed here that goes beyond this clause, but this clause, if properly
interpreted and amended, could take it a little further in the course
of this Bill. I do not think we are quite at that point
yet.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000191">We need to
be clear that some of the interventions that the Secretary of State is
going to have to take, at least in the short term, are along the lines
of the amendments that I have proposed—for example, an
intervention on grounds of encouraging energy efficiency. It is true
that there are other measures in the Government’s armoury to
deal with energy efficiency. I know that  the Minister and I do
not entirely agree, but as yet the ECO and Green Deal are not
effective. They may be  in three year’s time, but they
are not effective now. The warm home discount, although highly helpful
to  lots of fuel-poor families, is effectively an override on
bills and tariff structures that are not appropriate for fuel-poor
families. That is not necessary in the long term. I hope we keep it for
the next two or three years, but in the long term, it is not the most
appropriate way of dealing with fuel-poor families. You need different
overrides.</hs_para>

costs, I would have thought that the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, was a
fairly canny consumer, but the fact that he finds himself totally
incapable of understanding even page 1 of his five-page bill indicates
the kinds of problems that most consumers have, middling consumers as
well as fuel-poor ones. Something closer to the unit price requirement
is important. The Minister needs to look at what the consumer is saying
here and to come up with a scheme that is useable by the bulk of
consumers, including not only the noble Earl but also those who suffer
seriously from fuel poverty but who have the nous to try to make some
choices of their
own.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000193">It is also
important that a bill is accurate. Although there have been some
improvements, at the moment most bills are estimated, which means that
they are wrong. If you complain about them, it is very difficult to get
satisfaction. In the long run, smart meters and everything else may
solve this problem, but at the moment, there is serious consumer
detriment as a result of the way in which bills are presented and
enforced. It is very difficult to argue with the company supplying your
electricity. It is therefore important that we can intervene to make
everything a lot
clearer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000194">I am
not suggesting that the Minister should accept every word of my
amendments, but she and the Government should accept that there is a
need for more sharpness in the interventions that we are now proposing
in order to deliver the objectives of energy policy which, by and
large, we all broadly agree. Consumer affordability and tackling fuel
poverty are part of that, but so are energy efficiency, energy security
and ensuring that all energy users are treated fairly without
discrimination. All those things need to be part of a proper
regulator’s normal method of operation. They have not been. The
market has not delivered them and the regulator has not delivered them.
A new start for the regulator and a new context in which it is working
perhaps might. Clause 127 needs at least to be strengthened in order to
increase the possibility and the probably of that outcome. In the mean
time, I commend my amendments to the Minister and beg leave to withdraw

my noble friend, I am interested here simply because of the bills that
I, my friends and my 94 year-old mother have had. You look
at them. We have sometimes changed our supplier, and when we got a
condensing boiler for the first time—we are on to our second as
the first one burnt out—I tried to work out how much gas we were
saving. That was difficult. I am an A-level mathematician and I still
could not work out with ease whether we had saved. I worked it out in
the end but it was very complicated. Gas is the most complicated
because they use therms and things that make it much more
difficult.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307101000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000197">It
is from that standpoint that I am concerned. If we really want people
to get the best tariff, to understand what they are doing and how much
energy they are using and to use less energy, we need better bills and
better formats. As the noble Earl said, bills can run to five pages.
Sometimes I have had four pages. You also sometimes find that you have
something on the first page and then on the third page it is something
quite
different.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000198">The
other thing that concerns me is something that I mentioned at Second
Reading. As someone who has produced political leaflets for years, I
was told by people who had carried out research what to do if you want
to get your message across: where it is on the page, what sort of type
you use and the colours that do not work. If there is yellow print on
top of something, older people cannot read it at all. There are all
sorts of things that surprise me about the way in which companies, the
big six particularly, produce their bills. I remember British Gas
coming to me and showing me a bill saying, “Isn’t this
good?”. I said, “Well, actually, no. The thing you want
is not in the place where people look first on a page”. This is
quite important. It is difficult to prescribe—you cannot
prescribe in that much detail to the energy companies—but it is
important that we try to ensure that it is simple so that people can
understand it and really compare. They, particularly elderly people,
must be able to read it.</hs_para>

older now. We cannot read tiny print in the wrong colour. That is why I
put down the amendment. It may not be appropriate at this point in the

These might not be the right words but I think that everyone will

share those sentiments. I hope that the Minister can give a reasonably
positive reply to my amendment. I beg to

matter on which I would like the Minister to offer some reassurance:
the various government obligations that arise out of climate change

find it if you dig around, but I hope that these bills, in addition to
the unit cost—the actual cost of the energy—and the VAT,
list as a discrete amount what we consumers are asked to pay to
subsidise wind farms or whatever, in the interests of transparency. As
I say, I have seen a particular company, for whatever reason, perhaps
inadvertently, move backwards on this issue. I hope that this can be

Lord Bishop of Chester:</Member></B> Can I just come back on this
point? What I wanted was for the government obligations to be listed.
One justification for these green taxes is that it saves money in the
long run because of this, that or other theory. However, when the
Government themselves impose a financial tax or precept, or whatever
you want to call it, we should all surely want a degree of transparency
about it. Then there is an argument about whether it is justified
because of other long-term savings. The danger is that if you hide

step in before the noble Lord, Lord Whitty. I am extremely grateful to
my noble friends Lady Maddock and Lord Roper for their amendment. This
is a follow-on from our previous discussion. My noble friend Lord
Caithness rightly then ensured—and continues to
ensure—that this debate around simplification and clarity is
high on the agenda. The amendment proposed by the noble Baroness tries
to lay that out  in simple
terms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:42:32"></hs_TimeCode>, saying
that the information provided as part of a message on bills, annual
statements and 
<?notus-xml column=79?>other communications detailing the suppliers’ cheapest tariff
must be provided in a clear and easily understandable
format.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000214">Ensuring<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
that consumers are provided with clear and simple information regarding
their existing tariff and others available to them is one of the key
aims of the powers in question and Ofgem’s retail market review.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:43:02"></hs_TimeCode> power to
require suppliers to provide consumers with personalised details of the
expected cost of a given tariff and information on the
supplier’s cheapest tariff for them is one of the means by which
this will be achieved. That consumers should receive information about
tariffs in a clear and understandable way is something that we have
made plain to suppliers  as being central to our proposals.
Should it become necessary to use these powers, we expect to set this
out explicitly within the actual amendments to suppliers’
licence conditions. Indeed, Ofgem’s proposed changes to
suppliers’ licence conditions to implement the  RMR
already include such provisions. Standard licence condition 31E, once
amended, will set out specific plain and intelligible language and
presentation requirements for information provided to customers. We
have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:44:07"></hs_TimeCode> always been
clear that we expect suppliers to provide information to consumers that
is clear and understandable. However, if noble Lords feel that we have
not been clear enough then we are happy to consider this matter further

response to the concerns of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Chester, I sincerely understand his desire to see clarity on bills, but
that is up to suppliers to do. Ofgem can direct, but it is actually for
suppliers to do it. Somewhere I have a note on this that I have now
conveniently lost. Ofgem is producing factsheets that provide a
breakdown of the costs that make up a typical energy bill. We are aware
that some suppliers are already providing this, and the right reverend
Prelate mentioned that there may be one that he would not mention by
name. We do not hold comprehensive data on each individual
supplier’s approach. Maybe that is something that Ofgem needs to
look at. Given that I am taking this matter away to consider it
further, perhaps this is something else that I may reflect on. I hope
that my noble friends will find my explanation reassuring and withdraw

some suppliers do it but some seem to change their policies. Given that

when she says that the companies are “not obliged”, I
find it difficult to understand her choice of language. It is as if we
are asking them to do something difficult. At best, we could say that
we will just aim at the top six, or top seven if we included First
Utility. The other side of this is that, such is the stickiness in this
market, most people do not switch, so that 60%-odd are receiving their
bills from the same company year after year. We have been far too easy
on these companies, and the Minister gives me no comfort whatever by
using phrases such as “not obliged”. We should dashed
well make them do it; we have the powers to do so. The regulator can do
these things. It might be uncomfortable for the regulator but the
consumer is entitled to know. I hope that she goes away and reflects on
whether or not we should make the obligation rather more forceful than

explanation. I have to say that the proposal is fairly simple and I
cannot see that it would damage the Bill tremendously if it were in
there, but I suppose that it is too much to hope for. When I was in the
Commons, I once got a Minister to accept an amendment in its entirety
and I practically fell off my chair as he said it. At that time I was
the only Lib Dem on the Committee. I had a whole raft of amendments and
was busy looking at my notes for the next amendment when I suddenly
heard what he said. I am disappointed that the Minister today was not
able to do that, but never mind.</hs_para>

this issue seriously, because we all think that it is important. The
amendment goes to the heart of what we are trying to do about getting
better information about tariffs to enable people to make decisions. It
is clear to me, as I commented in the previous amendments, that people
working with those who could do with better tariffs are finding it very
difficult to do so because it is so complicated. The simpler that we
can make things, the more chance we have of achieving the aims that we
all have in the section that deals with tariffs. I am pleased and
disappointed all at the same time, but I recognise that we are where we

Roper:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 50G is tabled in my name and
that of my noble friend Lord Teverson. This amendment is parallel to
some discussions that we had during our previous day in Committee when
we were considering a nuclear regulatory organisation and taking up
references in the report of your Lordships’ Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee. Two paragraphs of the report discussed the
possibilities of modifying licences under Clause 127(1) and orders
about domestic supply contracts in Clause
127(10).</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307101000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-gc0001.htm#1307101000223">As the
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has made clear, this gives power to the
Secretary of State to intervene in an area that until now has been the
responsibility  of the regulator. The argument put forward by
the department in the memorandum that it sent to the Delegated Powers
Committee was that there was no need for any form of parliamentary
scrutiny because all that we are giving the Secretary of State power to
do is something that could already be done by Ofgem. That needs to be
examined rather more carefully, which was also the view of the
Delegated Powers Committee. This is the single instance in the Bill
when the Secretary of State is given power to modify the licences
without parliamentary scrutiny; in each of the other six cases, the
negative procedure is indicated. We have already seen the discussions.
This is an area of considerable public and political interest.
Therefore, if the Secretary of State is to intervene and in some sense
override the position of the regulator, it appears to the Delegated
Powers Committee that he ought to be answerable to Parliament and that,
as in other cases under powers conferred elsewhere in the Bill, it
should require the draft negative procedure. As on the previous
occasion, we have not seen the reply from the department to the
Delegated Powers Committee so we would like an assurance from the
Minister about how she is going to reply to the report.</hs_para>

complicated power to make orders about domestic supply contracts.
Similarly, it seems surprising that this order-making power is subject
to no parliamentary control. Although paragraph 358 of the memorandum
that the department submitted to the Delegated Powers Committee
explained why the definitions could not appropriately be included in
the Bill, it did not really explain why there is no provision for
parliamentary scrutiny. This amendment is put forward by my noble
friend and me in order to give the Minister an opportunity to explain
what the reaction of the department to the report of the Delegated
Powers Committee is likely to

relevant, he is not obliged to present

considering what approach to propose for each illegal

drugs which have recognised and widespread medical uses but which can
also affect a patient's ability to drive and are sometimes misused. We
know that the vast majority of people who use these drugs are doing so
responsibly and safely and that is why our approach does not unduly
penalise drivers who have taken properly prescribed medicines. The
limits we propose to set follow the recommendations of the Expert
Panel, which in the vast majority of cases, will avoid the new offence
catching out drivers who have taken properly prescribed or supplied
drugs in accordance with the directions of a healthcare professional or
the drug manufacturer. This will avoid inconveniencing the public and
taking up police

encourages illegal immigration. It also undercuts legitimate businesses
through illegal cost-cutting activity by rogue employers, and is often
associated with other forms of exploitative behaviour –
including harmful working conditions for employees and tax evasion. The
Government is committed to taking action to effectively tackle illegal
working. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have recently

labour should be doubled.</hs_para>

responsibility to check that their employees have the right to work in
the UK and, since 2008, this has been underpinned by a civil penalty
scheme. This has been successful in requiring employers to make right
to work checks and imposing a sanction on those who do not. We are
proposing to further refine these requirements to get tougher on
employers who continue to exploit illegal labour and increase the
sanction to reflect the harm they cause. We are also conscious of the
burdens on legitimate business, so we are also proposing a number of
measures to significantly reduce the administrative costs of complying
with the requirement to make right to work checks. Legitimate
businesses will benefit in two ways: from tougher sanctions against
rogue employers and from our intention to make it easier for compliant
businesses to fulfil their duties.</hs_para>

action against those who have no right to be here, and also against the

Review, conducted by Professor Sir John Hills, provided us with a new
understanding of the problem of fuel poverty. Professor Hills’s
work demonstrates that fuel poverty is a long-term and structural
problem requiring an on-going effort to mitigate it. We believe it is
right to reflect this by adopting the new measurement approach proposed
by Professor Hills, which will support a renewed focus on those with
the lowest incomes living in the worst homes. This new approach aligns
fully with the Government’s wider objectives of saving energy,
promoting growth and decarbonising the housing sector.</hs_para>

are proposing amending the statutory framework underpinning fuel
poverty. The existing fuel poverty target, contained in the Warm Homes
and Energy Conservation Act 2000, has the eradication of fuel poverty
as its end goal. This is the wrong type of target to focus on given the
nature of the problem. Nor is such an approach compatible with the
definition we are adopting. We are therefore proposing

believe there is real merit in giving a strong degree of statutory
backing to a fuel poverty target and our proposals reflect this. On
balance we believe the best way to do this is through secondary
legislation. This is reflected in amendments the Government has tabled
to the Energy Bill currently before Parliament.</hs_para>

we cannot achieve meaningful progress under this new framework against
a target date of 2016. We will put forward our proposals on the date,
level and precise form of this new target in due course, should our
amendments be approved by Parliament. Our proposals for that target

on security. Other aspects include increased training for the Libyan

enrolment into workplace pensions represents a step-change in the
pensions landscape. A crucial part of the automatic enrolment landscape
is NEST which was set up by Government to ensure all employers have
access to a high-quality, low-cost option for workplace pension
provision. Whilst the market has always provided for larger firms and
higher earners, NEST was created specifically to ensure that smaller
firms and low to moderate earners also have access to quality pension
provision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070975000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-wms0001.htm#13070975000070">To
ensure that NEST focused on this ‘target market’ the
previous Government legislated to constrain NEST in two particular ways
– an annual contribution limit, currently £4,500 a year,
and restrictions on transfers in and out of NEST, which prevents bulk
transfers of existing schemes and limits transfers by individual scheme
members.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070975000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-wms0001.htm#13070975000071">In
summer 2010 the Department for Work and Pensions commissioned an
independent review – Making Automatic Enrolment Work – to
consider whether the framework for automatic enrolment was fit for
purpose. The review concluded that the basic architecture, including
NEST, was appropriate, but that the constraints on NEST should be
lifted in
2017.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070975000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-wms0001.htm#13070975000072">More
recently the Work and Pensions Select Committee recommended in 2012
that the constraints should be lifted at once, expressing concern that
some firms might not be able to use NEST, resulting in consumer
detriment. Government responded in late 2012 with its ‘Call for
Evidence’ to seek views on the future of the NEST
constraints.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070975000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-wms0001.htm#13070975000073">Requiring
NEST to focus on this target market has been very successful. As a
large numbers of medium and smaller firms will start enrolling their
workers in the next few years, now is the time to focus on helping
these firms get ready. With its special focus on those workers with
lower earnings, NEST will be a key part of the solution as it has
thought hard about its design; it has aimed its research,
communications, use of language, investment and decumulation strategies
at its target market. It is working, and we need this to continue.
Therefore, to make sure we achieve our aim of getting people saving, we
have decided that NEST must continue to focus on its target group
without any
distractions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070975000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-wms0001.htm#13070975000074">The
responses to the Call for Evidence revealed a perception that the
restrictions placed on NEST prevent it from serving the low to moderate
earners and smaller  
<?notus-xml column=12?>employers it was intended for. The reality is quite the opposite. With
mandatory contributions of just 2% on a band of earnings, with at least
1% from firms, no employer contributing at this level or the full 8%
will exceed the annual contribution
limit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070975000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-wms0001.htm#13070975000075">However,
we need to look to the future and ensure NEST remains influential in
the marketplace, by continuing to help drive up standards and best
practice. The minimum contribution will rise to a combined contribution
of 5 per cent from October 2017 and 8 per cent from October
2018. Therefore, in line with the recommendations of the independent
Making Automatic Enrolment Work review, I intend to legislate as soon
as Parliamentary time allows to lift the contribution limit from 2017.
This will give employers the certainty they need that NEST will
continue to be an appropriate scheme for them and their workers when
minimum contributions rise, or should they choose to contribute
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070975000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-wms0001.htm#13070975000076">With
regard to individual transfers, we agree that NEST should be part of
the automatic transfer solution for which we are currently legislating.
Therefore we intend to lift the restrictions on individual transfers in
and out of NEST to coincide with the start of the
‘pot-follows-member’ regime. The ban on bulk transfers
will remain in place until the end of the main roll out period for
automatic enrolment in April 2017, when it will then be
lifted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070975000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-wms0001.htm#13070975000077">We
believe that the creation of NEST has played a crucial role in the
early success of automatic enrolment. NEST has focused on its target
market and has innovated to serve the needs of those in that market. As
automatic enrolment moves on to cover medium and smaller firms we want
NEST to continue its excellent work, whilst signalling now that beyond
2017 NEST will be put on a similar footing to other providers in the
wider pensions
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070975000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-wms0001.htm#13070975000078">The

their home, a home-loss payment of 10% of the value of their home (up
to £47,000), and reasonable moving costs. We do not expect that
all properties within the safeguarded area will be required for the
railway. Compulsory purchase powers to acquire properties needed for
the railway will be set out in the Hybrid Bill and can not be exercised
until that Bill has Royal
Assent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070975000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709-wms0001.htm#13070975000103">Information

soon be overwhelmed. HS2 will link eight of Britain’s 10 largest
cities, serving

recognised the impact of HS2 on those living along the line of route.
Issuing safeguarding directions brings certainty to many
owner-occupiers living in the safeguarded area who can now apply to
have their homes bought. I can assure the House that we will seek to
process blight notices swiftly so that those who qualify can move as
quickly as

upon the partnerships launched at the Family Planning Summit held in
London in 2012. Since the Summit two pharmaceutical companies, Bayer
and Merck, have announced price reductions of 50% in the cost of their
contraceptive implants. This has been achieved by guarantees to
purchase a minimum volume from them, a commitment underpinned by
expected future funding for implants from donors (including DFID,
Norway, Sweden, USA, the Gates Foundation and others). DFID has since
provided an additional £37.1m to United Nations Population Fund
to purchase contraceptives in 2012/13, including over 4m implants.

initiatives to expand access to contraceptive

This will give tenants an effective way to address complaints. However,
we are unconvinced that regulating or banning specific fees is
necessary because whilst landlords and letting agents are free to set
their own charges they are prohibited from setting unfair terms or fees
under existing consumer protection legislation. Where a consumer
believes that agents are in breach of this legislation, it is open to
them to draw this to the attention of their local trading standards

9 April and 4 June 2013 the Government consulted on a number of
proposals to reform legal aid via the <I>Transforming Legal Aid:
delivering a more credible and efficient system</I> consultation. This
included a proposed model of competitive tendering for criminal legal
aid services. We have been clear we must continue to bear down on the
cost of legal aid, including the nearly £1 billion of
taxpayers’ money spent on criminal legal aid a year, to ensure
we are getting the best deal for the
taxpayer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070978000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709w0001.htm#13070978000206">The
changes on which we’ve consulted won’t affect people
getting a fair trial. We will maintain a legal aid system that protects
the most vulnerable, and is sustainable and affordable for future
generations. The Government is mindful of the importance of considering
the impact of the legal aid proposals on different groups. In
accordance with our duties under the Equality Act 2010 we are
considering the impact of the proposals on individuals sharing
protected characteristics in order to give due regard to the need to
eliminate unlawful conduct, advance quality of opportunity, and foster
good relations. We published our initial conclusions along with five
impact assessments alongside the consultation document. These can be

their supply chain comprising both NHS and private sector healthcare

On 18 February 2013 Atos published its full list of supply
chain partners which represents a large, flexible network of sites
exceeding the forecast demand for PIP assessments. Any of Atos'
partners' sites could be used for PIP consultations providing they meet
DWP's requirements. Atos have identified up to 108 sites currently
available across Lot 3 which meet DWP's requirements for undertaking
PIP consultations. This provides sufficient capacity and coverage to
meet the forecast demand for assessing new claims for PIP. Atos will

Regulation does not limit production, but instead forces manufacturers
to reduce the 002 emissions of the vehicles they sell. It was designed
to be 'competitively neutral' by setting a single EU-wide objective
requiring manufacturers meet their targets on the basis of their sales
across the EU. This protects the diversity of products entering the
market by allowing manufacturers to offset production of higher average
002 emissions vehicles, with production of vehicles with lower average
CO2 emissions. Manufacturers with limited product range and/or small
production volumes can avoid disproportionate costs by applying for
alternative targets, based upon the reduction potential of their
product range, and these important provisions protect these important
areas of British car
production.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13070978000384" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130709w0001.htm#13070978000384">Vehicles:

low emission cars and vans target those vehicles that contribute the
most to reducing road transport emissions and which represent the
greatest economic opportunity. The cost gap of the new technology is
such that Government intervention is needed to encourage the move to
mass market for these vehicles. The government fully supports and
welcomes the development of electric powered two wheelers (ePTWs). The
Office for Low Emission Vehicles, through the Technology Strategy
Board, has funded a project to develop and validate a multi-speed gear
