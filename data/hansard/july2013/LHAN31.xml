Garden of Frognal:</Member></B> My Lords, in 2012, we brought into
force changes to the Video Recordings Act so that, unless they are
entirely suitable for all audiences, video games must carry
age ratings. The ratings system used is the pan-European game
information, PEGI. It is an offence to sell PEGI 12, 16 or 18-rated
games to those younger than the rating. The age ratings empower parents
to make informed decisions about the suitability of games for their
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Massey of Darwen" PimsId="1738" UID="13070811000726" xid="1343" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000726">Baroness
Massey of Darwen:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for that
comprehensive reply. I am sure that she is aware that some video games
are extremely pornographic and violent and that, even for adults, there
should be enforced regulation on them. Is she further aware that some
parents and other adults buy these games for children inadvertently
because the labelling is unspecific and unclear? Will she explain how
the Games Rating Authority is dealing with putting better controls for
parents on those
games?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Garden of Frognal" PimsId="5266" UID="13070811000727" xid="1973" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000727">Baroness
Garden of Frognal:</Member></B> The noble Baroness makes some valid
points there. The PEGI ratings now have traffic light warnings to try
to make it clearer which are the particularly inappropriate games for
children. It is also trying to make clear that the age-rating symbols
relate to the content of the game, not to the playability, because that
has also been a misunderstanding. There are prominent statements on the
website, askaboutgames.com, which has had a quarter of a million
visitors since it was set up, and which has a great many explanatory
aspects. The noble Baroness is right that there are different sorts of
unsuitability—but there are symbols on the PEGI guidance as to
whether the game involves violence, pornography, fear, and so on, which
again should guide both parents and young
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Storey" PimsId="5937" UID="13070811000728" xid="2146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000728">Lord
Storey:</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister will be aware that parents
generally have regard to the classification of films by the British
board. That is probably a result of widespread consultation with
parents. Will the games industry regulatory body have the same
consultation with parents to ensure that they understand how the
labelling and marking
works?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Garden of Frognal" PimsId="5266" UID="13070811000729" xid="1973" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000729">Baroness
Garden of Frognal:</Member></B> My noble friend makes a valid point. Of
course, we need to get the communication to parents as accurate as we
can. The difference between film classification and games
classification is that games are interactive, children are playing them
with people on screen, and the graphics have become ever more lifelike
and realistic since the days when they were little cartoon characters,
so it is really important is that both children and parents are aware
of what these games
mean.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Earl of Listowel" PimsId="1518" UID="13070811000730" xid="1317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000730">The
Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> My Lords, is the Minister also concerned
about the number of children who become so engrossed in these games

Is advice being given to parents about tackling the problem, and are

Garden of Frognal:</Member></B> The noble Earl is right to highlight
the addictive nature of some of these games. There are various parental
controls. There can 
<?notus-xml column=3?>be timings, for instance, put on the games to ensure that children
automatically have a break after a certain length of time. However, a
lot of this will be up to parents, and the more guidance we can get to
them the better because, as the noble Earl knows, these games can be
addictive and can cause children to spend an awful lot of time on
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Uddin" PimsId="4374" UID="13070811000732" xid="1475" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000732">Baroness
Uddin:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister accept that, while it
is very important to ensure that parents take their full
responsibility, parents must know the fullest amount of information
available about the illegality of some of these games? I note the fact
that this is not all the Government’s responsibility, but what
is her department doing to ensure that information is communicated to
parents? Also, many parents do not speak good enough English, so how
would she ensure that broader ranges of parents are aware of these
games being illegal?</hs_para>

from internet service providers, which are collaborating very
constructively with the Government. There is the Internet Watch
Foundation, for instance; we are also working with the Child
Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, CEOP, to try to make sure
that there are mechanisms within the games, which can be controls. If
there are ways in which children can be identified from playing the
games, they will be prevented from doing that. It is ongoing work, and

while welcoming very much the answers that my noble friend has given, I
wonder whether she is aware that, whether or not these games are good
in intent for children, they are very attractive to them. Placing the
onus on the parents is therefore rather a heavy duty, and we should not
leave them alone. Will she give consideration to tackling this problem
at source, with the producers and purveyors of these products being
taxed or their products made less attractive to them financially in
some way?</hs_para>

working very constructively with the internet service providers’
industry, which is as concerned to make sure that inappropriate
materials are not accessed by young people online. The providers are
very well aware of the damage that it can do to young children to find
themselves, perhaps inadvertently, drawn into a game which shows

referred to, the Fulham Legal Advice Centre closed last month, I
understand as a result of losing the money which used to come from
those areas of work that have been taken out of scope under LASPO. Half
the caseworkers in the Surrey Law Centre, which I believe serves the
Lord Chancellor’s own constituency, are being made redundant
through lack of funds. I declare an interest as chairman of the Access
to Justice Foundation and president of the Bar Pro Bono Unit, both of
which are involved in providing support to the not-for-profit sector in
giving free legal advice. Can the Minister also confirm that these
problems are happening against a background of increasing demand? There
has been a 100% increase in inquiries to the LawWorks inquiry line and
a 26.7% increase in inquiries to the Bar Pro Bono Unit. Will
the Minister say what more the Government will do, rather than simply

first amendment, and of the second amendment that is to be taken with

striking that the Bill is called the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill.
Therefore, I cannot see that what I propose can be objectionable to
anybody who wishes to further the Bill in the future. If it is
appropriate to refer to what is now being introduced as the Marriage
(Same Sex Couples) Bill, it must surely be right to use that name to
refer to what exists already in the law, and will continue to exist in
the law after this Bill becomes an Act, as I certainly expect that it

seems to me obvious that there is an important distinction between
these two types of marriage. My understanding is clear that the
Government wish to afford the gold standard to same-sex marriage. That
means using the word “marriage” to describe what is
involved, which I accept for the purposes of this amendment. Therefore,
I cannot see that it in any way degrades what is asked for and granted
to same-sex couples in the Bill. The Bill makes distinctions between
same-sex marriage and opposite-sex marriage in a number of respects. I
need not mention the more technical ones, but there is a fundamental
difference in relation to the consummation of the marriage and on the
effect to a child of being born to a member of a same-sex couple. That
has a very important effect on
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T15:11:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000070">My
understanding is that opposite-sex marriage is a uniquely well designed
system for the bringing into the world, and the nurture in the world,
of children because opposite-sex marriage involves a direct link
between the child and two parents, which arises from the nature of the
child’s birth. That, I think, is not in any way replicated in
any other form of marriage. Of course, it is possible for children to
become children of a marriage in various ways—for example, by
adoption and by in vitro fertilisation, which have their own
characteristics. Those of your Lordships who sat on the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Bill Committee some time ago, which sought
to amend the 1990 Act, will remember hearing people born by means of
IVF give very cogent and sensitive evidence on the difficulty of
getting information that that had happened and of tracing their
roots<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T15:13:35"></hs_TimeCode>. I am sure
your Lordships are aware that tracing one’s roots and being able
to say something about one’s ancestry can be an important factor
in the nurture and development of children and, indeed, in the
well-being of adults, as people have a great interest in
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T15:13:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000071">It
seems to me essential to recognise that distinction in the Bill as a
matter of ordinary drafting. This is not a marriage Bill; it is a Bill
which adds to the existing 
<?notus-xml column=13?>structure a new concept, as I think we should recognise throughout the
Bill. It is recognised in the Bill’s Title
and is reflected in the heading of various
documents, including today’s Marshalled List. In my
submission, it is vital that we do not lose sight in future of that
aspect of what people have called “traditional marriage”
as it is an extremely valuable part of the arrangements that we have
had for the birth and nurture of children.</hs_para>

I say again that the protection of children by marriage, when it works,
is extremely important and so far the state has not been able to devise
a system which is equally effective. I speak in the presence of people
who know much more about this than I do, but I believe that when the
natural family fails a child and he has to go into care—which
sadly happens, though fortunately not in the majority of
cases—one of the difficulties as a matter of practice is to get
a bond between a child and a particular individual in, for example a
local authority. That is for the very practical reason that local
authority staff change and take over different responsibilities and so
on. I am sure that that is not the only difficulty, but it is certainly
an important one.</hs_para>

Bill deals with same-sex marriage and opposite-sex marriage
differently in various places and mentioned the technical
situation of a child born to a member of the marriage. That child does
not enjoy the protection of the marriage on birth. It may be
possible for the child to be adopted by the couple, but that is a
different process. It is not a direct result of being born to a partner
in the marriage. However, perhaps the most striking difference in
treatment between same-sex marriage and opposite-sex marriage is in
relation to the churches and religious organisations. The nature of the
treatment in these two groups is very different indeed. Therefore, it
seems only sensible to recognise as a matter of definition what it is
that the different treatment applies to.</hs_para>

is the minimum that will secure recognition in the Bill of the
distinction between the two. I believe that it completely meets the
aims which were intimated as part of what this Bill is about
in the sense that it gives marriage with the gold standard to same-sex
couples, while retaining, without differentiating to any extent between
the two as a value judgment, the essential distinction. This is not a
matter of arbitrariness, but of simple fact. Recognising that fact in
the Bill seems to me to bring it much closer to what ordinary
people—and I count myself in that category—understand the
Bill to do. Trying to make out that the two are the same seems to many
people, including myself, to be an exercise in fantasy. The factual
position is that there is a fundamental distinction which no majority
in Parliament or elsewhere can
annihilate.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_08_PT_1/EF24A39AF3B68A738FDD8AA2B4933DC8E897BE25" __version__="1.12"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 8 July 2013">Monday,

solution to that problem. For those who have concerns about finding a
way to redefine marriage, which the Bill tries to do, it seems

For us, our marriage 50 years ago was not some simple ceremony but a
form of sacrament before God. Some hold that dear for that reason. For
others who have come to their view only over the past year or

same as traditional marriages. The noble and learned Lord

physically different, and the effect on children, a subject in which he
has had a close interest. It is therefore absurd to try to make the
same that which is essentially different. The amendment therefore
allows for same-sex couples to be distinct but at the same time to be
married and to be able to say so when they discuss their relationship

They believe strongly in the traditional conjugal view of marriage as

the traditional view of marriage a superior status. It is essential to
be sure that the marriage of same-sex couples is not regarded as less

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> My Lords, I listened with great interest
as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, presented his
case, particularly to what he said about children and families and the
importance for children to grow up in a very strong environment,
ideally with a father and a mother. I do not think that he said that
specifically, but he talked about children coming into the care system
and the difficulties at finding someone who will make a real commitment
to the child. In my own family, marriage was fairly relaxed from a
religious point of view, but it was there in preparation for having a
child and gave us children a secure base to look forward
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000089">I listened
to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, speaking about the old view and the
modern view of marriage. The old view is there for families and to give
a strong framework in which children can grow up, and the modern view
is much more about individual adults choosing what is best for them and
what they feel most comfortable with. I am reminded of a report from
the Children’s Society—the Good Childhood
inquiry—some time ago, which drew attention to exactly that
change and shift in adults, and the unfortunate consequence for
children, with so many children nowadays growing up without contact
with their fathers. That freedom of choice for adults has become a very
unhappy situation for many children who do not have that security of
having a father around.</hs_para>

difficult question and it is helpful that the noble and learned Lord
has tabled the amendment. It is important to distinguish between this
new version of marriage that we are discussing today, and traditional
marriage, especially as there is some misunderstanding about the impact
of same-sex parenting and heterosexual parenting on child development.
There are strong feelings on both sides, and some say now that the
question is quite finalised: we all know that same-sex parenting has
the same outcomes for children as heterosexual parenting. However, I
think that there are a number of difficulties about that particular
point 
<?notus-xml column=17?>of view, and I would say briefly that same-sex parenting has been around
for only a short time; it is a new phenomenon, so scientifically there
has not been the time for extensive or controlled research to
verify either way, or to provide data on these outcomes. We
will come back to this later in the debate, but I support
strongly what the noble and learned Lord proposes, and I hope that the
Minister will feel inclined to accept
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000091"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Butler-Sloss" PimsId="5111" UID="13070811000796" xid="1959" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000796">Baroness
Butler-Sloss:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and
learned Lord across the Chamber. I want to make a brief point to the
noble Lord, Lord Lester. If the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay,
had asked for the phrase, “traditional marriage”, the
point made would have some benefit and would be something that we
should perhaps take into account. But the amendment refers to
“same sex couples” and “opposite sex
couples”, so how on earth can anyone suggest anywhere that one
sort of couple is better than another sort of couple? They just happen
to be different—different and equal. So I cannot see how the
noble Lord, Lord Lester, can make the point that one group will be
downgraded because they are the same sex and another will not be
downgraded because they are opposite. That is not an argument that can
be used in the present wording—very clever and careful wording,
if I may respectfully say so—of the noble and learned
Lord’s
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000092"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Lord Bishop of Chester" PimsId="2586" UID="13070811000797" xid="1657" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000797">The
Lord Bishop of Chester:</Member></B> My Lords, I find myself asking,
what would actually change in the Bill if we accepted the amendment? As
I understand it, there would be recognition of difference yet equal
treatment of the two types of couple. That is what would happen.
Therefore, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Lester, who we all respect so
greatly, is it the case that the couples would not be regarded equally
when, in fact, the treatment of the couples would be exactly equal in
law? The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, made a similar
point. Would accepting the amendment of noble and learned Lord, Lord
Mackay of Clashfern—there are two Lord Mackays now in the
House—accord either of these forms of marriage a superior
status, as was alleged? I do not see that on the face of the Bill. It
simply accepts a certain difference.</hs_para>

seductive aspect of the Equality Act itself, that any differentiation
amid the protected characteristics is all the same. Therefore, the
difference between a woman of childbearing age and a woman beyond
childbearing age is just the same as the difference between a man and a
woman. That is plainly not the case. There is a greater distinction
between a man and a woman biologically than between a woman of
childbearing age and one who is not. An element of recognition of
difference within equal treatment in law is entirely consistent with
the purposes of the Bill.</hs_para>

still, greatly disturbed that the Government should have introduced a

the Government have turned down every opportunity to soothe the

the Bill should not reach the statute book without the Government doing
something to acknowledge that, until recently, it was almost
universally accepted—it was certainly so accepted by the
previous Government—that marriage could be only between a man
and a woman. The views of those who still hold that belief are
therefore worthy of respect and should be acknowledged in the Bill. The
best way of doing that is not just by a declaration in the form set out
in Amendment 4, but by a clear statement that the marriage
of a same-sex couple and the marriage of an opposite-sex couple are
equally valid but clearly different. The differences have been gone
over time and time again since Second Reading and I will not go into
them now, but they are different.</hs_para>

far this burying of traditional marriage, and putting something
entirely new in its place, has yet been fully recognised by the
populace. I wonder how many realise that this legislation authorises in
law a man who is married to another man to be called a husband, and a
woman married to another woman to be called a wife. Wife in its old
meaning has been abolished by a little-read schedule to the Bill and,
no doubt, the proper use of the term will soon disappear. These are
dramatic changes—changes that pay no regard to the normal use of
the English language, tradition, common sense or common courtesies. It
is up to those initiating such change to try and make it reasonably
palatable for those who were brought up to accept that marriage is the
union of a man and a woman. I hope that, even at this late hour, the
Government will recognise that they have some obligation in this
matter.</hs_para>

each of them would wrongly suggest to the happy couple entering into a
state of matrimony—to their families, their friends and to the
world at large—that theirs is not a marriage like any other. The
amendments would suggest that it is a distinct form of marriage to be
placed in a category of its own. Since the very purpose of the Bill is
to recognise same-sex marriages as the voluntary union of one man with
another or one woman with another, in the same way as the voluntary
union of a man and a woman, it would surely be bizarre in the extreme

the noble Lord, but let me try to explain why. The amendment seeks to
create two classes of marriage. It is conceived from the notion, as the
noble and learned Lord said, that what same-sex couples want is use of
the word “marriage”. It simply misses the point. What
same-sex couples want is marriage itself. They want to share with
opposite-sex couples the joy of married life, and to be treated equally
by the state and by society. They do not want to be “married
(same sex couples)”, and I suspect that opposite-sex couples do
not want their union bracketed,
either.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000111">The
noble and learned Lord has gone to a huge amount of trouble to identify
and draft amendments to ensure that the brackets are in the right
places and the sexual orientation identifiers placed at any and all
opportunities. The question that perplexes me is: why is that
necessary? Why does the noble and learned Lord want to pick out gay
couples in such a public and conspicuous way? I understand that those
opposed to same-sex marriage, having lost the vote at Second Reading,
now want a second—and, judging by the Marshalled List, a third,
fourth, fifth and sixth—bite 
<?notus-xml column=21?>of the cherry. “Give them marriage”, says the noble and
learned Lord, “but not the name. Call it something else:
‘traditional marriage’ and ‘marriage (same sex
couples)’—anything but marriage itself”. That is a
new battle; in that way we can preserve the inequality between same-sex
and opposite-sex
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000112">If
we do that, what of international recognition? This amendment would
allow other countries to treat same-sex couples differently from
opposite-sex couples. Those countries will say, “We recognise
only marriage (opposite sex couples)”. We will draw in statute a
difference for others to exploit. That is a bad idea. The word
“marriage” should be able to be used by couples
regardless of their sexual
orientation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000113">I
have a great deal of respect and admiration for the noble and learned
Lord and agree with much of what he says on many occasions, but I find
myself diametrically opposed to his view on this matter. I do not think
that the noble and learned Lord or other noble Lords who have spoken in
support of this amendment will ever see this Bill as I do. The
amendment that the noble and learned Lord has crafted is a means of
dividing us, not uniting us. It pours salts on to wounds at a time when
we should be healing. It will allow others—not noble Lords in
this place—to create mischief where none was intended. It will
be argued that Parliament made the distinction so must have had a
purpose in doing so. There the discrimination
begins.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000114">We
have an obligation in this House to make good and to rebuild once this
Bill is passed. This amendment would leave a scar on the Bill for
another day, and another battle to be fought. For those reasons, and
many more, I hope that this amendment will be defeated. Two classes of
marriage, however well disguised, is the very opposite of what this
Bill is designed to do. Giving us the use of the word
“marriage” with one hand and taking back its exclusivity
with the other would be a fatal blow to the intentions of the Bill.

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, it is always with very great care that
one clashes with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, particularly
when one has to suggest to him that there is an illogicality in the
argument that he has put forward. He said, on the one hand, that there
is a whole range of differences between same-sex marriage and
opposite-sex marriage. In that, he is not only right but obviously
right. He then attached to that the reason for making this distinction
in the Bill, but it is a distinction that does not need to be in the 
<?notus-xml column=22?>Bill because, as he says, it is universally recognised. Therefore,
making the distinction in the Bill must be for a different
purpose.</hs_para>

we have heard the debate continue, we have moved from the careful
language of the noble and learned Lord to expositions which explain the
purpose of the amendments. When they are referred to as modest
amendments, I think only of the modest proposal which, in Dean
Swift’s writing, went rather further than that title suggested.
This modest amendment is here for a purpose. It is to say now what has
so far not been able to be said more directly, which is, “Wait a
moment, it is not quite what you say”. We will have made sure
that in the Bill, and therefore in the Act, we make a distinction that
can be referred to and used not only internationally, as the noble
Lord, Lord Alli, said, but at
home.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000119">I think
that Christians should be even more strongly opposed to this than
others because the Bill is specifically designed to give us an absolute
right to maintain our view about marriage. It does so on the basis that
it gives the state an absolute right to maintain its view about
marriage. That was, after all, something that was started back in the
days of Henry VIII, when the state said that it could make its own
decisions about what marriage meant, even though that meant disagreeing
with the highest powers in the
church<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T15:57:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000120">I
am not suggesting that the state should go any further in its
relationships with the church than Henry VIII did, but I am suggesting
that this is an historic decision and one that we should respect. The
church, under the quadruple lock, is absolutely able both to perform
and to give its teaching about marriage. That is a teaching which I
wholly support. As a convert, I have to, otherwise I would not have
made that decision and choice. However, I also believe that
parliamentarians have a duty to the whole nation, and those in the
whole nation who seek marriage do not seek marriage followed by
brackets. Indeed, I think that opposite-sex couples ought to object to
this. Why should they have marriage so
defined?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000121">I
turn to the second argument, which is that in the very clear words
quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, there is now a different way of
looking at marriage from the historic one. That was rapidly picked up
by those who want to support the amendment. I hope that we will think
carefully about this. Differentiating between same-sex marriage and
opposite-sex marriage because you think that the one is about a new
view of marriage and the other is about an old view is of course not
correct. If you wanted to distinguish between the new view
and the old view of marriage, you would have to have more brackets. You
would have to have “(traditional) marriage” for
opposite-sex marriage and “(new) marriage” for
opposite-sex marriage. No one in this House would suggest that as one
approaches the registry office or the smart hotel, one
should go up with a list of alternatives, asking, “Am I going in
for marriage-light or marriage-heavy? Am I taking marriage in this way
or that way?”. From much of my experience of some 35 years in
surgeries as a Member of Parliament—more, if you take in
the period of candidacy—I do not think that anybody
would understand having to fill in a form on that basis.</hs_para>

back to the reason, which is very simple. People want to say on the
face of the Bill that they do not accept that this is marriage, and
they want to find the nicest way of doing so. I give that to them but
in my view the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, gave it away. What he said
was, “We tried here and we did not get that, so we tried at
another point and we did not get that. We tried at another
point again and we did not get that, so we have a new wheeze, which is
here and has moved farther towards it”. I beg the House to
realise that if we accept the proposal that the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Mackay of Clashfern, put forward so elegantly and with such
absolute honesty, we are actually undermining the whole purpose of the
Bill. In that sense, and not in any other, it is a wrecking amendment
because it would mean that what we have sought to do would be
undermined.</hs_para>

thing. I hope that those who are thinking of supporting this amendment
will just remember what they are having to live down. This country has
a terrible history of the way it has treated gay people. There are
other countries which have a terrible present in the way they treat gay
people. If you think that we are going too far, then put that down to
making up for not getting there much earlier. Put it down to all those
years in which gay people were subject to punishment of a criminal
kind. Put it down to all those years of the jokes at school and
university which so hurt gay people. Put it down to what we have done
in the past to gay people and, if we go a bit further than you would

down, he has made many important points but in his first point I think
he was saying that there is no risk of confusion in the public mind and
no need for this differentiation because it is all clear. However, is
there not a risk in terms of raising children? There
is a real question in the public mind about
having children raised by, for instance, two men or two women and about
children being raised without a father. I must not go on, of course,
and this is a simple question. However, there is confusion, and is not

It would be germane if we were in France and debating the French
changes, because France changed the law about adoption. The whole
system was changed. We, of course, are not changing the law, as that
provision is already there and is not altered at all. If that was where
we were and what we were doing, there would be a different argument
because I have to tell the House that I have a huge problem with the
creation of babies in a world in which there are so many babies waiting
for adoption. I have not yet come to believe that there is enough
evidence to say that same-sex adoption is the same as or equal to
opposite-sex adoption, but none of those issues is before us today. If
they were, we would have a different argument. Because they are not,
the proposed change is naked and unashamed. It is not about children or

<?notus-xml column=24?>any of those things. It is about two different sorts of marriage and the
difference will be upheld by those of ill will and by some of those of
ignorant will, and we should not have
it.</hs_para>

Fowler:</Member></B> My Lords, I have had great respect for my noble
and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern ever since we sat in
Cabinet together, but on this proposition I am afraid I cannot support
him. He seems essentially to be making a division between one group and
another when the whole aim of the Bill is to eliminate divisions and to
seek to create some equality. To that extent, the amendment goes
against the spirit of the Bill, which both Houses of Parliament have
given massive majorities, and I think there is a limit to the number of
times that we can debate the Second Reading in this House.</hs_para>

have been told by, among others, my noble friends Lord Waddington and
Lord Cormack that we must listen to what is being said outside this
House. I agree, but that is an argument that goes both ways. We should
also take into account what gay and lesbian people feel about the way
that they have been treated and whether this is yet another attempt to
create an underlying division between them and the rest of society. The
reason they will feel that—and this is a point that my noble
friend Lord Deben referred to in his excellent speech—is the
discrimination and prejudice that they have faced over the years in
this country. Of course it is true that homosexuality is no longer an
offence in the United Kingdom, but let no one believe for a moment that
the prejudice has vanished with it. It is true that it is not so bad
here as in some notoriously homophobic countries overseas. I have just
returned from Russia, where I have been looking at exactly these kinds
of issues and where a new law has been passed to stop gay issues being
discussed, making gays and lesbians subject to attack.</hs_para>

a mountain of prejudice to overcome here in this country. A few days

verbally or even physically abused. That is Britain as it stands today,
viewed from his eyes. I listened to the gay footballer Robbie

Lord Lester for legal advice. I am happy and honoured that that process

Mackay, and others, and she means no disrespect—“to mark
out my daughter as different and to mark out her relationships as
different?”. There are many differences, and others have
described them. Every marriage is different and many of us fall into a
variety of different categories. However, there are those we choose to
mark out, and it is a choice—there is nothing inevitable about
marking out a difference. That choice that says something about the
values of the society of which we are a part and something about
ourselves. I have struggled today to understand why creating and
reinforcing that sense of us and other is so important, and it seems to
me to lie behind those

promised that I would be brief. I spent some years, as noble Lords will
know, in the United States, so perhaps I come to some of these issues
of civil rights with a slightly different perspective. I am conscious
of the dissenting view of Justice John Marshall Harlan in 1896 in
Plessy v Ferguson. It was that Supreme Court ruling that created the
basis for separate and equal. I thought I would read noble Lords one of
his sentences, slightly paraphrasing. He said, “The thin
disguise of 
<?notus-xml column=26?>equal”, and have we not heard today that these changes still
permit equal? However, he said, “The thin disguise of equal will
not mislead anyone”, and I believe that the changes proposed
today will not mislead anyone. They are not a mechanism for recognising
the common institution of marriage, which unites every adult engaging
in a committed, loving and public relationship and who chooses to

Elystan-Morgan:</Member></B> My Lords, I respectfully disagree with the
noble Lord, Lord Deben, who made an excellent speech. Although I agree
with his basic submission, I disagree with his argument that this is a
wrecking amendment. It is not a wrecking amendment, but it is an
amendment that, if carried, could defeat the whole purpose and
objective of this legislation. It is on that basis that we should look
at it this
afternoon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000139">The
issue is important but simple: whether you elongate the institution of
marriage to include same-sex marriage as one indivisible institution,
or draw a dividing line through it—a frontier line that will
create two categories of marriage, one a gold standard and one a
standard of baser metal. That is the
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000140">There
are three arguments that can be put very briefly in favour of opposing
the amendment and accepting the elongated institution argument. First,
marriage has passed through many different phases, definitions and
concepts in the past 200 years. Before the 1836 legislation, all people
who wanted to get lawfully married had to be married in the Church of
England. Many, like my forebears, found that extremely distasteful but
that was it—it was a fait accompli. Before the Married
Women’s Property Act 1882, a married woman could not hold
property; it became her husband’s upon marriage. All that she
could cling to was what was called her paraphernalia. That changed
everything. Before 1991, where two persons were married and no
separation order had been made by the courts, a man could rape his wife
and she would have no redress. Do you think that did not change the
institution immensely? One may point to a number of other phenomena
that have in total, and in many cases individually, changed the
situation fundamentally. That is the first argument: there have been
changes in the law that have fundamentally metamorphosed the whole
concept of
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000141">Secondly—I
say this with very great diffidence as a Welsh
Presbyterian—there have been changes in the spiritual world as
well. The <I>Book of Common Prayer</I> justifies marriage in three
ways: first, for the procreation of children; secondly, so that the
temptations of adultery and fornication should be removed; and thirdly,
so that there should be a lifelong, devoted, loving partnership between
two people. As far as the first is concerned, you might say that people
who are beyond child-bearing age are logically in breach of that
precept, but nobody in his or her senses would argue that. However, I
know many young people who, for professional reasons, have married on
the basis that they will not have children. That is the clearest
understanding and agreement 
<?notus-xml column=27?>between them. Do you say that their marriage should be placed in some
hermetically sealed compartment on that account? I would not argue
that. Essentially, is one not justified, to a large extent, in saying
that the essence of marriage today for so many people is that lifelong
commitment of love, affection and loyalty? If that be the case, one can
say, yes, in the spiritual world, too, there have been massive changes
that have been accepted by society.</hs_para>

justification. Many Peers have already spoken of the days before 1967,
when homosexuality was a very grave offence. I remember well over 60
years ago, when I was a young law student, going along to the assizes
and seeing the local vicar, the nonconformist minister, the accountant,
the solicitor and many similar people of high standing in society, all
being sent to prison for four or five years for what we would today
call “lavatory cases”. I remember thinking, “There

have argued with myself a great deal over the past few weeks as to
where I stand in relation to this matter. I have asked myself whether
this change—the concept of single-sex marriage, which is of
course a massive change—of such magnitude as to demean and in
some way unsettle and undermine the concept of marriage. I have asked
myself whether it any way demeans or changes my own marriage. I was
supremely happily married for 48 years to a very splendid lady, who
died six years ago. I am sure that if she were alive today, she would

Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I apologise to
my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern.
British Rail prevented me from being here when he opened this debate.
However, I have had the advantage of long discussion with him
concerning his reasons for putting forward the amendment and I support
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:22:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000146">This
is not an easy debate. I am sure that there are many in the House now
who sway this way and that. The issues are highly complex and diverse
and we have heard some outstanding speeches today. However, I disagree
totally with one of the things that my noble friend Lord Fowler said
when he put it to the House that if we passed this amendment it would
add directly to homophobia in this country. If I was even a little in
agreement with him on that, I would not be standing and speaking here.
However difficult it is to assess the reactions of the great people of
this country to matters such as this, far from increasing homophobia,
Amendment 1 could ease the passage and consequences of this
profoundly important measure for the millions of our decent, not
prejudiced and not homophobic countrymen who currently believe that we
may be foisting on them what they would call an untruth—they
might call it dishonest or a public relations exercise.</hs_para>

we like it or not, millions of our decent fellow-citizens will agree
totally about same-sex couples having the same esteem, love and
life-long commitment, and so on, but, as has been said many times, and
so one need not elaborate on it, they believe that unions between
same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples are different and that they
have profoundly different potential consequences. To say that many
opposite-sex couples are disabled, too old or disinclined to procreate
is not an answer to the fundamental factual and real difference. That
is where, I repeat, millions of our countrymen sit at this time. The
noble Lord, Lord Pannick, talked about an inferior status, but they do
not want to create anything of the sort. Nobody is interested in
belittling the commitments made by homosexuals; there are a few, but, I
maintain, not many. However, what they do say is, “Why are we
pretending that it is exactly the
same<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:24:59"></hs_TimeCode> when it is
profoundly different in one particular?” Why not use the word
“marriage”, since that is the important thing, and then
have the qualification? It is not even as though the qualification is
very novel: it is in the Title of the Bill as we sit here. I believe
that in time—and I do not think that it will be a long
time—people will concentrate on the word
“marriage” and the bracketed bit, frankly, will fade into
lesser and lesser significance as the public mind
progresses.</hs_para>

children do better than children who are born in the normal way of

Naval Secretary with responsibility for naval personnel and the Special
Investigation Branch. On taking up that post, I discovered the
degrading treatment that was meted out to people suspected of being
gay, who had anonymous phone calls made about them. It was still
illegal to be gay in the services. I was shocked and appalled at how
gay people were treated. I stopped that behaviour immediately and then
pushed very hard to allow them to be accepted in the Armed Forces.
Thank goodness, that happened because it worked brilliantly and it is a

treated homosexuals and lesbians in this country, as was said by the

briefly now. Having talked to dozens of gay people recently and to my

only thing gay and lesbian people want is to be treated as ordinary
people. They do not want to be (extraordinary) people. People who are
on the receiving end of prejudice, particularly when they are
practising Christians and live profoundly Christian lives, know what
those brackets mean. They mean that you are different; you are not
ordinary. Being ordinary means living in your community and bringing up
children—maybe lots of children. It means going to church
regularly and being accepted on the same basis as every other Christian
in your community. It means sharing with your fellows on an equal
basis. Gay and lesbian people do not want brackets as they make them
different and will make them even more different as they travel across
the world. I beg your Lordships, in common decency, to give gay people

Thornton:</B> My Lords, I ask your Lordships not to be seduced by the
honeyed words and assurances of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay
of Clashfern, of whom we are all extremely fond and for whom we have
the most enormous respect. However, assertions about consummation 
<?notus-xml column=31?>and children, for which there is really no evidence, are nothing to do
with this Bill. The effects of these amendments are the same as those
introduced in Committee at the beginning: that one form of marriage is
different and therefore probably inferior to another. This completely
flies in the face of the Bill’s
purpose.</hs_para>

of the noble and learned Lord’s concern about family
and children, because he has spoken about them many times in this
Chamber. However, with respect, these are not the issues being
discussed in this Bill. I agree with many noble Lords who said that
this will probably be known as the “brackets” amendment.
We do not want or need brackets in this Bill, because its very purpose
is to provide for the state to recognise equally the relationships of
couples who wish to make a loving and lifelong commitment to each
other, regardless of whether they are between members of the same sex
or of the opposite
sex.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000165">I accept
that this purpose moves the statutory concept of marriage beyond that
which proponents of traditional marriage agree. This amendment is about
creating two classes of marriage. I congratulate my noble friend Lord
Anderson, who spoke of celebrating his special wedding anniversary, but
I hope that I will live long enough to celebrate silver wedding
anniversaries of same-sex marriages which will take place next summer.
My noble friends Lord Alli and Lord Richard, and the noble Lords, Lord
Fowler, Lord Deben, Lord Pannick and Lord Lester, put the case
powerfully and
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000166">I am
surprised by the opposition to equality of marriage from the noble
Earl, Lord Listowel, given his work with children, for which he is
famous in this House. If he had discussed this with young people, as I
have, he may find that in most cases they really do not understand what
the fuss is about or what the problem is here. I do not think that the
problems faced by the types of young people the noble Earl helps and
supports are a result of, for instance, the proposal for same-sex
marriage. That cannot be the case.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Waddington, that I have not seen any hostility to the
church during the course of these discussions. My noble friend Lady
Royall and I have met both the Church of England and the Roman Catholic
Church on several occasions throughout the course of this Bill. They
were friendly exchanges and friendly discussion. We disagree with each
other on some of this Bill, but I have not seen any unfriendliness, nor
do I think that the dismal picture that the noble Lord paints will come
to pass.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000168">I do
not think that the word “wife” will be abolished. As a
wife, I certainly do not think so and I hope that nobody will put any
ideas into my husband’s head. We wives are probably very safe
with the passage of this Bill. My noble friend Lord Alli asked the
question, “Why do same-sex couples have to have bracketed
marriages?”. I agree with him that it is a bad idea. We should
defeat this
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000169"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:40:00"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Stowell of Beeston" PimsId="5900" UID="13070811000829" xid="2111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000829">Baroness
Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
and learned friend for introducing his amendment and for all the
contributions to the debate. One or two noble Lords referred to this
issue as being complex. I disagree with them. What is before us is 
<?notus-xml column=32?>very simple. There is one institution of marriage, it is one of the most
important institutions that we have, and we want gay and lesbian
couples to be a part of it in exactly the same way as any other couples
who wish to be
married<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:40:36"></hs_TimeCode>. These
amendments create two separate, potentially legal institutions and,
therefore, undermine the fundamental purpose of the Bill, as other
noble Lords, including the noble Lords, Lord Pannick, Lord Alli, Lord
Deben and Lord Richard, have
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:40:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

introduced a change in support of gay rights, it has been hard-fought
for and not always been easy to progress. None the less, it has made it
easier to take the next step. Each step makes it easier for gay men and
women to live their lives in the same way as straight men and women. I
noted what the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said about gay men and
women wanting to live ordinary lives. The more that we allow them to do
so, and to see them doing so, the more it leads us to believe that we
should remove from them any barriers to being able to do
just
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:41:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

partnerships was a massive step forward. Through them, we gave gay
couples equal rights. I was not in Parliament at the time, but I
guessed that Parliament decided that the difference between us
justified keeping gay men and women out of the institution of marriage.
However, over the past eight or nine years, as we witnessed civil
partnerships taking place and have become familiar with couples in
civil partnerships, we as a society have realised that the exclusion of
gay men and women from marriage is not
justified<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:42:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Cormack said that he wanted us to reach a compromise and that the
amendment represented that. I say to him and to all noble Lords who
support him and these amendments that the time for
compromise is over. We now understand that serious relationships
between gay men and between gay women are no different from serious
relationships between straight men and women. I have said many times
during the passage of the Bill that gay couples want to settle down for
exactly the same reasons as all other couples do. They are
two people who love each other, want to commit to each other, want to
provide security and stability for each other, and want
to be a team, a partnership and to support each
other. Like straight people, that is what leads gay people to want to
marry. There is no difference there between
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:43:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble and learned friend Lord Mackay pointed to differences and raised
the issue of procreation and children to illustrate his argument. The
Bill as it stands distinguishes between same-sex couples and
opposite-sex couples only as far as is necessary to achieve a practical
result. My noble and learned friend talked at length about children. In
response, I should make just a few points.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:40:54"></hs_TimeCode> first, which
is really important, is that if we enact the Bill, the children of
same-sex couples will be able to enjoy the same status as other
children. That is a fantastic thing to be able to achieve. It will mean
that children at school will not be treated differently, as their
parents will be married in the same way as other parents may
be.</hs_para>

second point is that the Bill does nothing to change the parental
status and responsibility for children born to a woman married to a
woman or a child adopted by two men. I set out this in great detail in
a letter to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Guildford after the debate on parental responsibility in Committee. The
paragraph in Schedule 4 to the Bill which refers to parental
responsibility does only one thing—it makes clear a statement of
biological fact. A child born to a woman married to a woman is not
biologically linked to both spouses. However, it is important to stress
that, through this Bill, everything that already exists in law about
parental responsibility for children—whether they are children
born through IVF or adopted—or any other measure that safeguards
their future, which is important, will not change; we are not changing
anything in that
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:46:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000175">The
noble Earl, Lord Listowel, referred to the importance of both parents
of a child being able to provide support to that child and the child
succeeding. He questioned whether there was any evidence about how a
child thrives in the family of a same-sex couple. I should say to the
noble Earl and to all noble Lords that there is clear evidence that the
children of same-sex couples do very well indeed. Research shows that
they do better than children of opposite-sex couples. So there is
evidence there. There is no evidence to suggest that a child who is
part of a family where the parents are a same-sex couple should give
any cause for
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:47:12"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:47:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Waddington said that we have rejected the view that marriage can only
be between a man and a woman and that it was only right, therefore,
that we consider these amendments because we were not taking that
belief into account. I disagree with that. As I said at Second Reading,
this Bill is as much about protecting religious freedom and the belief
that people should be absolutely free to hold and express the view that
marriage should be between a man and a woman. However, for all the
reasons expressed by many noble Lords during today’s
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:48:06"></hs_TimeCode>, we are
not going to legislate in a way that creates two separate types of
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000177">The
key point I want to make is that gay men and women want to marry
because they support the institution of marriage and want the stability
and security it offers. They do not want to change it. They want

Government want to make that happen. As I said at the beginning, there
is one institution of marriage and we are opening the door to it. We do
not want to open a separate door marked “same-sex

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> I thank the noble Baroness for her reply
to my question about research into outcomes for children of same-sex
couples. It is encouraging and reassuring, to some extent, that there
is positive research about the experiences of two women bringing up a
child. However, is she aware that it is still early days in terms of
research? We have not, for instance, looked very deeply at what happens
to children being brought up by two men. We have not looked at issues
around 
<?notus-xml column=34?>lower income couples and the outcomes for them. Surely we need to keep
in mind, and be critical about, all the research because we know, for
instance, about poor outcomes for boys who grow up without fathers. We
need to look at the research critically because it is still early
days.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_08_PT_1/4065E6BAE0393927A2685F1DCC58BB1D939375F6" __version__="1.12"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 8 July 2013">Monday,

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> I would disagree with the noble
Earl’s suggestion that there is a difference in outcomes for
children of same-sex couples, but that is a debate for another day.
That argument, and the points he makes are not relevant to the
amendments before us, which are about creating two different types of
marriage. We are saying that there is only one institution of marriage,
and both gay and straight couples who want to get married should be
able to be part of that one institution on equal
terms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000181"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Mackay of Clashfern" PimsId="1610" UID="13070811000832" xid="1761" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000832">Lord
Mackay of Clashfern:</Member></B> My Lords, I am obliged to all those
who have taken part in this debate, whether supporting or opposing my
amendment. It is interesting to hear what people have to say. I quite
understand that the noble Lord, Lord Alli, does not like the brackets,
but they have been put in by Government in the Bill’s Title. I
thought, what else can I do but accept the Government’s guidance
on the matter? However, I think perhaps that that is not the noble
Lord’s most important
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000182">My
noble friend Lord Deben, in a characteristic speech, said that the
distinction between the two types of marriage was universally
recognised, so why should it be recognised in the Bill? If it is
universally recognised, surely it would be right to recognise it in the
Bill because it is founded on the absolute fact of what occurs. The two
are distinct. I do not try to separate them; I just distinguish because
they are distinct in fact, and nobody can alter that. The idea that I
am trying to wreck the Bill is not correct, I am sorry to
say—well, perhaps I am not sorry; I should be glad to say that
it is certainly not correct. I want to recognise in the Bill a
distinction which, according to my noble friend Lord Deben—and
who higher an authority?—is universally recognised. It damages
the Bill in the eyes of ordinary people when it is not seen that that
is
recognised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000183">My
noble friend said that I went on at length about children. I am sorry
if I went on too long, but it is a very important factor. Children are
very much at the centre of the institution of marriage as it
was—and is until the Bill is passed. They are very much at the
centre, and indeed, as your Lordships know, in relation to divorce and
all that, elaborate provisions were made for children. Children are
very important to marriage. There is a statement about children in the
Bill which I regard as very important. Paragraph 2(1) of Part 2 of
Schedule 4
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13070811000256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000256">“Section
11 does not extend the common law presumption that a child born to a
woman during her marriage is also the child of her husband …
Accordingly, where a child is born to a woman during her marriage to
another woman, that presumption is of no relevance to the question of
who the child’s parents
are”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13070811000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000184">Therefore,
the situation is that when two women are married under the Bill, and
one of them has a child, that child has the same status as if the woman
were single. If that is not a distinction—it should be
recognised at some point, whether in brackets or otherwise—I do 
<?notus-xml column=35?>not know what an important distinction can be. If the Government want to
improve on the brackets, I shall be happy that they should do so, but I
believe that there is a universally recognised distinction between the
marriage of two men or two women on the one hand and the marriage of a
man and a woman on the other. These are facts that depend on something
outside, and impossible to move, or remove by this legislation. The
Bill would be improved by people realising what it does and recognising
this universally understood
distinction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070811000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070811000185">My
noble friend Lord Lester quoted from the dissenting judgment of one of
the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. He
distinguished between the two types of marriage: the one slightly older
and the more recent one. I want to include in the Bill recognition of
that distinction. The quotation of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, seemed
to imply the necessity for some form of sexual relationship in both
types of marriage. I pointed out, and I think it has been accepted so
far, that same-sex marriage is not gay marriage—it is quite
wrong to describe it thus. It includes gay marriage, of course, but it
is wider because it involves same-sex couples, whether gay or not.
Platonic relationships are perfectly possible under the
Bill.</hs_para>

Lester of Herne Hill:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble and

preferred one to the other or said that one was superior to the other,
is quite unfounded so far as these amendments are concerned. There are
later amendments that may go further, but this amendment strikes me as
the absolute minimum to recognise the distinction that exists in fact.

Cumberlege:</Member></B> My Lords, in Committee, I introduced an
amendment that allowed civic registrars to exercise a right to
conscientiously object to conducting same-sex marriages. Although there
was some support for that amendment—in fact, there was quite a
bit—I sensed there would be much more support for a transitional
amendment that would protect only registrars in office now; they would
be protected only once the Bill becomes law. These men and women are
already in post and were, in effect, exempt when the law on civil
partnerships was introduced in 2004. I am very grateful to the noble
Lords who have put their names to this much narrower and more focused
amendment, and to those who wished to put their names down. They were
restricted by the fact that only four names are
allowed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070819000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070819000004">We
understand the nervousness about allowing future registrars to object
conscientiously, but why not take those who are in office now? Without
protection, those registrars will be faced with an impossible position:
resign and face possible unemployment, given how difficult it is to
find a job in today’s labour market; or stay and act against
their conscience. The lack of protection is unfair and inconsistent
with other areas of law, and it will unduly limit the freedom of
thought, conscience and
religion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T17:15:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070819000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070819000005">We
need to be fair to all. We need to ensure that those who wish to can
exercise a conscience clause and that those who want a same-sex
marriage can marry. Nothing in the amendment would prevent couples of
the same sex marrying. In the spirit of tolerance and respect, we have
considered and dealt with almost every concern put to us in this House
and the other place. The noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, asked whether a
previous amendment would open the door to registrars conscientiously to
object to other things, such as mixed-race marriages. That was never
our intention, and this amendment makes it clear beyond doubt that
registrars will be able to object conscientiously only to same-sex
marriages. We have done so by making it absolutely clear in proposed
new subsection (6) that the conscientious objection applies
only to the solemnisation of marriages. That is reinforced by proposed
new subsection (8), which states that the religious or other belief on
which the conscientious objection must be sincerely held must concern
only the marriage of same-sex couples. Any other conscientious
objection to marriage will not be covered by our amendment, so it will
not allow registrars to object to conducting marriages for any other
reasons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T17:16:52"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T17:16:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Barker, seemed concerned about the scope of our previous amendment. She
was under the impression that it would allow registrars conscientiously
to object to more than the conducting of marriage. She was concerned
that a registrar could, for example, sit in a register office at
interview and refuse to assist any same-sex couple. Again, that is not
what we intended. Therefore, our amendment has been revised to make it
abundantly clear in proposed new subsection (6) that a registrar may
conscientiously object only to conducting a same-sex marriage. Proposed
new subsection (7) puts that beyond doubt by stating that any other
activities will not be
covered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T17:17:41"></hs_TimeCode>. Our

stress that our amendment is not unprecedented; it is nothing new. My
noble friend, replying to the debate in Committee, attempted to draw a
distinction between our conscience clause and others found
in English law. I drew the attention of the House
to numerous other cases, such as a doctor’s right to refuse to
give contraceptive advice, a person’s right not to participate
in work involving the treatment and development of human embryos, and
the right of a Sikh not to wear a motor cycle helmet or a safety
helmet.</hs_para>

the protection for teachers is not explicitly framed as a
conscience clause, such as in our amendment, it operates like one
nevertheless, because it also allows atheist teachers to refuse to
conduct religious education without suffering any detriment. That
operates at voluntary-aided faith schools and, interestingly, at
non-faith schools. I am not saying that the registrar scenario is like
that of a doctor not giving contraceptive advice or a teacher refusing
to teach religious education.</hs_para>

clauses and others—of which there are many—are all
different, and they all allow a person to refrain from undertaking
different activities. The difference did not prevent conscience clauses
in those cases, so why does it in this case? What makes registrars are
so different as to warrant their forcible registration? Is the belief
about marriage not as valuable as a belief about contraception? Is the
belief about marriage not as worthy of protection as a teacher’s
conscientious objection to teaching religious education? It is not,
with the greatest respect, an answer to say that they perform a civil
or a public function because doctors, medical professionals, teachers
and so on, all of whom have the right to object conscientiously to some
activities, also perform public functions for civil society. Not only
is it therefore not fair to force all registrars currently in
employment to conduct same-sex marriages if they conscientiously object
to them, it is also
unnecessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070819000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070819000010">I

the chairman of the national panel for registration, but it takes us no

consultation meetings, how many registrars attended each meeting. Only
one or two registrars could have turned up, for all we know. Were the 
<?notus-xml column=41?>registrars who were not present asked for their opinion? For those who
were, was there a general discussion or a confidential questionnaire?

unfortunate Miss Ladele. The second meeting was simply for 10 managers,
whom we know are fearful that a conscience clause might
cause them managerial inconvenience. Who attended the most recent

series of unsupported statements, including that for the past 176 years
registrars have been carrying out their duties and have never wanted a
conscience clause. Of course they have not; they have never needed one.
Local authorities up and down the country were able to accommodate
their registrars’ conscientious objections. When an authority
did not, it was taken to the European Court of Human Rights. The Joint
Committee on Human Rights recognised the argument that registrars
currently in office would not be free to hold to their beliefs if they
were automatically designated as same-sex registrars. I welcome this
conclusion and I urge noble Lords to support and accommodate the
registrars currently in office. It is the right and the fair thing to
do. In the spirit of tolerance and freedom of the individual, which is
the hallmark of this House, let us together protect the
registrars’ freedom of thought, conscience and religion. With
this very modest but important amendment, we seek to do that. I beg to

Williams of Crosby:</Member></B> My Lords, I am a signatory to this
amendment. I realise that the time is going by and I shall make my
remarks in support of my noble friend Lady Cumberlege brief ones.
Interestingly, there is a real dilemma here about both equality and
liberty. Although the amendment is brief and limits itself to a modest
request, it has considerably greater implications than may at first be
realised.</hs_para>

registrar is the first step towards a career in public life for a great
many people. It is a job which they do for the community and one in
which they reflect their community’s interests and concerns. It
is a crucial step on the path towards the integration of different
minorities, regardless of religion, language or earlier origin. It is
therefore all the more important in communities where a large minority
is present—let us say Muslims, or other religious
groups—to make it possible for them to become registrars. To my
regret, this amendment is limited quite deliberately to those already
in office. I personally think that it would be better if it applied to
anyone applying for this job, which, I repeat, in my view at least is
the very first rung of a professional career in public life.</hs_para>

shall take this one step further. There are some religions that, for
deeply held principles, very strongly cannot accept the idea of
single-sex marriage. That includes most of the Muslim faith and those
who are supporters of Orthodox Jewry. It seems only right that
registrars who hold those faiths, and who have done their job properly
and intend to go on doing it well, should not be excluded from entry
into that profession or, even worse, forced out of it when they have
already been in it for several years and have performed satisfactorily.
I can think of almost nothing crueller than to announce that after two
or three years a registrar who has been behaving himself or herself in
an upright and proper manner should be compelled to leave their job,
often at a time when they have children and other responsibilities,
because of this legislation. I cannot for the life of me believe that
most people in this Chamber who believe in equality and human rights
would want to see that happen.</hs_para>

I do not understand why this relatively limited change could not be
made easily to permit people to make this decision on conscientious

giving advice on contraception or taking part in abortion. This very
limited right, linked to one particular thing, would allow their
conscience to be exercised.</hs_para>

have two important points to add on this. The numbers concerned would
be relatively small. I have recently looked at the record following the
passage of gay rights in Spain, and one is talking of a few score
people every year. That means that any decent register office could
easily, by dint of rotation or of acceptance, treat this rather in the
way that they do, quite properly, in the case of a registrar or an
assistant registrar who becomes pregnant, covering for them in their
enforced absence. That happens to all of us virtually every day of the
week in existing forms of employment. It happens to civil servants,
lawyers, teachers and doctors, and there is no reason on earth why it

have to say to the Minister that I find this insistence on such people

believe that this is genuinely a conflict about equality and liberty. I

strongly commend my noble friend’s amendment. I add one thing to
what she said about attempting to discover the opinions of registrars.
It is always a mistake to ask the opinions of managers about the views
of the people they manage, unless you have a proper method of
discovering what they are. Surely we 
<?notus-xml column=43?>know from the sad history of Mid Staffs that one of the things you
should not do if you smell difficulties is to talk to the top
management and assume that they truly reflect what the ordinary,
everyday workforce thinks, because often they have a very strong
in-built desire to avoid any problems of managerial difficulty, which
they always see as too big an obstacle. I strongly support my noble

amendment. It is a narrow and transitional amendment and does not in
any way affect the fundamental underlying purpose of this Bill.
Marriage registrars carry out a particularly attractive job. On the
number of occasions where I have been to a civil ceremony, I have
watched, with mounting enthusiasm, the way in which the registrar has
made the marriage ceremony a really important occasion. I
assume—and, indeed, I hope, since this Bill will become
law—that the majority of registrars will give the same
enthusiasm and pleasure to the single-sex couple as I have seen them do
in those services. I am about to go to yet another

when a number of registrars took the job, the idea that marriage would
be between single-sex couples was not even a blink on the horizon. I
can understand perfectly well that those who come in in future will
take a job in which they recognise that they will marry everybody,
whether that is two males, two females or a male and a female. For
those already in the post, for the reasons that the noble Baronesses,
Lady Cumberlege and Lady Williams of Crosby, have both put forward,
this is a small and special group. It would be particularly sad if,
having given to the minority in this country the right to marry in the
same way as the majority, that we cannot recognise that there remains a
minority who cannot take it. Are we to say that that minority, those
who came into post before one ever thought there would be same-sex
marriages, is not to be recognised at
all?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070814000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070814000003">As has

is a distinction that is important. The important thing is that the law
is changed after somebody has taken a job, and that law affects the
conscientious view that that person has of the job. The nearest thing
that came to my mind, in my own experience and connection with this,
was when Sunday trading was introduced, again on a free vote. Those who
were employed were given terms in relation to that. It seems to me that

For my part, I cannot accept that a public official is entitled to
protection against the requirement to perform his or her basic
obligations in relation to the official duties which they are
contracted to perform. As was pointed out in Committee, a judge or a
magistrate who administers the law of the land cannot refuse to
administer laws to which he or she objects. The law may well be
clarified after that judge or magistrate has been appointed. No doubt
some registrars have a conscientious objection to marrying divorced
couples; I cannot see that a conscientious objection to same-sex
marriage is any
different.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070814000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0001.htm#13070814000011">Of
course, as has been pointed out, the law does allow, in various
contexts, for conscientious objections, including doctors and abortion

the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. The difference,
as I see it, is that the registrar is performing the function of the
state, and the function of the state in this respect is to marry
people. The law, not the registrar, determines who is eligible to
marry. It is unfortunate if registrars take the view that they cannot
continue to perform this role, but no one is asking them to approve of
or bless same-sex marriage; all that they will be required to do is to
perform the official function that they have contracted to

people on to those adoption agencies that did do that, there was no
reason to do it, except that sometimes we mistake toleration for

of the judge is consistently and continuously to interpret the law. He

laws with which they do not agree, so it is perfectly proper to insist
that they should use their technical ability to impose sentences for

way, to be less strict on things which they think ought to have been
much better assessed by Parliament. But that is not true of registrars

what the noble Baroness said about how important it is for a marriage
to be conducted in a very proper way. Sometimes the presence of a
registrar can make a marriage very special, but the registrar is
invited to register a marriage, not to make it or to bless it. If he or
she does not register it, someone else will have to. It is not going to
make a difference to whether that marriage takes place. We need to have
concern for smaller registry offices that do not have a huge number of

might seem unfair to some that registrars who do not approve of gay
marriage should have their jobs put at risk if they refuse to marry
same-sex couples. Registration is the core of what those public

substantial part of their job that creates the issue, not their
religious belief. We divide church and state, and I think it is
dangerous to let church bleed into state functions. I believe that

has insisted, quite rightly, and I am happy that it has done so, that
any individual priest or cleric, no matter how strong their belief in

organisation has agreed. There is a blanket exemption, so if I were a
priest—the Bishop of Salisbury—and I deeply believed that
I should be allowed to marry gay couples, why could I not opt in? There
is a blanket ban from the churches. Individual opt-in and opt-out are
not on the table. The churches themselves ruled it out at the beginning
of this process. No priest can opt in; no registrar can opt out. If we
accept the case for religious organisations barring individuals from
opting in, we, too, must accept the case for civil registrars not being

that this is a very old story. In the case of Ladele, which was one of
the cases that went to the Strasbourg court, our courts decided that a
registrar could not exercise conscientious objection in relation to
civil partnerships. The Strasbourg court upheld our domestic
courts’ judgment to that effect. My noble and learned friend
Lord Mackay of Clashfern took objection to it and we debated it at the
time. The current position is that, under Strasbourg law as well as
domestic law, there is no right to conscientious objection in this
context, and nor should there

Knight of Collingtree:</Member></B> My Lords, in the first debate on
the Bill, I warned that we were losing the right to have and live by a
conscientious objection all the time. I gave a number of instances, one
of which has been referred to today, which was the simple and widely
known fact that all Catholic adoption agencies have had to close
because they are not happy about putting a child in a home
where there are two men or two ladies. I agree completely with what was
said in the earlier debate about the monstrous way that we
in this country and, I am afraid, other countries have treated
homosexuals in the past. However, those who point out how wrong that
was are saying, “But it’s only wrong up to a point. We
can demand that other rules are made that aren’t fair”.
More and more I come to the conclusion is that one person’s
human rights are the denial of another person’s human
rights.</hs_para>

during the First World War—that people were able to have a

were extremely important in the war effort, and that happened in the
last war, too. We must guard and guide that trend. It is woefully and
obviously wrong to say today that it is right that conscientious
objections shall, in certain circumstances, be smothered. It has to be

will not be able to go into the career that perhaps they have planned
for many years. I urge noble Lords to recognise that it is very
dangerous for a free country to deny a person’s right to live by

take account of the fact that some individuals may be affected. What
representations have been made on their behalf is not the point. We
need to allow for the fact that some such individuals may have serious
grounds of conscience. I turn to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick. He says that these people have a contract, as registrars, to
carry out marriages. However, the crucial point is that the marriage
that they are now asked to carry out is not what they understood
marriage to mean when they signed the contract. We have to take account
of the fact that we

amendment, as has been pointed out, but it has a certain symbolic
importance. A lot turns on the status of the issues that we talk about,
and that has dogged our debates throughout. The noble Lord, Lord
Lester, asked why there is an exception in this case. However, the law
does make exceptions in relation to the strongly held beliefs of a
significant number of members of a religious body in relation to sexual
orientation. The law allows religious bodies to have single-gender
priesthoods or whatever. We have agreed exceptions in that area that we
have not agreed in other areas, such as divorce. That is why the
parallel between same-sex marriage and divorce—I think that the
noble Lord, Lord Pannick, raised that point—does not quite
follow. It depends on what one regards as the status of the different
issues. For example, as I pointed out at Second Reading, historically
the canons of the Church of England have never banned clergy from
remarrying divorced people. A different status applies in this
instance.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070832000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070832000006">One
of the problems is that a lot of people here—and I understand
why—feel that this whole issue is a no-brainer, and that anyone
who is opposed to same-sex marriage is almost de facto and de jure
homophobic. That rather destroys the concept of reasonable
debate. I find that that happens in the Church of
England over the issue of women bishops: if you are opposed to that,
somehow a glaze goes over people’s eyes and they cannot speak to
you at all. As the noble Lord, Lord Deben, said, it is about
having tolerance in the democracy in which we live. The issue is a

registrar who is now, perhaps, 45. Almost 10 years ago we had the Civil
Partnership Act. During the passage of that Bill through this House the
noble and learned Baroness on our Front Bench said in terms that there
would be no relevance for marriage. That was said clearly in terms. If
that same registrar—who might have been put off by the
possibility of same-sex marriage—had looked at the manifestos of
the different parties at the last election, not one of which mentioned
same-sex marriage, should he nevertheless have anticipated that there
was a faint possibility of that happening? Of course not. It
is wholly unreasonable, even in the light of the recent past and the
stampede over the past years, to imagine that someone would have
anticipated that the situation would change.</hs_para>

Lester, talked about victims. He talked about the victimhood, if I can
repeat that word, of the couple who are not married because the
registrar has an objection. However, what is certain is that a
registrar will be a victim because—given the identikit of the
person I have mentioned, who is perhaps in mid-life, has been a
registrar for a number of years and did not anticipate the
change—his job will go. Being a registrar does not provide
specific training for anything else. He will face the fact that the
terms and conditions of his employment, on which he embarked some years
ago, have been fundamentally altered. However, there is no reasonable
prospect of victimhood for the gay couple who quite properly ask to be
married, because there can be a reasonable accommodation. There will be
a team or group of registrars in a particular district, and the couple
can avoid the one individual who has a conscientious objection and,
without any fuss, move their case to someone else. After all, I suspect
that, after the initial surge of gay people who want to get married,
there will be very few cases and relatively few registrars involved. If
the district is very small, an arrangement can be made with an
adjoining district—as in other areas of local government
administration—for the relatively small number of cases that
occur.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070832000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070832000012">The
noble Lord, Lord Pannick, took a fairly absolutist view, in my
judgment. Public officials enforce the law; the registrar is a public
official; he enforces the law or he takes the consequences. However, I
think that there are other public officials for whom accommodations are
found in statute. Doctors, given our National Health Service, are also
public officials in the broad definition of the term, and so are
teachers. Given that teachers overwhelmingly receive their salaries
from the state, their terms and conditions of employment come from the
state, yet we find exception for them.</hs_para>

should refrain from using that word—for the Government. The
proud tradition of my party over the centuries has been looking after

leader of the Government said that there would be no legislation for
same-sex marriage. Therefore, it is not inconceivable that the people
employed in registry offices might have formed a legitimate expectation
that that would be the case. We have to accept that a consequence of
this legislation will be to exclude from being employed as registrars
people in the Islamic, Sikh, Orthodox Jewish and Christian communities
who have profound beliefs. We simply have to accept that consequence.
It is for Parliament to legislate and if Parliament makes that
decision, that is proper. However, we have to bear in mind that there
is a significant problem for Islamic women who get married in a
religious wedding, think they are married and then find that, because
there has been no civil marriage, they are not married and can be set
aside.</hs_para>

must do all we can to enable existing registrars, who may be members of

Vinson:</Member></B> The noble Lord, Lord Lester, gave the impression
that registrars who were not happy with same-sex marriage would make
their feelings known. It would be much more sensible to allow
registrars with deep religious convictions who feel that they cannot
conduct same-sex marriages to say quietly when the roster of registrars
is being sorted out, “Do you mind if I am off with a cold on
Tuesday?” as everybody will understand why that is being done.
We are talking about a very small exception here. The converse is to
make such people conduct these ceremonies. We are told—it is
true—that registrars conduct ceremonies with spirit and feeling.
If ever I married again—God forbid—I would not want a
registrar to conduct the ceremony through gritted teeth because he did
not like doing it. This is a thoroughly sensible amendment. I remind
all those who are against it of the very moving words attributed, I
believe, to Christopher Fry about the downtrodden not treading

amendment. Those who are totally opposed to same-sex marriage have day
in and day out taken up an enormous amount of your Lordships’
time in making their case. This is the dying embers of their attempts
to go on making their case. It has nothing to do with tolerance. No one
is remotely asking those registrars who oppose same-sex marriage
suddenly to say that they are now in favour of it, as happened under
the old Stalinist rules. No one is remotely asking them to do that.
They can say what they truly believe for as long as they like and where
they like. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, made the central
point—I would have thought that was enough to end the
debate—when he said that all we are asking them to do is the job
they are paid to do. That is the beginning and end of the story. There
is nothing more to be said. This has nothing to do with tolerance. When
I think of some of the things I have had to tolerate with which I do
not agree, I shudder, but one does one’s job. As the noble Lord,
Lord Pannick, so excellently said, we are not asking these people to
change their minds. They can keep their views but they must do the job

public servant for many years and have had to make difficult
assessments and understand the nature of different staff and what they
bring to the job. The arguments about generosity and inclusiveness are
extremely attractive, but how does a manager decide who has a genuine
conscientious objection and who has not? Unless you have criteria and
people have previously said something about where they stand on the
issue, it will be very difficult to make that decision. Unless there is
absolute clarity about the matter, some people will choose not to
perform a ceremony because they do not want to do it as opposed to
having a conscientious objection to doing it. What about all the other
conscientious objections that people may have? Should they not be able
to object to marrying people who have a serious criminal history? What
if they discover that one of the marriage partners has been a
paedophile? Do they have the right to voice a 
<?notus-xml column=55?>conscientious objection to marrying them? This argument could get us
into enormous difficulties if we carry it

Walton of Detchant:</Member></B> My Lords, this may by no means be
exact, but when the Abortion Act became law many years ago, it was
quickly recognised that doctors, particularly obstetricians, who were
of a particular religious faith, might well have a serious objection to
carrying out abortion on ethical grounds. That was even if, on complete
medical advice and investigation, patients had been shown to have
fulfilled all the criteria established by law. Some could have argued
that those refusing to conduct abortions were not fulfilling their
terms and conditions of service within the National Health Service.
That argument was not widely used, but on the other hand it was quickly
recognised by the doctors’ regulatory authority, the General
Medical Council, that it was proper for doctors of that particular
religious persuasion, who had an immensely powerful objection to
carrying out abortion, to be able to refuse to do so on religious and
ethical grounds. However, they were advised that in those circumstances
they should do their best to see that the individual in question who
had fulfilled all the conditions set down by law should be referred to
another consultant who might be willing to carry out that
procedure.</hs_para>

the best of my knowledge, registrars who are public servants do not
have a regulatory authority. It may be argued that those who refuse to
carry out and register a single-sex marriage on religious or
conscientious grounds do not fulfil their existing terms and conditions
of service. This is a simple amendment. It protects those registrars at
present in post who object to carrying 
<?notus-xml column=56?>out single-sex marriages on powerful conscientious grounds. Once they
have retired, the issue will no longer be with us. All registrars
appointed in future will recognise that the terms of this law on
single-sex marriage apply to them and they will not have the right to
object on grounds of conscience. This amendment protects the ones who

is an important matter of principle here. Marriage
registrars are public servants performing statutory duties
on behalf of the state. They should be expected to perform their duties
in accordance with the law, without discrimination. An important
distinction can be made between the conscience clauses with regard to 
<?notus-xml column=59?>abortion and circumstances in which we are asking people to perform
duties on behalf of the state, without
discrimination.</hs_para>

to same-sex couples, the Government have made it clear throughout that
the Bill should protect and promote religious freedom. A substantial
amount in the Bill does that. As the noble Lord, Lord Peston, said,
registrars of whatever hue will still be able to express their views on
same-sex marriage, but the right to freedom of religious expression has
to be balanced with the need to protect others from discrimination. The
recent judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of
Lillian Ladele, referred to by my noble friend Lord Lester, supports
this view and the balanced position that we have
taken.</hs_para>

powerful points were made, not least about doctors in relation to
abortion. One should think about it for a moment—and perhaps I
may put it in the following way. Let us imagine that a doctor were to
say, “As a matter of conscience and belief, I am not going to
perform an abortion on this person because of their race or ethnicity,
but I will perform an abortion on another”. Perhaps that
demonstrates the point that we are trying to make. It would not be the
question of conscience about performing the act of solemnising a
marriage that is at issue; it is the question of discrimination that is
at the heart of this issue, and that is why the Government do not
support the amendment.</hs_para>

reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester, who said that divorce was not
an issue in the canon law of the Anglican Church. However, it is my
understanding that, until relatively recently, the Anglican Church did
not marry people who had been divorced on grounds of adultery or other
reasons, if a person’s original spouse was still alive. I think
that that is now possible with the permission of the bishop. In those
circumstances, if the Anglican Church was not going perform a marriage
and the person had to go down the road of a civil marriage if they
wished to contract a second marriage, where would we have been if the
registrar had said, “I have profound beliefs against marrying
divorcees, particularly if one of the grounds for divorce has been
adultery”?</hs_para>

will allow a registrar to exercise a conscience clause and some of
which will not? However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Richardson, said,
there might be some areas of the country with a small number of

objection to a conscience clause is based on Registrars being local
authority employees who are expected (and willing) to carry
out all the functions that their role covers. On a daily basis,
Registrars deal with many scenarios that for those with strong beliefs

Examples include: registering the birth of a child from a same-sex
couple; undertaking marriages for previously divorced persons; or
carrying out civil ceremonies and registrations. Registration Services
and, in particular, the Registrars, are passionate and proud
about the services they deliver and the customers they work with. For
the past 176 years, Registrars have been carrying out their duties and

Dear:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Amendment 4, I draw attention to
the fact that this is a more tightly drawn version of the two
amendments that I spoke to in Committee—when I had a
voice—on 17 June, which were then Amendments 7 and 8. Instead of
getting into the detail, which I did then, on how employers or public
sector bodies treat individuals, this amendment is simply a declaration
that the belief in traditional marriage is worthy of respect in a
democratic society. It makes it clear that it is vital for individuals
claiming protection under human rights or discrimination law who are
not card-carrying members of any particular religion, but it would be
helpful to people who are religious as well.</hs_para>

definition found in case law as far back as 1866 in the case of Hyde v
Hyde and Woodmansee, and was given by Lord Penzance in that leading
case. Until now, every couple at the point of marriage declares that
they are entering into marriage as defined by English law, which is, as
I have said, a voluntary, lifelong and exclusive union. We know that
things can go wrong in marriage and there is, of course, legal
provision for divorce. Throughout history and across cultures, the
definition of marriage has been understood in the terms that I have
just repeated.</hs_parafo>

becomes law, people who support traditional marriage are now often
accused of discrimination. It is said—I cannot vouch for it, but
it was sprayed all over the newspapers recently—that in a draft
version of a speech by the Deputy Prime Minister some were described as
bigots. They have certainly been likened in the House of Commons to
racists and advocates of the salve trade. However, it is generally
accepted that, no matter how one looks at the opinion polls and so on,
a great many people in the UK do not accept the new gender-neutral
definition of marriage proposed by the Bill. They may accept the Bill,
and many do, but they object to the gender-neutral definition, which
embraces them as well. I contend that they cannot be expected to
jettison their deeply held beliefs overnight; nor, I suggest, is it the
proper role of law to seek to coerce people to do so.</hs_para>

and heartened by the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Deben, who talked
about generosity. I made a note of that at the time. It seems that
those words have been played into. The word “generosity”
and, later, the words used by the noble Lord,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T19:06:08"></hs_TimeCode>
Elystan-Morgan, “reasonableness” and
“tolerance”, have been much in vogue over the past half
hour or so in your Lordships’ House. I applaud that. What we are
looking at is recognising the traditional view of marriage as held by
many people, who still cling to that as the ideal. That takes care,
very briefly, of the first part of my amendment.</hs_para>

concept—those words—is the key test in human rights law.
Case law from the European Court of Human Rights and, indeed, the
highest courts in the UK, also hold that for a belief to be protected
in law it must pass this legal threshold. Stating in the Bill that the
belief in traditional marriage meets this test would provide very
valuable help to everyone who holds that belief. It is particularly
important for individuals who are not, as one may say, card-carrying
members of any particular religion.</hs_parafo>

this country have a deeply held belief in marriage that is not, to
them, part of an overall religious or ethical belief system. The belief
is more likely to be recognised and protected in law where it flows
from an underlying, religious belief system. It is less likely to be
afforded protection where a person holds a belief that could be written
off as 
<?notus-xml column=67?>mere opinion. The case law on that I quoted extensively in Committee. I
will not go through it again. The references can be found in

can be no objection, she said, to putting this in the Bill. The
enacting of the Bill should make it abundantly clear that a belief in
same-sex marriage is worthy of respect. Millions of people who hold to
a traditional belief in marriage are left unsure today by what is going
on in this House and in another place as to whether their belief is
similarly worthy of respect. I contend that it is necessary and that it
takes absolutely nothing away from the Bill, or what the Bill seeks to
set out, to include the amendment.</hs_parafo>

Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, I will not detain the House long. I do
not disagree with what the noble Lord, Lord Dear, said, but I seek to
sharpen up his amendment for two reasons. First, I have been approached
by many people during the passage of the Bill through your
Lordships’ House who believe very firmly that marriage is
between a man and a woman and wish to 
<?notus-xml column=68?>see that recognised at all appropriate points, but have themselves not
been able necessarily to sustain marriage for life.</hs_para>

is a fact of life—the noble Lord, Lord Dear, briefly alluded to
it—that many marriages do not stay the course. There are many in
your Lordships’ House who have been married more than once. That
does not in any sense weaken or invalidate the marriage, or make those
noble Lords who have had more than one marriage believe less in
marriage as an institution. But we live in a very different world from
that of 1866 cited by the noble Lord, Lord Dear.
Even<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> within the
clergy, I have many good friends, some highly placed within the Church
of England, who have had a marriage that has come to grief. Some have
remarried and some have not. In that spirit of tolerance, understanding
and generosity, to quote my noble friend Lord Deben in a previous
debate, it would be more inclusive just to omit those words. That does
not in any sense weaken the thrust of the amendment of the noble Lord,
Lord Dear; it merely brings it up to date and recognises the world in
which we

slightly more playful in that I would take away the words “in a
democratic society” because this belief is worthy of respect in
all societies, democratic or not. We recognise that. It is certainly
not an amendment to an amendment that I would press. However, I must
say to your Lordships’ House that those of us who believe in
traditional marriage but are not in any way opposed to
equality—one must repeat that, as one has many times during
these debates—feel that including something along these lines in
the Bill could not do any harm and could be of some reassurance to many
people outside this House. They are the sort of people referred to by

to expand on why I think this is a really dreadful amendment. It is
dreadful for the reasons that my noble friend Lord Cormack has

this in, what other definitions of marriage will we have to put in? Do
we say, “Nothing in this Act shall counteract the opinion that
some people believe X, Y and Z”? All Acts would be interminable
and intolerable if we added all the things that they did not have a

the problem is much more basic than that. There is a fundamental

reasonably undermine the value of a Bill by putting into it a phrase
that is designed to say, “Look, we’ve had to pass this

Lester of Herne Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, the law on traditional
marriage is contained in the Marriage Act 1949. Nothing in
the Bill affects the rights and duties under the Marriage Act 1949 of
what is called traditional marriage. If it did so, the amendment might
have some kind of purpose, but it does not. If it does not undermine
the ability to marry under the Marriage Act, does it create any sort of
belief that that form of marriage is in some way undesirable? No, it
does not. Nothing in the Bill suggests anything wrong with the
traditional view of marriage. What it does do is to create another form
of marriage and treat it as part of the concept of marriage. That does
not undermine traditional marriage unless you take the view, as some
do, that we should not have the Bill at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000002"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Royall of Blaisdon" PimsId="485" UID="13070845000182" xid="1719" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000182">Baroness
Royall of Blaisdon:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Dear,
spoke of traditional marriage being worthy of respect. Indeed,
traditional marriage, in his words, is worthy of respect. But, the
great thing is that after the passing of this Bill, same-sex marriage
will be equally worthy of respect. That will be a matter for
celebration. This is because at the moment marriage is a voluntary
union of one man and one woman, but with the passing of this Bill I am
delighted that 
<?notus-xml column=70?>marriage will be extended to the voluntary union of one man and one man,

is asking people to abandon their beliefs. The Bill does not suggest in
any way that they should or that they must, as has been said so many

common law protection of freedom of speech and the existing protections
in the Equality Act 2010, religion or belief will continue

Royall of Blaisdon:</Member></B> My Lords, the issue pertaining to
registrars is not to do with conscience but with the fact that
registrars are public servants, and they are upholding the law. In
being a registrar they are doing their duty as public servants. Their
beliefs are nothing to do with their work as a registrar. This
amendment is completely different. It is to do with freedom of belief
and freedom of expression, which I believe are a hallmark of democracy.

having a sort of gold hallmark of marriage, and then a sort of

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Lord, Lord Dear. In introducing his amendment he reminded us again that
we should try to ensure that we are tolerant, generous and courteous,
not only in our debates in this House but also in the legislation that
we are bringing forward. I argue that we are doing just that. The noble
Baroness, Lady Royall, just quoted something I said at an earlier
stage. The Government are very clear that the Bill does not only allow
same-sex couples to marry; it also protects religious freedom and
ensures that no belief that anyone holds now is affected by the
introduction of this Bill. As I said at earlier stages, we are clear
that the belief that marriage should be of one man with one woman 
<?notus-xml column=71?>is protected under the Equality Act 2010. It meets the established
criteria set out in case
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000009">The noble
Lord, Lord Dear, referred to the case of Grainger plc v
Nicholson, which specifically included beliefs worthy of
respect in a democratic society. Equally, Article 9 of the European
Convention on Human Rights guarantees that everyone has the right to
freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This means that everyone
has an absolute right to hold any belief. However, of course the right
to manifest one’s belief is qualified, and the state can
regulate that in certain circumstances where that is necessary for the
protection of the rights and freedoms of others. As I have made clear,
it is perfectly possible for somebody to not only have that legitimate
belief but also to be free to express that belief. To follow up on the
exchange that just took place between my noble friend, Baroness Knight,
and the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, the difference is that what is not
possible is for somebody to withhold their services because of the
belief they hold. There is nothing to stop them from having that
belief. The amendment is therefore unnecessary. It states something
that is entirely true—that the Bill does nothing to undermine

been pointed out, the view that a marriage of a same-sex couple, like
the marriage of an opposite-sex couple, is a valid marriage is also a
belief worthy of respect in a democratic society. As was said by the
noble Baroness, Lady Royall, and my noble friend Lord Deben, if we are
going to state that the one belief is worthy of respect, we ought to
state that both are worthy of respect. As it stands, this amendment
suggests that a belief of the kind it covers, concerning marriage
between a man and a woman, is in some way superior to a belief that
marriage of a same-sex couple exclusively and for life is to be
welcomed as an equally valid relationship. Therefore the amendment goes
against the entire point of the

caution the House on a further point of principle. We risk getting into
rather dangerous territory if we start to set out in statute which
beliefs are worthy of respect or protection in law. It may seem easy
here, where there is absolutely no doubt that the belief concerned is
mainstream and uncontroversial, but it would not be wise for
legislation to list beliefs, just as we do not list religions.
Otherwise we get into the arena of state-sponsored religions and
beliefs. It would also be an impossible task to list all religions and
beliefs that are protected, which would cast doubt about whether
unlisted beliefs are protected. That point was made in this debate by
some noble Lords who are

touch on Amendments 5 and 6, put forward by my noble friend Lord
Cormack. I will go not into detail, because they do not affect the
fundamental point I am making, which is that these amendments are
unnecessary. They risk creating the suggestion that a belief in the
validity of the marriage of same-sex couples is to some extent less
worthy than a belief that 
<?notus-xml column=72?>marriage should be of one man with one woman. As I have explained, it
would be most unwise to seek to legislate for what is or is not a

that said, and just to be absolutely clear, of course none of that

assurance on, which is something that we debated at length at earlier

decides to try to take action against them. If they were to do that,
the law would protect them, because the view that the noble Lord has

hold that belief and express it. Clearly, as noble friends who are

to take in all manner of different contexts in order to consider the

parade, after a defeat here, a success in removing the word
“insulting” from Section 5 of the Public Order Act
shortly before Christmas with a fairly substantial majority. That was
taking the word “insulting” out but leaving in

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally):</Member></B> My
Lords, I shall also speak to the draft Employment Tribunals and
Employment Appeal Tribunal Fees Order 2013. The purpose of these orders
is to make provision for fees to be paid by those who present claims or
make appeals to employment tribunals and the Employment Appeal
Tribunal. They also make provision for fees to be remitted or waived in
full or in part if the person cannot afford to pay using the existing
civil courts remission
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000026">Bringing
a claim or an appeal to employment tribunals and the Employment Appeal
Tribunal is currently free of charge. In 2012-13, the cost of running
the employment tribunals system was £74.4 million. That cost was
entirely met by the taxpayer. While the Government are committed to
providing a fair system for those who need an independent tribunal to
settle an employment dispute, we also believe that it is perfectly
reasonable that those using the tribunals should contribute to their
cost, where they can afford to do so. It is important that noble Lords
understand that introducing fees into these tribunals is not an attempt
to deter individuals from bringing claims—vexatious or
otherwise—and given the mitigations in place we do not believe
the provisions of this order will do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000027">Employment
tribunals were originally intended as the option of last resort in
disputes when all other resolution services had failed. Over time that
status has eroded and claims are now often launched prematurely,
without exploring alternative options for resolving disputes. The
introduction of fees can support a necessary change in the mindset of
users and help to reset the system by encouraging individuals to stop
and think about whether a dispute can be settled without recourse to a
tribunal, and whether it is really necessary to submit a claim.
Complementing that aim, mandatory early conciliation will be introduced
in 2014, meaning parties will not be able to bring a claim to the
tribunal without first having sought a conciliated resolution via
ACAS.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000028">The
Government are also implementing a brand new simplified set of rules
and regulations governing procedure in employment tribunals. The
simplified rules attempt to roll back and reset unnecessary complexity

reliance on legal representation and help return employment tribunals

that are beyond my remit I will ask my colleague, my noble friend Lord
Younger, to respond in writing should it be necessary. I am confident
that noble Lords will see that these proposals are not an attack on
employment rights or on people with low incomes. They simply reset the
system that this Government inherited and reduce the taxpayer subsidy
of employment tribunals by transferring some of the cost to those who
use the service, while protecting access to justice for all. Assuming
parliamentary approval, the instrument is due to come into force on the
day after it is signed and made. We are confident that, subject to that
approval, fees will come into effect on 29 July this year.</hs_para>

for the tribunal to deal with and so cost less for a claimant to
bring—namely, £160 at issue and £230 before the
hearing. Type B claims are more complicated, requiring more tribunal
time and resources to determine. Therefore they attract higher fees of
£250 at issue and £950 at hearing. Where there is a

fee will be paid.</hs_para>

number of individuals named within a form. If claimants present their

of pounds, often at the taxpayer’s expense. We seem to be about
to live in a world where employees, often low
paid, not only no longer receive legal advice or legal aid
to pursue a claim arising out of their employment problems but will
have to pay significant sums to have their case dealt with
by an employment tribunal. It costs only between £35 and
£70 to issue a money claim of up to £1,000 in the civil
courts but, as the Minister confirmed, it will cost £160 to
issue a type A claim—for example, for wage theft, withheld
holiday pay or all manner of modest claims—in the employment
tribunal, and a further £230 for a hearing, with higher fees

employment tribunal than it does to lodge an appeal in the Supreme
Court, which costs £1,000, and even with a hearing the total

Judges in Scotland consider that there is a significant risk that if a
claim is for a small amount of money then a claimant will be
discouraged from pursuing that claim, even although they are legally
entitled to the sums due. For example, say an individual is entitled to
one week’s wages in respect of holiday pay and the individual is
paid just above the threshold which would allow them to qualify for
remission. That person may decide that they will not pursue the sum
due. This could have the consequence of encouraging a less than fair

there is a remission scheme but this pitches the threshold very low.
For example, no fee is payable if the disposable monthly income of the

beyond that. That is a very low threshold. Crucially, there will also
be a capital limit of £3,000. Ironically, a claimant who,

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> My Lords, we have seen a series of
government proposals over the past year, all designed to reduce
employment rights and all apparently in the belief that this will
promote employment. So a supine, disposable workforce is expected to
result in increased employment. This is entirely wrong. We have
legislation now making it more difficult for a dismissed worker to
claim unfair dismissal. Already, a worker must be in the job for two
years before any such claim can be made. Then a series of steps has to
be taken before the case can get to a tribunal. The Government have
admitted that they want to make access more difficult, and their
policies certainly have done so. Now, the Government want to charge and
a complicated system is being proposed.</hs_para>

unpaid wages, and smaller claims under category A, are to
have an issue fee of £160 followed by a hearing fee

being £250 and then £950. We are
told that vulnerable and poorer people will not have to pay but the TUC
research indicates that a significant number of people on the national
minimum wage and living wage rates will have to pay. It is clear that
the Government are moving in the direction of the Beecroft proposals,
which were widely condemned even by employers. The Government are
trying to do that without seeming to do so. The scheme by which
employees give up employment rights in return for shares in the
employing company, which incidentally was voted down in this House when
first proposed, is not meeting with much success even though the

the family, leading perhaps to further benefit claims as well as the
illness of the dismissed employee. An appeal to an ET before a judge
sitting alone will cost more money, and lay members, who bring
experience and knowledge of workplaces, are being dispensed with. The
Government are clearly expecting that the whole process will seem too
complicated and costly for most employees and that there will be very
few claims as a result—with no legal aid, of course, in
employment cases. Furthermore, employers will be less inclined to seek
resolution internally, as they will understand well enough that the

constrained by some very tight budgets and needs to save money.
However, it is clear from these orders that it is proposing to save
money very much at the expense of the low-paid and the most vulnerable
in our society. The argument that was made by my noble
friend Lord Beecham about the comparison with the fees at the Supreme
Court tells its own story. The fees at the Supreme Court are
disproportionately low compared to what will be the position in the
tribunals. Therefore, I do not see the Minister’s
argument that saving money has to be at the expense of those in the
lower income parts of our society compared to those who are much better
off and will be taking cases in the higher courts. The burden is in the

place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000076">Secondly,
it is clear that this is all about deterring applicants. My noble

raising the qualifying period for unfair dismissal. That took 3 million
people out of the unfair dismissals scope virtually at a stroke. Now we
have got this as well. As people have said, it is not going to deter
the well paid executive who can see a crock of gold at the end of the
case. Nor will it deter the union member because we already know that
unions are preparing to support their members in appropriate cases by
covering the fees. It will be those who are on their own, probably low
paid and vulnerable, and who will not find it easy to get a comparable
job. They are being told to go away quietly. I think that is a green

improving the quality of the contract of employment, and I mean
everything from holidays and maternity rights through to the quality of
access to justice, we have been going backwards since 2010. A more
unequal society is the same as a less just society; a society which
protects the strong at the expense of the weak. Of course, this can all
be reversed; we hope that it will be in a couple of years with the
election of a Labour Government, and on this side of the House, that is

my noble friend Lady Donaghy said, and they started to do it by
enhancing the role of ACAS and encouraging mediation. We support that

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have taken
part in this debate, many of whom I know have spoken from a wealth of
experience of tribunals, ACAS and the trade union movement. It has been
helpful to identify and address concerns. Doing so has enabled me to
set on record why the Government have decided to introduce fees in the
employment tribunal system and, crucially, what has been put in place
to ensure that fees are not a barrier to those wanting to access the
justice
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000087">In
speaking to his amendment to the Motion on the fees order, the noble
Lord, Lord Beecham, expressed regret that its provisions do not
effectively protect access to justice, that some claimants will be
deterred from bringing claims and that the remission system is
inadequate. Neither I nor my government colleagues accept those
arguments. We believe that the mitigations we have put in place will
properly protect access to justice for those seeking to bring claims.
The remission scheme will ensure that those on low incomes can apply to
have their fee reduced or waived entirely and, given the importance of
the issues at stake, the Government believe it is unlikely that fees
alone will deter those with a strong case bringing a claim. These
factors, together with the power for the tribunal to order
reimbursement of fees paid, will help to ensure that access to justice
is maintained for those who wish to bring a
claim.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000088">As I
have mentioned, we hope that fees will encourage potential
claimants seriously to consider options to resolve disputes outside the
tribunal system. From 2014, mandatory early conciliation
will mean parties cannot bring a claim to the tribunal
without first having sought a conciliated resolution via ACAS. Any
decrease in claims after the introduction of fees
does not mean that claims are being deterred. It is more likely that
disputes are being resolved without the need to use the tribunal, which
benefits everyone.</hs_para>

Beecham, raised a number of issues. He asked whether fees
should be charged for someone seeking a small amount. All
claimants, irrespective of appeal or claim type should make a
contribution to the cost where they can afford to do so, and everyone
should also think carefully about entering into litigation irrespective
of the remedy sought. Claimants should bear the cost of fees
where they make an allegation in a claim and fail
to pursue it or where the employer is judged to have acted
lawfully.</hs_para>

the employment tribunal is more expensive than the civil courts. The
civil courts do not offer a reasonable comparator in this instance as
they charge at up to five points in the court process and fees are set
to recover the full cost. Civil courts process significantly higher
volumes of claims and therefore have lower unit costs. In the civil
courts, parties open themselves to much wider cost powers so there are
different issues to consider.</hs_para>

about the changes to the process for the enforcement of awards when
fees are introduced. The enforcement of employment tribunal awards is

Government have commissioned new research covering England and Wales

McNally:</Member></B> If they are not, I will write and tell the noble
Lord. The noble Lord also raised the question of whether the Government
know what the impact will be. It is difficult to predict the impact
that the introduction of fees will have on behaviour. It may be
reasonable to assume that if people who are thinking about bringing a
claim have to pay to do so, they will more carefully consider whether
they wish to do so and their chances of success than they would if the
process was free. If this is a valid assumption, we would expect the
number of speculative claims—and therefore the number of claims
overall—to fall. We will review the impact post-implementation
to ensure that the remissions system acts to ensure that only those who
can afford to pay fees do so. To ensure that the fee-charging process
is simple to understand and administer, we will examine impacts on
equality groups in the light of experience and will verify the amount
of fee income

noble Lord asked how we will review fees. Fees will be kept under
review as part of an ongoing review of fees across the justice system.
The review will seek to ensure that the remission system acts to ensure
that only those who can afford to pay do so. The noble Lord, Lord
Beecham, asked if redundancy payments will be taken into account in a
remission of application. No, this is considered a capital payment

pay tribute again to the vast experience the noble Baroness, Lady
Donaghy, has of ACAS. I believe that making ACAS a first stop is a step
forward and one to be much welcomed. Like all Members of the House I
always regret when we are not able to receive the wisdom of the noble
Lord, Lord Sugar, in person, but I note that he is in favour of more
conciliation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T20:27:19"></hs_TimeCode>.
The noble Baroness asked if the introduction of fees undermines the
aims of early conciliation. We do not believe so. Fees can encourage
parties to resolve their disputes as early as possible. In
addition, respondents will be aware of the financial
implications of losing a claim, including the ability of tribunals
to order them to reimburse a claimant’s fee.
Therefore, if a respondent waits to see if the claimant pays
the fee, it could increase the respondent’s own cost.
The noble Baroness also asked if this is designed to prevent
weak and vexatious claims. We do not intend fees to prevent claimants
bringing forward claims they believe to be genuine. We intend only
that users who can afford to do so should contribute to the
cost. If fees were to discourage those bringing speculative claims from
doing so, this would be a positive
consequence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T20:28:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000100">The
noble Baroness, Lady Drake, acknowledged that this is a simplified
scheme, and that is to be welcomed. It neither tilts the balance
against workers nor closes the tribunal door. The noble Baroness
also made the point that it was particularly disadvantageous
to vulnerable people. Our initial analysis suggests that BME
groups, women, younger people and disabled people are more likely to
fall into the lower income bracket, so these groups are more likely to
qualify for partial or full fee remission. The Government believe that
it is right and fair that users of the Employment Appeal Tribunal, as
with the employment tribunals, make a contribution towards the cost of
their case when they can afford to do so. There are clear public policy
reasons not to place the full burden on the taxpayer to subsidise fully
a user who has already had the benefit of a previous judicial

noble Baroness, Lady Drake, also asked how fees will incentivise
business to settle if only the claimant pays fees. Businesses will be
conscious of the financial implications of losing a case, as well as
the wider power of the employment tribunal judiciary to impose

will also be aware of the power of the tribunal to order them to
reimburse the fees paid by the successful claimant.</hs_para>

will enhance the role of ACAS. The truth is that people who wish to
resolve an employment dispute have access to an independent tribunal,
which is part of a justice system that is highly respected throughout
the world. However, proceedings before the tribunals are costly and the
Government believe that it is unfair that taxpayers have to shoulder
all of that cost. To share the burden, we are proposing to charge fees

us, is both reasonable and right.</hs_para>

Meacher:</Member></B> My Lords, the purpose of this amendment is to
provide for humanist and other belief-based marriages to have legal
recognition in England and Wales, which they have had in Scotland since
2005. I apologise to the Minister and your Lordships for the fact that
I have been in five different countries over the past few weeks and
have been unable to attend any of the previous sessions on the Bill. I
pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, and the noble Baroness,
Lady Massey, who tabled a similar amendment in Committee. I also convey
the apologies 
<?notus-xml column=90?>of the noble Lord, Lord Garel-Jones, who is in hospital, I am sad to
say. We were very keen to have his name on the amendment in view of the
powerful speech he made in
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000108">It
is gratifying that the humanist amendments have been supported on all
sides of both Houses by people of religion and of no religion. Indeed,
I hope the Minister will not mind if I quote her. She said

applaud the Minister for tabling the government amendment, which takes
a historic step towards eliminating the inequity in our system
regarding humanist and other non-religious belief organisations. I
offer the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, my personal thanks for having
worked very hard to ensure that belief-based marriages are given legal
status. It is appropriate and helpful that the noble Baronesses, Lady
Thornton and Lady Brinton, and the noble Lord, Lord Alli, have included
their names on the government amendment, illustrating the strong
support from all sides of the House for the key principle of our
amendment, while acknowledging, probably very fairly, the
Government’s commitment to a consultation on the
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000110">Noble
Lords may ask why I am moving this amendment, bearing in mind the fact

that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13070845000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000166">“we

feel a great duty to carry the torch for our dear colleague while he
lies in hospital. It is very much in that context that I need to put
some points on the record and seek some assurances from the Minister.
In so doing, I seek to avoid a rerun of the Committee stage, albeit I
was not here to listen to it, although noble Lords will be glad to hear
that I have read
it.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13070845000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000111">Religious
marriages reflect the deepest beliefs and values of religious couples,
but humanist beliefs and values are of equal importance to humanist
couples. In an increasingly secular society, it is important that we do
all we can to promote and recognise good values. Registry office
marriages now account for two-thirds of marriages in this country.
Those marriages may not involve the couple committing themselves in a
ceremony to the all-important beliefs and associated values that they
will need in times of trouble. If we want marriages to survive, we must
nurture beliefs and values which will help couples to sort out their
problems. There is also the equity issue. In the case of humanists,
despite the cost and inconvenience, some have two marriage ceremonies
to achieve the things they want: a meaningful wedding and one that has
legal status. I hope that the Government accept that the inequity
cannot continue beyond a short period to allow for a review and
consultation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070845000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000112">Humanist marriage is
well tried and tested. Scotland gave legal status to humanist marriages
eight years ago and has some 3,000 such marriages each year. 
<?notus-xml column=91?>Humanist marriages account for 58% of the increase in marriages in
Scotland in the last three years. All of them, of course, are belief
and value-based marriages, and I am sure that noble Lords value that
fact. Every year in England, the number of humanist marriages exceeds
the number of Quaker or Unitarian marriages. Yet humanist marriages
have no legal recognition, while these smaller minorities do have it.
Legally recognised humanist marriages have strong support from the
public, according to a YouGov poll—this is another important
issue for the Government—with 53% in favour and only 12%
opposed. Few policies, I suggest, have such a ringing public
endorsement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000113">No
one has any reason to fear the legal recognition of humanist and other
belief-based marriages, again another important point. In particular, I
do not believe that churches have anything to fear. Religious
ceremonies already have the intrinsic characteristic of what, for me,
is a good ceremony: a focus on important beliefs and values. I
understand that the Church of England is relaxed about this amendment
and I welcome that fact. I hope this also applies to the other great
religions.</hs_para>

celebrants of humanist marriages and funerals is to be congratulated.
Anyone who has attended a humanist marriage or funeral will attest that
they are of the highest quality of ceremony that one could have. I have
attended only two humanist funerals. They were professionally
conducted, moving and memorable. Those who have been to other
ceremonies have said the same to me.</hs_para>

this amendment represents a fundamental legislative change, but it is
absolutely not. It builds organically on the existing law of the
Marriage Act 1949. It is based upon the provisions that allow the
Society of Friends to solemnise marriages, but adds some tighter
controls which I would think the Government—and certainly
I—welcome.</hs_para>

Government’s objections to the earlier amendment. All these
concerns have been fully addressed in this amendment. I believe that
the Government accept that fact. The draft has been vetted and cleared
by a number of marriage law experts, and we know from the opinion of
Matrix Chambers that the amendment is compatible with the European
convention. So there is no reason to reject the content of this
amendment. We hope that regulations will reflect the essential points
so carefully drafted for our Amendment 7. However, we understand the
Government’s wish to undertake a consultation before introducing
regulations to give legal status to humanist and other belief-based
marriages.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070845000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000117">I
now turn to the Government’s amendment and hope the Minister can
give us just four assurances. First, will she repeat in this House her
officials’ assurances that they expect to complete the review,
consultation and report well ahead of the end of 2014, which of course
is the date given in the government amendment? Most importantly, can
the Minister assure the House that regulations will be laid before the
next general election? With eight years of experience of such marriages
in Scotland and many decades of experience of analogous Quaker and
Jewish marriages, I trust that this is not too much to ask. The
important point here is that the 
<?notus-xml column=92?>amendment should not be kicked into touch. Can the Minister assure the
House that the considerable and unique experience and expertise of the
British Humanist Association will be fully taken on board in the review
and consultation, and that the criteria set out in the amendment will
be considered as a basic guide for the future regulations when the
review is being undertaken? No one has criticised those principles and
points in our amendment, and they would provide a good basis for future
regulations. Finally, can the Minister confirm that it is not her
intention that commercial organisations will be able to profit from the
regulations on belief-based marriages?</hs_para>

debate on this issue in Committee, I undertook to have further
discussions with colleagues about what the Government could do about
the proposals put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Harrison. I
recognised the strength of feeling in that debate and am pleased to
bring forward on behalf of the Government amendments that provide for a
statutory review, including a full public consultation, on whether
belief organisations should solemnise marriage and, if so, what such a
provision would look like. Crucially, the new clause provides the means
to make any future changes by providing an order-making power that may
amend any England and Wales legislation, both primary and secondary. In
taking this approach, the Government’s amendment reflects the
solution proposed by my noble friend Lord Lester in Committee,
supported by the noble Lord, Lord Alli, among others. Since then, I
have had the opportunity to speak to some Members of your
Lordships’ House with an interest in this matter. My officials
have also met the British Humanist Association and the noble Baroness,
Lady Meacher. I am grateful to all noble Lords who have given up some
of their time to engage in discussion with the Government, and to the
British Humanist Association for its constructive approach to finding a
way forward on this matter.</hs_para>

little more about the government amendments and why they offer the best
way forward in resolving this important issue. The arrangements for the
review, which will be a statutory requirement, must provide for a full
public consultation, and the Secretary of State must arrange for a
report on the outcome of the review to be published by 1
January 2015. 
<?notus-xml column=93?>The new clause gives the Secretary of State power to make provision by
order permitting marriages according to the usages of belief
organisations. Our amendment defines a belief organisation as an
organisation whose principal or sole purpose is the advancement of a
system of non-religious beliefs which relate to morality and ethics. I
note what the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, said about the importance
of belief organisations and their
purpose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000123">Such
an order may amend any England and Wales legislation, both primary and
secondary, and may make provision for the charging of fees. The point
about fees is a technical one: it merely enables the Registrar General
to charge a fee, as she does currently, to cover her costs in
administering the service.</hs_para>

that no religious service may be used at any marriage solemnised under
the provisions of the order. This is because it has been a principle
since their introduction that civil marriage ceremonies should be
clearly distinct from religious marriage ceremonies. We do not want
this review to open up the system by which religious organisations
carry out marriages which has been in place for years, and this Bill
has been drafted on those foundations. The intention is to maintain the
distinction so that no religious elements should be used in a marriage
according to the usages of belief organisations. Any order made under
this clause will be subject to the affirmative procedure. So, were the
Secretary of State to take advantage of the order-making clause, both
Houses of Parliament would have an opportunity to debate it and the
order would be subject to the affirmative
procedure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000125">Although
the Government maintain that this Bill is not the right place to make
broader changes to marriage law, as I have said already, it would be
wrong not to recognise the strength of feeling in support of the
humanists. A statutory consultation as a means to effect any change is
the right way forward in responding to the support for humanists,
ensuring that the wider public are able to contribute to the debate,
and securing that arrangements for belief-based marriages are made on a
sound footing and that any implications of them are fully
understood.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000126">The
noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, referred to what is already in place in
Ireland and Scotland. There the law has been changed to allow for
humanist and other belief marriages, but they operate a different
system to what we have in England and Wales. None the less, in both
those countries the changes were subject to extensive dialogue over a
period of time with interested parties to develop a solution that fits
with their marriage law. It must be right that, if we are to change the
law in England and Wales, we should do so only after proper
consideration, as it has already been given in Scotland and Ireland,
and therefore after a proper public
consultation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000127">In
addition to a public consultation, we also need to give consideration
to the impact of the changes on the voluntary, private and local
government sectors and on religious organisations, although, as the
noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, said, we have not received any suggestion
from the churches that they object to the amendment we are bringing
forward in order to achieve proper consideration. Likewise,
consideration 
<?notus-xml column=94?>must be given to what safeguards may be required and how these should be
established and, in particular, how we ensure that the significant
legal commitment made through marriage is properly regulated and
recorded. Such fundamental public policy changes would normally be
subject to these considerations and a review and consultation will
allow us to do
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000128">Furthermore,
we need to consider whether there are other belief organisations in
addition to humanists which may wish to solemnise marriage, and
therefore draw up criteria accordingly. I note what the noble Baroness
said about the criteria in the amendment in her name. While we will, of
course, have due regard to the proposals put forward by the BHA, we
need to make sure that the criteria are set in a way that would allow
belief organisations other than the BHA to conduct marriages should
they wish to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0002.htm#13070845000129">Let me now
respond to some of the specific questions put to me by the noble
Baroness. She asked me about commercial organisations. I can confirm
that it is not our intention to allow commercial organisations to
solemnise marriage. Marriage is an important institution and marriage
for profit risks undermining key safeguards—for example, it
could increase the instances of forced and sham marriages—if the
emphasis is simply on increasing the numbers of couples going down the
aisle, as it were, as opposed to undertaking proper checks on the
couples. I hope I am able to reassure her on that point. She asked me
about taking account of the expertise and experience of the British
Humanist Association. I can certainly give her an assurance that we
would want to give due weight to the expertise of humanist celebrants
during the design of the review and consultation. We will also look

must consult openly. Ministers will consider the results of the

clear and said in Committee that the ball is well and truly in our

<?notus-xml column=95?>In our discussions in Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne
Hill, like the lone ranger, and not for the first time in this Bill,
rode over the hill to our rescue and gave us this formulation. I am
more than delighted that the Government have tabled the amendment,
bearing the names of the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, and my
noble friend Lady Thornton. I pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady
Stowell, for all her efforts in securing the change in policy. I know
that she spent many hours negotiating with many different interests,

I know that it is a personal mission for her and I believe that many of

was pipped to the post by others. I, too, offer my thanks to Julian
Huppert MP who started the process in another place, to the noble
Baroness, Lady Thornton, and to my noble friend Lord Lester for the
work they have done in conjunction with the Minister. We are extremely
grateful for the progress that has been made in the short time since
Committee. The only point I would reiterate from the debate in
Committee is that this Bill is very much about equality. So far the
equality has been based on same-sex and heterosexual marriage. This
issue is vital for people who do not follow a religion or faith to be
able to celebrate their marriages in the way they wish. It is long
overdue and I am delighted that the government amendments pave the way.

Lester of Herne Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, I just wish to add that
the process here has been admirable. Had we simply stuck with forcing
through an amendment to do the trick, it would not have held in the
other place. There would have been ping pong and no public
consultation. Including sexual orientation discrimination in the 2006
Act and caste discrimination in the 2010 Act by regulation and
consultation seemed to be the best way forward. I am extremely glad
that that approach, which is in the amendment of the noble Baroness,
Lady Meacher, and now reflected in the government amendment, does the
trick.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070845000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070845000136">The

the Long Title. Although this sounds like me being a lawyer, I am very
glad that it is there because I raised the point in the previous debate

one—not exactly caveat—point, which is that there are

that possible. The amendment offers the possibility but—as the
noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, makes clear—not yet a guarantee
that humanists, and perhaps in due course other groups, will be able to
conduct lawful marriages. As we have heard, that already happens in a
fast-growing number of countries. Humanism is a movement. It is not
bound together by belief in a supreme being or a formal body of
doctrine, but by ethical conviction, a belief in rationality and the
virtues of science, respect for nature and a commitment to optimise the
sum total of human happiness here on earth.</hs_para>

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T21:04:16"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I add
a few words from my own perspective and possibly from the perspective
of these Benches, which may not be exactly the same. The Church of
England was caught on the hop slightly by this issue in the Commons. A
lot of time was given to an amendment on this matter, whereas all our
energies had been around the quadruple lock and associated
issues.</hs_para>

couple of years ago, in your Lordships’ House, I made clear my
own commitment in principle to humanist marriage. It might have been
one of my periodic jousts 
<?notus-xml column=97?>with the noble Lord, Lord Alli. I cannot remember the precise details of
it, but I made it clear. The honourable Member for the Rhondda
immediately said that I was completely in favour of his amendment in
the House of Commons. This then goaded the Second Church Estates
Commissioner to state that the Church of England was actually opposed
to humanist marriage. It was all rather on the hop.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T21:05:18"></hs_TimeCode> Committee,
the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Guildford said here in your
Lordships’ House that he was, in principle, open to this
development. Speaking for myself—I cannot speak more widely than
that—it would make eminent sense for this consultation to take
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T21:05:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070845000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070845000143">There
has been quite a lot of discussion of the Bill as if the objection to
same-sex marriage was because of a particular religious understanding
of marriage. I understand why that perception has been raised. However,
it is important to say that, in Christian terms, marriage is not a
possession of the church. It has always been seen as part of the
creative order and for the good of creation as a whole. That has always
been the position of the churches. I see no reason at all why the
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T21:06:10"></hs_TimeCode>consultation
should not lead to permission for humanist marriage and indeed for
other belief organisations that meet the necessary criteria for doing

Government’s amendment is important because it allows for time
for consultation. One of our complaints has been that this process has
been rather telescoped in relation to same-sex marriage. We need time
to think through some of the implications. I said at Second
Reading—I will not repeat my points—that many of the
issues before us would be resolved if we went towards a more
continental separation of a civil preliminary and then had other
organisations celebrate marriage in this dual way. That would iron out
a lot of our problems. That
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T21:06:58"></hs_TimeCode>may not be part

of premises, which is one solution that may arise because at the moment
we have a premises-based system in England and Wales. In Scotland,
there is a celebrant-based process. That needs some careful thought
because there may be some hybrid. However, I welcome the consultation.

compulsion by any means will not be allowed under the Bill. Therefore,
any detrimental or unfavourable treatment of a person—whether an

performed, has decided not to perform or has refused to perform, a
Clause 2(1) or (2) activity will be absolutely prohibited. That is in

of our concerns was that the word “compelled” did not
make it clear that less favourable treatment by a public authority of a

authority could, for example, have used Section 149 of the Equality Act

Amendments 18 and 19. Amendment 18 is designed to protect persons as
designated in the Bill from unfavourable treatment following an
expression of opinion or belief about same-sex marriage. I am aware
that this issue has been debated to some extent under other amendments.
Under Section 149 of the Equality Act, a public authority must always
have regard to the need to provide all persons with equal
opportunities, whether they be black, white, male, female, gay,
lesbian, straight or whatever. In particular, public authorities must
also be mindful of any disadvantage that is or could be suffered by any
person with a protected characteristic, and the need to remove or
minimise that disadvantage. Those protected characteristics have been
well rehearsed in this House during this debate. They include age, sex,
sexual orientation, religious or other belief and pregnancy.</hs_para>

authorities a lot of discretion in deciding whether to pursue a course
of action. A public authority could decide to use its powers, for
example, to try to eliminate or minimise disadvantages suffered by
those in the LGBT community. That is a laudable aim but it could do so
in a way which unnecessarily disadvantages those with religious or
other beliefs about marriage. Section 149 does not force them to do so
but it allows them to do so by giving them discretion. That discretion
has expanded significantly over the years and the courts have
interpreted it as a duty to further equality of opportunity, rather
than a duty to avoid discrimination. The positive rather than negative
duty has encouraged public authorities to pursue broad equality aims.
Public authorities have, for example, denied public contracts to
organisations which the public authority regarded as unsuitable to be
associated with, for example on grounds of race, and the courts appear
to have deemed this entirely lawful.</hs_para>

decides to pursue equality of opportunity for the LGBT community, and
if this is done in a way which unnecessarily disadvantages those of
religious or other beliefs, the courts are unlikely to overturn such an
action because of their general reluctance to second-guess public
authorities in exercising their discretion. The protection from
compulsion under Clause 2 gives protections only from actions arising
or relating to the solemnisation of same-sex marriages. It is not at
all clear from the Bill whether individuals employed by public
authorities will be protected if they express an opinion or belief that
marriage should only be between a man and a woman. At this point, I
should say that I heard the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of
Tankerness, refer to something in relation to disciplinary authority.
He was speaking quite quickly but it was something about disciplinary
proceedings. Perhaps he could reassure me on that point when he sums
up.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307096000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#1307096000023">At the
moment, it is unclear whether a teacher would be able to teach that
marriage should only be between a man and woman, if that is their
belief, because some pupils, parents and other teachers could find such
teaching grossly offensive. It is not clear whether a school would be
able positively to promote opposite-sex marriage unless it promoted
same-sex marriage equally. It could be argued that such an expression
would be contrary to the duty on public authorities to further equality
of opportunity for the LGBT community and to foster good relations
between people with different protected characteristics.</hs_para>

hypothesis alone. A judgment was handed down just two weeks ago in
which the public sector equality duty was one of the reasons used to
dismiss Dr Hans-Christian Raabe from a position on the Advisory Council
on the Misuse of Drugs, which he had been given some 17 days earlier by
the Home department. He received a letter from the Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State for Crime Prevention, Mr James Brokenshire,
telling him that his authority was being revoked because it had been
discovered that some eight years ago, he had co-authored an article<I>,
</I><I>Gay Marriage and Homosexuality: Some Medical Comments</I>. He
lost that judicial review; the judgment was in June 2013. That case

have relied on Article 9 and the fact that religion and belief is also
a protected characteristic for the purpose of the public sector
equality duty. They do that in order to suggest that this amendment is
not necessary but it is in fact unclear whether expression of belief
would be protected as a manifestation of religion or belief, following
the case of Dr Raabe. It was asserted in that case that Article 9 of
the European Convention guarantees only absolute entitlement to hold
religious views. It does not guarantee absolute protection for their
manifestation.</hs_para>

that there is a difference between acts that are a manifestation of

expression 
<?notus-xml column=104?>or a belief is protected as a manifestation of religion or
belief—for example, when someone reasonably expresses a view in
favour of traditional marriage—it will not necessarily protect
individuals because the public authority has to strike a balance

amendment, the issue will therefore have to be resolved in the courts,
and that will result in expense and uncertainty until it is resolved.
That will have chilling effects on freedom of speech and public debate.
During the earlier debates, the noble Lord, Lord Elton, referred to a

particular legislation is to achieve clarity, in so far as it can, so
that its application in public life in this country will not produce
dissension or disturbance. Therefore, when we look at the provisions of
the Act, we should have in mind a saying of the American Supreme Court:

reasonable and not contrary to the Act. The amendments thus far have
not involved the Equality Act, and the concern of many is not just
Speakers’ Corner—homosexuality is a sin and so is
adultery between opposite-sex people, or whatever it might be. The

share her view and the view of others and join in the congratulation of

certainly meet Amendments 22 and 23. However, there is
potentially a gap, shown by Amendments 18 and 19. I share the view of
the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, and support his proposal that the
guidance offered by the Government should be available. The gap that
the noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan, has identified in Amendments 18
and 19 may well be met by that guidance, so it would be helpful for the
Government to do that. I personally would wait to see that guidance
before wishing to take Amendments 18 and 19 any further, although it is
clearly not a matter for me but for the mover. However, the Government
need to recognise that something needs to be said on paper to be sure
that these points are met. To that extent, I differ from the noble

believes that the legal structure is in place to give the reassurances
that have been sought. We have said on many occasions and from all
parts of your Lordships’ House, not least from this Dispatch
Box, that the security and protection of religious freedom that we wish
to give to religious institutions is very much an important part of the

18 and 19, which the noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan, spoke to and

intention of the amendments appears to be to ensure that any religious

2010 places a duty on public authorities to have due regard to the need
to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster
good relations between people who hold and do not hold particular
protected characteristics. It applies to the protected characteristic
of religion or belief, not just to sexual orientation, and, as we have
already made clear, the belief that marriage should be of one man with
one woman is a protected belief. Let me also make it clear that the
equality duty is a duty to think, not to act or to produce a particular
outcome; it does not require any particular outcome. If, for example, a
public authority withdrew its facilities from an organisation or
treated an employee less favourably, simply because of the expression
of a belief about the marriage of same-sex couples, it would be acting
unlawfully, both in failing to apply the duty properly and potentially
committing an act of unlawful discrimination under the Equality
Act.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307096000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#1307096000051">Members
of your Lordships’ House may recall that when we debated this in
Committee, I referred to the decision of the Judicial Committee of your
Lordship’s House in the case of Wheeler v Leicester City Council
in 1985. That was a case in which the council banned a rugby club from
using its ground after some of its members attended a tour of South
Africa. The council was using a predecessor of a public sector duty to
justify its actions. In that case, the House of Lords held that the
decision was irrational; it also found that the decision was
procedurally unfair and that therefore there was an improper purpose,
which resulted in the council’s decision being quashed. I

limited to—this picks up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord
Brennan, that the words in brackets in the amendment are not
exhaustive—disciplinary or other action taken in the employment
context. In all circumstances, a person who has suffered a detriment

authority is prevented, as Amendments 18 and 19 suggest, from having
any regard to an individual’s or an organisation’s
beliefs about the marriage of same-sex couples, it would be unable to
consider how its own decisions could potentially discriminate against
or otherwise disadvantage people who do believe that marriage should
only be between a man and a woman. In fact, therefore, it could have
the absolute opposite effect from that which I am sure that the noble
Baroness seeks to achieve. I believe that that would be an unintended

is always the possibility of someone acting in an idiotic way. What we

appointment. In fact he did not set out any religious basis for the
views expressed in the 2005 Paper and there is no reason to suppose
that the revocation of his appointment would inhibit or deter any
person who opposes same sex marriage on religious grounds from publicly
expressing such views for fear of being rejected for a similar
appointment in the future. Mr de la Mare pointed out the most obviously

amendment clarifies the circumstances in which the power would be used,
by providing that the Secretary of State may make regulations about the
procedures to be followed and fees payable on matters such as the
registration applications and the appointment of authorised persons to
attend ceremonies. It makes more explicit the extent of the powers that
can be exercised under the section. Amendment 41 responds to the
committee’s concerns that the scope of the powers regarding
shared buildings which are not shared under the Sharing of Church
Buildings Act 1969 appeared to extend beyond religious buildings, and
whether this was an appropriate use of the powers. The amendment
clarifies the Secretary of State’s powers
to make regulations about the registration of registered
places of worship not subject to an agreement under the 1969 Act. The
amendment makes it clear that the powers apply to buildings which have
been registered as places of worship and not to any other
buildings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307096000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#1307096000066">I
turn now to Amendments 54 to 59, 108 to 110, 116 and 117, which
collectively address the committee’s recommendations on Clause
9, relating to the conversion of civil partnerships. The committee was
concerned that not all regulations made under Clause 9 would be purely
administrative and that some were of sufficient significance to warrant
the regulations being made by the Secretary of State rather than the
Registrar
General.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307096000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#1307096000067">Although
most regulations made under Clause 9 are likely to relate to
administrative matters—and hence were not originally subject to
any parliamentary procedure—we welcome the committee’s
remarks and recognise that the first set of regulations will set out
more important issues, such as where conversions can take place, the
processes involved and whether couples will be given a choice of
alternatives on such matters. We therefore agree with the
committee’s recommendation that the Secretary of State, rather
than the Registrar General as currently provided, should make
regulations 
<?notus-xml column=113?>under Clause 9 and that the first set of such regulations should be
fully debated by Parliament by being subject to the affirmative
procedure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307096000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#1307096000068">In
Amendment 123, we propose enabling the Secretary of State to empower
the Registrar General to make administrative regulations. However,
thanks to the committee’s rapid and helpful input, it has come
to our attention that the drafting of Amendment 123 means that its
effect may be broader than we intended. We are considering this
urgently and, if required, we will withdraw Amendment 123, when we
reach it, and table a revised amendment as soon as possible, which will
have a narrower effect, in response to the committee’s input and
our original
intentions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307096000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#1307096000069">Amendments
113, 114 and 118 respond to two committee recommendations. The
committee felt that, when the Government seek by order under
paragraph 1 or 2 of Schedule 2 to vary the general rule that
marriages of same-sex couples in England and Wales are to be treated as
civil partnerships in other parts of the United Kingdom, this should be
subject to greater parliamentary
control.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307096000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#1307096000070">We
accept this, but emphasise that already the Government can do nothing
under this power without the consent of the Scottish Parliament or the
Northern Ireland Assembly, as appropriate, where any such order
contains provision within the legislative competence of either of the
devolved Administrations. In the case of paragraph 27 of Schedule 4, we
are again happy to accept the committee’s recommendation that
any disapplication of the general rule that marriages of same-sex
couples are to be treated under English and Welsh law in the same way
as marriage between opposite-sex couples should be subject to the
affirmative procedure. We welcome these observations and accordingly
propose to introduce the affirmative procedure when the
Secretary of State makes an order under paragraph 1(2) or
paragraph 2 to Schedule 2 or paragraph 27 to Schedule
4.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307096000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#1307096000071">I turn now
to Schedule 6 and Amendment 91, which responds to the
committee’s concern that aspects of these powers were not
consistent with the quadruple-lock protections for the Church of
England and the Church in Wales. This amendment clarifies the provision
for Orders in Council in relation to the solemnisation through
religious ceremonies of marriages of same-sex couples on Armed Forces
bases overseas. This amendment clarifies that an Order in Council to
make provision for the marriage of same-sex couples on Armed Forces
bases overseas explicitly prohibits solemnisation of marriage according
to the rites of the Church of England or the Church in Wales, in line
with the religious protections elsewhere in the Bill. This amendment
also provides that the Order in Council must, rather than may, make
provision to secure that such a marriage under other religious rites
and usages may not be solemnised unless the relevant governing
authority has given written consent to marriages of same-sex
couples.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307096000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#1307096000072">I will
now briefly cover Amendment 92, which does not derive from the
recommendations of the committee. This amendment clarifies that, should
the Church in Wales decide that the law of England and Wales be changed
to allow the marriage of couples according to 
<?notus-xml column=114?>the rites of the Church in Wales, the Lord Chancellor is permitted to
make relevant amending provision. This will include amending provision
to include Orders in Council for marriages overseas. Given the
relatively technical nature of this amendment and, for administrative
convenience, it is thought appropriate for the Lord Chancellor, as
opposed to the Secretary of State, to make the order, even though it is
related to the Armed Forces.</hs_para>

I should say, as perhaps a blinding glimpse of the obvious: it is
surely better for the school to have a willing teacher—somebody

their heart is not in it. The end product would be less than desirable.
I believe that the amendment will do everything to protect those

of our teaching staff in this country. They will either refuse or will
have great reluctance to teach the subject. We need to protect them,

Eden of Winton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Dear, for moving his amendment and I support what he said. I have one
point to make, which I regard as important. In the real world, the
teacher in a classroom often finds him or herself in a somewhat
isolated position. It is not always easy to control a class of up to
about 30 children. It can be difficult for the teacher to establish
fully the nature of what he or she wants to get across. A side example,
which appears more regularly than one would wish, is when a teacher has
tried to discipline someone in the class. The net result can
be—I have recent practical examples of this—that the
father of the child takes the opportunity to address the teacher in an
abusive and threatening manner. One does not want to see that extended

is most important that the guidance given to the teaching profession is

abundantly clear that any teacher who feels as strongly as was

teaching matters with which they are unhappy will be fully protected. I

Royall of Blaisdon:</Member></B> My Lords, we have debated this issue
several times throughout the passage of the Bill. I believe it is
absolutely clear that while teachers will be under a legal duty, as is
right and proper, to teach the law of the land—that gay couples
will be able to marry—that does not mean that teachers are going
to be able to advocate this as the best form of marriage, and nor are
they going to be asked to promote same-sex marriage. These are very
different things. It is right and proper that teachers in our country
should be expected to teach the law of the land—not to promote
or advocate but just to teach.</hs_para>

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend raises a very
interesting question about how teachers will work with this
legislation. At Second Reading, the noble Baroness, Lady Stowell, made
it very clear that this is a Bill about same-sex marriage. The
Government have no intention of dealing with any other issue; this is
just about same-sex marriage. However, from our debates this afternoon,
I think it is also clear that we agree that for many years marriage has
been understood to be the stepping stone to starting a family. For many
people, it is the basis for going on to have children. Therefore, it
does not seem too far-fetched to think that if a Government bring
forward a Bill to introduce same-sex marriage, they may by implication
be saying, “We have looked at all the research about the
outcomes for same-sex marriage and the outcomes for children growing up
with two women or two men as parents, and we are sanguine about the
results. We are quite confident now that there are no concerns at all
about that fashion of bringing up children”. Clearly, from what
the noble Baroness said at Second Reading, that is not the
Government’s intention, but I can see that this may be a
difficulty—that there may be a popular misunderstanding of the
Government’s intention in this Bill. Therefore, we need to make
the guidance very clear for teachers.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T22:22:32"></hs_TimeCode> noble friend
cited two concerning cases about teachers coming under pressure because
they had a different view from that of their head teachers about what
should be taught in this area. A lot of work needs to be done in
ensuring that the best guidance possible is offered to
teachers.</hs_para>

reiterate that there are strong feelings on both sides of this issue.
Some people feel very strongly that with same-sex parenting there is no
difference in terms of outcomes for children, and there are others who
are very strongly against it. The science so far does not prove the
case either way, but both sides want to twist or bend it to a certain
degree to make that conclusion. Therefore, this matter requires a lot
of attention. There is a need to think really carefully about the
evidence involved and to use it in advising teachers and other
childcare professionals about the best framework for the best outcomes

children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T22:23:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Massey of Darwen:</Member></B> I commend what the noble Baroness has
just said about existing policies. I want to make one quick point.
Teachers in schools do not usually teach in isolation. Behind them
there is a school ethos and school policies developed by the staff and
the governors and very often by the pupils themselves involving
parents. That is the context in which teachers are teaching. The
existing law will apply and I do not see any problem at all. I agree

subject. Teachers constantly have to face this issue. I remember going
to a Protestant school and being taught about transubstantiation. The
teacher had a duty to explain that honestly and straightforwardly. He
also had a duty to explain what he himself thought about it. I did not
agree with what he thought about it. On the other hand, I was extremely
well informed by how he explained it. That is what teachers are doing
constantly, in all sorts of areas. That is all that is being
asked.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070917000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000011">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T22:25:00"></hs_TimeCode>
is right that the teacher should explain what the law is. It is right
that the teacher should have to explain the arguments that led to the
law being as it is. It is also perfectly reasonable—and 13
year-olds would certainly demand it—for the pupils to say,
“Well what do you think about it?”. It is perfectly right
for the teacher to say what he or she thinks about it, but with the
proper politeness and courtesy that teaching implies.</hs_para>

to make a special arrangement for this, because it is already covered.
I really do not think that we should get hung up about this, because it
will have to be dealt with immediately we change the law, whatever we
do. That is what teachers are there for: to try to make people
understand that this is what the law is and that there are arguments.

Reading on this issue. We all have huge respect for the role of
teachers and admiration for what they do, but many are deeply concerned
about the impact of the Bill. Indeed, in the Government's response to
the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the door was left partially open
in that the Government said that they would continue to engage with
religious organisations and others to explore 
<?notus-xml column=120?>whether there was a case for further clarification in this area. I

the issue into two—that teachers will have to explain the

pretending things that will not happen. Anyone who has stood in front

teaching pupils about the ordinary, normal married state and same-sex
marriage at the same time in as honest and fair a way as they possibly
can. Then the pupils who are listening very carefully say, “But

think about it Sir?” As the noble Lord, Lord Deben, said,

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Dear, for moving Amendment 46. This amendment obviously reflects the
concerns he expressed about the potential effect of the Bill on
teachers’ ability to express personal views about marriage,
their employment rights and how they are expected to approach this
topic in class. Noble Lords who have followed the passage of the Bill
will know that these issues have been discussed at length in Committee,
not only in this House but also in another
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070917000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000017">Before
I respond to those three separate issues, I make the point that the way
in which some contributions have been made to the debate this evening
suggests that we are starting to confuse these three issues. I think it
is important to see them as separate points. I start by addressing the
point about freedom of expression generally. On this point I can be
absolutely clear in response to my noble friend Baroness Barker, who
asked about whether anything had changed in this Bill. Teachers are and
will continue to be free to express a personal view about marriage or
any other matter, provided they do so in a balanced and sensitive way.
There is nothing in the Bill which will restrict anyone’s right
to express the view that marriage should be between a man and a
woman.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070917000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000018">Amendment
46, put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Dear, aims to offer additional
protections in this regard. This is unnecessary for exactly the same
reasons that I spelled out in response to debates earlier this evening.
I will not repeat them, but I just signpost for noble Lords Article 9
of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Equality Act 2010.
Everything I have said previously applies here. People, including
teachers, have the right to believe whatever they wish to believe, and
nothing about this is changed.</hs_para>

Dear, referred to the specific case of a teacher whom he said had been
told that it is homophobic to disagree with the belief that same-sex
couples should be able to marry. Obviously I do not know the details of
that case, but I can be absolutely clear, because of everything that is
in the Bill and what we are legislating to bring about, that it is
absolutely legitimate to have a belief that marriage should only be
between a man and a woman. I can say categorically that, if somebody
holds that belief, it is not
homophobic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070917000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000020">I
move on to how the Bill affects teachers’ employment rights.
Like any other employee, teachers are protected from being
discriminated against or harassed because of their religion or belief.
Discriminating against someone because they hold or express a belief
about marriage is unlawful under the Equality Act. I add that the noble
Lord’s amendment risks casting doubt on that existing protection
by discriminating against a teacher applying for a job in a non-faith
school, because his or his belief about marriage would already be
unlawful under the Equality Act. The point, which I have made in other
debates, is that, if we start being specific on the face of the Bill
about such things, we dilute the protections to which teachers, as
indeed any other employee, have the right, and we put them at
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070917000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000021">Subsection
(2) of the noble Lord’s amendment would also cast doubt on the
ability of teachers in faith schools who are not covered by this
provision to express their personal views about marriage in an
appropriate way. I am sure that he would agree that such an outcome
would be undesirable, and harmful to the ability of teachers in faith
schools to present their own views in an appropriate manner and in the
broader context of that school’s faith
ethos.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070917000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000022">The
noble Lord, Lord Curry of Kirkharle, referred to the
Government’s response to the Joint Committee on Human Rights,
and the point it makes about considering an amendment which relates
directly to faith schools. I point out to the noble Lord that that is
very different to the amendments we are discussing right now. That
particular amendment, which the Government refer to in their response
to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, is a very specific one, which
we will debate on Wednesday. It is not this
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070917000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000023">Then
we move on to the issue of the requirements and demands on teachers in
the classroom and the content of their lessons. First, I must remind
the House again that, although I know that this is not just related
specifically to sex and relationship education, none the less sex and
relationship education is not compulsory for primary schools. It is
compulsory only for secondary schools. When the noble Lord referred to
particular materials and the effect they may have on younger children,
there is no demand or requirement on primary schools to teach sex and
relationship
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070917000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000024">No

noble Lord, Lord Dear, referred to some specific material. I make the
point to him that the Government do not specify the materials that any
school should use to support teaching. The main point I make is that

relationship education and to make that available to parents because it
is important that they consult with parents about their approach to
education in this
context.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070917000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000027">The
noble Lord, Lord Dear, and my noble friend Lord Eden, asked about
guidance. The Equality and Human Rights Commission guidance that we
have talked about in the context of other debates includes technical
guidance for schools in England dealing with the areas of the Equality
Act 2010 which deal with the provision of education in schools. That
will be reviewed as part of the work that the EHRC has committed to do
to review its guidance in the context of this Bill when enacted. We are

work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070917000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000028">I
understand the concerns behind the noble Lord’s amendment and
the strength of his feeling in this area. I can only reassure him as
clearly as I can that the protections are there for teachers in the
context of both their own employment rights, their own personal beliefs
and their ability to express them, and also the requirement for them to
teach the law of the land: they are under no obligation to promote or
endorse anything that they do not agree with. As we have said at
earlier stages in the passage of the Bill, to achieve the kind of
tolerance, courtesy and generosity that we all talk about as being so
important, it is incumbent upon teachers to be able to explain very
clearly that there are many types of families and that same-sex couples
will be able to marry in future. We want our children to be able to
learn about the whole difference of views that there are in this
country so that they can themselves ensure that we have the kind of
society that we all feel strongly and passionately about. I hope that
on that basis, the noble Lord feels able to withdraw his amendment. If

Anderson of Swansea:</Member></B> My Lords, I think I now have the
message that the night is late and that I should be as succinct as I
can be in moving Amendment 49. It, again, relates to
employer-employee relationships and the adequate protections which, in
my judgment, should be given to employees who are,
of course, in a more vulnerable position as a result.
Essentially, Amendment 49 seeks to protect the free speech of those who
believe in, what I call in shorthand, traditional marriage. It provides
protection, particularly in the workplace, for those who hold that
view.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070917000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000040">The
amendment would insert proposed new Section 47G into the
Employment Rights Act 1996 to prevent employers subjecting their
employees to detriment for holding or expressing their
belief. It is qualified only in that it protects the expression of
belief in traditional marriage, and states that that belief must be
expressed in a reasonable manner. Therefore, it is no protection to
zealots who choose to travel well beyond the bounds of
respect for the dignity of same-sex couples. The amendment is further
qualified in that it does not affect employers such as gay charities
and religious charities, which are allowed, under Schedule 9 to the
Equality Act, to select job applicants on the grounds of sexual
orientation and belief where there is a genuine occupational
requirement for the
job.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070917000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000041">I should
like to think that noble Lords will feel that all this is eminently
reasonable. I look forward with interest to the Minister’s
response and I hope that she will accept that this is a serious matter
that deserves a serious reply. We are dealing with a view of marriage
that was the orthodox view, and one that was accepted by the mainstream
and, indeed, by all parties until some time after the 2010 election.
Suddenly, there was pressure for change which gathered pace and the
tide has swept on. There is a danger that supporters of traditional
marriage will be left somewhat vulnerable on a sandbank unless there
are adequate protections. These people are not bigots, as the Deputy
Prime Minister called them, but ordinary people, many of whom are
perhaps either in a majority or close to being in one. The question
that we now have to ask ourselves is whether we should maintain space
in the public square for those people to hold and express their
views.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070917000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000042">If
an employer accepts the analysis that to be critical of traditional
marriage is equivalent to being critical of black people and saying
that they are not fully human, that may justify detrimental action. I
hope that we can be assured that employers who take that view will not
prevail.</hs_para>

as speedily as I can. It is in many cases an important belief that
would be impervious to change, and the question we now face is whether
we want people who subscribe to the traditional view of marriage to be
treated in the same way that we would treat racists. Of course, it is
not a problem for us in Parliament because we benefit from privilege,
but lest anyone should think that I am making too much of this, we have
several examples of where people have been disadvantaged even before
the law comes into effect. I shall not go into details, but Adrian
Smith’s position in the Trafford Housing Trust and the Reverend
Willie Ross, who was dispensed with as a volunteer police chaplain, are
cases in point.</hs_para>

Government have been alive to the fact that the Bill raises concerns
about religious liberty and have sought to respond, but their
understanding of religious liberty is very limited. The protections
they have provided—the quadruple lock—relate narrowly to
the conduct of religious services. Faith values go well beyond
religious worship. In Wales, they relate not just to faith-based
welfare provision but to respect for the integrity of mainstream
religion and conscience generally. Therefore, the views of such people
need to be respected not only in their church, because they are in
church for only a short time in the week, but in their
employment.</hs_para>

introduced by the Government, rather belatedly, in Committee, was
welcome but does not tackle the main point of this amendment. The
government amendment applies only to the criminal law and to only a
very narrow section of that law. It protects people from
being convicted under the law against inciting homophobic
hatred. The law applies only to extreme speech and is not
therefore relevant to this case in the employment sphere. We
spend a great deal of time at work, and it is
here that people are perhaps most vulnerable. My judgment is
that we should introduce proper protections for beliefs
about marriage into the Bill, even when the new definition of marriage
takes place, well aware that there were very sad cases of people who
were discriminated against before this Bill will come into effect. It
need not happen if we really believe in equality and diversity. We must
surely apply the law in a way that does not deny space for those who
genuinely hold often deeply religious views for deeply religious
reasons.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070917000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070917000046">Over
the years, the traditional role of your Lordships’ House has
been to protect minorities and freedom of speech. Unless the Bill is
amended to give employment law protections to those who hold to
traditional marriage, it will become the source of very real civil
liberty problems. This is clearly not a wrecking amendment. Same-sex
marriages would still happen if the amendment were accepted, but the
amendment affords protection for those who hold what has until recently
been the mainstream view. I therefore urge Members of the
House to support it, both those who support the redefinition of
marriage proposed by the Bill and those who do not. If we pass the
amendment today, we will make plain that there is indeed a place in the
public square for those who believe in same-sex marriage and for those
who do not. We will protect key civil liberties 
<?notus-xml column=128?>and protect our own identity as a democracy that believes in protecting
our identity, minorities and civil liberties where there is a genuine
space for difference. I beg to
move.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_08_PT_1/0432FE6515585945F3FD559D85411B4C9BCC358A" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 8 July 2013">Monday,

Thornton:</Member></B> My Lords, I know that my noble friend is very
concerned because cultural change is always difficult and sometimes
painful, and I understand that. We have discussed these issues in some
detail in Committee. I say to my noble friend that although the
safeguards to protect people’s freedom of speech exist, we also
have the safeguards under the Equality Act, which is a carefully
considered piece of legislation. They set the boundaries and
characteristics that allow religion and belief as a protected
characteristic, so we have the safeguards that ensure that this
amendment is not necessary. As several noble Lords have already said
during this debate and in Committee, one cannot legislate against
idiots taking silly cases. Although in some of the cases that my noble
friends have mentioned people won those vexatious, silly cases, that
does not mean that you change the fundamental laws and freedoms that we
already have. We will be opposing my noble friend’s

talked about this being a serious amendment, and that he wishes the

strikes the right balance in providing protection for the employee,
while also protecting other employees and customers from discrimination

there to strike a balance. Employers must have the right to ask their
staff to do what is necessary to run 
<?notus-xml column=129?>their business, provided that it is reasonable and lawful. Therefore, if
an employer does not think it right that an employee should express
personal views on this or any other subject to customers, for example

with the exception of faith representatives who do not wish to
solemnise same-sex marriages, the Bill currently contains no protection
for other individuals; that is, individuals outside the ambit of the
faith organisations. Therefore, for example, while a priest, minister,
rabbi or imam is free to say that he does not believe in same-sex
marriage and wants nothing to do with the ceremony, the Bill provides
no protection at all for the chauffeur, seamstress, printer,
photographer, caterer or marriage counsellor who may be no less
committed to the principle of traditional marriage. Obviously, the
normal legal principles would have to prevail—that is, that the
relationship should not be too remote. This amendment therefore is
based on the premise that not only church and faith leaders require
strong and effective protection. In addition, a whole host of ordinary
people will face crises of conscience. It is the job of this House and

accommodation has a long pedigree in other parts of the world. There is
much case law on this in the United States. Title VII of the American
Civil Rights Act 1964 requires that employers reasonably accommodate
the sincerely held religious belief of employees unless doing so would
impose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer’s
business. This protection extends to manifestations of those beliefs.
That is the interpretation of “accommodation” in the US.
Are we to be less protective in this case than the US, which is also a
common law jurisdiction? Without the protection contained in the
amendment, employees will be faced with a stark choice of being forced
to act against their conscience or losing their job. Surely, in a free
and democratic society we would not want to see anyone placed in this
position simply on account of their conscientious belief that only a 
<?notus-xml column=132?>man and a woman can contract to a marriage. This, after all, is a view
of marriage which until very recently was the orthodox mainstream view
held almost universally by Members of your Lordships’ House and
by the population at large, and is still embraced by most other
countries. If there is a chance of reasonable accommodation, it is
surely not unreasonable to ask an employer in those circumstances to

first point is that an employer should have the right to ask his
employees to do their job. Equally, he may not impose a requirement on
them that would discriminate against them because of their religion or
belief. Of course, it is open to private sector employers to make any
adjustment they wish for their staff. It is quite possible, and
perfectly lawful, for an employer to 
<?notus-xml column=133?>allow staff not to be involved in any activity that is objectionable to
them—if the employer wishes. In this regard, private sector
employers are not in the same position as public sector employers. As

duty on employers to provide reasonable accommodation in respect of

would work in conjunction with the rules on indirect discrimination,
and whether all other religious and philosophical beliefs should be
equally protected—not just the belief that marriage should be of
one man with one woman. That is not a task to be undertaken in this

of an employee. I hear the noble Lord, Lord Deben, who tried to reduce
to an absurdity the point that I was trying to make, but does he or
does he not believe in the principle of seeking to accommodate,
wherever practicable? Clearly, in many firms such an accommodation
would not be practicable because of the number of individuals concerned

not unreasonable to ask an employer to ensure that the individual who

acknowledged evil. It is a rift in our society that needs to be mended.
The tragedy is that the way in which it has been introduced has made it
much harder to implement. However, that makes me keener for the Bill to
do the job effectively. When the civil partnership legislation was
introduced, it was generally understood that civil partnerships were to
be taken as the equivalent of marriage and conferred equal status.
However, that did not happen. The Bill needs to produce a status that
is the equivalent of marriage. Given that it can be done no other way,
some of us have reluctantly come to the view that the status must also
be

them—that is, equal status. There is a difference between the
two that is clear in the statute. In Clause 9, we therefore have the
arrangements by which a civil partnership can be converted into a
marriage. One would think that would be a momentous occasion and should
be attended with some ceremony. I am well aware, from the volume of
letters I have received, of the need for a measure of this kind and I

and, if they did not like them, they could have their own words but
they would have to be cleared by the registrar. I rang up the local
registrar’s services association to find out what guidance was
given to registrars on what would be suitable. The only advice

provision on the statute book relating to marriage was trawled and

Is a couple in a civil partnership almost essentially married? The
language of marriage has been used in popular terms for civil

Alli:</Member></B> I understand the motivation behind the noble Lord,
Lord Elton’s amendment, and I did not view it with huge
suspicion. I understand that a conversion 
<?notus-xml column=137?>of civil partnership to a marriage should be marked by a ceremony to
convey the solemnity of the occasion. I completely accept that. In
other circumstances, I would be with him on this amendment, but I am
afraid that the past is the past and the future is the future. We have
to start the journey from where we are. Many same-sex couples will have
already had big celebrations when they entered their civil
partnerships. They will have had family and friends witness their civil
partnerships, and they will have made vows and speeches. For them, I
suspect, it was the nearest they probably thought they would get to a
marriage and they would not wish to repeat that whole process. There
will be others who simply went to the registry office and had a small
civil partnership in the expectation that one day they would be able to
marry. For them, this would provide the opportunity to recommit their
vows in the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Elton, wants them to do.
There may indeed be others who wish to wait until the right reverend
Prelate, and his colleagues, sanction same-sex marriage, or even permit
civil partnerships in their churches, mosques and
temples.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070919000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070919000002">I
am afraid that I do not think it is up to us to place an unnecessary
hurdle in the conversion of civil partnerships in the way in which the
noble Lord suggests. There is a further point. We should remember that
many of those ceremonies are for the young, and we should also respect
the financial burdens that another ceremony might place on those who
are just starting off in life. While it is a lovely idea, I do not
believe that it is necessary or that in the end will help those in
civil partnerships who want to convert their civil partnerships into
weddings. I am sorry, as I wanted to agree with the noble Lord, Lord
Elton, and I am sure that we will find a way of doing so in future.

one. I had a ray of hope when I heard the noble Lord, Lord Alli, start
to speak. I thought that at last we would unite the House. My noble
friend’s arguments are unassailable. It is absolutely right that
we should be strengthening marriage, and this is a marvellous way to do
it. I think of the weddings I have been to. I have been to a same-sex
wedding, a pagan wedding, and what I consider to be normal
weddings—Christian weddings. When I go to weddings the most
moving part for me is when the vows are exchanged. There is always a
hush in the town hall, church or the venue wherever it is taking place
because people recognise that this is the very heart of the ceremony.
It is the total commitment of two people to each other. I so agree with
the right reverend Prelate that it is a public and social institution.
It is something that you should make very public—what you are
doing, why you are doing it and what you hope for the future. I am
afraid I do not agree with any of the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord
Alli. I think this is equity, fairness and what we should be
doing.</hs_para>

Butler-Sloss:</Member></B> My Lords, I also agree with amendment of the
noble Lord, Lord Elton. One point made by the noble Lord, Lord Alli, I
thought was really quite unnecessary. One does not have to spend much
money on a civil ceremony. I have a number of 
<?notus-xml column=138?>friends, indeed members of my own family, who have got married with just
two witnesses. In one case, they asked two people from the street,
would they go in and be the witnesses. That was the cheapest possible
wedding one could have. I would also like to support marriage in the
Bill, at the point which we have now reached. There is a danger of
demoting marriage among those who are civil partners. That would be the
worst of all worlds. That would be very sad indeed. We should be
strengthening every sort of marriage. We have got to that stage.
Therefore, the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Elton, would be
entirely appropriate.</hs_para>

him, I am very much in favour of strengthening marriage, and
celebrating marriage at every opportunity. Therefore, I certainly agree
with the sentiment of the amendment. Public commitment, made in the
presence of friends and family, is an expression of that commitment and
of the seriousness of the union that the two people are entering into.
However, couples choosing to convert their civil partnerships into
marriage, which of course they will not have to do, will already have
gone through a very similar process. It is not the same and not with
the vows, which I think are extremely important, although not everybody
would agree; but they have made a public commitment in the presence of
a registrar and witnesses.</hs_para>

have done that, as the noble Lord himself said, might have wished to

partnership into marriage. However, for those couples that wish to
embark upon marriage then, of course, it is absolutely right and
proper. I am sure that when the guidance comes out, when the Government
publish whatever they are going to publish in relation to the
conversion of civil partnerships into marriage, should a couple wish to
exchange vows and marry they will be able to do so. It is just that not
every couple will be required to do so. It is the difference between
requiring and enabling a couple to do so. I am afraid I cannot agree
with the amendment, but I am fully behind the
sentiment.</hs_para>

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who
participated in this mini debate. I particularly thank my noble friend
Lord Elton for concerning himself so positively in looking at the
conversion from civil partnerships to marriage. I think that the right
reverend Prelate may have invited himself to some civil partnership
ceremonies now that he has mentioned that he has not yet had such an
invitation.</hs_para>

debated Clause 9 in Committee and the nature of the process that will
apply for couples in a civil partnership to convert that partnership to
a marriage. I was very grateful to my noble friend
Lord Elton for agreeing to withdraw a similar amendment to
this in Committee on the basis that it was appropriate to await the
Government’s response to the recommendations of the Delegated
Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. I hope that he is pleased with
the Government’s decision, which I explained 
<?notus-xml column=139?>earlier this evening, to accept the Committee’s recommendation on
Clause 9, so that the regulations under this clause would be made by
the Secretary of State, rather than the Registrar General, and that the
first such regulations would be subject to the affirmative procedure,
and subsequent regulations subject to the negative procedure.
Therefore, we will be debating this further.</hs_para>

includes the power to make regulations on the detailed process of
conversions, which it would not be appropriate to set out on the face
of the Bill. This will follow discussions with interested parties,
which have already started. I note the noble Lord’s sympathy for
those who may be affected by this, as well as that of the right
reverend Prelate and my noble friend Lady Cumberlege. I assure them
that their views and those of others will be fed in.</hs_para>

be appropriate to go into further detail at this point, other than to
reiterate that we do not envisage conversion to be akin to a marriage
ceremony, nor that it must take place in registered places of worship
as this amendment seems to envisage. We must remember, as the noble
Lord, Lord Alli, and the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, pointed out, that
couples in a civil partnership have already made a public commitment to
each other and formed a legal relationship with equivalent rights and
responsibilities to those of marriage. They may not want another
ceremony or the costs associated with a more complicated procedure. Of
course, we envisage that couples should have the ability to opt for a
ceremony, as noble Lords have pointed out, if that is what they
wish.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070919000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070919000011">We have
had a very sympathetic discussion in this debate as we look forward to
the conversions to marriage. That is very encouraging. I
hope that my noble friend will be willing to withdraw his amendment in
the light of the government amendments that we agreed earlier and that
he will be pleased that Parliament will have the opportunity to
consider the detail of the process in due course. I am sure that we
will have interesting debates at that time. I therefore hope that my
noble friend will be content to withdraw his
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070919000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070919000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Elton" PimsId="3105" UID="13070919000175" xid="1210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070919000175">Lord
Elton:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend leaves me in a quandary.
I think I am right in saying that the consultation will not bear fruit
until after the Bill has passed through Parliament. If I can address
the arguments that have been made, my feeling is that the noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, dealt fairly effectively with the
noble Lord, Lord Alli—or rather with his arguments, not
necessarily with him. The costs can be
minimal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070919000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0003.htm#13070919000013">Too
much has been made of the barrier. It is not a barrier: it is an
escalator. It is something very easy to get on to that gets you where
you want to be. That is what the Bill is for: to open up marriage to
people who want it and who could not get it until now. If that is what
we are committed to, we must have some means of doing it. We could
leave it to the Secretary of State. I am glad that it will not be the
Registrar General and 
<?notus-xml column=140?>I am glad that it will be subject to the affirmative procedure. But I
think as a matter of principle that the vows should be the same in both
instances.</hs_para>

Butler-Sloss:</Member></B> My Lords, in Committee, I spoke to a similar
but not identical amendment at midnight. Today, I start two or three
minutes later. It makes me wonder whether it is a ploy of the
government Front-Bench to make sure that I speak to an amendment on
this subject after 9 pm. The noble Baroness, Lady Stowell, made that
suggestion in Committee. In Committee, I spoke at some length, despite
the hour, about the importance of trust between those who enter into
matrimony, so today I shall be very brief. Trust can be destroyed if
one spouse has a relationship outside marriage and breaks the concept
of faithfulness. That extramarital relationship strikes at the root of
the marriage bond and can be devastating. It seems to me that the
behaviour of the erring spouse should be identified as adultery, as it
is in the Matrimonial Causes Act. I do not see why the injured spouse
should petition for unreasonable behaviour, which is a wholly different
matrimonial offence.</hs_para>

like the previous amendment by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, is intended

recall that I also spoke in Committee on her amendment. The issue we
wrestled with then is the same that we are wrestling with now, which
was that definition of adultery and the sexual act that defines it. I
see that the noble and learned Baroness has said that a judge could
interpret that but in every instance bar that of a lesbian
relationship, we could find an accommodation. The issue of how you
define adultery between two lesbians is something we have tackled over
and over again from the Civil Partnership Act onwards. I do not believe
that the noble and learned Baroness’s amendment deals with that.
I have huge sympathy regarding the issue that she raises but I do not
feel that the amendment is drawn in a way which will make it clear.
Given that there are grounds of unreasonable behaviour, it is probably
unnecessary.</hs_para>

this amendment. Under existing law, if a married man has a sexual
relationship with another man his wife cannot sue for divorce on the
ground of adultery. She can sue for divorce on the ground of
unreasonable behaviour, based on sexual infidelity. As I understand it,
the Bill adopts the same approach in relation to same-sex marriage and
sexual infidelity with another same-sex partner. This seems to be
consistent with existing legal principle. It involves no detriment
whatever to the other party to the marriage, who can obtain a divorce
on the basis of unreasonable behaviour. I, too, am concerned about the

similar to adultery is one which is precise enough, even for the most
learned of Lords. I feel that it does not achieve anything. We have
another way of dealing with these things and, if I may say so, a rather
more all-embracing and less detailed way of doing so. I am not ashamed

appear fairly late in the Sexual Offences Act would have sufficed as a
definition, but there is a point to be made about the distinction
between the grounds in same-sex marriage and those in opposite-sex
marriage. Adultery is mentioned in particular in relation to
unreasonable behaviour in opposite-sex marriage. This is an imbalance
between the two, which are supposed to be absolutely the same. It seems
an unnecessary difference and the noble and learned Baroness has put
her finger on an important point so far as this is
concerned.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_08_PT_1/0D61C02C3B9D111F697BAF143013832C21B63036" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 8 July 2013">Monday,

amendment. While the law retains adultery as a ground for
divorce, I believe that it should be applied equally. I
think that I am right in recalling that perhaps this could have been
short-circuited, as I believe there remains on our statute books,
although it is not in force, a whole provision in relation
to no-fault divorce. However, until we are in the position where people
do not use fault as a ground for divorce, it is my submission that it
should be applied to all situations.</hs_para>

inequality here. It is as unjust to gay couples as it is to
heterosexual couples, as neither of them can ask for divorce on the
grounds of adultery with someone of the same sex. Although I appreciate
any humour that we can inject into this debate, as my noble friend Lord
Deben just did, this is a serious point. One has only to look at some
of the support group websites that exist. The one that I have come
across is for wives who subsequently discover that their husband is in
a relationship with a man. The support group website that I looked at
this evening talks about pain, loss, betrayal, confusion, loss of
self-esteem and feelings of isolation. To be told that if your husband
leaves you for another man it is just unreasonable behaviour, but if he
were to leave you for another woman you could petition for divorce on
the grounds of adultery, is, I believe, unjust.</hs_para>

that means that the only couples in either of our

After all, as a sexual relationship was not the basis of their
marriage, they cannot complain that adultery is not available to them.
I think that we have left the law in not just a muddled state but an
unjust one, and it is important to recognise that.</hs_para>

that the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, says that this is the existing law,
but if we are saying that culture is changing and we are changing the

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, for introducing her amendment

will start by addressing one angle that underpins this amendment and
the debate associated with it, and that is about fidelity. It was
something to which my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay referred. I
want to be absolutely clear that the Government recognise the
importance that couples, whether opposite-sex or same-sex, attach to
fidelity in their relationships. The seriousness and the intention of
same-sex couples wishing to make a commitment to each other are no less
serious than that of opposite-sex couples. There is no difference in
the intensity of the commitment and fidelity is every bit as important
for same-sex couples who wish to marry as it is for opposite-sex
couples.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070919000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0004.htm#13070919000034">The
provisions in the Bill do not, in any way, imply that fidelity will be
less important in marriages of same-sex couples than it is in marriages
of opposite-sex couples. It is important to make that point, not so
much in relation to what the noble and learned Baroness said today, but
certainly following up on the debate that we had in Committee, and the
comments of my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay, lead me to make
that clear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070919000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0004.htm#13070919000035">It
is important to remember that betrayal in close relationships can,
unfortunately, take many forms. A partner can be unfaithful by sharing
confidences and not necessarily by sharing a bed. I make that point
because I think that the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss,
said in Committee, when she was moving her amendment, that for her the
opposite of fidelity was adultery. However, I would argue that the
opposite of fidelity is infidelity, and infidelity takes many forms; it
is not necessarily about adultery via a sexual act. Her amendment, as
we have heard, seeks to create a new fact for divorce to sit alongside
the current fact of adultery in the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. This
new fact would apply to sexual activity, similar to adultery, of a
married person with someone of the same sex outside the marriage, and
it would apply to all marriages, whether of same-sex or opposite-sex
couples.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070919000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-0004.htm#13070919000036">The
effect of this definition is not clear as we do not know what sexual
acts would be covered by the amendment. That point was made by the

Pannick<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T00:17:21"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
worth reminding ourselves that the 
<?notus-xml column=146?>definition of adultery that exists in law now took decades to be defined
through case law; it was not something that was established overnight.
If we are to introduce something called “similar to
adultery”, as the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has said, this lack
of clarity would mean that all married couples, whether same-sex or
opposite-sex, would not be clear about the grounds on which they could
obtain a divorce. Neither same-sex nor opposite-sex couples would
benefit from the extended facts to constitute adultery inserted by this

amused by our debate that evening and seemed to think that off the back

whatever they may be, were dealt with by irretrievable breakdown of
marriage and unreasonable behaviour? However, if adultery is to remain,
it remains an inequality and an injustice. Like other noble Lords, I

review of all public bodies. Its overriding aims are to increase
transparency and accountability, cut out duplication of activity and
discontinue unnecessary activities. In conducting individual reviews of

I may give some brief background on the public lending right scheme and
the public body managing it, formally known as the Registrar of Public
Lending Right. The position of registrar was established by the Public
Lending Right Act 1979, which gave authors a legal right to receive
payment for the free lending of their books by public libraries. Under
the 1979 Act, funding is provided by central government, and payments
are made to eligible authors and other rights holders 
<?notus-xml column=2?>in accordance with how often their books are lent out from a sample of
UK public libraries. The registrar is a corporation sole and is
appointed by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to
maintain a register of eligible rights holders and books, and to
supervise the administration of the scheme. Around 23,000 rights
holders receive a public lending right payment each year, up to a
maximum of £6,600.</hs_para>

registrar receives grant in aid from the department to fund both the
administration costs and the payments to authors. Given the current
economic climate, the decision was taken in October 2010 to reduce the
resource grant-in-aid budget for public lending right by 15% in real
terms over the spending period from April 2011 to April 2015, and the
proportion of grant in aid used to administer the scheme was capped at
£756,000 a year.

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, I want to start
where the Minister finished, by welcoming the extension of the PLR to
e-books and audiobooks on-site. This was subject to much discussion in
the Chamber a few weeks ago, when the Minister was not able to give us
an assurance us one way or another, but, since then, other events have
intervened. The Chancellor’s announcement in the recent spending
review was very welcome. However, I note that this applies only to
e-books and audiobooks borrowed 
<?notus-xml column=4?>on-site. It still leaves open the question of how the PLR is to be
extended—if, indeed, it is to be extended—to those
borrowed through the web or alternative ways yet to be discovered.
Given the way in which the technology is moving, e-books will not be
requested in terms of their physical presence in the library. Perhaps
the Minister could respond to that when he sums up this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000017">I
would also like to praise the way in which the department has gone
about this operation. It has been a long time since I have read such a
good consultation exercise. I am constantly coming up against them in
secondary legislation debates, where they are sometimes
somewhat<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T15:40:52"></hs_TimeCode>
perfunctory in approach. This seemed to be a genuine consultation which
offered real alternatives and suggested possibilities
available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T15:41:06"></hs_TimeCode> for
those who wished to consult. It is a model of its type. The department
should be very pleased that it has been bold enough to try to take this
all the way out and to take responsibility for the answers that came
back.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070816000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000018">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T15:42:15"></hs_TimeCode>
problem with a consultation as open as this is that it might get
answers back that, perhaps, the department was not looking for. It is
therefore not altogether surprising to discover that nearly 95%,
I think, of those who responded were against what the
department was proposing. Given that the department consulted authors
and others interested in the written word, the responses were somewhat
well written, rather redolent of deeper and other worries, and must
have made rather uncomfortable box reading for the Minister when he
came to review them. Not surprisingly, the department has found a way
of eliding any real criticism from approaching its proposed solution.
It will not take account of the consultation or, indeed, the very
singular report that came in from those who were consulted. I am sorry
about that. It is quite clear that this measure does not command
support among those who were
consulted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000019">That
raises the question of why this is being done. Is it because the
department wants to reduce the number of its bodies? I find that rather
surprising because it was clear throughout both the consultation
exercise and, indeed, the reports of the various committees of your
Lordships’ House and the other place that have looked at this,
that the registrar does a good job and has done it with considerable
economy. There are no apparent suggestions that the registrar is at
fault in any of the ways in which it is going about its job. The
registrar is regarded as a friend of the authors and seems to have good
relationships also with the public libraries that have to come up with
the funding as a result of the lending and to work with a very small
staff and a very inexpensive foundation in Stockport. The registrar
seems to be doing a very good job indeed.</hs_para>

jobs have been located to a relatively poor area of the country, and it
is good that there are jobs of this high calibre there involved in such
good activity. It is therefore a bit surprising that the department
does not recognise that, by making this change, we are also introducing
some risk about whether those jobs will continue. The real essence of
what is requested at the heart of this proposal is that costs be
reduced rather than that the number of bodies 
<?notus-xml column=5?>be reduced, because the transfer is actually being made to the British
Library. Although it looks as though we are losing one body and simply
absorbing it into another, it is clearly a different function which
must be added on to the existing work of the British Library. To some
extent, therefore, there is not really a reduction in its activity or
the management spread in which it will be
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000021">On
the cost argument, which I presume has been part of this, there will
also be costs in the British Library. The change seems to be financed
by the reduction of one post—that is, the loss of the registrar
post. Indeed, the whole operation seems to revolve around the fact that
the cost of that post will no longer be counted against departmental
spend. Of course, when the Minister introduced this, he made clear that
it was now unlikely to result in savings until March 2015, which
perhaps cuts into the overall savings that have been requested. Several
respondents and both committees which have looked at this have pointed
out that the existing provision in the registrar’s office is
extremely efficient. When the House of Commons reviewed this in May, it
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13070816000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000138">“So
far the office of the Registrar has been successful in keeping its
operating costs below the budget cap of £756,000 per annum which

ways at variance with the activities that it has to have. It introduces
the rather unwelcome thought that the British Library—which in
some sense prides itself on its independence and is, as it should be,
at arm’s length from the Government—is now also an agent
of the department in terms of its operation under the statute for the
provision of payments to authors. That is, in a sense, mixing up apples

will be a permanent arrangement or whether it might change? Again, that

pleased to hear from the Minister that he has accepted the suggestion

not going to use this opportunity to delay the order—which, 
<?notus-xml column=6?>in a sense, I regret, but I understand that it is not an issue which
will catch much attention. I think the arguments are a bit thin, and I
worry that the implications of what is happening here are that we will
lose a small but valuable outpost of activity in Stockport, which has
the confidence of authors and writers and has worked well with local
authorities. Its incorporation with the British Library, although not
unreasonable, is not in accordance with the majority of respondents.

the main issues with which we would need to wrestle if there were to be

British Library is retaining the current office in Stockton-on-Tees and

My Lords, this instrument seeks to correct an error
in the 2012 regulations. The error concerns the formula used for
calculating the glass remelt recycling target for producers of glass
packaging. The consequence is that the proportion of producers’
glass obligations that have to be met by evidence from remelt
applications is inadvertently higher than the intended 63% for 2013-15.
This instrument corrects that mistake by substituting an amended
formula which ensures that the 63% glass remelt target is correctly
applied to a producer’s glass recycling obligation for 2013-15
and 64% for 2016-17. My officials have worked with the Environment
Agency to correct the error and to check that no further changes are
needed to the 2012 regulations.</hs_para>

The consultation included the correct target of 63% but the draft

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, as always, I am most grateful to the
noble Lord for his comments. Before I address them, perhaps I could say
that the target we are talking about offers both economic and
environmental benefits for the United Kingdom. As valuable resources
for our industries become scarcer and more expensive, we need processes
in place to recycle and recover them in order to retain as much of
their value as we can in the economy. Indeed, the Government want the
United Kingdom to move towards a zero waste economy; that is, an
economy where resources are fully valued. We want to see material
resources reused, recycled or recovered wherever possible, and only
disposed of as a last resort. The targets in these regulations play an
important part in achieving this ambition. They will help the UK to go
further in recovering the value of discarded packaging materials and
help to tackle the wasteful practice of burying these resources in
landfill. Overall, we estimate that the whole package of targets will
provide a net benefit of over £180 million to the UK economy
over the period from 2013 to 2017. Over 95% of those benefits will come
from revenue generated from recycled materials. We will also see
greenhouse gas savings associated with diverting waste from landfill
and energy savings from replacing virgin materials with recycled
ones<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T15:58:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

recognise that the economic benefits will not be shared by all. These
regulations will place an increased cost burden on the producers of
packaging 
<?notus-xml column=9?>materials. However, the recycling targets will help to support wider
growth and the creation of jobs in the recycling sector. I am pleased
to say that when we consulted on the regulations, most businesses,
including the majority of those on which the increased costs will fall,
supported our approach. As I said, I am sorry for the error made in the
2012 regulations and I thank the noble Lord for taking the time to
debate this instrument today. It will permit producers to continue to
meet their obligations under the correct glass remelt recycling
target.</hs_para>

not calculated the cost of correcting the error. I do not anticipate
that it will be material. It will consist basically of official time to
check the regulations and prepare amended regulations. As I said in my
opening speech, the effective cost of the correction is nil, because
everybody has been operating on 63% anyway. The only other thing I
would say to the noble Lord is that I always enjoy being ragged by him
about my mathematics. With those comments, I commend the
regulations.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13070816000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000206">Motion

This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:04:53"></hs_TimeCode> order was
laid before the House on 3 June 2013. First, I apologise to noble Lords
for an error that appeared in paragraph 3.2 of the Explanatory
Memorandum. The memorandum omitted to note that Part 7 of the draft
order will apply retrospectively from 1 April 2013. Part 7 concerns
transitional and savings provisions. This is in line with the
provisions for Parts 1 to 5, and Articles 29 to 31. This administrative
error has been amended, and corrected versions are now
available.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000040">The
order is made under Section 150 of the Government of Wales Act 2006,
which allows for consequential amendments to primary and secondary
legislation in consequence of provisions made by an Assembly Act or
subordinate legislation. The order is made as a consequence of the
Natural Resources Body for Wales (Functions) Order 2013, brought
forward by the Welsh Ministers, which was approved by the National
Assembly on 19 March 2013. I shall refer to this as the functions
order. The order transferred functions in relation to Wales from the
Environment Agency and the Forestry Commission to the new body, Natural
Resources Wales. It also abolished the 
<?notus-xml column=10?>Countryside Council for Wales and transferred its functions to the new
Natural Resources Body for
Wales.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000041">This
consequential order provides for the completion of legal arrangements
for the Environment Agency, the Forestry Commission and Natural
Resources Wales to operate together in their respective areas in the
most effective and efficient manner. For example, it makes provision to
remove Welsh Ministers from the appointment and funding of the
Environment Agency and the Forestry Commission. It also amends the
Environment Act 1995 to ensure that the new Natural Resources Body for
Wales can make appropriate charging schemes in relation to the EU
Emissions Trading Scheme, and that the Environment Agency and the
Natural Resources Body for Wales can make cross-border arrangements for
cost recovery and charging for water abstracting
licences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000042">In
preparing this consequential order, the Wales Office worked closely
with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and other
key UK government departments, as well as the Welsh Government. We are
all agreed that the provisions in this order are necessary to ensure
that Natural Resources Wales can exercise its functions to fulfil its
remit and co-operate effectively with its counterpart organisations
across the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000043">This order
is also important to the UK. Without it, the Environment Agency and
Forestry Commission in England will be unable to delegate their
functions to the Natural Resources Body for Wales and similar bodies
across the border, and would therefore be unable to fulfil their remit
efficiently and cost-effectively. For example, in the event of a
pollution incident in Wales that impacted on England, the Environment
Agency in England would not be able to delegate the clean-up to the
Natural Resources Body for Wales. This could result in unnecessary
duplication of decision-making and deployment of staff, and a waste of
Environment Agency resources. That is just one example of the
importance of this order to both the UK and Welsh
Governments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000044">This
order demonstrates the UK Government’s continued commitment to
working with the Welsh Government to make the devolution settlement

practical result is something to be welcomed. I commend this order to

Baroness for introducing these regulations so clearly. She will perhaps
be relieved to know that I have not suddenly taken on shadow Welsh

outset that we are supportive of these regulations. From my reading of
the Explanatory Notes and the other documentation, it appears that all
the consultations have been carried out well by the Welsh Office and
the Government. Obviously, these 
<?notus-xml column=11?>regulations are bringing forward measures that have come from the Welsh

my only question to the Minister—and not wanting to delay the
Committee—is that the merging of the devolved functions of the
Environment Agency and the Forestry Commission with the Natural
Resources Body for Wales will produce some interesting learning for the
rest of the United Kingdom in terms of joined-up working in this area.
Does the Minister know of any mechanisms that the Environment Agency,
the Forestry Commission or indeed Defra will be putting in place to
ensure that we can learn those lessons and see whether or not there are
aspects of joint working that we could do better here as this new body
proceeds in Wales? It is not always fashionable, I know, for us in
England to learn from Wales—sometimes it is more likely for
Ministers to be sent to New Zealand than across the Severn
Bridge—but there are things that we could learn from our friends
in the devolved Assembly and I would be interested in the
Minister’s
response<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:08:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000048"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Randerson" PimsId="5929" UID="13070816000182" xid="2139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000182">Baroness
Randerson:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Knight, for his
positive words in support of this order. Referring specifically to the
noble Lord’s question, it is very much the case that close and
co-operative working will continue between the Environment Agency, the
Forestry Commission and the new Natural Resources Body for Wales. It is
essential that that close co-operation will continue, from the
perspective of both England and Wales.</hs_para>

there will be training co-operation, which will greatly benefit the new
body in Wales because it will be able to call upon training
opportunities in England, where the numbers undertaking training are
very much larger and therefore there is a wider range of opportunities.
Close working is also very important because, of course, rivers do not
follow national boundaries. The organisations concerned—the
predecessor organisation in Wales and the continuing organisations in
England—are used to working together and co-operatively in order
to reduce costs. They work across border when there is agreement and it
is essential that that kind of co-operation continue. I think that so
long as there is co-operation, both in operational working and in
training, there will be ample opportunities for the organisations which
continue to exist in England to learn and to observe what is taking
place in
Wales<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:10:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000050">Perhaps
I may also briefly mention to the noble Lords that there was recently a
triennial review of the Environment Agency and the Forestry Commission
in England which looked at whether those bodies should continue in
their current form, should be reformed or should be merged. That
triennial review concluded that the bodies should continue but that
there should be reforms. I think it is important that the lessons from
that review be taken. By the time of the next triennial review, which
will be in 2016, there will of course be ample opportunity to have
learnt from the experience in
Wales<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:11:20"></hs_TimeCode>. With

facing a huge shortage in the number of people with the appropriate
technology skills to fill these jobs and grow the high-tech, high-value
industries in which the UK should—and must—be globally
competitive. Clearly, something has to change. Two important recent
reports—from the Royal Society on computing in schools, led by

curriculum, which was last updated in 2007 for secondary schools and
1999 for primary schools, has led us away from teaching pupils to
program computers and develop a deep understanding of how computer
technology actually works. For too long, and for too many pupils, ICT
lessons have focused on basic IT user skills and avoided the more
challenging aspects of the subject, such as control technology and
statistical process control. Experts contend that the existing ICT
curriculum fails to prepare pupils for higher-level study. As Alex Hope

appropriately skilled employees into the computer games and visual

leader.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000057">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:16:35"></hs_TimeCode>,
the potential loss is much broader, since virtually all sectors of the
economy make extensive use of digital systems, and high-level computing
skills are required to develop and maintain the hardware and software
on which so many businesses depend. Beyond the economic arguments for
reforming the ICT curriculum, we are letting young people down if we do

crisis in technology education in schools head-on; first, by
withdrawing, or “disapplying”, the existing ICT
curriculum last September. Subsequently, we worked with leading subject
experts, convened by the British Computer Society and the Royal Academy
of Engineering, on an ambitious and challenging new curriculum that
places computer science and practical programming at its centre. From
key stage 1 onwards, the new curriculum aims to develop pupils’
understanding of the fundamental principles and concepts of computer
science and to enable them to write computer programs in several
languages. Pupils will continue to develop skills in using a range of
digital tools to carry out tasks, becoming digitally literate. For the
first time, they will also be taught in primary school how to stay safe
on the internet, keep personal information private and use technology
respectfully and
securely.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000059">As
we are overhauling the content of the curriculum, we are changing the
name of the subject, from ICT to computing. There are good reasons for
this. As the Royal Society report contends, the very title
“ICT” is part of the problem, as it carries negative
connotations of a dated and unchallenging curriculum that does not
serve the needs and ambitions of pupils. Renaming the subject will
encourage schools and teachers to develop fresh approaches to teaching
the new curriculum content. We agree with the Royal Society and others
that “computing” is an appropriate broad umbrella term,
which covers the three principal elements of the subject included in
the new curriculum—computer science, digital skills and
information technology—but without being too strongly associated
with any one of
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000060">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:18:40"></hs_TimeCode>
know that our proposals are ambitious and that many schools and
teachers will be teaching computer science and programming for the very
first time. 
<?notus-xml column=14?>Fortunately, it has never been easier for schools and pupils to get
started with programming, through using low-cost hardware such as the
Raspberry Pi computer, which costs around £30, through free
programming languages such as Scratch and through the support of
grass-roots organisations such as Computing at School. Furthermore, we
are taking steps to ensure that teachers have the skills needed to
teach the new computer curriculum. Over the next two years, we are
providing £2 million in funding for the British Computer
Society’s Network of Teaching Excellence, which will enable our
best computing teachers to train thousands more to teach computer
science and programming to their pupils. We will also be signposting
teachers to the best resources worldwide to use in teaching the new

proposals have wide support. They have been greeted positively by
important organisations including Microsoft, Google, Facebook, the
British Computer Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering. In the
consultation, a majority were in favour of the change. Also, many of
those who disagreed with or were unsure of the change in title were
actually concerned about the content and the challenges for schools in
teaching the new curriculum and there were relatively few concerns that
related directly to the name of the subject in itself. This was also
the case for the responses to the more recent one-month consultation on
the draft order. We are considering these concerns in the course of
finalising the new computing programmes of study. Having considered the
evidence from the public consultations, we remain certain that
replacing “ICT” with “computing” will
improve the status of the subject in schools and encourage schools to
develop fresh approaches to the way in which they teach this vital part
of the national
curriculum.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000062">As
the Committee may have heard today, the statutory consultation of the

the summer. We then intend to publish the final version of the new

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
his explanation of the proposed name change; indeed, the order is
narrow in its intent. On the whole, we welcome the change and the need
to revitalise the ICT curriculum. We take on board the concerns that
were raised by Ofsted, that the curriculum and teaching approaches had
not kept pace with the rapid technological developments outside the
school environment. While we share the concerns of many of the
respondents that the term “computing”, which is now being
adopted, suggests too narrow a focus, we also recognise the need to
send a signal that the content has been substantially
modernised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:21:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of all the subjects in the national curriculum, this one will continue
to have challenges in keeping up with the pace of change. For 
<?notus-xml column=15?>example, it is easy to foresee that what we are now celebrating as a new
computing course will appear in a few years’ time to be dumbed
down and irrelevant to the demands of employers in the future. However,
in the mean time, I have a few questions that I hope the Minister can
address<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:22:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

on professional development, the Minister made the point that some
money was being made available for some of the professional development
work. Does he feel that it will be sufficient? There is a serious issue
about ongoing professional development throughout the system, starting
at primary level, where updating computer skills will be part of a
range of updated skills which all primary teachers will need to deliver
the new curriculum. It is also an issue at secondary level, where it
may not be easy but is possible to recruit specialist staff with
up-to-date computing skills. However, if you are not careful, that
knowledge and those skills can fall out of date very
quickly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:23:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Government planning to do to attract new specialist computing staff
to teach in schools? It is fairly obvious that there would be
alternative, better paid jobs for high-class performers in computing.
They may not necessarily rush into the teaching
profession<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:23:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000067">Thirdly,
can the Minister confirm that the change in name does not represent a
narrowing of the curriculum, and that pupils will be taught some of
those broader skills such as internet use and safety, word processing
and data processing, so that the subject will actually give people a
range of knowledge and skills which the word “computing”
does not necessarily
encompass<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:24:12"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:24:12"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

will be successful only if it is supported by sufficient funds to
modernise IT facilities and to keep modernising them as technology
changes. The noble Lord made reference to some low-cost initiatives in
terms of facilities in schools. However, I have seen reference to 3D
printers. That is fine, it is just one example, but 3D printers are
very expensive. The fact is that, for children to have an up-to-date
and relevant experience, you would need to keep providing not just
low-cost but some quite expensive technological equipment in schools on
an ongoing basis. Will sufficient funds be available to do
that?</hs_para>

computing skills and the supporting equipment that would be needed are
increasingly integral to the teaching of all subjects, not just
computing, have the Government given sufficient thought to what
computing skills should be taught within the confines of the computing
curriculum and what computing skills need to be provided with all the
other arts and science subjects that people will be studying, in all of
which pupils will increasingly require computing skills to participate
fully? Has that division of responsibilities been thought through? I
look forward to the Minister’s

Bett conference at the beginning of last year, when the Secretary of
State, Michael Gove, who is now on his feet in the other place talking
about these issues, announced the disapplication of the programme of
study for ICT. I broadly welcomed that announcement. It goes back to my
dissatisfaction when I was Schools Minister with the ICT curriculum,
particularly at key stages 3 and 4, and to how unengaging my son found
the experience of doing the European Computer Driving Licence. My
attempt to change things was to get Jim Rose’s primary
curriculum review to include ICT as a core subject alongside English
and maths. It was a battle that I eventually won by subterfuge, and
Jim’s review included ICT at its core. I wanted young people
starting secondary school to be plug-and-play ready to use ICT across
the whole curriculum in their
learning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000072">I
was also informed, as I think the Minister was, and as he mentioned in
his opening comments, by the changing nature of the labour market,
which is essentially hollowing out due to globalisation and
technological change. The growth in high-skill, high-wage work is at
the higher end of the market and is very much informed by technology
and people who are confident with it. Not all of it requires
programming skill. Therefore, my first question is: how will the
Minister ensure that digital skills remain across the whole curriculum
and inform the way in which young people learn in all subjects, not
just in the subject called
computing?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000073">I
cannot see any occupation where we will not require people to be
confident in using the internet and technology, and to have a basic
understanding of how it works. I am chair of the Online Centres
Foundation, which just today was renamed the Tinder Foundation. We are
very active in digital inclusion, and we see people referred to us from
jobcentres so that they can not just process a claim but apply for
jobs, because 70% of employers require you to apply online. These are
fundamental skills for every child to learn in order to be confident

issue of digital skills across the curriculum raises an additional
question. It is a perhaps unfashionable question about pedagogy. As a
Minister, I was always slightly reluctant to get involved in pedagogy
because I am not a trained teacher. However, I regret that, and I have
looked at the amount of investment that has gone into technology in
schools over time and have seen that some of it was not spent well,
because not every teacher was taught to be confident in using it, and
to shift their pedagogy in order to use it
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000075">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:29:38"></hs_TimeCode>

finding out from the Minister whether, as 3D printers land in schools,
they are not going to be used to prop doors open or get dusty in
cupboards. Last<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:30:12"></hs_TimeCode>
Friday I was talking to teachers from the Isle of Portland Aldridge
Community Academy down in Dorset following their being shortlisted for
a TES Schools Award. Unfortunately the school did not manage to win an
award, but it is worth noting that both the nominated projects involved
3D printers, so I can see that some fantastic pedagogy may emerge from
this technology that encourages highly engaged teaching and
learning.</hs_para>

am not persuaded that we have in place a system for scaling teaching
innovation around how we use technology. It is the mistake that has
always been made with new technologies in learning: we have no system
for scaling proper, high-quality continuing professional development to
ensure that teachers can design really engaging learning experiences
using new technologies. To me, that is essential. We no longer have the
British Educational Communications and Technology Agency. I understand
the reasons for the Government’s decision to get rid of it three
years ago, but we have only one official in the whole of Sanctuary
Buildings—the whole department—on ICT. She is a great
official who does a fantastic job, but it is only part of her role.
That seems inadequate to ensure that every school is procuring
efficiently when buying this technology and that we are continuing to
strike really good deals with the likes of Microsoft, thus saving huge
amounts of public money in respect of licensing. Are we able to provide
any kind of lead on how we teach when using this technology? As the
Government acknowledge in wanting to bring forward these changes, and
as the Secretary of State acknowledged in his Bett speech in January
2012, technology is an important tool in educating children because it
is a huge part of the world in which they are growing up. However, we
have only one official in the department, which does not make any sense

questions for the Minister. He is right to point to Raspberry Pi and I
pay an unfashionable tribute to Google for funding its provision in a
number of schools so that it is even cheaper than the Minister has
said. However, it is not just about Raspberry Pi. Does the department
have a view on personal, one-to-one computing in schools, about
bringing in your own device and whether that is a way forward in terms
of it being affordable? Does he have a view on the use of the pupil
premium for children from poorer homes so that they are able to access
personal devices for homework as well as when they are at school? If he
has the answers to these questions, they will be listened to carefully
and very warmly received by a large community out

to teacher training, which has already been mentioned by my noble
friend Lady Jones. As I understand it from the British Computer Society
and CAS, there has been some discussion with higher education
institutions about how they could be at the heart of a network to
deliver some of this teacher training. That is commendable at the
geekier end, but the mistake would be to think about computing as
computer science, a name that was conjured up at one point, and forget
the wider application of computers and computing. In terms of teacher
training, is the Minister looking at peer-to-peer learning and how we
could use the model created in the specialist leaders of education
scheme, which has been so successful in driving school improvement at
relatively low cost, in order to identify the teachers who are driving
forward really good pedagogy and practice around the teaching of
computing, as it will now be called following this order? Having done
that, will we be able

Nash:</Member></hs_speaker> I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady
Jones, and the noble Lord, Lord Knight, for their excellent speeches
and their broad support for the name change and the need to revitalise
the ICT curriculum. The noble Baroness asked the very important
question of what steps the Government are taking to ensure that the
professional development of teachers keeps pace with the curriculum
change. In addition to the points I mentioned in my opening speech, and
to provide more detail on one of them, the National College for
Teaching and Leadership has established an expert group to signpost
schools, teachers and trainees towards existing high quality curriculum
resources. We will consider the group’s recommendations
carefully as we prepare for the implementation of the new national
curriculum from September 2014. The £2 million
funding for the computer science CPD runs until 2015. By then, we will
ensure that teachers in approximately 16,000 primary and secondary
schools are
capable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:35:34"></hs_TimeCode> of
teaching computer science. We think that this number is very
adequate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000080">Secondly,
the noble Baroness asked what the Government are planning to ensure
that we attract new specialist computer staff to teach in schools. We
have made available bursaries of up to £9,000 for suitably
qualified candidates to help ensure that computer science
undergraduates consider teaching as a career option. Furthermore, there
are up to 100 scholarships worth £20,000 each for exceptional
applicants. Initial teacher training providers are also offering
subject knowledge enhancement courses to graduates from non-computer
science courses which have a significant technology component. These
courses will provide candidates with the computer science knowledge
they require to go on to study the computer science
PGCE.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000081">Thirdly,
the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, asked me to confirm that the change in
name does not represent a narrowing of the curriculum and that pupils
will be taught e-safety. I can confirm that the name change represents
a rebalancing rather than a narrowing of the curriculum. The purpose of
the study statement for the new computing curriculum states that pupils
should become digitally literate—as the noble Lord, Lord Knight,
stated was so important—through this particular curriculum
subject. There is content on digital skills at key stages 1 to 3.
Keeping our children and young people safe on the internet is a top
priority for this Government and the noble Lords know that it is an
area in which we are doing a great deal of work. This is why for the
first time children will be taught in primary school how to stay safe
on the internet, to keep personal information private and to use
technology respectfully and securely. We have also strengthened the
requirements around e-safety at key stages 3 and 4. Throughout their
schooling, pupils will be taught to recognise inappropriate contact and
conduct as well as to know each appropriate way to report concerns. We
have been advised on this by leading e-safety experts, including the
Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, the UK Safer Internet
Centre, the NSPCC and Professor Sonia Livingstone.</hs_para>

the noble Baroness asked whether the teaching would be successful. It
needs to be supported by sufficient funds to modernise ICT facilities
and keep them current. Evidence from the British
Educational<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:38:05"></hs_TimeCode>
Suppliers Association shows that school spending on digital technology,
hardware, software and services is increasing annually. Schools are
choosing to make this expenditure—there is no ring-fenced
capital or revenue funding for digital technologies. I agree with the
noble Lord, Lord Knight, that if it were true that there was only one
official focusing on this in the department, that would be too few. I
understand that there is one leading official who is supported by the
STEM team. However, I undertake to investigate the position further so
that we can consider whether we have enough support.</hs_para>

identify the resources that schools can use to teach computing and
design and technology. I was delighted to hear that the noble Lord,
Lord Knight, recently visited the Isle of Portland Aldridge Community
Academy and thereby celebrated the success of the sponsored academy
programme initiated by the previous Government. The noble Lord asked
about the pupil premium and whether it can be used for purchasing
personal devices. I know that some schools provide iPads and I am sure
that it will become a growing trend. It is a scenario that I would be

keen to trust teachers to use their own discretion. Together with the
training that we will be providing, it is up to schools to determine
where and how they teach computing skills in the context of other

strong affinities with the content of the computing programmes of
study, most notably maths and design and
technology<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:40:17"></hs_TimeCode>. The

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Astor
of Hever):</Member></B> My Lords, there are two instruments for
consideration today, the Armed Forces (Retrial for Serious Offences)
Order 2013 and the Armed Forces (Court Martial) (Amendment) Rules 2013.
I shall say a few words on each, starting with the former. For your
Lordships’ convenience, I shall refer to it as the retrial
order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:42:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000087">This
instrument enables persons acquitted of certain very serious offences
by a service court—for example, the court martial—to be
retried in the service justice system. This may happen only if new and
compelling evidence comes to light in relation to those offences and if
it is in the interests of justice for a retrial to take place. These
are high hurdles to
clear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000088">Our
purpose in making this order is to follow the same path as Part 10 of
the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which reformed the law relating to
double jeopardy. Before the 2003 Act, a person who had been acquitted
of an offence could not be retried. The 2003 Act changed the law to
permit retrials in respect of a number of very serious offences where
new and compelling evidence has come to light, but separate provision
is required to apply this to our service justice
arrangements.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070816000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000089">We are now filling that
gap. I do not want to give the impression that this measure is driven
by specific concerns about members of the Armed Forces who are evading
justice because they cannot currently be retried. It is intended simply
to bring the two systems of justice into line on this matter, extending
the same principles from one to the other; nor would I want to give the
impression that we are doing this now for any reason other than we want
to have the legislation
ready.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000090">The
Armed Forces (Retrial for Serious Offences) Order makes provision for
the retrial of persons previously acquitted in the service justice
system of a “qualifying” offence. Qualifying offences are
set out in Schedule 1 to the order. They include a very limited number
of criminal offences—such as murder, manslaughter and
rape—and, because this legislation is for the services, a small
number of disciplinary offences, such as assisting the enemy.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070816000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000091">The order sets out the
arrangements governing the investigation, charging and application for
a retrial of an acquitted person for a qualifying offence. Retrial is a
complex matter and there are, as I said, high hurdles to get over
first. In broad terms, the order will enable the service police to
reinvestigate the commission of a 
<?notus-xml column=21?>qualifying offence by a person previously acquitted of the offence.
Investigative measures may, in most cases, occur only if the Director
of Service Prosecutions consents; and he may only give his consent if
he is satisfied that it is in the public interest to proceed with an
investigation and that there is either some new evidence that warrants
an investigation or some evidence would come to light if the
investigation takes
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000092">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:47:24"></hs_TimeCode>,
there is a power for service police to take investigative steps without
the consent of the Director of Service Prosecutions if it is necessary
to do so to prevent the investigation being prejudiced. Additionally, a
person previously acquitted of a qualifying offence may be arrested
only if a judge advocate has issued a warrant for their arrest. Where a
person has been charged with a qualifying offence, and if the Director
of Service Prosecution consents, a prosecuting officer may apply to the
Court Martial Appeal Court for an order to retry the person. Where such
an application is made, the court must make the order applied for if it
is satisfied both that there is new and compelling evidence against the
acquitted person and that it is in the interests of justice to do so.
As the Committee will recognise, therefore, a strong set of safeguards
has been built into the new procedures.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070816000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000093">It is important to
clarify the position of those who have left the Armed Forces. In most
cases, there are strict limits in place that prevent former service
personnel being charged with a service offence when they have been out
of the Armed Forces for more than six months. However, this time limit
can be waived if the Attorney-General consents. The time limit applies
in relation to all former service personnel who are suspected of
committing a service offence and not just to those who might face
retrial. These provisions also apply to civilians subject to service
discipline.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000094">The
order also makes provision for the production of evidence and
attendance of witnesses at the hearing. It creates a right of appeal to
the Supreme Court. There is provision for the Court Martial Appeal
Court to make an order restricting the publication of material which
might otherwise prejudice the administration of justice and,
furthermore, it makes it an offence for a person or an organisation to
breach an order prohibiting publication. It provides for the period of
time in which certain arrangements for the retrial must be made and for
the holding in custody, and release from custody, of a person,
previously acquitted, who is charged with a qualifying offence. There
are also a small number of supplementary provisions relating to the
rules governing the service of documents and the exercise of functions
of the Director of Service Prosecutions and the Court Martial Appeal
Court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000095">I now
turn to the second order, the Armed Forces (Court Martial) (Amendment)
Rules 2013. The court martial was established by the Armed Forces Act
2006 as a standing permanent court that replaced the system of ad hoc
courts martial that were convened by the services. The court martial
may sit anywhere, within or outside the United Kingdom. It comprises a
civilian judge, known as the judge advocate, and lay
members—sometimes referred to as the board members—who
are usually officers or warrant officers. Its rules of procedure are
set out in the Armed Forces (Court 
<?notus-xml column=22?>Martial) Rules 2009. I shall call these the 2009 rules. These broadly
follow those that apply in the civilian system, but reflect the
different make-up of the court martial. The main purpose of the second
instrument before us today is to amend these rules, specifically Rule
29, to reduce, in certain circumstances, the number of lay members that
sit on the panel of the court
martial.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000096">The
court martial rules—in fact, the rules of all service
courts—are kept under review by the Service Courts Rules Review
Committee. This is a non-statutory body under the chairmanship of the
Judge Advocate-General. Currently, Rule 29 of the 2009 rules provides
that where court martial proceedings relate to a more serious offence,
there shall be at least five lay members. The Service Courts Rules
Review Committee considers that in cases where a defendant or
co-defendants all enter a guilty plea before the trial begins, it is
not necessary to have five lay members. It has therefore recommended an
amendment to Rule 29 that reduces the minimum number of lay members
required to sit in the court martial in these circumstances from five
to three. The aim of this is to reduce delay and the cost of
proceedings in the court martial, but it is not cutting corners. It is
a sensible adaptation of the system to a particular set of
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000097">The
instrument does two further things. It prescribes a procedure for the
court martial to certify to a civilian court, which has the power to
commit for contempt, the failure of a person to comply with an order of
a judge advocate to produce material to a service policeman or to give
a service policeman access to it. It also removes a piece of
legislation made obsolete by changes made in the Armed Forces Act
2011.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000098">The
Armed Forces Act 2006 gave Her Majesty’s Armed Forces a service
justice system that provides consistent and fair access to justice for
all, whether they are in Aldershot or Afghanistan. We have faith in
this system and, more importantly, our Armed Forces have faith in it.
However, we continually look for ways to enhance our processes and to
keep the service justice system in line with its civilian counterpart.
The orders that we are considering today contribute to that
effort.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000099">Finally,
I will say a few words about ECHR issues. It is the custom for
Ministers commending instruments subject to the affirmative procedure

friend for what he said but will make just a few remarks about the
Armed Forces (Retrial for Serious Offences) Order. We need to be
careful that we do not surround the activities of our Armed Forces, in
particular our Special Forces, with such a panoply of legislation that
they will have difficulty discharging their duties in the manner that
we would wish. Of course the Armed Forces cannot be exempt from the
law, but if they are at risk—or fear that they are at
risk—of too zealous an application of the relevant legislation,
there may be difficulties of a wider kind.</hs_para>

back so far, but some of your Lordships may recall an incident in
Gibraltar in 1987 when Special Forces were involved in an operation
against IRA suspects. At the time, there was much initial discussion,
although it did not go on for ever, as to whether they had complied
with the law or not. It was a very finely balanced judgment and a
question of whether they had complied with the rules of engagement, as
they are called, laid down by Ministers in respect of the use of
firearms in circumstances such as then prevailed. I was much involved
in the discussion; indeed, there was a very important debate in your
Lordships’ House at that time, to which I
replied<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:55:29"></hs_TimeCode>. It was
established that they had indeed complied with the required legal
provisions and therefore that no question of any offence arose.
However, there was a coroner’s examination of the matter in
Gibraltar. The outcome of that was not initially certain but eventually
it was
clear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:55:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000102">It
is important that in general terms we do not surround our Armed Forces,
and particularly our Special Forces, with such a panoply of rules and

second prosecution, as provided for by this
order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:56:29"></hs_TimeCode>. I need to
be careful, as there is a particular case before the courts at present

Rosser:</Member></B> Perhaps I may resume my contribution, which I had
hardly started. I should say again that the second instrument we are
discussing, on the reduction in the number of lay members who sit in a
court martial in sentencing proceedings where a guilty plea has been
entered in serious cases, could be argued to be weakening the panel, at
least as far as lay members are concerned. The first instrument we are
considering seems to go in the other direction, since among other
things it now provides for a panel to be able to hear a 
<?notus-xml column=24?>case again if new and compelling evidence comes to light following a
person or persons being acquitted of certain serious
offences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000107">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T17:07:54"></hs_TimeCode>
understand what has driven the order; namely, bringing service
proceedings into line with the civilian justice system. I had assumed
that the terms of the order would apply only if the person or persons
concerned in respect of whom new and compelling evidence had come to
light were still members of the Armed Forces, but I think that the
Minister referred to a six-month period that could possibly be waived.
I am not sure whether that means that for a period of six months after
someone has left the Armed Forces, in the circumstances set out in this
order, they could still be recalled and retried through the court
martial system. I would be grateful if he could clarify the situation
when he responds. What would happen if there were two or more
defendants, one or more of whom was still in the Armed Forces and one
or more of whom was not? How would the reopened case be dealt with?
Would it be dealt with within the court martial system?</hs_para>

what is driving the order, but what is driving the second instrument is
a little less clear. Paragraph 7.2 of the Explanatory Memorandum states
that the change being
proposed,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13070816000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000141">“is

delay can certainly be in the interests of justice, but reducing the
cost of proceedings sounds as though the instrument is, at least in
part, financially rather than justice driven, or at least financially
at least as much as justice driven. No figure is given for the
reduction in the cost of proceedings, and, as far as I can see, the
Explanatory Memorandum is also silent on what the reduction in delays
would be, and on how such a reduction would be achieved as a result of
the proposals set out in the
rules.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13070816000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000109">Currently,
at least five lay members are required to sit in court martial
proceedings that relate to a more serious offence, as listed in
Schedule 2 to the Armed Forces Act 2006. Under the new rules, the
minimum five lay members would be reduced to a minimum of three and a
maximum of five in cases relating to a more serious offence where the
defendant or defendants entered a guilty plea before the trial began,
and where sentence had to be passed. As the Minister said, this arises
from a review and recommendation of the Services Courts Rules Review
Committee. Is there to be any reduction in the number of non-lay
members sitting in court martial proceedings? Are lay members
represented on the Services Courts Rules Review Committee that carried
out the review and made the recommendation in front of us
today?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000110">It
would be helpful to know what the savings would be, since it is not
immediately obvious that savings of any significance are likely to
arise, unless reducing the number of lay members from five to three
will be used as a reason for reducing the total number of lay members
eligible to sit. To enable me—if nobody else—to get some
feel for the impact that the proposed changes might have, perhaps the
Minister will answer the following questions, if not today then at a
later date. How many court martial proceedings with lay members were
held in 2012? What was the total number of cases they heard? What was
the total number of 
<?notus-xml column=25?>days in aggregate for which the courts martial sat? Is the number of
sitting days going up, going down or remaining static each year? What
is the total number of lay members eligible in aggregate to sit in
court martial proceedings? What is the average number of sitting days

year?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000111">Furthermore,
in how many cases in 2012, if this statutory instrument had been in

8.1 of the Explanatory Memorandum states that the rules have been the
subject of “rigorous consultation” with the various
bodies and organisations to which it refers. I am not sure of the
difference between “consultation” and “rigorous
consultation”, and I suspect that the Minister is not, either.
Therefore, I am not inviting him to answer the question. However, does
one of those bodies and organisations listed in the Explanatory
Memorandum as having been consulted represent or speak for the lay

statutory
instrument?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000113">I
conclude by saying that while we have no intention of opposing the
order and rules, I would be grateful if the Minister would respond, at
some stage if not today, to the points I have made. Unless there is a
corresponding reduction in non-lay members sitting in court martial
proceedings, the statutory instrument alters the balance between lay
members and non-lay members in sentencing for serious offences where a
guilty plea has been entered. I am not clear of the justification for
this, in the interests of justice. The decision on whether one is found
guilty of an offence is a profoundly significant one for a defendant,
and so, too, is the decision on sentence where lay membership
involvement has been reduced where there has been a guilty plea, since
that sentence—we are talking about serious offences—can
take away an individual’s liberty for a considerable period of
time.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13070816000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000153">5.15

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful for the support
that both noble Lords gave to the two instruments that we have
considered today. Taking the question from my noble friend Lord
Trefgarne first, I agree with him that we should not surround our Armed
Forces, particularly our Special Forces, with too much of a panoply of
legislation. However, we feel that we have got this right. My noble
friend mentioned the Special Forces, and in particular the Gibraltar
case. He has raised a really important point, not just for Special
Forces but for all members of the Armed Forces, and I am very grateful
to him for that. My answer is that our Special Forces personnel are in
the same position as regards the law as any other member of the
services. I am sure that neither they nor the Committee would wish it
to be any other way. However, I emphasise that there are a strong set
of safeguards before any retrial can be set in motion. I stress that
the

turn to the questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, although I
will not necessarily deal with them in the order that he asked them.
First, he asked whether there are lay members on the Service Courts
Rules Review Committee and whether the order has their support. The
committee is chaired by the Judge Advocate General—the senior
service judge—and includes the Director of Service Prosecutions
and legal and policy representatives from the Ministry of Defence. The
Association of Military Court Advocates is also represented. In its
work, the committee consults the services, the Service Prosecuting
Authority, the Association of Military Court Advocates and the Military
Court Service. It does not make the rules itself but makes
recommendations to the Secretary of State, who does make the rules, and
any necessary changes, through the procedure being used
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T17:16:55"></hs_TimeCode>. As I

noble Lord asked how many court martial sittings there were last year
with lay service members on the panel. Last year, I understand that 516
service personnel were court-martialled with lay members. How many
cases were heard in a court martial is, in essence, the same question,
and the answer is also 516. The court martial sat for 689 days in 2012.
The noble Lord asked if the number of sitting days was going up, going
down or staying the same. I am advised that it appears to be staying
the
same<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T17:18:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000118">The
noble Lord asked about the total number of lay members who are eligible
to sit. In principle, all officers and warrant officers of the three
services who are eligible and qualified in accordance with the Armed
Forces Act 2006 may sit in the court martial. In some cases, certain
civilians may also be eligible. Who is eligible in any given case
depends on a wide range of factors specific to each case. I am aware
that that may not fully answer the noble Lord’s question, and I
will pad that out in a detailed answering

noble Lord asked whether it weakens the panel for a court martial if it
is reduced from five lay members to three. We feel that it does not. In
fact, most courts martial have a three-man lay panel for sentencing and
for trial purposes. This change simply recognises that, where an
accused is charged with a more serious offence and admits his guilt,
there is no need for a five-man
panel.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000120">The

a claimant can ask for a decision to be reconsidered by a
decision-maker, which may result in a revised decision. In practice,
however, many people do not do so and instead make an appeal from the
outset. This is more costly for the taxpayer, time-consuming, stressful
for claimants and their families, and for a significant number of
appellants unnecessary. I say this because the reason that the vast
majority of decisions are overturned on appeal is because of new
evidence presented at the tribunal.</hs_para>

hope that noble Lords will agree that we need a process that enables
this evidence to be seen or heard by the decision-maker at the earliest
opportunity. It is accepted that this does not mean that all decisions
will be changed and that appeals will be unnecessary, but we believe we
should have a process that at least promotes this possibility.
Mandatory reconsideration does just
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000127">Mandatory<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T17:21:48"></hs_TimeCode>
reconsideration will mean that applying for a revision will become a
necessary step in the decision-making process before claimants decide
whether they wish to appeal. Importantly, the intention is that another
DWP decision-maker will review the original decision, requesting extra
information or evidence as required via a telephone discussion, and, if
appropriate, correct the decision. When this happens, there is no need
for an appeal—an outcome that is better for the individual and
better for the

for it. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T17:21:47"></hs_TimeCode> would

undertook a formal consultation before we introduced mandatory
reconsideration for universal credit and personal independence payment.
A number of respondents suggested that there should be a time limit on
the reconsideration process and there have been further representations
about this. While we understand the concerns, we are not making any
statutory provision for it. Some cases are more complex and require
additional time—particularly, for example, cases where extra
medical evidence may need to be sought. Others will be completed in
days. It will be a case of considering each case on its
merits.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070816000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000130">However, we are
considering the scope for internal performance targets. While these
will reflect the requirement to deal with applications quickly, it will
not be at the expense of quality. The process will fail if clearance
times become the driver. We will be back with unnecessary appeals and
all that that entails. It is a balancing act which we must get right.
We will monitor developments closely and adjust accordingly. We may in
due course learn from the experience of UC and PIP but at this time we
have had so few requests for mandatory reconsideration that we have not
as yet learnt anything which will inform our future handling of these
applications. We will of course continue to monitor the situation ahead
of October.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070816000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000131">I
turn now to the payment of benefit pending reconsideration and appeal.
This has caused a lot of concern, particularly in relation to
employment and support allowance. First, I want to make the point that
there is no change from the current policy. If someone is refused
benefit under the existing provisions and they request a revision of
that decision, benefit  
<?notus-xml column=29?>will not be paid pending the consideration of that request. It will be
the same for mandatory reconsideration. Secondly, there is no change in
relation to appeals. If someone appeals a decision under the existing
provisions, no benefit is paid pending the appeal being
heard—save for ESA, which I will come to. This must be right. It
would be perverse to pay benefit in circumstances where the Secretary
of State has established that there is no entitlement to
benefit.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070816000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000132">I turn
now to ESA. At the moment, if someone appeals a refusal of ESA, it can
continue to be paid pending the appeal being heard. This is not
changing. What is changing is that there can be no appeal until there
has been a mandatory reconsideration. There could therefore be a gap in
payment. However, during that period—and I repeat my message
that applications will be dealt with quickly so that this is kept to a
minimum—the claimant could claim jobseeker’s allowance or
universal credit. In other words, alternative sources of funds are
available. The claimant may choose to wait for the outcome of his
application and, if necessary, appeal and be paid ESA at that point. It
is accepted that the move from stopping ESA to claiming and being paid
jobseeker’s allowance will not happen overnight, but provided
that the claimant does not delay in making his claim, the wait for his
first payment of jobseeker’s allowance should be
short.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070816000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070816000133">Finally,
another change to mention linked to the introduction of mandatory
reconsideration is that all appeals will be made directly to HMCTS and
not as now to this department. This change brings the DWP in line with
other departments’ appeals processes. This is a positive move as
it will allow HMCTS to book hearing dates more quickly than is possible
currently. The department believes that the regulations will result in
a clearer, escalating dispute process that will deliver a fair and
efficient system for people who dispute a decision. I commend this
statutory instrument to the
Committee.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_08_PT_1/72DD389D3A39F5C54B7966AB5FB6468DD35AD376" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 8 July 2013">Monday,

that they would apply to all benefits administered by the DWP with the

the Minister clarify the way in which these regulations will apply

lodgement elements of JSA and ESA are affected by these regulations,
the commencement having been done by the previous set. Perhaps the

notice of the content of those 154 responses than that paragraph might

Perhaps the Minister could take us through the reasoning behind the

some of the comments made by outside organisations such as Citizens
Advice, the Child Poverty Action Group and others. I will draw out one
or two quite specific points.</hs_parafo>

mentioned, a number of respondents proposed that there should be a time
limit for the department to complete its reconsideration of disputed
decisions. I take the point that a time limit would make it difficult
to accommodate the huge variety in the nature of cases but can the
Minister deal with the fact that, at the moment, if the department
were—unimaginably, obviously—to drag its feet in response
to an application, a claimant can move matters along by lodging an
appeal? These regulations would preclude that possibility. Can the
Minister tell the Committee how the interests of the claimant will be
protected in these circumstances? After all, 39% of all social security
and child support appeals to the First-tier Tribunal were successful in
the period from January to March 2013, the last quarter for which
statistics are available. Since there were 130,517 social security and
child support cases determined in those three months, I make that over
50,000 people who had been denied benefits to which they were lawfully
entitled. That, presumably, could be 200,000 in a 12-month period, were
the pattern maintained. I presume that the Minister would accept that
the Government owe a duty of care to those citizens to remedy these

also worth noting that the Courts and Tribunals Service is facing a
significant increase in its caseload, driven mainly, it reports, by the
37% increase in the number of social security and child support appeals
in 2012-13 as against the previous year. The last statistical bulletin
suggests that this was driven primarily by appeals in relation to ESA,
which more than doubled between the final quarter of 2011-12 and the
comparable period of 2012-13. In fact, those ESA claims accounted for
more than 70% of all the social security and child support receipts in
the final quarter of 2012-13. Does the outstanding caseload for social
security and child support tribunal cases—which is now 41%
higher at the end of 31 March 2013 than it was a year
earlier—suggest that there will be a greater delay for
claimants, not only in being allowed to lodge an appeal but then in the
time it might take for that appeal to be
heard?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070822000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070822000005">Can the
Minister tell the Committee what assessment the department has made of
the likely change in the end-to-end elapsed time for a claimant wanting
to challenge a decision to secure a successful appeal? We could, for
example, see them being delayed from making an application for
reconsideration, so that there are more reconsiderations, which take
longer. There would be a delay, therefore, before they are allowed to
appeal

paragraph 12 of the Explanatory Memorandum published with these
regulations suggests that the Government do not intend to publish data
on the number of requests they receive for reconsideration, how long it
takes to process them or the outcome of the reconsideration requests.
Can the Minister tell me if I have got that right? If so, how can
Parliament scrutinise the effectiveness of this process, which the
Government intend to replace a statutory process which is, at least
currently, subject to published
data?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070822000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070822000009">The
other big issue raised in response to the consultation was the proposal
the Minister referred to; that the department should consider paying
ESA pending reconsideration. The Minister indicated that this was not a
change from the current process and that ESA is of course paid only at
the assessment rate once an appeal is started. However, as he
acknowledged, an applicant may not now go to appeal and is therefore
obliged to wait for however long it takes the department to reconsider
his or her case. Can the Minister take me through what would happen to
someone in that circumstance? If the claimant did what he suggests, and
applied for JSA, would they therefore be subject to the full range of
conditionality and sanctions that would apply to anyone else making an
application for JSA?</hs_para>

can the Minister help me understand what would happen if a claimant,
for example, who believed they were not fit for work none the less had
their application for ESA turned down? They start a process of
reconsideration and appeal but meanwhile, because they have nothing
else to live on, decide to apply for JSA. However, they are sanctioned
for failing to take up a job or to follow an instruction which they do
not believe they are fit to do. Let us suppose that claimant is
eventually successful, and the tribunal agrees that they do not have to
undertake work because they are not fit to do it. What would then be
the status of any sanction that was applied to the claimant in those
circumstances?</hs_para>

raised in relation to these proposals was about what would happen if
the department refused to reconsider a decision, either because it felt
there were no grounds or because the claimant was late in making the
application. Can the Minister confirm 
<?notus-xml column=32?>that that means that the applicant could not go to appeal because there
had been no reconsideration and that is a necessary gateway, if you
like, before being allowed to appeal? Are there any circumstances in
which a claimant could appeal without having had a reconsideration? If
so, what time limits would apply? Can the Minister—this is
particularly important—tell us how broad he is willing to make
the grounds for considering a late application for reconsideration?
Many concerns have been expressed about vulnerable clients,
particularly perhaps those with mental health issues, who might
struggle with that. How broad will he be able to be with
that?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070822000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070822000012">The
principles of mandatory reconsideration were discussed in some detail
during the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill, so I have not revisited
them today. I realise that I have asked a number of detailed questions,

event.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070822000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070822000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Freud" PimsId="5439" UID="13070822000026" xid="2007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070822000026">Lord
Freud:</Member></B> I thank the noble Baroness for responding with her
customary detailed and forensic approach to this. She has raised a
number of important issues, which gives me an opportunity to set out
the Government’s thinking a little further. I can assure the
noble Baroness that we will be closely monitoring the new process and
its impact on claimants and appeals during the early stages of its
implementation. Clearly, it is a key change and we must get it right. I
will deal with as many of the specific questions as I can and turn to
the printer to answer the
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070822000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070822000014">The
noble Baroness asked, first, to what these regulations apply. Earlier
regulations dealt with the contributory JSA and ESA—in practice
we have taken that apart—which is the new ESA and JSA element.
These regulations apply to the legacy versions of income-based ESA and
JSA. The two income-based benefits will be gradually replaced by
universal
credit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070822000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070822000015">On the
question of conditionality, we would see modified conditionality for a
person requesting mandatory consideration—that is,
conditionality that would be adjusted for the fact that the person was
in that position. This is the current position and, in practice, there
will be no change on that
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070822000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070822000016">On the
publication of data, the issue is that the data effectively will not
meet the standards for publication, which, as the noble Baroness knows,
are pretty strict. That means that they will not be publishable because
the collected data will not be validated. That is the issue. A
validation system for this would be costly. Therefore, we have no plans
for publication, although we will look at how we can get more
information out. We are looking at how we monitor the process in the
early period to make sure in particular that we get the timings right
and that appropriate information is made
available.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070822000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130708-gc0001.htm#13070822000017">On
the question of late application for reconsideration, the
decision-maker is in a position to extend the time to apply if the

which is one month. However, there is an absolute deadline of 13 months

Government has expressed its regret about the way resettlement of BIOT
was carried out in the late 1960s and early 1970s. We do not seek to
justify those actions or excuse the conduct of an earlier generation.
What happened was clearly wrong, which is why substantial compensation
was rightly paid. Both the British courts and the European Court of
Human Rights have confirmed that compensation has been paid in full and
final settlement.</hs_para>

of infrastructure and public services appropriate for a twenty-first
