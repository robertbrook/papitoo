with which I agree, save for one: with great respect, standardised
packaging would not be an extension of the nanny state, because it
would not impinge on anybody’s freedom or right not only to buy

The Minister says, quite correctly, that the best legislation is based

lobbyists? She will be aware that Department of Health officials met
Philip Morris Ltd at the end of January this year, but although minutes
of meetings with other tobacco companies that occurred at the same time
have been released, the Department insists that the minutes of the
meeting with Philip Morris have yet to be finalised. Is it not the
truth that the Government are trying to cover their tracks over their

to the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services report that
was published recently. It is important to look at that report in
context and not misinterpret the figures. The report shows that
spending has been roughly flat in social care, and the last survey also
shows that councils are expecting a small increase in expenditure on
social care next year. The 20% or £2.7 billion that
is often touted by the Opposition in fact represents savings that
councils have made through efficiencies, and that money is obviously
being reinvested in front-line

otherwise have been wasted were saved by investing in social care and
implementing the service transformation that we all require. However,
this is about making all NHS and social care budgets go further, and

about their figures. As I explained earlier, the £2.7
billion—or 20%—figure represents the savings that
councils have made to meet demand, and real-terms spending next year is
expected to go up. The point from the ADASS and other surveys is that
integration works. This Government are investing in integration.

Marsh review before asking his questions, because it highlights a
fundamental, systemic failure of leadership at the ambulance trust
which dates back to the last Government’s time in office. As we
know, the number of NHS managers in the east of England rose by 86.4%
under the last Government, but there was a lack of connection between
the managers of the trust and front-line staff. Government Members are
promoting clinical leadership, and trusting clinicians and front-line
paramedics to deliver a much better ambulance service. I suggest that
the hon. Gentleman should prepare his questions more thoroughly in

the instance she cited at all. It is completely unacceptable if that
kind of thing has to happen. The principle of 111—which is for
people to have an easy-to-remember number and to be able to be
connected to a clinician directly if they need to be, which did not
happen with NHS Direct—is a good one, but it is not happening in
practice as much as it needs to be. We are broadly meeting our
operational standards, but it is not good enough and she has given a
very good example as to
why.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0001.htm#13071683000104"><Member ContinuationText="Miss Anne McIntosh" PimsId="1818" UID="13071683000900" xid="394" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0001.htm#13071683000900"><B>Miss

Hunt:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. Nearly 60%
of people with dementia are in a care setting, but one of the tragedies
is that many of them could continue to live healthily and happily at
home for much longer if they were given the support that they needed.
Often, however, that support does not arrive until it is too late, when
the carer or family member is under too much pressure to be able to
look after them. The dementia diagnosis rate at the beginning of this
Parliament was less than 40%, but our objective is to get that up to
two thirds by the end of the Parliament. Also, we want to
ensure that a proper care plan is in place for the two thirds who are
diagnosed, so that we can avoid the problems that my hon. Friend has

expected—yet they often receive their diagnoses even later than
people with dementia in the rest of the population. Will the Secretary

Committee on Resource Allocation that NHS England received before was
that they would have meant increasing resources to the areas with the

that the number of nurses needed varies from hospital to hospital and

hospitals it already does. The system that we have—this was
supported by the shadow Health Secretary in his evidence to the Francis

we did

a ratio such as 1:8 cannot be applied uniformly across his local

including shots fired at police by dissident republicans. Violence
erupted as the crowd reached the police line on Woodvale road,
preventing access to the route past the Ardoyne shop fronts. This has
been followed by further disturbances and rioting on each night since

I also welcome the inclusion of parading in the remit of the
Executive’s all-party working group and the appointment of the
distinguished US former envoy to Northern Ireland, Richard Haass, to

out in the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. Section 9
states that I can review a determination made by the Parades Commission

those on the streets over recent days taking part in this violence, I

building the case needed for more arrests and more criminal

Bruce judged that none of the 14 hospitals is providing a consistently

professional and geographic isolation, failure to act on data or

openness, a lack of willingness to learn from mistakes, a lack of
ambition, and ineffectual governance and assurance processes. In some
cases, trust boards were shockingly unaware of problems
discovered by the review teams in their own hospitals. Today I can
therefore announce that 11 of the 14 hospitals will be placed into
special measures for fundamental breaches of care. In addition, the NHS
Trust Development Authority and Monitor have today placed all 14 trusts

those 11 trusts, special measures mean that each hospital will be
required to implement the recommendations of the Keogh review, with
external teams sent in to help them do this. Their progress will be
tracked and made public. The TDA or Monitor will assess the quality of
leadership at each hospital, requiring the removal of any senior

Inevitably, there will be widespread public concern not just about
these hospitals but about any NHS hospital, and some have chosen to

best way to restore trust in our NHS is transparency and honesty about
problems, followed by decisiveness in sorting them out. The public need

Today’s review and the rigorous actions that we are taking

NHS exists to provide patients with safe, compassionate and effective
care. In the vast majority of places it does just this, and we should
remember that there continues to be much good care even in
the hospitals reviewed today. Just as we cannot tolerate
mediocre or weak leadership, we must not tolerate any attempts to cover
up such failings. It is never acceptable for Government
Ministers to put pressure on the NHS to suppress
bad news, because in doing so they make it less likely that poor care
will be tackled.</hs_Para>

have today begun a journey to change this culture. These 14 failing
hospital trusts are not the end of the story. Where there are other
examples of unacceptable care, we will find them and we will root them
out. Under the new rigorous inspection regime led by the
chief inspector of hospitals, if a hospital is not performing as it
should, the public will be told. If a hospital is failing,
it will be put into special measures with a limited time period to sort
out its problems. There will be accountability, too: failure in the NHS
should never be a consequence-free zone, so we will stop unjustified
pay-offs and ensure it will no longer be possible for failed managers
to get new positions elsewhere in the

in hand with greater accountability, there will be greater support.
Drawing inspiration from education, where super-heads have helped to
turn around failing schools, I have asked the NHS Leadership Academy to
develop a programme that will identify, support and train outstanding
leaders. We have many extraordinary leaders such as David Dalton in
Salford Royal and Dame Julie Moore of University hospital Birmingham,

our NHS. It was set up 65 years ago with a pledge to provide us all
with the best available care, and I am determined that the NHS will
stand by that pledge. We owe its patients nothing less. I commend this
statement to the House.</hs_Para>

of the trusts examined by Keogh had warnings in place, and it is
shocking that they have been allowed to cut staff to unsafe levels on
this Government’s watch. Overall, seven of the trusts in the
review have cut front-line staff by a shocking 1,117. The great sadness
is that it appears Ministers are in danger of forgetting the lessons of
Stafford, where Robert Francis identified “dangerous
cuts” to the front line as a primary cause of care failures.
Like Robert Francis, Sir Bruce makes recommendations on appropriate
staffing levels. Is it not the case that the Secretary of State can no
longer ignore these authoritative calls, and will he take urgent action
on safe staffing levels in these 14 trusts and across the NHS? Will he
accept that the loss of over 4,000 nursing jobs that has now been laid
bare under this Government is a monumental mistake, while
£3 billion has been siphoned out of the NHS front
line to pay for reorganisation that nobody wanted and nobody

the Secretary of State now take immediate action, working with the

on what happens next, the simple truth is that people watching will
want solutions rather than point scoring. Surely the right response to
the Keogh review is now to accept the Francis recommendations in full,

need to see the regulation of health care assistants. Will the
Secretary of State work with us now on early implementation of the
Francis recommendations? He spoke earlier of a new era of transparency.
If he means what he says, will he now publish the NHS risk register?

the appalling change that was made to the regulation of hospitals. The
CQC was stripped of expert inspectors, and hospitals began to be

identified in Buckinghamshire relating to out-of-hours care and also to
dementia patients, who themselves often need help out of hours. I
raised the difficult issue of the GP contract because, in order to
solve such problems, we need more joined-up care in the community. The

unsafe staffing levels. It must be accepted that the number of nurses
has reached unsafe levels in these 14 hospitals and many parts of the

he act now to ensure that all wards in all hospitals publicise their

we are bringing in—I congratulate my hon. Friend, who is a huge
supporter of Kettering hospital, which he and I have visited
together—is that the NHS in many ways is no different from other
parts of our public services: there are excellent bits and there are
bits where there is poor leadership. What we have to do if we are to
sort out the poor leadership is to expose it and to make sure that the
public know about it and the politicians cannot duck sorting it out. My
hon. Friend’s constituents will be thinking, as a result of
tomorrow’s headlines, “What about Kettering
hospital?” That is why we will have an independent chief
inspector who will go round and tell them how good Kettering hospital
is. However much they love it, he may well find things that need to be

current definition of a victim and survivor in Northern Ireland, and
specifically the definition contained in the 2006 Order, is a matter of
controversy and is not accepted by the vast majority of innocent
victims and survivors in Northern Ireland. Why is it unacceptable? In
every conflict there are two sides, but in the case of Northern Ireland
the previous Government determined that anyone affected by the
troubles, either through the loss of a loved one or through
psychological trauma or physical injury, would be defined as a victim
and survivor. In effect, that means that innocent victims are equated
with those who joined illegal terrorist organisations and went out to
commit murder and destruction in Northern Ireland, and indeed in other
parts of the United Kingdom, because I am minded that not all the
victims of terrorist violence relating to Northern Ireland were in
Northern Ireland. One thinks of the victims of outrages in Birmingham,
Manchester, here in London, in Guildford and in Brighton, where the IRA
sought to murder the Prime Minister of the day and members of her
Cabinet. That was an act not only of terrorism, but of treason under
the law of the United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

reality is that today in Northern Ireland the people who perpetrated
those acts of terrorism, whether republican or loyalist, or of any
other affiliation, if they were injured during the troubles, or if
through an act of their own commission they were subjected to
psychological trauma or physical injury, are regarded as a victim and
survivor for the purposes of the current legislation. I believe that is
simply morally indefensible. It is deeply hurtful to the innocent
victims on both sides in Northern Ireland, because we are talking about
not only IRA atrocities, but those committed by loyalists. The notion
that those who went out with guns and bombs to take innocent life are
defined under the current legislation as victims and survivors is just
plain wrong.</hs_Para>

will give one example. The notorious Shankill bomb was exploded by the
provisional IRA outside a butcher’s shop in the heart of Belfast
on a busy Saturday afternoon. Many innocent people lost their lives
that day as a result, but the bomber, Thomas Begley, was also killed.
Yet under the definition of a victim and survivor, Thomas Begley, who
murdered nine innocent people that day, is regarded as a victim. I
believe that is
unacceptable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000472" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0002.htm#13071683000472">Imagine<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T14:44:51"></hs_TimeCode>

people, are the same as those they murdered and should be regarded as
such under the law. Imagine the outcry there would be in this city. Yet
in Belfast and in my home city of Lisburn the victims have to put up

significant consequences, for example in dealing with the past in
Northern Ireland. A few years ago the Eames-Bradley report put forward
proposals for dealing with the legacy of the past, one of which was
that there should be a recognition payment for the families of those

and survivor, the same recognition payment would go to the families of
IRA and loyalist terrorists as would go to the families of the innocent
victims. Consequently, on that issue alone the Eames-Bradley report

complex supply chains led by a large prime contractor, their
contribution is not always noticed as much as it should be, but they
are an important part of the equation. I will come later to the balance

improved. We have already made significant progress, but we recognise

priority as Defence Secretary has been to establish, for the first
time, a fully costed and deliverable 10-year equipment plan. This has
now been achieved and published. Our armed forces now have the
certainty that the equipment they are expecting has been both planned
for and is properly funded. However, if we are to deliver this
programme consistently and to entrench a better method of working to

best way of ensuring value for taxpayers’ money. However,
sometimes there is only a single provider of a capability we require,
such as nuclear propulsion units. Sometimes the need to maintain
critical national industrial capabilities or sovereign control of the
intellectual property in equipment programmes requires us to place
contracts with UK companies without a competitive process. European

profit that contractors can earn is fixed, but there are few if any
incentives for them to reduce costs. Clearly, this does not serve the
best interests of the taxpayer and neither does it help industry to

Based on his recommendations and following extensive consultations with
our major single-source suppliers, we have developed a framework that
will be introduced through regulations provided for in part 2 of the

exchange for providing the MOD with transparency on costs and the
protections we need to ensure value for money. It will align the MOD

delivery of defined efficiencies, sharing 
<?notus-xml column=963?>the benefits between industry and the

will replace an existing non-departmental public body that has little
power other than to oversee a voluntary framework that can be amended

Government-owned contractor-operated procurement, it is crucial that
defence procurement practices be modernised to serve both the
front-line overseas and the bottom line back home. Both parties agree
that some of the issues that have plagued defence procurement have been
insufficiently tackled by successive Administrations. In all
Governments, momentum on modernisation has been lost. Major projects
such as Eurofighter-Typhoon have grown greatly in cost and have been
delivered years late. The roots of that lay in the late Baroness
Thatcher’s Administration, showing just how far back some of
these issues go.</hs_Para>

reform must strengthen value for money within programmes, with industry

procurement management model must retain parliamentary accountability
for decision making—the point made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:34:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart)—so that
oversight and scrutiny of multi-billion pound contracts is not
hampered, but if possible enhanced. Thirdly, any change in management
model must protect the rights of staff and engage with their trade
union representatives, and finally, the procurement process should be
characterised by talent and skill, with clear lines of responsibility,
proper reward and career structures and a culture of consequences for
those tasked with project management. Within that, military expertise
has to be maximised without a single-service interest dominating
decision making.

Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot), it is important that
the comparison be genuine and be seen to be genuine. I say gently to
the Secretary of State, however, that so far he has failed to guarantee
that the Government will publish the findings of the two
value-for-money studies. I hope they will take the opportunity, today
or in Committee, to commit to doing so. It is essential that
Parliament, industry and our armed forces have full confidence that
affordability is a determining factor in this process, but that can be
achieved only if we have public transparency in the findings prior to a
final decision being made and Members being asked to vote in
favour.</hs_Para>

to suppress it, although he should have recognised that it covered not
just the period of a Labour Government, but the period during which I
was in charge of defence procurement. The report revealed a great many
failings in the procurement process. It showed, for instance, that the
programme was overheated, that a weak interface between the MOD and
DE&amp;S was resulting in poor discipline and very little change

redundancies, not to mention the fighting in Afghanistan and the
withdrawals from Afghanistan and Germany. As I have said, we are asking

In December 2011 the Chief of Defence Matériel set out four
options: first, the status quo; secondly, a trading fund; thirdly, an

and fourthly, the GoCo. We are now down to two options: a

DE&amp;S-plus is not at all clear. The White Paper devotes a massive
four lines to it and does not define it. In fact, so far as I
understand it, DE&amp;S-plus is designed to be unclear in order to be
the basis for a negotiation between the MOD and the Treasury as to the
freedoms the Treasury can offer. In other words, if DE&amp;S-plus can
pay more for its personnel and so attract much needed
skills—more than current civil service terms and conditions
allow for—the GoCo will become less attractive. But how, in
practice, can the Treasury loosen the rules for the MOD without
loosening those same rules for other Departments with similar
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:01:54"></hs_TimeCode>? If the

this decision has already been made—so it is GoCo or nothing,

Committee has asked lots of questions, some of which remain unanswered.
No other country has gone down this route, so this is courageous,

First, if a foreign company is the lead partner within a GoCo, how will
the MOD deal with any conflicts of loyalty that arise? The Atomic

Assembly, and I spoke to many alliance partners in NATO and to Congress
members in Washington. The best that they could say was that Britain
was very brave, that they would like to see whether we succeeded and
that they would leave us to get on with it. Concern was also expressed,
however, about whether they would be willing to share confidential
contracting and technological information. Does the right hon.

am going to divide the final question on this defence procurement issue
into three. We understand that the process of moving towards a GoCo, if
a GoCo is accepted, will be taken in two stages, with perhaps one
domain paving the way to be followed by the rest of defence
procurement. My questions are: first, what will be included in the
first domain? Secondly, how long will it take for the Government to
work out whether it has succeeded, so that the remainder of defence
procurement joins the first domain? Thirdly, how will anybody work out,
within a period of less than 10 years—many of these defence
contracts run for so long—whether this approach has succeeded?
My suspicion is that the success of this entire process will be able to
be judged only in about 2020. I wish it well and, as I said at the

single source contracts, the House will be relieved to hear that I have
not got very much more to say. I am not sure why this matter requires
legislation, because for many decades we have been spending 40% of the
defence budget without legislation. It may be that there is a tearing
and pressing need for legislation or that the setting up of the
regulator is what requires legislation, but no doubt that can be
explained. It is startling that the MOD will be able to challenge a
contract price already agreed between the parties up to two years after
the completion of that contract. I would have thought that would make
it a bit difficult for industry to decide how to invest, but, again, no
doubt the Minister will deal with that in his wind-up.

3 of the Bill deals with the reserves—once again, I declare an
interest because my daughter is one of them. I keep asking this, but I
am told that repetition is no shame in a politician: what plan does the
Prime Minister have to form an alliance with the Leader of the
Opposition and to go out and make it absolutely plain that this reserve
forces project must succeed, in the national interest. It must succeed
because there is no plan B. Much of the plan has already been welcomed
by industry. I think there is a greater job to be done by industry in
saying that this must succeed in the national interest, and by the FSB,
which, as I say, supports it. Some measures in the Bill—for
example, the extra notice for the deployment of reservists—will
certainly make 
<?notus-xml column=978?>things easier for employers. The £500 extra
payment has been welcomed by the British Medical Association, as well
as by the FSB and others. Perhaps there is more to be done in order to
sell this, but the success of the entire process is essential. I
welcome this Bill and this part of it as being in the national
interest, and I hope that the Prime Minister will be able to get out
there and say so
himself.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_16_PT_1/4CB97C65DCAB5DE5A4E41F25F362BC446A46BDD0" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 July 2013">Tuesday

I have spent some time on the Defence Committee, along with the
Chairman and others. We have spent a number of years studying some of
these things, from Governments who have come and gone. Clearly the Bill
is central to our discussion about how we make our MOD efficient, so I
do not approach it from the point of view of opposing change and
reform. This is a debate about how we get the correct reform. On the
question of GoCo or no-GoCo—or “NoCo” or whatever
it is or is likely to be—or “NDPB-plus”, I am not
going to go into great detail, because the previous speech raised many
of the concern. As for the freedoms required in the individual terms
and conditions given to a chief executive of an organisation, who can
pick and choose people and so on, I am a little worried that we should
build structures around individuals, as they also come and go. That
cannot be the only reason for reform, however; there must be
broader reasons for making such a
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:14:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000622" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000622">Let
me deal with the organisation in the context of the rest of the
Ministry of Defence, because the remainder of the Levene reforms must

be procurers. They will not sit on the central board, but they will buy
things from various parts of the organisation, as there will be single
contracts in addition to DE&amp;S requirements. We can make DE&amp;S as
efficient as we like, but we must consider the broader context of
whether changing DE&amp;S will make the whole process more efficient,

personal prejudice—I was glad that the Secretary of State spoke
about where risk will be retained—is that if we are not careful,
a further risk is created by moving things too far away from the

anything goes wrong, it might lack the strategic capacity to direct in
such a way as to change the process. Care needs to be taken about the

Beacons mountain rescue team—effectively became the initial
primary support for the rescue activity. I do not want to get this

substantial foreign element in its running.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:29:36"></hs_TimeCode> reason for

there should be a serious concern about foreign companies or foreign

intellectual property rights—state secrets—and the other
relates to reasons of commercial confidentiality.</hs_Para>

I was working for at the time. I cannot see how the commercially in
confidence question could possibly arise in Aldermaston with regard to
the American companies involved in the management. It simply is not an

Friend mentions, as he knows. The problem is that knowing how a
particular contractor has structured a particular contract, which the
management company must know—otherwise, there is no point in
having it—means that that kind of information must be known to
it, and it is extremely valuable material. He was quite right to say in
his previous intervention that the danger already exists. However, the
only way to produce an enforceable mechanism that deals with it cannot
cover foreign employees who go back to America, or indeed anywhere

main point concerns reserve forces. I strongly support part 3 of the
Bill and the Government’s measures on reserves, and I was
delighted to hear the shadow Defence Secretary give a broad welcome
from the Opposition Benches to those measures. I will not go into the
provisions in the Bill except to say that one or two—special
support for SMEs, for example—are especially welcome, as is
greater protection for employees who are reservists. Instead, I suggest
that the Bill could provide a vehicle for reforms in the governance of
reserves. Such reforms were highlighted in the report by the
independent commission to review the United Kingdom’s reserve
forces, on which I was privileged to serve, as we are a long way out of
line with arrangements in other English-speaking countries.</hs_Para>

looked at three areas of governance, one of which was for transition.
The other two areas were senior appointments, and the role of the
reserve forces and cadets associations and, when considering those two
matters, it is important to ask what is happening abroad. I have
focused on English-speaking countries because there is little point in
looking at countries that have recently given up conscription. The most
obvious example of a country that gave up conscription a long time
ago—France—has gone down a route that Britain will never
follow in having an armed gendarmerie trained effectively as an army
reserve, including a big reserve component of its own. Therefore, the
US, Canada and Australia seemed to the commission, and seem to me
today, to be the best comparators.</hs_Para>

those countries—I say this with no pride at all as somebody who
has extensively visited their armed forces—have consistently
had, year after year, much lower personnel turnover than our reserve
forces, and they often get better turnouts for periodic training. The
National Guard units that I visited in Afghanistan had a staggering 98%
turnout for that operation, and the officer recruiting level of all
those other countries is much higher than in the UK. Reserve forces in
those countries have a larger place in society than our Army Reserve,
and I fully endorse and totally support everything the Government are
doing to expand that role in society. Above all, reserves in other
countries have much more experience than us of deploying formed
capability rather than simply being used as a part-time personnel
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:32:34"></hs_TimeCode>, as has

Stewart:</Member></B> I totally understand and accept
the majority of what my hon. Friend is saying, but to
compare us with the National Guard is somewhat misleading. National
Guard units are often mobilised and deployed 
<?notus-xml column=983?>for long periods of time, whereas our system will bring someone in for
six months’ operations, presumably with three months of training
before and three months afterwards. That is not as long as National

Brazier:</Member></B> My hon. Friend has been misinformed about that.
An impressive airborne cavalry unit that I visited in Kabul was one of
a small number of units that had had the misfortune a few years ago of
being part of the only experiment by the Americans in recent memory of
trying to call people out for more than 12 months. The US has the same
limit as us in the UK and has agreed never to repeat that experiment
because of the painful experience. Such units operate on the same
12-month cycle as we
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000650" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000650">I
do not say this to run down our reserve forces in any way, but when
those forces were used as formed bodies, they served extremely well
despite the handicaps they faced. One thinks of a company of reservists
from the London Regiment, who in their time in Afghanistan were reputed
to have killed 45 members of the Taliban. They got an incredible
endorsement, which I quoted in the House, from their Brigade Commander,
Brigadier—now General—Lorimer. I also think of my own
former unit, which deployed a squadron that got three military crosses.
However, I want to make the point that, in terms of yardsticks, we are
behind the curve. I welcome all the Government’s efforts to move

Brazier:</Member></B> They have almost exactly the same total span as
us—basically, 12 months. Unlike us, they typically do three
months’ work-up and nine months’ deployment—this
is for formed bodies up to brigade level—whereas we do six
months and six months, but it is still a 12-month limit. The
Australians, who have sent a number of formed bodies to Afghanistan, do
three months and three
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:35:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000653" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000653">I
am explaining these points because it is worth looking at the
difference in governance arrangements, some of which we set out in our
commission report. In all three of these countries, the vast majority
of reserve units are commanded by reservists, and the vast majority of
those units are in brigades, also commanded by reservists. The National
Guard has a whole mass of legislation protecting its special status.
Australia and Canada do not have the same legal arrangements, but both
countries have a set of widely accepted customs and practices that work
in lieu.</hs_Para>

brings me to the main point that I want to put to the House. I suggest
that there are four things—two pairs of
things—we can do to redress the balance a little, all of which
build on the spirit of what the Government 
<?notus-xml column=984?>are doing. The first two are about people. Sir Peter Wall anticipated
our commission report with a very good move that has been pivotal in
delivering progress when he announced overnight that he was creating a
new post that has existed since time immemorial in Australia and Canada
and in the National Guard in every state in America—a de facto
commander of the TA in the shape of the Deputy Commander Land Forces.
The Duke of Westminster was the first incumbent and General Ranald
Munro is now doing the job. They are both fine reserve
officers.</hs_Para>

Peter Wall said that that was a tied post, but there is nothing laid
down anywhere to say that some future, less enlightened Chief of the
General Staff, with a selection committee entirely composed of senior
regular officers, and one token civil servant, should not at some
future stage retire an existing two-star general and say “Here
we have a reservist who can do the job.” That is the current
arrangement with the reserves in the RAF. I propose that a list should
be laid down of certain jobs that are tied to people, many of whom may
be ex-regulars, who have for a number of years earned their living in
the civilian world and served as reservists at the same time. The
selection committee should include an outside element, perhaps the
chairman of the Reserve Forces and Cadets Associations or the outgoing
incumbent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:38:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000656" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000656">My
second recommendation on people is that we must address the issue of
reserve primacy for unit-level command. I am not asking that we have
reservist brigade commanders, like all these other countries, although
we do already have reservist deputy brigade commanders. In 2011, a week
before we published our report, the military secretary’s
department broke completely new ground by announcing, unbelievably,
that whereas other countries have 80% to 90% reservist commanders, and
historically we have had 40% to 50%, 24 out of 30 of the reserve
commands were to go to regular officers. I have to say that I was so
angry about this that my fellow members of the commission had more or
less to tie me down.</hs_Para>

subsequent year—2012—the department did something that
was arguably even worse. Although it put the word out that
it wanted more reservists, it applied a de facto reverse quality filter
and made such an unreasonable demand with regard to man training days
for TA commanding officers that most of the people with the best jobs
said, “I’m not putting in for that.” The result
was a great deal of unhappiness with some of the command
awards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:39:58"></hs_TimeCode>. The
generation who will take on those units—the two years between
recruits mean that this relates to almost every Territorial Army
unit—are not necessarily the kind of people who would have been

good news is that the new military secretary is working very hard on
this and trying to sort it out. A strenuous effort is being made to
encourage and develop good-quality people to be the next generation of
TA commanding officers. None of this, however, is laid down anywhere. I
think that TA primacy—which, incidentally, exists in the Royal
Naval Reserve—should be formally laid
down<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:40:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000659" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000659">That
brings me to my last two points, which are on the RFCAs. I was
delighted that the Government adopted in their Green Paper our
report’s recommendation for an annual report from the RFCA
Council on the state 
<?notus-xml column=985?>of the reserve forces. It was right that the Secretary of State saw that
first and I was glad when he published the Green Paper for Parliament.
Unfortunately, it was then suddenly announced in the White Paper that,
rather than having a wider remit, the report should focus on progress
with integration and that it should stop when integration is completed
in 2018. That was not our recommendation. It is after the political
spotlight has moved on that the role of this independent report will be
most

is worth remembering that when Haldane set up the reserves, who served
so bravely six years later in the first world war, he gave to the
County Associations—the forerunners of the RFCAs—a large
part of the budget as well as the responsibility for managing
recruitment, basic training and property. Today the only responsibility
left to the RFCAs is the control of property, which they do vastly more
effectively than the Defence Infrastructure Organisation, with less
than a third of the percentage overhead. They also make use of all the
free expertise available from the people on the individual regional
councils, including estate agents, lawyers and
entrepreneurs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000661" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000661">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:42:30"></hs_TimeCode>
the past 10 or 15 years, the RFCAs have been handicapped in that work
because, despite the fact that they own most of the estate, they are no
longer allowed a free hand to manage it properly. They are constantly
subject to trying to drive deals. For example, in Yorkshire an
excellent deal with a local supermarket that would enable essential
renovation work to take place has been on hold for several years. Now

summary, the word “integration” is at the heart of this.
The Government are committed—in a welcome plan that I strongly
support—to the integration of regular and reserve components. We
have tried assimilation and it failed. The findings of our
commission’s report on an assimilated structure with no separate
chain of command for Army Reserve—in fact, the structure did not
even include a reserve branch at Land Command; it just had a few people
scattered around—were dismal. Integration is about recognising
that each service has a separate ethos. Someone who serves as a
reservist and does something else for their main living has a different
ethos. The White Paper says a great deal about moving from being
service personnel to providing capability—I strongly support
that—but in order to make it work we have to hardwire certain
structures into the system, and I believe that this welcome Bill offers
us that
opportunity.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_16_PT_1/6621597776431985D0ED6F81F88126A9170E14A3" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 July 2013">Tuesday

seem to remember that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:49:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
mentioned it in a telling intervention on the Secretary of State. The
House needs assurance that we are getting the best value possible for
public money. There is a risk that we will focus too much on price
without thinking about value. My hon. Friend raises another important
point on accountability. As I understand it—the
Minister might contradict me, as he will have far more of an
understanding on this than I do—GoCo contracts will be up to
nine years long, subject to performance. However, there is no
opportunity for contract extension. After nine years, a full review of
a GoCo contract will be carried out and put back out to the
market.</hs_Para>

have some concerns about that. First and foremost, the project lead-in
time for defence projects is often decades. If a project is at least 10
years long, how can a nine-year contract provide any degree of
certainty? If a project—whether the development and
roll-out of a new ship or a new fighter—takes 15 years to
develop and is in operation for a further 30 years, where is the
inbuilt institutional memory and stability that allows for truly
effective project management if the contract changes three or four
times? Will that not make a project more expensive and prone to
risk<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:51:01"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000675" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000675">The

part 2, I share the understanding and concerns of the Chair of the
Defence Committee about how the single source regulations office might
put UK companies at a disadvantage. My understanding is that
clause 14(7) allows the Secretary of State to waive the new
regulations from any single-source contract he wishes, but that
overseas suppliers will be outside the jurisdiction of the new
single-source contract regulation. Does that not create an unlevel
playing field, where only UK companies will be subject to the new
pricing and reporting requirements? If we are to have a true industrial
strategy—long-term stability, with co-operation across
Government —how will this help to provide UK companies and their
supply chains with a level playing

UK brand is strong when it comes to defence capability: we are the envy

innovative manufacturing offer. While I strongly believe that the
overriding consideration has to be whether a piece of equipment is
compatible with the objectives of our armed forces in theatre, we
undermine our economic competitive advantage if we fail to recognise
how strong that offer is in the global market. A quarter of annual
revenues in the UK defence sector, some £5.4 billion, is 
<?notus-xml column=988?>derived from exports. However, defence manufacturers tell me that export
opportunities are being lost because some countries are saying in
response to the narrow off-the-shelf approach, “If it is not
good enough for the British armed forces, why should it be good enough
for us?” How will the Bill deal with that, and will the GoCo

7 and 8, which are concerned with intellectual property, have been
mentioned by other hon. Members. The provisions allow the contractor
access to confidential and commercially sensitive information. Our
intellectual property regime is one of this country’s
competitive advantages, with knowledge-based firms feeling that their
invention and creation will be protected in law, yet clause 7 reduces
the restrictions on the disclosure to, and use by, the contractor of
confidential information. A defence firm, highly protective of its
technological knowledge, which might be its unique selling point and
give it its advantage in the marketplace, might be happy to share IP
directly with the Government, especially if it was trying to establish
a long-term relationship. Indeed, I would encourage that. It would also
aid the MOD by providing it with sector intelligence on the pipeline of
technological innovation over the next few years, which might aid
operational planning, and I know the Minister has put in place other
things in that regard. However, a company might be less happy about
sharing such knowledge with a competitor. A small company in the supply
chain might feel particularly vulnerable to the takeover of IP by a
huge contractor conglomerate, so what safeguards will the Minister put
in place to ensure that suppliers’ IP is adequately

hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright) and tempted to tear up my speech
and demolish his instead. I shall resist that temptation, however, save
for one thing: we should be careful what we say about exports, because
often, by acquiring a capability overseas, we can build a defensive
strategic relationship with another country that brings much greater
long-term benefits to the UK. The classic example of that was the
acquisition of the military afloat reach and
sustainability—MARS—tankers for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary
in South Korea, which led to a family of tankers being developed in
consultation with BMT, the excellent British design house, and a range
of equipment being fitted on to those tankers, not just by the British
Navy but by other navies too.
More<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:59:37"></hs_TimeCode>
importantly, however, that deal led to the South Korean Government
deciding 
<?notus-xml column=989?>that they would like a strategic relationship with the UK, as a result
of which, Rolls-Royce got into the marine market there with
its propulsion systems, and now AugustaWestland is sending AW159
helicopters there. Sometimes a short-term decision to buy
overseas—such decisions are often deplored by the <I>Daily
Mail</I>, which does not understand defence acquisition at
all—can actually be the right decision for Britain’s
strategic interests globally and for British jobs, so I advise caution
about that. The South Korean example is a model of how to acquire
capability in the best interests of the country, economically and
strategically.</hs_Para>

parliamentary constituencies to get a sense of their scale, and in this

That is not a huge number. I genuinely believe that what the Government
are doing will help us to recruit some of the specialists we need, as
the White Paper says, particularly in the area of cyber-security.

by following up on the point made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:12:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Mid Worcestershire (Peter Luff), who said that ex-Ministers
probably should not boast about their achievements. I say gently to the
ex-Minister that if they do not do the boasting, there is probably no
one else who will do it on their
behalf<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:12:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000717" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000717">I
think we have been greatly served over the past two decades by a
succession of good, generous and genuine procurement Ministers, not
least Lord Gilbert who so sadly passed away just a few short weeks ago.
The spirit of the debate on both sides of the House is testimony to the
fact that we believe that providing our men and women who serve so
bravely with the correct equipment is an issue on which we should not
make too much of a party political point—although Members will
forgive me, as we are in Parliament, for making some observations in my
speech.</hs_Para>

have a specific question for the Minister, which he may wish to
consider, on the reserves and the territorial extent of the provisions.
The explanatory notes state that the Bill’s scope on reservists
will extend to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man—so, to
Crown dependencies—but do not mention the overseas territories.
It is my understanding that Bermuda and Gibraltar raise TA units, and
it would be helpful if the Minister could explain why the provisions
will not extend to Gibraltar and Bermuda. I know that the Minister is
already thinking carefully about the answer he will give me.</hs_Para>

has been some suggestion that the budget is now balanced, but
unfortunately the Defence Committee’s view has been that as the
Secretary of State has consistently refused to show us the books, we
have no way of upholding that judgment. The Prime Minister—he is
only the Prime Minister and not Lynton Crosby, so he is not actually
running the Government—has said that his preference is for a
real-terms increase from 2015 or 2016, but there is some confusion
about the date he meant. Perhaps the Minister will explain what will
happen if there is no real-terms increase. Will the books go out of
budget? This returns me to my exchange with the hon. Member for Mid
Worcestershire. If the books are balanced only in the event of a
real-terms increase beyond 2015, I am afraid that we shall have another
black hole, whether the Minister likes it or not.</hs_Para>

of a sceptic when it comes to a GoCo, for a reason that the Minister
heard me give only last week when he met members of the Defence
Committee representing both sides of the House. There are three reasons
for the overruns and programme delays that have led to some of the
biggest procurement problems in the last 20 years: those involving the
Type 45 destroyer, the joint strike fighter and the Queen Elizabeth
class carrier.</hs_Para>

is the conspiracy between the defence industry and the services. The
industry wants the work and the services want the kit, so they
artificially drive down the cost that they declare to Ministers for
each project. Surprisingly enough, once the main gate decision has been
reached, the costs start to rise to fairly extreme levels. We also see
decisions being pushed to the right. As was pointed out by my right
hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State, Labour must take some
responsibility—our hands were not entirely clean in this
regard—but it is not a new
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000722" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000722">Secondly,
there is the chopping and changing of programmes. We saw that when,
following the strategic defence and security review, a carrier decision
was changed in favour of a sea variant. After £100 million had
been wasted in 18 months, the new Secretary of State made the correct
decision to return to the B variant, but unfortunately we are where we
are, and, regrettably, the taxpayer is down £100 million.
Thirdly, there is the problem of immature decision making on the part
of the MOD and the services. They do not necessarily understand what
their requirements are in the longer term, and that drives up
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000723" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000723">The
GoCo will not solve any of those problems, but strong ministerial
leadership would help to alleviate at least two of them, if not all
three. I hope that the Minister will explain how the MOD will tackle
the buy-in conspiracies, the chopping and changing, and the lack of
mature decision
making.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000724" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000724">As
was made clear by my Friends the Members for Hartlepool (Mr Wright) and
for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr Havard)—and, indeed, by the
right hon. Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)—the
Committee feels quite strongly about the research budget. We spend only
1.2% of the defence budget on research and development, and not all
that money is going to United Kingdom companies. We are, in effect,
subsidising other nations. The Defence Committee has an
aspiration—it cannot be described as a pledge—to reach a
spending level of 2%, and, crucially, we think that that money should
be spent on UK companies. We must support our own companies, as the
Americans and the French do. We should welcome an update from the
Minister on the progress of, for instance, the remotely piloted
aircraft programme. I understand that Sentinel will not be funded
beyond 2015, and it would be helpful to understand the implications of
that
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000725" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000725">May
I press the Minister to say more about how two programmes will be dealt
with under either GoCo or single source? I will not make my speech
about Trident today, because we shall have a three-hour debate on the
subject tomorrow, but it would be helpful if the Minister could explain
how the common missile programme will be dealt with, in
practical terms, under the new arrangements. I should also like to know
how the joint 
<?notus-xml column=996?>strike fighter programme will be dealt with, given the genuine concern
that has been expressed by our closest ally about GoCo and the new
arrangements.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000726" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000726">I
am slightly disappointed that the Bill contains no provision to tackle
the “revolving doors”. The Committee is concerned not
just about the revelations in <I>The Sunday Times </I>about generals
and admirals leaving on a Friday afternoon and popping up in the
defence industry on a Monday morning, but about the more general
policy. I am not specifically criticising the Bill here, but it would
be helpful if the Minister outlined what steps he intends to take, so
that we avoid this culture and what appears to the Committee to be an
unhealthy relationship between some of our senior military leadership
and the defence industry is tidied

is easy to knock civil servants. Politicians have never lost a vote by
having a go—<I>[Interruption.] </I>Except in Cheltenham, where I
suspect that if a politician knocked the civil servants, they would
probably lose quite a lot of their votes. On the whole, however,
knocking civil servants is not a difficult gig, and successive
Governments have perhaps been guilty of doing that. I think we must
recognise the contribution made by our civil servants, however, as we
would not have a procurement programme or a functioning defence
industry without them. I hope the Minister will say that this is not
going to turn into an exercise in beating up civil servants.</hs_Para>

cannot see anything in the Bill about how the pay and conditions for
those for whom Bernard Gray wants greater flexibility will be set. The
Defence Committee is very concerned that Mr Gray may be seeking to have
the power to set the pay and conditions for his management team without
ministerial buy-in. Will the Minister explain how he will ensure that
there will be ministerial accountability for all the pay and conditions
awarded to Mr Gray and his team? We understand the argument about
increasing competitiveness, but we must not get into some of the
situations that have developed elsewhere, with personal contracts and
off-the-books arrangements and tax avoidance, such as for the chief
executive of the Student Loans Company. Will the Secretary of State
still have to sign-off all individual packages, or does the Minister
expect that to be delegated to Mr Gray and his successors?</hs_Para>

the point about invitation to negotiate, it is my understanding that we
have seen a slippage from July to August. Can the Minister confirm
whether that is indeed the case, and does he understand the concern
felt by me and many other Members across the House in respect of the
aspirational timeline he has set and the possibility that it will
become harder to meet the deadlines? I might not attribute this to the
same cynical reasons as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:22:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Mid Worcestershire (Peter Luff), but can the Minister assure us
that if the date has indeed been moved, there will be no rushing of the
later stages to get us back on

appreciate the sentiment behind the aim of trying to transfer financial
risk from the MOD to defence contractors, but does the Minister accept
that in reality that is impossible, partly because we are talking about
buying kit for our men and women serving on the front lines? The MOD
will have to own and take accountability for those decisions,
therefore, and any slippage or risk will ultimately be borne by the
politicians, not BAE or Babcock or whoever else. I am also yet to be
convinced that there is a practical way of transferring the financial 
<?notus-xml column=997?>risk, because. given the types and the size of the
contracts, in the final analysis the MOD will still have to be the
underwriter for those
projects<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:23:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000731" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000731">I
have asked the Minister this question before, but I did not get a clear
answer, so I will ask again: which country does he hold up as a good
example of defence procurement? We often hear about the bad examples,
but I have yet to hear that there is any good example. Perhaps the
Chinese, for the obvious reason they tend to chop people’s heads
off when it goes wrong? Which country would the Minister hold up as
doing procurement well? The United States has some of the worst
examples of procurement. We need only to look at the Strike fighter to
see that. That project’s costs have increased 100% in the past
10 years, from $100 million per airframe to $191

Docherty:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; he has made
that point about Sweden to the Defence Committee as well. I take on
board the point that he is making about the Saab Gripen. My
understanding is that the Swedes would say that they procure less badly
than us or the United States; they would not say that they were a great
procurer. The hon. Gentleman is probably right, however, and he has
probably helped the Minister to avoid doing some homework. Sweden might
be a reasonable example, although it does not have a fantastic track
record on procurement schemes.</hs_Para>

us bear in mind some of the problems that we have coming down the road,
including the strike fighter. I apologise to my colleagues on the
Defence Committee for having been something of a sceptic about the
whole procurement system. An example can be seen in air-to-air
refuelling. The A-variant of the strike fighter, which the US air
force, Australia and most of our European allies are procuring, uses a
probe and drogue refuelling system, whereas the B-variant and the
C-variant, which we and the US Marine Corps are buying, use a boom
refuelling system. Unfortunately, the two systems are not compatible
with each other, so if the RAF were to win its argument for the
A-variant, it would have to retrofit the Voyager tankers to enable them
to be refuelled. That is an example of the UK, the US and
others not being joined up, and it is absurd that we have got into such
a situation. I shall not rehearse the arguments about the carrier, but
the Defence Committee found that there had been an “immature
understanding” of the decisions on the strike fighter and the
carrier, and that not enough detailed work had been done before
decisions were made. Will the Minister tell us how he is going to fix
that problem?</hs_Para>

on reservists. We have lost those two young men, but in the past we

strengthening the package not only to reservists, but to their

be able to focus on problems that lie in particular professions, where
reservists are having real difficulty in meeting their training and
deployment commitments. Anecdotally, teachers always seem to top that
list, but one would think that that profession would be well geared up
to cope with reservists, given the supply teaching system. I hope the

has been much focus on the issue of reserve forces as the major
challenge facing the MOD, but I would argue that it is tiny in
comparison with the challenges on Defence Equipment and Support. What
we have had has not been fit for purpose; earlier in this Parliament, I
highlighted the case of a frigate that was 
<?notus-xml column=999?>deployed to Libya with no defensive weapons on board. Historically, we
seem to have been incapable of getting what we needed, where we needed
it and in a state in which we could use it. It will be some time before
these reforms come into effect. They are very much needed and I very
much welcome them, but they will not take effect immediately. I hope
that the Minister can provide reassurance that the status quo will not
remain in the interim. We cannot wait for this Bill to take effect for
further progress to be made; we need further improvements now. I very

We must seek to protect our sovereign capabilities and the unique
research, development and supply chain networks so evident in
constituencies such as mine. We need to have a clear vision of what
industrially is in our national interest. We need to consider: what
technology should we be investing in with our research and development
funds? What do we build enough of over a given cycle? What is genuinely
innovative? What kit could we be using in trade deals, for example? To
which countries should we be exporting? Clearly there are countries to
which we do not want to sell particular kit, but it might be to our
advantage, for diplomatic and defence reasons, to sell them naval
assets to protect their oil platforms, for example. Outside the MOD we
need a more sophisticated view on exports.</hs_Para>

the White Paper produced by

subtleties when considering whether to retain particular sovereign
capabilities and focusing on our national interests. We need to learn
from the example of the MARS tanker contract, which he cited, because
although a proposal might seem on paper to be the best decision for the
budget and the procurement process, we must be aware of its knock-on
effects on the supply chain. A number of companies would have found it
difficult to get a foot in the door to supply kit for that project,
including large companies with an export rate close to 50% of what they
produce. We must learn from such experiences and guard against throwing

them to be built in Portsmouth,

and challenges inherent in their service selection and training, and
while we must all accept the necessity of gruelling and
challenging assessment procedures, especially for our special forces,
such processes should never be exempt from appropriate scrutiny by the
MOD and external authorities. I hope that there will be a full and
thorough investigation of the tragic events as a matter of urgency,

wide-ranging

contributing to our operations at Camp Bastion. I have also seen the
work of our reservists at home. I have seen that in Wales in my

preparing for civil emergencies to liaising with merchant shipping and

shall make a few brief remarks about the recruitment of reservists and
in particular the move to a 70:30 split, which is a significant change
predicated on a successful available uplift of the reserve capacity,
while the regular Army, as we have heard from many hon. Members, faces
a loss of 20,000 troops. The uplift is planned regardless of the timing
and the coherence of the two changes and one being contingent on the
other. We should be careful that no gaps in capacity or capability
occur as a result. The Secretary of State admitted in a statement the
other week in the House that many current reserve units remain heavily
under-recruited, which is the justification for closing or
rationalising a number of
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:42:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000757" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000757">From
the details of the strategy, I am not yet totally convinced that the
recruitment levels will meet expectations, particularly in view of the
barriers to bringing reservists in that many hon. Members have spoken
about and despite the measures in the Bill, a number of which are

recruit more reservists and retain them in their employment. There are
measures in clause 44 to deal with additional payments and measures in

announcements have generated a great deal of media interest, which

Friend the Member for East Renfrewshire said, there is evidence of real
concern resulting from those comments, as last year the Army Reserve
recruitment target was missed by more than 4,000. I want more
assurances from Ministers that we will not see a rise in that figure. A
worrying survey from the Federation of Small Businesses has shown that
a third of employers said that nothing, including the measures set out
in the Bill, would encourage them to take on reservists. What
assessment have Ministers made of the impact on some
reservists—hopefully only a few—who might to choose to
leave the service given the changes in the length of deployment and
other changes outlined in the Government’s proposals that might

do not want to paint a bleak picture. I would certainly be willing to
speak to any employer in my constituency who is worried about employing
a reservist and to talk about the benefits for them and the employee.
Nevertheless, we must recognise that there will be a major shift in
numbers and expectations. I worry whether the Government might simply
be over-reaching themselves, which could leave us with gaps in
capability or put stresses and strains on our overall reserve forces

Secretary of State tried to brush off that concern earlier by
describing it as a potential for “lumpiness” in the
transition process, but that might understate the risk. How long does
he expect that “lumpiness” to persist and what exact
impact does he think it will have on capability? As I said, that comes

potential squeezing out of smaller companies in defence supply chains.
I certainly am aware of that from conversations I have had with
companies in my constituency, such as BCB International, which provides
excellent services and products to UK and other NATO armed forces. It
provides a significant majority of camouflage paint and a significant
proportion of survival gear, non-lethal devices and blast-protection
equipment, and it does some excellent and innovative work. I want to
hear more assurances from Ministers that such companies will not lose
out as a result of these changes and that they will continue
to play a valuable and innovative role in our defence supply
chains.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_16_PT_1/DF616AF1FCFFA59127DD9C44C3E68AFA5797EB93" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 July 2013">Tuesday

right hon. Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr Murphy), who is no longer

Member for Portsmouth North (Penny Mordaunt), whose remarks about the
reservists who died recently in the Brecon Beacons were well made. In a
debate such as this it is right to pay tribute to the courage,
commitment and loyalty of all our armed forces, and to emphasise that 
<?notus-xml column=1004?>those who die in training are people of no less courage, loyalty and
commitment than those who die on active
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000768" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000768">This
enabling Bill does not directly mandate the creation of a so-called
GoCo procurement system, and neither does it set the terms of
single-source contracts, the shape of new reserve forces or the plan
for implementing them, as that is done in more detail in the White
Paper. It does, however, give the Secretary of State power to change
defence procurement and the way reservists are recruited and supported,
and I think there is general consensus that such powers are badly
needed, and that particularly for procurement, the existing system has
not delivered.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:52:00"></hs_TimeCode>Let us consider
some of the statistics: average timing overruns of 80%; cost overruns
often 40% over estimate. Bernard Gray’s 2009 report suggested
that we might be wasting as much as £1.5 billion a year through
poor procurement. Clearly that cannot go on, and it is right for the
Government to take tough decisions to tackle the issue.</hs_Para>

does not mean, however, that there are no possible criticisms of the
GoCo model—we have heard some in this debate, and in another
place Lord Lee made pointed criticisms about the possibilities of a
GoCo. I raised in this Chamber the possible complexity of having
various bodies involved in procurement and trying to align it. Those
bodies obviously include NATO, the Ministry of Defence, the armed
forces and eventual contractors, and now we are inserting the GoCo
level into that process. I highlighted to the Secretary of State the
possible risks of inefficiencies and complexity entering the system,
and his reply was good. He said that any structure contains the risk of
inefficiency and waste creeping into the system, and that whatever
structure we create, we must focus on good management and monitoring,
and good assessment of cost effectiveness and management of contracts.
I am sure that is right. It is clear that something has to change, and
the Bill is going down the right path.</hs_Para>

is how single-source contracting has managed to develop on such a large
scale. However, it has created the strange anomaly whereby there is
currently no legal framework regulating defence single-source
contracts, and so we are now putting in place something that will, in
effect, regulate those contracts. I could make a small point about the
value of the European Union on occasion, when we see exposed the
fallacy of the argument advanced by some Members that we are beset by
EU rules on all these issues. In this case, we find that where an EU
rule does not apply, we feel the need to invent a substitute, and I am
afraid that that would be the case in many other examples often cited
in this Chamber.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:55:23"></hs_TimeCode> is
absolutely the right thing to do. I think we all instinctively know
that where there are single suppliers, with no 
<?notus-xml column=1005?>competition and no regulatory oversight, there is a real risk that
uncompetitive results will be the outcome. We must address the obvious
risk in the procurement of single-source contracts, and the Government
are right to do so in this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:55:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071683000773" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000773">Part
3 makes changes to reserve forces. This is a sensitive area to deal
with but it is very necessary to do so. As we move further into the
21st century, the threats that our military are asked to counter and
the demands on them are changing, and we need to look at a more
flexible and light-footed model of personnel. The Government plan by
2020 to change the numbers in the Army from 102,000 to 82,000 regular
soldiers but to balance that by increasing the number of reserves from
15,000 to 30,000 by 2018, with smaller increases in the maritime
reserve and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force, giving us a total reserve
armed forces of about 35,000 people. That is a different model that
will prove more flexible and more cost-effective but make certain
demands as well. If we are to have that level of reliance on our Army
Reserve forces, we need to take some of the steps that the Government
have considered in providing access to and use of the same equipment
and vehicles as regulars, increasing reserves’ training
commitments to 40 days a year, and pairing reserve units with regular
units for training and deployment

might add some ideas such as those put forward by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:57:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North Devon (Sir Nick Harvey) about trying to promote
reserve liability. He has particularly identified the Gurkhas as a
group who might figurehead and lead that process. Automatic reserve
liability for the Gurkhas would send a positive signal that we are
aiming for parity of esteem between the regular forces and
the reserves. We should also be encouraging ex-regulars consciously to
engage with the
reserves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:57:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

to draw attention to work that is being done in a slightly different
context by a company based in my constituency. This may sound like a
shameless plug for a local company, and perhaps it is, in a way. It is
called Omega Resource Group and it is doing interesting work with 1
Rifles based on the employment of veterans, taking ex-regulars and
trying to place them in civilian jobs in a way that makes the best use
of their skills and markets those skills effectively. Although that
might not seem immediately relevant, I think that it is. If we are to
try to increase the demands on employers on behalf of our reserve
forces, employers have to understand even more than before the value of
having soldiers and military people as part of their
establishment.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071683000776" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#13071683000776">Omega<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:59:43"></hs_TimeCode>
has made a very good case for that. It says that there are widespread
myths among employers—for instance, that soldiers have
institutionalised thinking and are incapable of thinking out of the
box. Omega points out that exactly the opposite is true—that
modern soldiers are brilliant at thinking out of the box,
problem-solving, and thinking tactically and differently from the way
that might be expected. That kind of skill, resilience and flexibility
is exactly what we should be trying to sell to employers. We will have
to do that selling job because we will be putting greater demands on
them if these increased reserve commitments are to be successful. We
need to look at companies like Omega and, I am sure, many others that
have experience of military personnel—some will already employ
ex-military personnel—who can help to make a success of the
whole process.</hs_Para>

Bill is a reflection of how seriously this Government take defence
matters and is another significant milestone in Ministry of Defence
reforms since 2010. We have seen improved operational decision making,
thanks to the National Security Council, and the creation of the
Defence Board, the primary MOD decision-making body, which
under the previous Government did not include the Secretary of State.
We have seen the introduction of real-time control of major equipment
programmes in order to stop spiralling costs and delays, and the major
projects review board is taking note of and monitoring the top 20
programmes. A focus on British exports has led to an increase in the
world market share, boosting support for our small and medium-sized
enterprises, and the completion of the long overdue basing review
ensures that Her Majesty’s forces are now represented right
across the Union. We have also developed an exit strategy from
Afghanistan after inheriting a war that had no clear mission, and we
have enshrined in law, through the military covenant, the
nation’s lifelong duty of care to those who serve in the armed
forces. Finally, as has been said time and again, the Secretary of
State and his team have, after inheriting a defence budget in deficit,
managed to balance the MOD’s
books<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:03:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716101000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#130716101000012">Those
reforms continue with this Second Reading debate, which has focused on
two main areas: the way in which equipment is procured, and the
balancing of our regular and reserve forces. It is important to
understand the landscape this Government inherited. I am
afraid that a glance at Labour’s efforts on
procurement makes worrying reading. The majority of the equipment
projects ran over budget, as explained in detail by the National Audit

Friend makes an important point. A concern that dates back
even to those times is that many of those who have been in
charge of procurement have not stayed in their posts for long. Indeed,
the people in uniform who filled those posts would spend six to
18 months on a project and, once they were conversant with
it, would be rotated out and back to a front-line posting or elsewhere,

control. Nine aircraft cost as much as three space shuttles. That was
outrageous spending. When we came into government, we decided to stop

another. That means that every time a missile system upgrade is
required, two complex computer 
<?notus-xml column=1008?>systems have to be reconciled, which makes it far too complicated and
costly to do any major upgrades to the software or the missiles. That

how the costs had ratcheted up. However, the F-16 is now seen as one of
the most successful aircraft in the world, if the hon. Gentleman wishes

cost has now shrunk because the problems have been removed and enough

an intervention, I posed a question on the concerns that I and others
have about a possible clash of interests if a GoCo is owned by a
foreign operator, an issue that perhaps needs to be explored in
Committee. “Off the shelf” has been mentioned as a
possible way forward: instead of procuring ourselves, we could simply
purchase whatever we need. We saw what happened in Afghanistan when
there was a rush to recognise that the Snatch Land Rover was inadequate
for our troops there. We suddenly saw the Cougar, Vector, Jackal and
Bulldog being purchased off the shelf at huge cost to the taxpayer,
until eventually something was found—the Mastiff—that was
adequate for the troops. Going shopping and hoping that we hit on the
right thing is the not the way to look after our troops on the front
line.</hs_Para>

the balance of regular and reserve forces, as I mentioned, I am a
member of the reserves and my last exercise was in Laikipia in Kenya.
Halfway through the two-and-a-half week exercise, we came together to
discuss the future of the TA and its impact on each of us. Round the
table, we had to say what would happen if we were required to break
away from our jobs for nine months. Not one person in my group was able
to put up their hand and say that their employer would be able to grant
them permission to be away from work for that period. I hope we can
pursue this issue in Committee. We need to secure employees’
rights to ensure that jobs can be protected, otherwise we will struggle

to the changing nature of warfare, greater emphasis is now being placed
on stabilisation operations. That has been illustrated in both Iraq and
Afghanistan, where the kinetic phase of war ended quickly but there was
no unconditional surrender. I am reminded of the study by General
Charles Krulak, who described the concept of the three-block war:
soldiers can be fighting one week, doing stabilisation operations the
next and engaging in peacekeeping the week after. Reserves often have
civilian skills that regulars do not have, which can be used for those
peacekeeping and stabilisation roles.</hs_Para>

Today, the TA represents

intended to go overseas, but the first world war changed that, and it
is now used in all sorts of circumstances to provide not just military
but civilian support. The Bill will bring greater job security to those
in uniform, result in more funds for training and provide better
equipment for the reservists. It is fair to say that we owe all those
who serve a debt of gratitude. It is we politicians who put soldiers,

Friend the Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr Murphy) talked about the
background to the need for change and the importance of not
jeopardising the ability of our defence industries to deliver
world-class equipment to our front-line forces. We have to say loudly
and clearly that, ultimately, we have to get this right if we are
serious about giving our soldiers, sailors and airmen and women the kit
and support they need when carrying out their role of protecting our
nation. We cannot cut corners; we need to sharpen up our act. The
question is therefore this: does this proposal cut the
mustard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:20:45"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:20:46"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716101000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0003.htm#130716101000049">Procurement
and the problems associated with it are issues not just for the public
sector but for the private sector. As we have seen, getting large
projects delivered on time and to budget is a problem not just for the
Ministry of Defence but for companies outside. Wembley stadium is an
example. It is neither easy nor straightforward to procure for large
projects and contracts, which is why we on the Labour Benches have been
interested to see the results brought forward by the Chief of Defence
Matériel, based on work started under the last Labour
Government. The Government will also need to convince Members of this
House, the Public Accounts Committee and those outside that they are
capable of negotiating and supervising a contract that will be one of
the most complex undertaken, given past history—a point touched
on by the former Minister,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:21:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Mid Worcestershire. I would add that anything that this
House decides must not risk destabilising our defence industrial
sector, our prime contractors or their supply chain—which is
made up of innovative and high-quality small and medium-sized
enterprises—in a way that might reduce our ability to deliver in
the UK the projects that are vital to this nation’s
security.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Mid Worcestershire waxed nostalgically lyrical about
the Bill. He also made the point, in a non-partisan way, that our armed
forces are currently well equipped. His observations on the Single
Source Regulations Office were acute, and he is correct that the
weighty impact assessment is an interesting and valuable document. I am
sure that the Minister has noted his remarks about the potential
exemptions of foreign companies—as well as the concerns others
have raised—and the need for a level playing field. I thank the
former Minister for his gracious acknowledgement that whatever the
party political differences, we have a shared interest in getting the

the Member for Dunfermline and West Fife for delivering a speech that

Bill. He has been assiduous in his preparation,

jury is still very much out on whether the GoCo approach in part 1 of
the Bill is a panacea. The points made by many right hon. and hon.
Members bear out some of those anxieties. It is vital that the
Committee set up to scrutinise the Bill does so with great care and
attention to detail, because the devil is always in the detail and this
is a very techie—if I may use that term —piece of

channel, too, the French are looking at them with interest—and,
I suspect, with some concern. Indeed, the impact assessment highlights
the fact that one of the key risks associated with the Bill is that our
international partners might not fully accept the proposals. The MOD
itself has acknowledged that although the Minister has received
assurances from the Americans, rumours still abound, so they will need
to be put down firmly in Committee with some evidence to back up the
assertions made. As we know, the Americans have set up a taskforce to

that the safeguards in place are robust and that the taxpayer will not

for funding of the reserves. We have set aside £1.8 billion for
that purpose, which includes the cost of payments to small and

single-source arrangements. The existing arrangements, which are
voluntary, have been in place for 45 years, and do not work. We have
concluded that, as Lord Currie recommended, they should be
given the force of statute to ensure that the contractors honour the
undertakings given under the single-source arrangements. The system
will be policed independently by the new single-source regulation
office, whose staff will be selected by an appointments committee and
whose chairman and chief executive will be recommended by the Secretary
of State. It will subsequently appoint its own staff, and will be
funded jointly by the MOD and the companies themselves. My right hon.

foreign military sales to the United States. They will not, but we

controls the handling of confidential information supplied to the MOD
by contractors under previous and existing contracts. Those will be

detailed provisions relating to unauthorised disclosures and
unauthorised use of the information by the GoCo. The contract will also
include a comprehensive suite of provisions to protect the MOD’s
own confidential information, including new confidential and
security-classified information, which is generated as a consequence of

that the Official Secrets Act will also apply where appropriate to
those staff in the GoCo, who will also be subject to confidentiality
clauses in their own contracts as now. Given all these safeguards, I am
confident that sensitive information within the GoCo will remain within
the GoCo and we will be able to address concerns hon. Members have
raised in that regard.</hs_Para>

of the country are the primary responsibility of Government
and we will make sure they are protected. If we have concerns in that
area, that will be a reason not to select a GoCo route. Given the scale
of activity it is likely that the winner of a competition for a GoCo
will be a consortium. It is highly likely that members of the
consortium will include US companies who have made approaches to us
thus far, and we will ensure that a future GoCo is suitably constructed
in order to protect UK interests. The contracting entity will be
UK-domiciled and UK-registered and we have specified that the
overwhelming majority of the contracts shall be performed in the UK,

hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr Havard) asked about
this. A GoCo contractor would act as agent of the MOD so the principal
risk would reside primarily with the MOD. The risk that would transfer
would be risk of non-delivery, which would form part of the performance
fee of the contractor operating the GoCo. That element would be at
risk, but the principal risk for fulfilling contracts would reside with
the Secretary of

number of points in relation to reserves provisions. Many of these
matters are not properly part of the Bill. I am sure he will seek to
press some of these points in Committee, however, and I will be happy
to discuss them with him if and when we get there. On his point about
whether there should be officers dedicated to reserves and whether they
should hold senior posts, the intention is for the reserves to be more

touched on the need to maintain research and development and asked how
that would work in the GoCo structure. He mentioned the figure of 1.2%.
It is a policy commitment of the MOD to spend that percentage of our
budget on science and technology. Our research and development budget
is somewhat larger than that, however. In fact, we are spending
approximately £1 billion on research and development
within our programmes in addition to the science and technology budget.
It will be an important part of the policy setting, should a GoCo be
the successful outcome, that we should to continue to direct the
science and technology spend and the research and development spend, as
we would for any normal procurement.</hs_Para>

similar to the cost of that referendum on the alternative vote system,

hon. Friend the shadow Foreign Secretary said on Second Reading, any
decisions about the European Union and about an in/out referendum
should be taken in the national interest, and the Opposition do not
believe that such a referendum in 2017, as proposed in the Bill, is in
the national interest. The Prime Minister, in January, chose an
arbitrary date in order to keep his Back Benchers on side.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:50:08"></hs_TimeCode> Bill also
sets out the 2017 date, which does not reflect any realistic timetable
of treaty change, given that the French and Dutch
Governments, and many others, including even the German Government,
have now gone cool on the idea. The Bill sets an arbitrary date that
does not represent a clear negotiating strategy, and I fear it has been
motivated by a desire to paper over the deep divisions in the
Conservative party on whether the UK should remain a member of the
European Union.

needs to be considered carefully in Committee, and when it comes out of
Committee—whenever that is—in several months, it will
need to be properly considered in the House on Report and before it
gets, or if it gets, a Third Reading. There are too many important
questions to be considered for it to be assumed that the Bill should be
pushed through without proper scrutiny and debate. The future of our
country in Europe is at stake. Therefore the House and the country
expect nothing less than the proper parliamentary scrutiny appropriate
for a parliamentary democracy, not a democracy that is undermined by
what a former Labour Prime Minister called a device of demagogues and
dictators, which was quoted favourably by Margaret Thatcher when she
was Leader of the Opposition in the debate in 1975. In that debate she

that Government money will be given to the yes and no campaigns for
this referendum? If it is, that will mean the cost will be more than
£75 million. We can clearly see that, in addition to his point
about whether the referendum will be on the same day as other

vote—yes or no. Will he support state funding for this

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:16:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Aldershot (Sir Gerald Howarth). That has guided our
thinking throughout the passage of the Bill. We have listened to these
arguments and acted. Our amendment to the Public Order Act 1986,
amendment 53, puts it beyond doubt that the discussion or criticism of
marriage regarding the sex of the parties to it shall not be taken, of
itself, to be threatening or intended to stir up hatred on the grounds
of sexual orientation. The belief that marriage should be of one man
with one woman is, of course, mainstream, legitimate and lawful, and it
is explicitly recognised as such by the religious protections contained
in the Bill. Whatever one’s view about the marriage of same-sex
couples, it is legitimate and the Government will protect the right to
express it. I hope that that provides the reassurance that several
right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House have been
looking
for.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716101000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0004.htm#130716101000164">Extending
marriage to same-sex couples changes nothing in respect of freedom of
speech. That is why, in relation to other questions about the operation
of the Equality Act 2010, particularly on the position of employees and
teachers, we are clear that further changes to the law are 
<?notus-xml column=1028?>not necessary and could indeed be harmful in casting doubt where none
currently exists. For this reason, we believe that the best way to
deliver clarity is through guidance to deal with the particular
concerns that have been expressed, not by making specific provision in
the law. We will therefore work with the Equality and Human
Rights Commission to ensure that guidance will be available on how the
Equality Act should be interpreted in the light of this

historically there are many pre-existing discrepancies within the

considerable price tag. Amendment 11 represents a sensible way forward

been debating the Bill, we have been not only lobbied, but serenaded,
most fabulously by the London Gay Men’s Chorus, who sang a
rousing version of “Get me to the Church on Time”, which
we all joined in with, as the Bill got its Second Reading in the House
of Lords. That was a loud and proud, joyous celebration of
love, laughter and marriage. That is the spirit in which we should see
the Bill through its final stages this evening. As a result of this
vote, same-sex couples will have the same recognition and respect from
the state, and the same recognition under the law, for their
relationship and their love. Because marriage is about the ups and
downs, the long-term commitment through thick and thin, so this is also
about the right to grow old and grumpy together under the

the Members for East Lothian (Fiona O'Donnell) and for Cardiff West
(Kevin Brennan) are relevant—not only to the Lords amendments we
are considering, but to the amendments that many people have tried to
make, and certainly from the Back Benches—is that there has been
a debate about what happens in schools and teaching. We know that the
removal of section 28 has been a good thing, which is an example of why
people are wrong to be concerned about the impact on teaching. As the
Secretary of State said, there are many safeguards in law to protect
freedom of religion and belief in these matters, but also to ensure
that we do not discriminate. That is what the amendments and this Bill
are all about.</hs_Para>

want to refer to some of the most significant amendments passed in the

House—as have many others—that we support the principle
of allowing humanist weddings in England and Wales. We know that 2,500
non-religious couples in Scotland every year already enjoy the meaning
and sentiment that having a humanist ceremony can bring to their
special day. Humanist weddings are now the third most popular choice of
ceremony in Scotland. I gather that humanist funerals are also quite
popular in both England and Wales, as well as in Scotland. When it
comes to weddings, we think that couples in England and Wales should be

the Bill was in this place and in Committee, and the Government
originally stated that they would not support amendments that would
deliver humanist wedding ceremonies in this Bill, citing concern about
delaying its passage. We did not, of course, want to delay the
Bill’s passage or to create complexities that might have caused
unintended problems elsewhere. That is why we did not, in the end,

love going to them, but I do not love going to marriages. Marriage is
something that people commit to for the whole of their lives—it
has ups and downs; pain as well as pleasure and beauty—so it is
obviously a very different thing from the one-day fabulous celebration
that we all want to enjoy at weddings. However, I think we have a great
opportunity to celebrate both weddings and marriages—that is
what the Bill is about—and that long-term loving commitment that
two people want to make to each other: to put up with each other when
things get tough, to look after each other through illness or old age.

turn to pension survivor benefits, on which a major amendment was

make some progress towards addressing the remaining pensions
inequalities between same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Measures have
already been taken to equalise survivor benefit entitlements for civil
partners with those of widowers under public sector and contracted-out
schemes, and I welcome that. However, the estimates of the cost of
equalising the remaining differences in survivor benefits have so far
been very wide ranging. Everyone has accepted that the equalisation of
pensions would involve some small and direct cost to private pension
schemes, and the Government have asserted at different stages that
equalising the benefits for civil partners and married couples of the
same sex could result in a wide range of costs, but we have never seen
any breakdown of those costs or of how they are

neither the House of Commons Library nor the National Association of
Pension Funds can provide a list of contracted-in schemes, which means

Cooper:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes an
important point. We also tried to find out through the House of Commons
Library and others how some of the costings produced by the Government
could be calculated. Everybody wants to ensure that the approach to the
legislation and to pensions is fiscally responsible, and we need to
understand what the costs might be, so it has been very frustrating
that we have not had a detailed breakdown that justifies the claims of
large costs. That makes it implausible to many experts that such costs
would accrue. Many experts believe that the costs would not be those
that Ministers have suggested would be incurred at different stages.
That is why it is right to make this progress in the
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:51:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

she really saying that equality should depend on price? Surely we want

agree that it is right to get an assessment of what the costs should be
before making any decision. It is right to get the information, but
unfortunately it has not been forthcoming. Although we have pressed the
issue in the Commons and in meetings with Ministers, including
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:52:05"></hs_TimeCode> Minister of
State, Department for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Thornbury

evidence we need—it looks to many experts as though the proposal
is affordable, doable and will not incur the considerable costs that
the Government have suggested.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:52:29"></hs_TimeCode>The amendment

the right point about the principle of equality that we should be
pursuing. That is why we wanted to see progress made on the

towards ensuring that the costings were set out and we would have the

one partner changes gender will for the first time be able to do so. I
am pleased that the Government have made that concession and have
allowed a fast-track procedure for gender recognition certificates to
take place in particular circumstances, and I am pleased
that the issue was debated in such detail in the House of

given the huge effect that the present situation has on some
people’s lives, it tends not to be considered much in comparison
with the consideration that is given to other issues. The House of

Cooper:</Member></B> We took the view that the amendment to the Public
Order Act was not necessary, because there was already considerable
protection for freedom of religion and freedom of speech. However, we
accepted the Government’s amendment because we were content to
accept a clarification of the Public Order Act, and because we thought
it right to support the Bill. As I have said many times, the Bill is
the product of a great deal of cross-party discussion and compromise on
a number of issues which took place to ensure that progress could be
made.</hs_Para>

Members wanted to see further changes, but I think that there is
already strong protection in case law, in primary legislation and,
indeed, in the Human Rights Act for freedom of religion, freedom of
belief and freedom of speech. Freedom of speech goes in both
directions. Just as the Bill rightly respects and protects the freedom
of belief of those who do not want to celebrate same-sex marriage as
part of their religion, we should support and respect freedom of belief
for faith groups who do want to celebrate it. It is worth reflecting on
the fact that these amendments and these debates show just how far we
have come in a short period of time for LGBT equality. When the Labour
Government proposed changes to the law to get rid of section
28, to end the bar on serving in the armed forces, to end
discrimination in employment, to allow gay adoption and to end
discrimination in the provision of goods and services, each time there
was strong opposition, but now those changes are taken for granted even
by those who opposed them at the time.</hs_Para>

behind. In the Commons 69% of those who voted supported the

Throughout the passage of the Bill, Ministers have acted in good faith
and with good intentions to make it clear that they did not want it to
encroach on religious 
<?notus-xml column=1041?>liberty. In fact, they have given a 100% guarantee
on that. That guarantee has focused on religious premises and the
wedding ceremony. Hon. Members have scrutinised the Bill in Committee,
on Report and in the other place to determine how secure the locks will
be. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:07:07"></hs_TimeCode>Scrutiny has
been carried out by those who oppose the Bill, not by Her

not a single amendment was tabled in Committee to clauses 1 or 2, even

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:07:41"></hs_TimeCode>I
have been involved in the ups and downs of the Bill, and I have noticed
from our debates on important clauses such as clauses 1 and
2, on safeguarding religious liberty and on those who wish to opt in or
out of same-sex marriage ceremonies, that the bulk of the scrutiny has
come from those who oppose the Bill. That includes two thirds of the
members of the parliamentary Conservative party, who did not support
the Bill on Third Reading, with honourable additions in the form of
members of other parties.</hs_Para>

have been raised throughout the Bill’s passage by non-Church of
England denominations, especially the Catholic Church, to which I pay
tribute for its hard work and engagement with those on all sides of the
argument. This is at the heart of amendments 1 and 2. Hon. Members have
sought clarity through tabling amendments in Committee and on Report in
this House and in the other place about the meaning of the word
“compelled”. I pay tribute to the Ministers for listening
to the debate and to the views of the Joint Committee on Human Rights
in this regard, and I am grateful to the Government for tabling Lords
amendments 1 and 2, which properly clarify the meaning of the word.
They allay many of the concerns that have been raised about the
quadruple lock.</hs_Para>

from the main denominations that they are satisfied that the locks now
in place with the additional clarification are comprehensive and will
protect both religious individuals and religious organisations on the
issue of conducting same-sex marriage ceremonies. Those amendments,
coupled with Ministers’ assurances and explanations,
particularly those given in the other place on the meaning of
“compelled”, make it clear that compulsion “by any
means”—those three words will have a very important
impact on denominations on this matter—is prohibited under the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:14:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716112000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0004.htm#130716112000046">Therefore,
as I understand it, any type of detrimental or unfavourable treatment,
any civil or criminal action or penalty, and any less favourable
treatment undertaken by a public authority against a religious
organisation or individual that has not performed, has decided not to
perform or has refused to perform a clause 2(1) or clause 2(2) activity
will be absolutely prohibited. The words “by any means”
are enormously welcomed by denominations beyond the reaches of the
Church of England.</hs_Para>

organisations are protected. The Government’s amendments also
protect them, when they are deciding whether or not to perform a clause
2(1) activity, against 
<?notus-xml column=1042?>challenges—we pressed on these throughout the stages of the
Bill—under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Equality Act 2010,
which has been mentioned, and by way of judicial review or any other
legal challenge on the ground that the religious organisation’s
decision involves the exercise of a public function. I recognise that
the Government have never considered that decision to involve the
exercise of a public function, despite much debate and scrutiny, not
least by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. However, the
Government’s amendments 1 and 2 alleviate the perceived risk and
that has an important impact; it is a real, measurable improvement made
during the passage of the Bill.</hs_Para>

saw progress in the Commons Public Bill Committee, when heroes and

the amendment before us, as the point was made in a considered way that
we needed to clarify the word “compelled”. So I welcome
the fact that we have moved on from that derision. We have moved on
from the swatting away of the amendments that sought this clarification
in the Commons Public Bill Committee<I>—[Interruption.]</I> We
have also moved on from the “Star Wars” theme and the
Jedi knights discussion. I am not sure what theme we need to move us
into this particular passage. The helpful contributions made in the
other place have moved us towards amendments 1 and 2, so we should not
underestimate the movement and progress that have been made. There has

liberty—indeed there is a 100% guarantee—does not just
encompass the walls of a church or religious premises; it goes beyond
that into the public square and relates to people manifesting their

Doughty:</Member></B> It is a genuine pleasure to be able to speak on
such an historic occasion. The fact that we are discussing a relevantly
small, concise and consensual group of Lords amendments shows the
extent of the scrutiny that the Bill has received in both Houses, as
well as the clear will of both Houses at all stages of its passage,
notwithstanding the objections that have been
raised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:18:33"></hs_TimeCode>. Despite
several claims to the contrary, anyone who has followed the debates in
the Chamber or in Committee, or indeed during the late-night sittings
in the other place, will know that the suggestion that it has not
received adequate scrutiny is not
true.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716112000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0004.htm#130716112000067">I
commend the fact that most debates in this House have taken place in a
highly respectful manner, which sends out a helpful message to the
public and especially our young people. I am sorry to say that that was
not always the case in the other place, but I hope that lessons have
been learned on both sides about how to conduct such debates
respectfully and in a caring
manner.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716112000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0004.htm#130716112000068">The
Lords amendments underline the Bill’s fundamental
characteristics of being permissive and protective. The crucial point
is that the Bill will not compel anyone to do anything that they do not
want to do, and religious organisations that do not want to conduct
same-sex marriages will not have to do so. Given the myths that have
been out there in the public, it is important to underline that the
Bill is about permission and that it includes the appropriate
protections that Conservative Members have sought.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:19:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

several points, and I note that he is happy with Lords amendments 1 and
2, which he believes offer additional
protections.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:15:12"></hs_TimeCode> It
is crucial that we understand that. That was the Government’s

we have noted, there have been amendments about the meaning of
“compelled”. I do not think that was entirely necessary,
but if it provides additional assurances and additional protections and
makes people feel more comfortable, that is a good thing. We have seen
important clarification of some technical aspects—for example,
about who can authorise marriages. Particularly in the case of people
of the Jewish faith, important clarifications were provided in the
Lords, which will help with the application of the

illustrates why so many people want the Bill to go forward. The fact
that some people who wanted to maintain their marriage felt unable to

The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

already existed, but if the additional protections please other people
and make them feel more secure, that can only be a good thing. The
comments of Baroness Stowell were important when she said that the
amendments that were agreed do not allow hate speech. There are two
sides to this. We will protect the rights of people who disagree in a
calm and respectful manner, but when that steps over into a different
type of speech, which unfortunately has happened in some of the public

is important to underline again that the protections that come through
this set of amendments are all in addition to existing ones in the
Bill. A great deal of thought went into the Bill and I commend the
Government for that and for respecting and trying to understand the
concerns that had legitimately been expressed, which have been answered
comprehensively. I am glad that the protections provided by the
amendments are on top of the protections in the original text and in
other legislation such as the Equality Act 2010. These things were all
carefully considered long before I came into this place. It is
important that we recognise that. It is not as though there was some
sort of free-for-all or the ability to abuse various
circumstances.</hs_Para>

conclusion, the Lords amendments are the result of detailed, technical

putting in place the final piece of the equality jigsaw referred to by
Stonewall and other organisations. I am very glad that we have reached
this stage. As other hon. Members have commented, it reflects a wider
change that has taken place in public attitudes. Of the many surveys
that have taken place, one shows that 80% of people under the age of 50
welcome the changes and that three in every five people with faith also
want them to go through. I think that reflects how far we have come,

not humanists, particularly since that works in

speak to this important group of amendments to this important Bill,
which is a piece of proposed legislation that rights past wrong. The
Bill will ensure that gay and lesbian residents of Hackney North and
Stoke Newington, and countrywide, will have the chance to marry the
person they love, and for that love to be recognised by the law and the
wider community.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette
Cooper), Baroness Thornton in the other House who helped to steer these
amendments through, Baroness 
<?notus-xml column=1048?>Stowell, and the Liberal Baroness Northover. One remarkable thing about
the amendments is that they represent genuine cross party co-operation
and hard work, and having seen the consequences of them, I know how
deeply grateful the LGBT community is not just in Hackney North but
right around the country for that cross-party work in the other place.
One must, of course, also pay tribute to
Stonewall<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:30:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716112000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0004.htm#130716112000092">Throughout
the passage of the Bill, the Labour party has supported the principle
of allowing humanist weddings in England and Wales, as already happens
in Scotland, and I have urged the Government properly to consider the
practical implementation of that. Every year, 2,500 non-religious
couples in Scotland enjoy the meaning and sentiment that a humanist
ceremony can bring to their wedding. Humanist weddings are the third
most popular choice of ceremony in Scotland, and we are glad that
couples in England and Wales will be able to enjoy the same choice. The
Government originally stated that they could not support these
amendments, but we are glad that with cross-party co-operation, we have
reached a position where the Bill can be accordingly amended.</hs_Para>

acknowledge that in some ways the amendments on consent and gender
recognition certificates do not go far enough, but we have made some
progress. Trans campaign groups interpreted the original Bill to mean
that individuals undergoing gender reassignment and seeking full legal
status in a new gender would have to seek the consent of their spouse
before a full gender recognition certificate could be issued. Following
cross-party negotiations, the Government agreed to clarify the issue of
consent within the Bill, and the amendments make it clear that the
spouse is not consenting to the issuing of a full gender recognition
certificate, but to the terms of their marriage certificate being
changed. The Government also conceded on a fast-track procedure for the
gender recognition certificate where a person who has been living in a
new gender for an extended period, and I am glad to rise in support of
those

incredibly lucky to attend a humanist wedding for the first time almost
two years ago. Unfortunately, I have attended a few humanist
funerals as well. The couple did not feel that a register

hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) that we cannot put a price on
equality. We need to work with the sector, as we did on the issue of
access to public transport for people with disabilities, when there was
a recognition that we needed to give the sector time to make all
vehicles accessible. I remember the furore over the costs. It was said
that it was not realistic or practical. However, when we get into a bus
or a taxi now, we all expect that vehicle to be accessible. Labour has
consistently supported an amendment on this issue and it is great that
the Government now say that we will have a time-limited review so that
we can make progress. The gender of the two people who commit to a
relationship should not affect their rights. The rights within a
marriage should be the same for everyone. I look forward to hearing the
conclusions of that

amendments 42 and 43, which were tabled by the Government, demonstrate
that the Bill will have consequences that some of us had not foreseen.
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff South and Penarth, who is no

through a gender transition, it is important that that fact does not
change the value, authenticity and worth of the marriage. Such couples
should remain in a marriage if they wish to do

amendment 53, on freedom of expression, is important. It has been the
mission of many of us to ensure that this important step forward on
equality also protects religious freedom. In making it clear that mere

speech in relation to the offence of incitement of hatred against
homosexual people. However, when phrases such as “aggressive

are merely offensive, but that does not absolve those who use those
words of causing that offence. If my hon. Friend and others are calling
for freedom of expression and not to be prosecuted—as they
should not be—for merely criticising activity or conduct, they
have a responsibility to use words carefully that do not cause grave
offence to a considerable section of the community. It would be
considered intolerable to talk of aggressive blacks or aggressive Jews.
Perhaps even my hon. Friend would not consider it acceptable to do

Gilmore</B> (Edinburgh East) (Lab):</Member> Many of my constituents
contacted me who support humanist weddings but were disturbed when they
thought they were going to drop out of the Bill. I know the Government
were concerned they might be a diversion and so delay the Bill, but I
am pleased that, after discussion and debate, they have been included.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:59:36"></hs_TimeCode> am marginally
amused, however, that the amendment asks for a review, given that I
have sat through several Bill Committees recently in which the

rather than immediate action, and for somehow wimping out. Perhaps a
review is appropriate if there are concerns about the mechanics of how
something will work.</hs_Para>

they had been available when I got married—more years ago than I
care to recall. At that time, if someone was not
religious—I belonged to a family that was strong, but
not religious—the choice was a simple registry office ceremony
or, for some, to pretend to be religious. Humanist ceremonies, whether
for weddings or other periods of life, offer something more profound
that reflects upon our humanity and our connections to each other.
Humanist weddings give people the opportunity to celebrate their love
and commitment to each other, while, in sadder circumstances, humanist
funerals avoid that vague religious feeling that might be totally
meaningless to the family and which might have meant nothing to the
person who died. It is the same with weddings.</hs_Para>

a cursory examination of the amendments made in the other place

amendments 1 and 2, which tighten up the quad locks that are meant to
stop Churches doing same-sex marriages. We were told repeatedly in this

we live in, when declaring one’s support for the Marriage Act
1949, under which most of us were married, could be deemed to be
stirring up hatred. Indeed, such is the risk that we have to legislate
against it. I hope that amendment 53 has some read-across to the
offences in section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 and other offences
with a much lower threshold than “homophobic incitement”.

“balanced”—a word that Ministers themselves have
used. I am sorry, but the view of the Catholic Church and other
Churches on marriage is not “balanced”; it is a view. It
is the view that marriage is between one man and one woman for life. It
is not a balanced view; it is a view, and increasingly a

Equality Act 2010, anything could happen. It is like an experiment with

particularly for those with no religious beliefs who do not really wish
to engage with such beliefs at those sensitive moments. Councillor
friends of mine, instead of going to a civic wedding ceremony in a
chapel or a church, decided to have a humanist ceremony, which was more
in keeping with their beliefs, much more honest and less hypocritical
than using a chapel simply for the day of that civic ceremony. Humanist
marriage ceremonies fall exactly into that category—offering an

amendment 11, it is worth revisiting why the pension inequality has to
be addressed. The inequality between survivor benefits of civil
partners and married couples is simply not sustainable, but it is worth
repeating that this issue relates to contracted-in schemes. The key
point is that for a man or woman in what some would call a traditional
marriage, the pension rights in the event of the partner’s death
go back to the date the pension scheme was joined. If, however, someone
is a surviving civil partner, even though the partner might have been
in the scheme for 20 years, the pension rights go back only to the date
when civil partnerships became law. I must point out that this is not
just a fractional difference. In the example of John Walker, his civil
partner would get a surviving pension of £500 a year. If the
civil partnership were dissolved and he married a woman, she would be
entitled to £41,000 a year in the form of a widow’s
pension. That discrimination is simply not
defensible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:09:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716112000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0005.htm#130716112000170">The
important message to remember is that although survivor benefits are
currently unequal, contribution rates are not. Two men—one
straight, one gay—both pay in at the same contribution rate. If
their contribution rate is not determined by their sexuality, why
should their pension be?</hs_Para>

bottom line is that if contributions are equal, pension benefits should
be equal too. I welcome the review, because we can get to the bottom of
how the figures were determined. As has been mentioned before, neither
the Library nor the National Association of Pension Funds can help to
identify the schemes. We do not know where the figure has come from.

drainage lines either extending east out of Wales or to the ports;
further that Wales is already greatly more than self sufficient in
electricity generation, producing at least twice more electricity than
what we use but most of this is given to the UK national grid and then
sold back to us; further that future renewable energy projects for
Wales show that we could be easily producing at least four times more
than we use if we realised basic achievable renewable energy projects
(including tidal lagoons and the Severn estuary instead of a barrage)
and this without even mentioning the possibility of clean coal and
methane gas extraction, which could make this figure higher again;
further that joining the currently unconnected electricity lines could
be done with specially designed pylons that blend in with the Welsh
environment, by underground cables or by placing undersea cables in
Cardigan Bay and this would mean that all of Wales’ energy
production is quantifiable and our abundant excess energy can be
exported and providing potentially thousands of new

debate before the summer recess, as it provides us with a timely
opportunity to consider the future of the fishing industry in the
United Kingdom. Last month, the Minister provided details of the agreed
reforms to the common fisheries policy, which provides the framework
within which fishing in the UK will be administered over the course of
the next few years. Its provisions are generally welcome, though its
success will depend on how domestic fisheries are

Wednesday in the High Court, Mr Justice Cranston delivered an approved
judgment that will pave the way for the introduction of a new system of
management that could be fairer and more environmentally friendly than
its predecessor and that could provide an opportunity to reverse the
fortunes of many fishing communities around the British isles. That is
good news, although I sense that the path to this promised land will
not be an easy one to travel
along<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:28:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716112000237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0005.htm#130716112000237">My
interest and concern are for the inshore fleet that fishes out of
Lowestoft in Suffolk, in my constituency. Like so many other fleets, it
has had a raw deal in recent years. The Lowestoft fleet, which is a
pale shadow of its former self, used to dominate the local economy. A
significant contributory factor to its decline has been the way in
which fishing quotas have been allocated in recent years. It is not
possible to turn back the clock to the town’s glory years, but
there is an opportunity to build an industry that can play a role in
bringing back prosperity to an area that has struggled in recent
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716112000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0005.htm#130716112000238">It
is important to state at the outset that the Minister has achieved an
enormous amount in the three years he has been in post. He has
negotiated hard in the CFP reforms and delivered a settlement that is
good for the UK. He has also listened to the concerns of the inshore
fleet and made proposals to address those in the face of opposition
from the producer organisations. His Department then defended this
decision staunchly and successfully in the High Court. We owe him a
debt of gratitude, for we have arrived at a position where we can
provide a new beginning for the fishing industry in the UK. As Charles

appropriate to say a bit about the inshore fleet and the under-10 metre
boats—about the people involved and the situation they find
themselves in today. Such boats comprise more than 77% of the UK fleet
and employ over 65% of the fleet’s total work force, yet they
currently receive only 4% of the total quota available to the UK. What
is good for the under-10s is largely good for the ports in which they
are based, and vice versa; they have considerable potential to deliver
economic, environmental and cultural benefits for their coastal
communities, many of which are among the most deprived in the country.
They are also good for fish stocks, as theirs is a low-impact,
sustainable form of fishing. Moreover, the income they generate is
likely to stay in  
<?notus-xml column=1069?>these communities and permeate down the supply
chain, which has invariably been built up over many decades but which
has been much eroded in recent
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716112000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0005.htm#130716112000240">Today,
that is very much the case in Lowestoft. It now has a small industry,
but the infrastructure is still there and with the right policy
framework it can deliver more for the area. The work of these fishermen
still fishing out of Lowestoft should be contrasted with that of the
eight affiliated vessels in the Lowestoft Fish Producers Organisation,
which are all controlled by fishing interests based in the Netherlands.
Those boats have UK fishing licences and hold British quota, but they
contribute nothing to the local economy. Dutch-controlled vessels
fishing British quota boast an annual turnover of £48
million, yet 1% of the fish they catch is landed in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716112000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0005.htm#130716112000241">In
recent years, the under-10s have had a raw deal and in the
Minister’s own words they have been “hanging on”
by their “fingernails“. The root cause of their plight is
the fixed quota allocation system introduced in 1999. As the under-10s
did not keep records of their catch in the 1994 to 1996 reference
period, the quota they received at that time was a best estimate,
subsequently shown to be a major under-assessment, for which they have
been paying ever since. Although there have been attempts to address
the situation, as Jerry Percy of NUTFA—the New Under Ten
Fishermens Association—has pointed out, with the under-10s
starting from such a low level of quota in the first place, an
additional percentage based simply on past allocations will be of
little, if any, use.</hs_Para>

the situation has got worse in many respects. The way the
system was devised has meant that the producer organisations have been
able to hold or acquire fixed quota allocation units, knowing that they
could retain them if they did not use them. They could sell or lease
them to the under-10s on their own terms, at their own whim and fancy.
That conjures up the image of the under-10s taking on the role of
Oliver Twist holding out the bowl for more food, only to be denied.
Moreover, where reallocations have taken place, they have been
profoundly unsatisfactory, as they have been neither permanent nor
predictable, and they have invariably taken place towards the end of
the fishing season.</hs_Para>

decommissioning scheme simply exacerbated the problem, creating more
“slipper skippers”, with vessel owners entitled to retain
the fixed quota allocation units even when their vessels had been
decommissioned. A system has, thus, developed whereby the under-10s do
not have enough quota to make a living and are in effect dying a slow,
lingering death, while quota held by the producer organisations was not
being used, and attempts by Government to encourage gifts of unused
quota have invariably come to nothing.</hs_Para>

Minister, to his credit, tried to impose a modest redistribution of
unused quota, which equated to 0.1% of the fixed quota allocation units
in the UK. He sought to be reasonable and conciliatory to POs in doing
that, and when representations were made against his proposals, he
reduced the number of realigned units from 10,494 to 7,901. Despite
that, the producer organisations took the view that the
Government’s proposal deprived them, without compensation, of
what they viewed as a valuable entitlement, even though it
was minimal and, in effect, represented quota that was not
being used. They therefore launched a judicial review

did not constitute interference with, or deprivation of, possessions,
as the producer organisations had contended. He also expressed the
opinion that the producer organisations and their members have no
proprietary interest in the fishing stock itself, and that fixed quota

on the response from Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s Fish Fight

as the support of fishing communities from all around the UK, and it

well as setting out the courses for the elimination of discards and the
introduction of a decentralised management system, also has
the requirement for member states to allocate fishing quota taking into
account environmental, social and economic considerations. This
provides the framework for root and branch reform. I urge the Minister
to pursue such a course and, as the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
Committee recommended in its 2011 report, to base these reform
proposals on the needs of the inshore fleet, rather than on the
existing patterns of work of the offshore fleet. DEFRA should identify
those stocks and areas where a re-alignment of quota allocation would
be of real benefit to the inshore

prevent the problems of the past recurring, there is a vital and urgent
need for transparency. As a high priority, it is important that a
publicly accessible register of quota allocations and transactions is
published as soon as practicably possible. I would welcome an update
from the Minister as to the progress being made in providing that by
the end of the year, as has previously been stated. Without a clear
register, it is incredibly difficult to see who is benefiting from the
nation’s fish resource and to work out whether it is being
properly shared out so as to get maximum social benefit. Such a
register should establish what proportion of quota is currently held by
non-fishermen. It would, I hope, at least dispel the urban
myth that has grown up that football clubs hold quota. I urge that
consideration be given to introducing a requirement that in future
quota should be held only by active fishermen.

Friend the Member for Waveney (Peter Aldous). His constituency might
have a much diminished fleet, but he is a worthy champion of it and has
stood up for it on many occasions. Having visited Lowestoft’s
fishing industry with him, I have seen at first hand his passion to see
it return to economic viability—to flourish, as he puts
it—and to protect it from the complications of a system that has
failed it, failed the marine environment and failed the coastal
communities on which it
depends<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:45:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307177000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0005.htm#1307177000002">I
was of course pleased that the judgment in the judicial review between
the UK Association of Fish Producer Organisations and my Department
went in our favour. That completely vindicates the decision I took in
2011 to realign consistently underutilised quota from producer
organisations and allocate it to those able to fish it. I agree with my
hon. Friend that we are not talking about a huge amount of quota, but
we have won on a key point of principle. I entirely agree with the
view, commonly held across the House, that we are talking about a
national asset. It is my Department’s job to allocate fishing
opportunities in this country in as fair a way as possible. The
judgment might still be subject to an appeal, but I will set out what I
intend to do to ensure that we can maximise the value of our fishing
quotas and the sustainability of the fleet while 
<?notus-xml column=1073?>guaranteeing the transparency and accountability of those who have
access to this priceless public

projects being undertaken by different stakeholders. Work to finalise
the reallocation of the fixed quota allocation units had been put on
hold pending the outcome of the judicial review. That work will now
proceed to allow the transfer of units from producer organisations to
the under-10 metre English pool. I encourage the industry, particularly
producer organisations, to support that work. I entirely endorse what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:47:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

previously updated the House on 17 June 2013 on the vital progress to
secure radical reform of the common fisheries policy. I do not
underestimate the challenges fishermen will face as we adapt to the new
provisions, especially those relating to the discard ban. We are
already working with the industry in the UK on a range of projects,
including catch quotas, more selective gears and the identification of
discard rates in our fisheries, to ensure that we can make the new
system work effectively for the whole fleet. However, the deal that has
been agreed—to introduce a ban on discards, manage our fish
stocks sustainably and manage our seas on a regional basis—will
benefit all of our fleet, large and
small.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307177000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0005.htm#1307177000005">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:48:30"></hs_TimeCode>
long last our fishing industry will be able to have some certainty as
to its future. Although the introduction of a ban on discards has taken
the headlines, the requirement to manage our seas to maximum
sustainable yield by 2020 is perhaps the most significant element of
the reform. When we look back on this period, perhaps in a decade or
two, we will see that as the really big win in returning our seas to
sustainable harvesting of wild fish. Fishermen will have certainty over
the future of the stocks they fish and depend on.</hs_Para>

part of a package of measures to reform domestic fisheries, my

group of fishermen from Ramsgate. I pay tribute to
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:49:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for South Thanet (Laura Sandys) for her support for that

her constituency—just as

purpose of the scheme was to give a group of inshore
fishermen some quota from the under-10 metre pool and for them to
manage it themselves. The scheme ran from 1 June 2012 to 31 May this
year, and has been extended in response to calls for the pilot to
continue from the National Federation of Fishermen’s
Organisations, and the Ramsgate fishermen group. It will now operate
until 31 December with 
<?notus-xml column=1074?>support from the Fish Producers’ Organisation. The group will
have full management control over the quotas it has been
allocated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:50:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307177000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/debtext/130716-0005.htm#1307177000008">The
project demonstrated key benefits such as more flexibility and greater
certainty in fishing activities that supported better business planning
and efficiency. The group preferred the management arrangement under
the pilot, which was reflected in its request for it to continue. The
offer by the FPO demonstrates the willingness of producer organisations
to help the inshore fleet, which is a welcome development. By working
together, different sectors of the industry can bring about initiatives
that help maximise their catches, get better value for their fish, and
promote a common interest in managing those resources effectively. The
outcome of the pilot will be used to help us determine ways in which we
may seek to manage the inshore fleet, and the quota available to it in
the future.</hs_Para>

for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is currently funding an
activity-based research project piloting a community supported fishery
approach on the south coast. Under that project, communities in
Brighton and Chichester have formed co-operatives through which local
fishers supply weekly boxes of fish directly to subscribing members. As
well as testing the appetite for consumers to work with their local
fishers in that way, and sharing both the risks and benefits faced by
the fishers, the project also provides a mechanism to create a market
for underutilised or discarded fish
species<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:52:07"></hs_TimeCode>. The
project is due to finish at the end of July, but the co-operatives and

publish that register by the end of 2013. The public have a right to

other organisations for their efforts in helping to secure a bright
future for the nation’s fisheries resources. The Marine
Stewardship Council has launched phase 3 of its Project Inshore
initiative. The purpose of the project is to assess all inshore fish
stocks in England and Wales so as to determine their preparedness for
certification. The aim is not to seek certification for all stocks, but
to produce a road map outlining the status of the fisheries in order to
develop best practice so they can be managed sustainably. That is a
timely project, supported by a range of stakeholders such as Seafish,
NGOs and retailers.</hs_Para>

the Future is another initiative that focuses on the viability of our
fishing communities and the sustainable use of fish stocks.

the industry.</hs_Para>

task now facing us is a challenging one. Let us not run away from that
fact; it is well understood by the fishing industry and by everybody
who minds about the health of our seas. It is important that we all
work together to grasp the opportunities provided by CFP reform and
other initiatives. I hope that now that the court case is behind us we
can all work together to make sure that we have a meaningful future for
our fishing industry. Let us not hide from the fact that there are many
fishers in the over-10 metre sector as well as the under-10 metre
sector who have found life next to

cannot guarantee that people will be able to walk across Hamilton dock
in Lowestoft in the way that they could in the past. It is possible,
however, that people will see that this is a business they want to go
into and can manage in the same way that any other small business can
be managed. However, they can do so only if there is a rising biomass
of fish in the sea. Our overriding determination must be to ensure that
fish stocks increase, and then the fishing opportunities that we
allocate as fairly as possible can be of much more economic benefit to
fishermen fishing in harmony with
nature<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:56:40"></hs_TimeCode>. In

have heard it before before. I had that feeling when I heard of the
latest strengthening of national Parliaments within the European Union

stage I decided to break one of my basic rules: over the years I have
never taken part in an EU debate without saying something that I have
not said before. I recommend that practice to others, but on this

again, the role of national Parliaments is essentially being used as a
fig leaf to hide accountability for decision making at the European
level. The fig leaf is being used by national Governments, and we
should not fall for it. I had a feeling of déjà vu 10
years ago, when I went to the Convention on the Future of Europe. One
of the five working groups was on the role of national Parliaments, and
an old hand sidled up to me and said, “Remember the dud they
sold John Major?” I said, “No, I don’t remember
the dud they sold John Major.” And the old hand said,
“Well, during Maastricht they introduced the concept of
subsidiarity and proportionality, which was supposed to appease the
national Governments. There was also then a review of competences
across Whitehall.”</hs_Para>

was funny—I thought I had heard that before. The dud they sold
Major was on the principle that national Parliaments should be given a
role on policing subsidiarity and proportionality—the Convention
on the Future of Europe was in 2002 or 2003—so I said,
“When has the principle ever been invoked?” I was then
told that it had been invoked only once, during the British presidency,
when there was the bright idea that we wanted to standardise the water
temperature for sea lions in zoos. That was a step too even for Britain
and was deemed to be out of order on the principle of subsidiarity and
proportionality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T09:32:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071668000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071668000010">Subsidiarity
and proportionality are being chucked at an interesting case that is
currently going through—the representation of women on company
boards. I find that quite extraordinary. The rights of women are now

bit of history. In 1994, after Maastricht, national Parliaments were
supposed to come to the rescue; and in 2002-03, they were supposed to
come to the rescue again with a card system of yellow cards, red cards,
vetoes and all those kinds of things. Yet again,  we hear that
national Parliaments are supposed to be strengthened, but in this place
we are talking less about Europe than ever before. Previously, a small,
select group of people would gather on Wednesdays ahead of a European
Council meeting, and occasionally we would tell each other something
that we had not said before. We considered the programme of the
European Council. There were afternoon debates, and Ministers had to
tell the Commons what was about to happen. Regularly, on the following
Monday, the Prime Minister would give a statement on the results. Some
Members will remember that we used to have great fun at those
pre-Council meetings, because the Danes would usually have published
the Council conclusions on their website ahead of the Council meeting.
We made fun of that, but at least we talked about
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071668000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071668000012">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T09:34:44"></hs_TimeCode>

deemed to be Back-Bench business. I spent three consecutive Thursdays
complaining  about that to the Leader of the House, and I kept
getting the same answer—that it is part of the Wright
recommendations. We have overturned other parts of the Wright
recommendations, so why are they suddenly sacrosanct? On top of that,
the Prime Minister did not give a Council statement back in June
because he said it was so boring, and he has combined the subsequent
Council statements with hefty, serious foreign policy statements on
other issues. The last Council statement was combined with a statement
on Afghanistan. Both issues would have deserved a statement in their

would really improve national Parliaments? I am caught between a rock
and a hard place, because  I do not want national Parliaments
to become separate institutions within the architectural framework of
the EU. The EU has the Commission and the Council, but national
Parliaments provide the majorities to form the Governments that send
Ministers to the Council. There is, however, a little-known
organisation that is known only to those who have been to some of its
meetings—COSAC, which is the conference of European scrutiny
committees<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T09:38:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071668000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071668000018">Ten
years ago, I was trying to broker a deal in that working group between
national Parliaments so that COSAC would be strengthened in the red and
yellow card system, but for that the MEPs would have had to leave
COSAC. It is difficult for COSAC to arrive at a decision, because there
are, say, four representatives from each country, two from the
Government and two from the Opposition. If there is a coalition
Government, in our case the representatives could be a Tory, a Lib Dem
and two Labour Members, so there are probably three views among the
four representatives. Consensus then has to be reached across 27 or 28
countries within extremely tight time limits. What then happens is that
MEPs are the only people who are sufficiently united in their view and
who caucus—they are usually united in the view that the European
Parliament is good and national Parliaments are bad. The card system
will not work unless the national Parliaments that exercise the veto
have a network to talk to each other. If that network has an in-built
number of MEPs who can outvote the national parliamentarians, it simply
will not work. I do not know whether it is possible to change the job
that COSAC does in such a way, but we will

matter. We need to decide what we think the role of national
Parliaments is. Is it only to scrutinise? If so, we need to widen the
base so that more Members take part more regularly. Or is it to get
Governments to change their decisions at times? I think that it
needs  to be the latter, but a number of things have to happen
to allow that. Early information is key.</hs_Para>

information about how people actually act in the Council of Ministers.
I have sat in the Council of Ministers, and I know that there is rarely
a vote. If there is, it is seen as a failure by the civil servants that
they have allowed the situation to arise. They do a head count to see
whether they have a qualified majority, and if they do not think they
will get the decision they want, they give in gracefully.</hs_Para>

to what really needs to change. We need a proper Europe Minister. That
is not to cast any aspersions on the current Europe Minister, but the
position is a fallacy. Why are matters involving the European Union,
which deals essentially with domestic legislation, placed in the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office? Numerous Governments have tried at
times to get the Europe function out of the Foreign Office. From what I
gather, the trade union of Foreign Office Ministers usually gets
together and it does not happen, but there is a question to be
addressed there.</hs_Para>

Minister is in the Foreign Office and makes decisions and strikes
bargains regularly, they might say, “There’s an idea here
that affects agriculture on which we want some compromise”, or
it might be on cigarette advertising, the working hours of junior
doctors or any number of issues on which we can get a deal. Such deals
are struck across various Departments. At that level of political
bargaining, the House has no ability to scrutinise, take a role or even
know what happens. We are simply given the end results. A Europe
Minister should have accountability for our permanent representative in
Brussels, UKRep, which does all those dealings, and be answerable to
the House of Commons for the bargains struck. There was a stage when a
previous Prime Minister, Tony Blair, seriously envisaged such a role,

the outcry: “You can’t politicise UKRep!” I am not

could be a regular slot for UKRep representatives when they come on a
Friday to brief Whitehall Departments about what they have done. They
could stay until the Monday morning or come on the Thursday afternoon
to give evidence. If we do not want to do it at the civil service
level—actually, I would rather do it at the political

that happened during the convention was the Iraq war, which meant that
people’s attention was rightly drawn to other things. However,
as I was representing national Parliaments and not the British
Government, I had access to the Departments across Whitehall in a way
that even a Cabinet Minister probably never has.  I had a
snapshot of what was happening in various Departments at any given
time, and then I saw how people negotiated and traded things.</hs_Para>

nothing wrong with that, but if we do not know what deals are being
struck, we can neither approve nor disapprove. What happens is not
uniquely British: every Government comes back with a success that they
regard as an ultimate success for their own negotiating position, and
think that they have shown all the others how they have failed.
Anything that they do not like, they blame on the European Union. We
will never be at ease with the decision-making process unless we

we do not like; there is no cognizance of the things that we do

come within the single market rules. There was a reference to how often

answer came back that the information was not available. The Foreign
Office felt that it was not its job to answer for the European Union,
but as an MP, I had no means at that stage to go further and find that
information. Similarly, the Dutch had not fully signed 
<?notus-xml column=174?>up to that agreement. When I tried to find out why, I was told that that

subsequently got off its high horse and accepted the

of the card system, however, perhaps the British Government will
consider discussing with the Commission the idea of a delete button for
legislative proposals. When we have a general election and the
Government go, so do their manifesto commitments and legislative
proposals; the slate is wiped clean. At the European level, there is no
such delete button. Proposals that are not agreed in one parliamentary
session, simply refuse to die. A classic example of that is the

Negotiations on the working time directive started in the ’90s,
with legitimate concerns about lorry drivers driving for too long, and
so on. It was not until 1999 that I ended up trying to negotiate on
opt-out for junior doctors, because we could tell that the working
hours requirements would mean that the increase in doctors, which the
Labour Government was bringing in, would be totally consumed in the
first few years. We wanted the directive to be phased, but we then had
court judgments that extended it even further. The political impact of

thing that they really loved about the European Union and one that they
would get rid of tomorrow if we could. The group was half Germans and
half Brits, and to my absolute astonishment there was a consensus
around the table that the one thing that we should get rid of was the
European Parliament. Then I realised the real difference between the
Germans and the Brits. We talked about the connection never being made
and how a double mandate was the way to link things, but for the
Germans the double mandate was to use some MEPs as national MPs, while
for the Brits it was to use some nationally elected parliamentarians at

must look at the workings of the European Parliament. It will simply
not do that our contact with it is getting less and less. With the
closed list system, fewer and fewer people know who their MEPs are. The
relationship is not only fractured, but virtually non-existent. I am
interested to hear what the Minister has to say even about some basic
things. He may want to correct me, but we do not automatically issue
passes for the House of Commons to Members of the European Parliament,
so they have to queue up with everyone else. If we want a proper a
dialogue, they ought to be here. I remember that we would not let MEPs

have two points to make on scrutiny and accountability. The European
Parliament does not see itself as being accountable to national
Parliaments; in reality, it is in competition, which is why many
national parliamentarians around Europe are not in favour of the
European Parliament, because it sees its future as taking over our

with unaccountability. In the Scrutiny Committee, we have improved our
function, but we have not extended that to the whole House. In
fact,  we have reduced the accountability of Ministers, and of
the Prime Minister in particular, through debate in the House, in order
for us to know what the Government are doing at the European level.

never be at peace or feel that we know what decisions are being made on

years. It is extremely refreshing to hear such cogent and well thought
out concern about the whole European issue, which has dogged our
political debates for the  30 years or so that I have been in
the House—whether there is any connection, I cannot say. Today,
the one thing that saddens me slightly and, I dare say, her, too, is
that so few people are participating in a debate about what is at the
heart of our democratic system. I regard this matter as being not
“about Europe” but about Britain, and about democracy,
which is not peculiar to any one
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071669000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071669000004">Our
democratic systems have, in real terms, emerged since the 19th century,
because of John Bright and others. I mention his name because

for Birmingham, Edgbaston represents part of his old constituency,
before it was Birmingham Central. His fight for the working-class vote
was in essence the beginnings of our democratic system. The
Conservative party, under Disraeli, gave in to the pressures. There is
no need to go into the detail, but it was incredibly important and was
based on the assumption that when people went into the polling booth
and cast their vote secretly in a ballot box—that was the system
that was devised in the late 19th century to ensure that the people had
their say—we had a democracy. Other countries have run parallel
with that, so the issue is not exclusively British but applies
elsewhere in the whole of the European continent and the rest of the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071669000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071669000005">I
fear that with the movement towards bigger regional systems, even those
who claim that they want world government ignore national identity,
traditions and democratic systems, and therefore in essence national
Parliaments, at their peril. The European Union, which I voted for as

inexorably along a trajectory towards more and more centralisation and
less and less national
involvement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071669000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071669000006">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T10:01:28"></hs_TimeCode>
Minister for Europe is here. He and I have engaged in debates and
discussions on the matter since at least 1988 or 1989, when I was first
elected chairman of the backbench committee on European affairs in
hostile circumstances. It was interesting that the national
parliamentarians who then represented the Conservative 
<?notus-xml column=177?>party elected me in a secret ballot because I had put out a note
explaining why I was standing, which was all about national
Parliaments. I had written a pamphlet for the Bow Group called
“A Democratic Way to European Unity: Arguments against
Federalism” and I followed that up the following year with
another called “Against a Federal Europe—The Battle for
Britain”. I think I can fairly say—I do so without

remained the central problem.</hs_Para>

difference is that the evidence now demonstrates the analysis of where
we were going wrong, which was further and further integration, and
that was in the 1988 to 1991 period. Since then, we have had Amsterdam,
Nice and Maastricht, and we have had the constitutional and Lisbon
treaties. Irrespective of the evidence, both economic and political,
there is increasing distrust not only in the United Kingdom but
throughout the whole of Europe. I need not give all the
Eurobarometer’s figures, but 72% of those in countries such as
Spain and Italy have now decided that they do not trust the European
Union. I presume to say that riots, unemployment and the rise of the
far right are all things that I said would happen when I wrote those
pamphlets back in 1988-91 and
since.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071669000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071669000008">Despite
all that, as well as the Bloomberg speech and the movement towards a

consistently over a long period have been proved right. I am not
saying, “I told you so.” The matter is far too serious

dysfunctional and as a result we cannot deliver the prosperity that
people want, not only will they become completely alienated from laws
that are generated to exclude them from participation in a prosperous
business and social environment, but the entire fabric of the European

problem is the treaties. The issue is no longer just a call for reform.
I was anxious for reform, and I have called for renegotiation for as
long as I can remember, because I thought the treaties would go wrong.
Now that they have gone so wrong, there is no prospect of their
improving the situation and, as I will explain, there is absolutely no
sign that any Government in any European country are seriously
grappling with the intrinsic problem at the heart of the treaties.
Governments talk about renegotiation, but we are past that. The reality
is that we must leave the existing treaties—I make this point in
the context of our national Parliament and our own
country—because unless other countries are prepared to face up
to the fact that there has been a cataclysmic failure of the system,
they will not be impelled to make the changes that are needed to
achieve what I still believe in: co-operation on the European continent

have been to Lithuania twice, and I have great affection for that
country. One has only to look at the way in which it has been
brutalised for 150 years by successive dictatorships—the Nazis,
Russians and Soviet Union—to realise why it would want the
security of working within the framework of something bigger. The same
applies to Estonia, Latvia and many other countries in central and
eastern Europe, so there is an understandable reason for their wanting
to play safe,  as it were. However, it is not playing safe that
is the problem, because the price that people will pay for allowing
that democratic system to be so much at risk will be another collapse
of those countries if the democratic freedom that they fought for

fact is that tinkering with the treaties is not the only thing

on to the question of ever-closer union. Certainly that was embedded in
the early treaties, including in the treaty of Rome. However, it was
not capable of being implemented, unless and until the genie was
gradually eased out of the bottle as a result of successive treaty
changes. People are cynical about the 1975 referendum, and I understand
why. There is plenty of reason to believe that, in fact, it was done
with some cynicism by the then Prime Minister, Harold Wilson. However,
the reality is that people such as Tony Benn and others, who were
involved in arguments on the other side, challenged whether it would
ultimately lead to political union.</hs_Para>

I freely state that I voted yes in 1975, it was because, as far as I
was aware, it was going to be a common market. It was not only that,
however. It could only become more of an integrated, ever-closer union
as a result of further treaties, which is why I most emphatically put
my foot down on the Maastricht treaty—I tabled about 200
amendments, or whatever it was—and fought the arguments right
the way through from beginning to end, because that was about the
creation of European government. There is no disputing that, and I

treaty is simply a consolidation of all the others. Anyone who cares to
get those treaties out can see that, although I have to say that there
are not many people who would. Sometimes even I have a great
disinclination to get out the consolidated treaties and plough through
them, although I notice that the Minister has them on his desk, with
lots of little yellow flashes so that he can immediately leap to one

appear in our domestic legislation is the Henry VIII clause,
as well call it. The passerelle clause has all the same
characteristics; it is a capacity to make changes without having to go
back to the source of authority. However, we have to pin our main
concerns to the source of authority, which is the European Communities
Act 1972 itself. I allude to the White Paper, which was brought out,
preceding that treaty, in 1971, and upon which, as a result of a huge
amount of discussion in Parliament but not so much outside, the United
Kingdom Parliament decided to pass the Act on an apparently—I
say “apparently”—free vote. It happened, however,
because certain Labour Members at that time decided that they would
back Edward Heath’s proposals for what was to be enacted in the
1972 Act.</hs_Para>

White Paper is the foundation of our national parliamentary commitment

labyrinth and the inexplicable and completely impossible complexities
of the legislation, as was clearly demonstrated in yesterday’s
debate on the opt-out. The fact is that all that ultimately turns on
one piece of legislation, which we entered into voluntarily in
Parliament—no doubt some, or perhaps most, did so for the best
of motives. What it said was that we will accept all the decisions that
are ultimately taken in the Council of Ministers as the legislation of

time, we set up a scrutiny process, which I shall come on to in a
moment. However, the fundamental issue is that the White Paper stated
unequivocally—I do not have the quotation to hand, but I am sure
that I will in no way fail to express it clearly—that we must
retain the veto in our own national interest and to do otherwise would
not only undermine our national interest, but endanger the very fabric
of the European Community itself. That was a very wise remark, because
as Members will note from what I said at the beginning, the whole of 
<?notus-xml column=180?>Europe is in convulsion. It is faced not only with a democratic deficit,

Dublin, only a month ago, I was invited by the EU

question of democratic legitimacy. Viviane Reding, who was meant to

that the Dublin parliamentarians were not at all amused. That is the
manner in which we are being treated—that is all the member
states. She said, unequivocally—I paraphrase her
remarks—that we need a federation of nation states. It was
completely and totally without any attempt to enter a dialogue or a

written. Viviane Reding is the vice-president of the European
Commission and is responsible for justice and home affairs—the
very matters on which we scored that notable result last night in
upholding national scrutiny. However, they are not listening.</hs_Para>

Vilnius, the following month—only last week— Mr
Sefcovic, the Commissioner responsible for relations with the national
Parliaments and the European Parliament, made his position clear. I
arrived in Vilnius at 1 o’clock in the morning, and I was back
in London by 7 o’clock that evening. People said, “What
on earth did you think you were doing going all the way to Vilnius for
four hours?” I explained very simply that, as the Chairman of
the European Scrutiny Committee—one of 28 national
Chairmen—I had the right to be there and that, when I saw that
the meeting was about the next steps towards political and economic
union, I knew, in the light of what I know from other sources, that the
EU has not the slightest interest in renegotiation; all it wants to do
is to press on with the process of integration.</hs_Para>

the scrutiny process, it was interesting that an increasing number of
member state Parliaments are conscious of the impact that these issues
are having on their populations, on which they rely for re-election,
and of the fact that they must respond. A silent revolution is in the
making. I am not going to exaggerate these things, but there is an
issue when the Belgian representative gets up and starts talking about
Belgium’s problems with democratic legitimacy. I cannot think of
one of the 28 member states that does not, in the relevant chamber or
outside, in the margins, over coffee, lunch or dinner, refer to the
problem of democratic legitimacy.</hs_Para>

issue is terribly simple: if we do not get rid of the existing treaties
and deal with the fundamental structure, there is no answer to the
question of democratic legitimacy. We do our best in the European
Scrutiny Committee. When I was first elected Chairman, at the end of
2010, the first thing I did was to set up an inquiry into the 
<?notus-xml column=181?>European Union and the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament,
which is basically what we are discussing. I wanted to get expert
evidence, and we did. Our report came out, and we made it clear that
national Parliaments actually have the last say. We voluntarily
introduced the 1972 Act; that is what the principle involved in the
Factortame case is all about. It is not, as some people believe, that
we are locked into a completely irreversible situation. Although the
treaties say, as the Maastricht treaty did, that the euro, once entered
into, is irrevocable, individual member states must voluntarily decide
to accept that system.</hs_Para>

the moment, there is no recognition whatever that things are going
wrong. There is not the slightest intention to change the foundations
of the treaties, which is absolutely what is needed if we are to
preserve democracy in each member state, including in the United
Kingdom. Whether we are in the euro is by the bye; the fact is that all
the other legislation that affects our economy every day must be
subject not merely to a competence review, but to a clear decision. I
look to the Minister, because the issue is his responsibility, although
he will, quite understandably, take his instructions from No.

the fundamental principles  of our national democracy depend on
our national Parliaments. The Prime Minister was right; the question is
whether we do anything about that. We are promising a referendum in
2017, but that is far too late. The fact is that it should be held
before the general election, because we have profound reasons for
getting on with it. In Dublin, when I had finished making my rather
strong remarks about the state of the European Union and the role of
national Parliaments, the chairman of the Bundestag’s European
affairs committee said, “We must have a referendum in the United
Kingdom as soon as possible, because people do not like the

now have two Governments and two Parliaments, both dealing with the
same subject matter. That inherent contradiction is completely
unworkable. There are attempts at assimilation, but they just create a
more complicated labyrinth, as a result of which the whole situation
becomes increasingly dysfunctional. What is more, the creation of a
two-tier, two-Government, two-Parliament Europe with no real connection
to anything is happening before our very eyes, without any treaty
changes. That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T10:26:12"></hs_TimeCode> is

fundamental reason for holding a referendum is that a fundamental
change is taking place now in the relationship between the European
Union and the United Kingdom. We are not talking about change in 2017;
indeed, there may not be another treaty—I cannot say, although
the Minister probably knows. However, whether or not there is another
treaty, and whether or not there is renegotiation and some nibbling
here and there—some of it may sound attractive to some
people—that will not change the basic structure. That is what is
wrong, and that is why national Parliaments must reassert themselves.
They have the power to deal with their respective parties, particularly
from the Back Benches, including by persuasion. I was extremely glad
that the Government listened yesterday. It was partly a numbers
question; we live in a civilised world, and we appreciate that there
are times when Ministers recognise that they do not have the support
that they need. Three Select Committee Chairmen 
<?notus-xml column=182?>got together—other members of the Liaison Committee were also
involved—and that created a bit of a problem for the Government.
None the less, we are grateful for what happened.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady mentioned consensus and the fact that there are rarely votes.
I simply recommend that people read VoteWatch, which is produced by
Simon Hix of the London School of Economics. It has demonstrated that
where there could be different outcomes, all countries end up agreeing
on 90% of the legislation, and I believe that the figure has increased
since Simon Hix looked at that. Part of the problem is the qualified
majority voting system and part of the problem is the co-decision
system, but I shall park those issues. However, that is how the system
overcomes the issue of what national Parliaments could decide for
themselves if they regained the power that they should regain for
themselves. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T10:28:26"></hs_TimeCode>I
also recommend that people read Professor Damian Chalmers’s
paper on democratic self-government, which will prove to be a seminal
contribution to this debate. He will give evidence to the European
Scrutiny Committee quite soon.</hs_Para>

worries me about the red card system is that it is a further indication
of a refusal to grapple with the essential question—that we
should end up as an association of nation states that have a veto where
necessary, but that co-operate where possible. We should also be able
to trade and to work in political co-operation with our neighbours,
without being governed by them. The red card system is liable to
increase federal arrangements. I do not see why, when this Parliament,
as a national Parliament, says that it does not want a measure, we
should then be obliged to say yes to it, just because we do not reach a
certain threshold when other member states, for completely different
reasons, say they want the measure or are not prepared to stand up and
say that they do not want it.</hs_Para>

goes back to the fundamental question on which I will end. It is about
the ballot box, freedom of choice and those questions that people
fought and died for, and that should determine our attitude towards not
merely nibbling at, revising or reforming the European Union, but
dealing with the real problem: the foundations of the treaties
themselves. It may be a big ask to expect the Minister to agree, but if
we do not deal with that, just as those of us who found that what we
said in the 1990s has not exactly been proved wrong, we will be in a
similar place in 10 or 15 years’ time, and, regrettably, by then
I fear it will be too

Reynolds</B> (Wolverhampton North East) (Lab):</Member> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Chope, in a
debate that is of great interest to you. I congratulate my
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T10:30:50"></hs_TimeCode>hon. Friend the
Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) on securing the debate and
on a characteristically thorough and forensic speech, which drew on not
only 17 years in the House, but many weeks and months—I do not
know how many—on the Convention on the Future of Europe. She is
a real expert and it was a great pleasure to hear her this
morning.</hs_Para>

agree in particular with my hon. Friend’s overall argument that
national Parliaments need to play a much greater role in holding to
account not only the 
<?notus-xml column=183?>European Union, but our own Government’s decisions on Europe and
the formulation of European legislation and policy.
She and many other right hon. and  hon. Friends, some of whom
are here this morning, want parliamentary scrutiny of the EU and what
our Government does in Europe to be enhanced and improved. That
objective unites pro-Europeans and Eurosceptics, and hon. Members from
different parties
alike.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071670000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071670000004">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T10:32:13"></hs_TimeCode>
agree with my hon. Friend’s specific point that it is
regrettable that one of the first actions of the Government when they
came into power in 2010 was to do away with pre-European Council
debates. It is unsurprising that she, and others present and beyond our
debate today, complained repeatedly about the decision, but
unfortunately it was to no avail. While other member states are
improving their scrutiny of their Governments’ decision-making
and negotiating strategy ahead of European Councils, our Government
have taken a retrograde step and have in effect decreased scrutiny. The
Government have not simply done away with the pre-Council debates, but
the post-Council debates are now combined with major issues of
concern—whether Afghanistan or the horrific murder in Woolwich.
Such subjects and the post-European Council report need to be separate.
They are too important to be combined. Notwithstanding the scrutiny of
the European Scrutiny Committee, it is vital that scrutiny also takes
place on the Floor of the House, as she set out, so that all right hon.
and hon. Members have the opportunity to scrutinise how the Government
represent the UK in the EU.</hs_Para>

starting point from which I approach the debate is perhaps different
from that of some hon. Members who have spoken. I am a passionate
believer in our membership of the EU. I
am<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T10:34:00"></hs_TimeCode> both
pro-European and passionately in favour of reform. Just because I
believe in our membership, that does not mean that I think the EU is
perfect—far from it. I spent six years of my life working and
living in Brussels; I have seen at first hand the many imperfections of
the EU. A vital part of EU reform lies in the issue that we are
focusing on today: strengthening the accountability that national
Parliaments have over European

Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire South (Mr Alexander), in
a speech in January this year, set out proposals for a red card system.
It took the Government five months to come to the same conclusion, but
we were encouraged—better late than never. As hon. Members are
acutely aware, the current yellow card system was introduced by the
Lisbon treaty, which the Labour Government negotiated. It gives
national Parliaments the ability to force the European Commission to
reconsider its proposals if they believe that a proposal violates the
subsidiarity principle.</hs_Para>

been a stunning success. As the hon. Gentleman set out, it has been
used successfully on only one occasion  
<?notus-xml column=184?>—the so-called Monti II proposals, which were then withdrawn by
the European Commission. Just because the yellow card system is not a

withdraw it.”</hs_Para>

permanent representations. As

in Westminster Hall and answer MPs’ questions about the forward

Denmark, before European Council meetings the Prime Minister has to go
before the European committee to discuss her negotiating strategy, and
in the German system, the Bundestag now has much greater power to
scrutinise the Government’s negotiating strategy for those
meetings. Our Prime Minister, when he had just been elected as party
leader, told the party to “stop banging on” about Europe,
and there are rumours in today’s press that the first report on
the balance of competences, which we all await with bated breath, has
been put off until after the summer, apparently because Ministers are
fearful of their own Back Benchers. I would be interested to hear why a
dispassionate, objective assessment of the balance of competences
should be put off in that way. The Government again seem to be putting
the party interest before the national one. We are worried that they
feel compelled to delay the initial report, and we are greatly
interested in what the Minister has to say about

debate comes at a particularly important time, because the eurozone
member states are likely to pursue further integration among the
eurozone 17. Their Parliaments, and those in non-eurozone member states

scrutiny on the Floor of the House. The

by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T10:45:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

focused on how we do European business here in Westminster, and others
that centred on what might be done in the broader European Union

shall start with the hon. Lady’s points about how we deal with
European business here at Westminster. Her most important point was
that it was vital to find a way to engage and involve a rather larger
number of Members in European business. I have to confess that when I
go in to the Chamber for a debate on Europe, or in to a Committee, I
feel at times like a cut-price version of Henry V before Agincourt. It
is a matter
of:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13071670000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071670000058">“We

are gathered together, and it is very familiar faces, from both sides
of the House, that tend to feature. It is, however, not a Government
matter, but a problem for Parliament. Parliament must take more
seriously its collective responsibility as an institution to see,
rightly or wrongly—individual hon. Members will have their own
views on this—that we live in a world in which European Union
business should be treated as mainstream political business, and not as
something that can be quietly shoved off to some annexe next door and
left to specialists to get on with in peace and quiet. The decisions
that British Ministers of any party take in the Council of Ministers
have an impact on the lives of  the constituents of every
Member of this House and  I agree, therefore, with the thrust
of what the hon.  Lady

disagree with the hon. Lady, however, in that I feel that the focus
should not be just on the Chamber. The Chamber is clearly important,
but we need to consider the role of Committees, including departmental
Select Committees. In various evidence sessions with the European
Scrutiny Committee over the past couple of years, I have tried to
emphasise my growing belief that part of the answer lies in persuading
the departmental Select Committees to give greater priority to that
aspect of their work that covers European Union business. That is a
matter for Select Committees, and it would be wrong for the Government
to get into the business of 
<?notus-xml column=187?>seeking to give them instructions—the powers are already there
within the terms of resolutions. It is primarily for those Committees
to take ownership of those agendas and drive them forward. They can by
all means invite European Commissioners to give evidence and by all
means go to Brussels every now and then to take evidence and meet
informally with people in the European institutions who are involved in
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071670000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071670000028">I
look forward to the forthcoming report from the European Scrutiny
Committee on the scrutiny process. I am sure that many of the matters
that have been touched on this morning, such as whether we should move
towards a mandate model of scrutiny along the lines of what the
Scandinavian countries have, will be addressed in that report, and I
obviously do not want to pre-empt the Government’s response to
it. I say to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton North East (Emma
Reynolds) that one of the characteristics of that mandate
system—she rightly drew attention to some of its
virtues—is that the sessions between the Minister and the

of these systems has advantages and disadvantages, but could the

Lidington:</Member></B> That is a very good point. To my mind, it means
that one needs to focus the collective memory of elected Members
through the members of the Liaison Committee, which is composed of
relatively senior Members of Parliament, and through the system of the
Committee Clerks. If we look at our Parliament’s representation
in Brussels, we have some very talented people representing the two
Houses, but that amounts to three staff. The Bundestag and the
Bundesrat have 18 or 19 people between them, and that is on top of the
German federal representation and the representative offices from each
of the German Länder that are present in Brussels. Again,
Parliament should consider the question of whether our level of
representation and the number of people we have on the ground in
Brussels are sufficient, but the Government cannot, or should not,
issue instructions on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071670000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071670000031">The
hon. Lady asked whether COSAC could be improved, and my answer is
definitely yes. It is an imperfect organisation, and it could be
strengthened through reforms to the secretariat or through a formal
power to summon commissioners, rather than expecting commissioners by
convention to come and give evidence. It is not just about the formal
meetings of COSAC, because if any system of red or yellow cards is to
be effective, there has to be a culture of talking and working together
that means that different parliamentary representatives, and in
particular the chairs of the relevant committees, are used to having
contact with each other in networking and co-ordinating an approach to
a particular Commission draft measure.</hs_Para>

asked about the role of the Europe Minister, and she was very fair in
how she put it. There is a perfectly legitimate debate to be had in
this country about where that office sits. Some argue that it should
sit in the Foreign Office. Others argue that it should sit in the
Cabinet Office and so be directly accountable to the Prime Minister.
Some argue that it should be a self-standing Department or be located
in Brussels, in effect performing the political office of the permanent
representative. In France, Germany, Poland and Spain my counterparts
sit in their respective Foreign Ministries. In Sweden, however, the
Europe Minister sits in the Prime Minister’s office and reports
directly to the Prime Minister, although she represents a different
political party from the Prime Minister in the current
coalition.</hs_Para>

is not where the Europe Minister sits, but how the right level of
co-ordination and accountability is achieved across Government. The
Europe Minister could be put in the Cabinet Office, but that raises the
question of how the work at Brussels, which is certainly
cross-departmental in Whitehall terms, is co-ordinated with the
bilateral diplomatic work that has to be done with 27 other member
states, because European business cannot be done in Brussels alone. I
would be worried about a gap opening between a Minister dealing with
Brussels business and a Minister dealing with our diplomatic efforts
on, for example, Germany. We try to co-ordinate our conversations with
German Ministers across all relevant political dossiers. When I see
German counterparts, I do not talk strictly about Foreign Office
business; I talk about financial services, the European budget and
whichever European issues are high on the agenda at that

have effective co-ordination through a Cabinet system, which we do
through the European Affairs Committee of the Cabinet. I repeat the
point I have made elsewhere: the permanent representative, who is a

he wishes to move from the mandate he has already been granted, he has
to go back to Ministers and seek their agreement and authority to go
beyond
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071670000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071670000035">On
the question of yellow and red cards, under the current system national
Parliaments or chambers of national Parliaments can submit a reasoned

One third of the voting weight of national Parliaments needs to be
signed up for the Commission to be compelled to carry out a formal
review, and the reasoned opinion may only be submitted on the grounds
of subsidiarity. We could make more use of reasoned opinions than we

agreement is perfect, and that includes the Good Friday agreement. I do
not believe that every dot and comma of it must be protected for all

society. However, its principles are hugely important and provide an
agreed foundation on which we can build for the future. Indeed, my own
party has argued for significant changes to the Strand 1 structures
that govern the operations of the Assembly. Those changes would create
a more normalised form of governance with a properly funded and
resourced Opposition to hold the Executive to account, and with
weighted majority voting replacing the current petition of concern
arrangements, which are increasingly being misused. Such reforms are
within the spirit of the agreement and are not a challenge to its key

that is grounds for inaction on the Government’s part. It is the
duty of Government as a co-guarantor of the agreement and as a
signatory to it to engage proactively with all stakeholders, including
political parties, to seek  
<?notus-xml column=191?>consensus on this and other outstanding issues. There is a particular

the primary purpose of seeking this debate is to discuss not the
content of any Bill of Rights, but the process by which the Bill can be
advanced, it is important to put on record my own party’s broad
views on the Bill of Rights. Alliance recognises that human rights are
inherent and universal. There is scope for different jurisdictions to
recognise different rights in domestic law, provided of course that no
inappropriate inequalities are created in doing so. Rights and a
framework for the delivery and protection of rights are important to
protect individuals and minorities against the state and against
others. However, any dialogue around rights cannot be separated from
responsibilities. Those claiming rights cannot do so without some
consideration for the maintenance of the framework of a democratic
society based on the rule of law that provides for the exercise of
rights. That is particularly important to emphasise in the context of
the past few days when tensions between competing rights have spilled
over into lawlessness in a way that is both destructive and
reckless.</hs_Para>

broad terms, Alliance believes that any Northern Ireland Bill of Rights
must be realistic and capable of being enforced through our own courts,
consistent with European and international standards, and flexible
enough to take account of changing circumstances in an evolving
Northern Ireland. Furthermore, it must avoid entrenching any particular
view of identity, such as the notion of two separate communities in
Northern Ireland, which could reinforce sectarian divisions. Equally,
it should avoid giving group rights precedence over the rights of the
individual in a manner that would do
likewise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T11:04:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071670000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071670000049">My
reason for raising the issue at this time is in part also linked to the
progress being made by the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions)
Bill. The previous Secretary of
State<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T11:04:46"></hs_TimeCode>, the right
hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr Paterson) wrote to all party
leaders about the Bill on 5 September 2011, seeking views on a number
of measures that he hoped to include within the Bill. In the seventh
paragraph of his letter, he raised  the issue of the Northern
Ireland Bill of Rights in which he offered two options for taking the
matter forward. He

remains disagreement about possible further rights protections in
Northern Ireland. I have agreed with the Lord Chancellor that any
specific supplementary rights for Northern Ireland should be
implemented in a separate section of any legislation that would give
effect to a UK Bill of Rights. However, our forthcoming Bill may
provide opportunities to handle this issue differently by, for example,
giving the Assembly power to take forward work, or even legislate, in
this
area.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13071670000050" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071670000050">At
that time, the Alliance party view would have been that a UK-wide Bill
of Rights could have provided a suitable vehicle for progressing the
Northern Ireland Bill. Although Northern Ireland is a distinct society
in many respects, it does not and should not exist in a self-contained
bubble. It is part of a wider UK, all-Ireland and European and
international context. In a globalised and interdependent world,
individuals are interacting much more across frontiers, and human
rights protections must recognise and respond to those
challenges.</hs_Para>

was originally envisaged that any Northern Ireland Bill of Rights would
be created in the context of a common platform across the UK provided
by the European convention on human rights, but no wider UK Bill of
Rights. However, Alliance recognised at that point that any process to
formulate a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland would have to relate to
any potential UK Bill of Rights. That could still have entailed a
separate chapter for the Northern Ireland Bill of Rights or a chapter
within a larger document, provided that the subtleties of the situation
in Northern Ireland were respected. However, it would be fair to say
that the UK Bill of Rights has been kicked into some very long grass at
this point and that we are unlikely to see it delivered in the medium

Long:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his point. He
reinforces what I said earlier about there being no consensus on the
issue. However, I want to address some of what he said. There are two
narratives around the Bill of Rights. One is an expansive Bill of
Rights, which includes a lot of detail, such as socio-economic rights
to which he refers, and there are others who believe that that is not
the role of the Bill of Rights. They believe that it should enshrine
broader principles around which the country should protect
people’s rights as individuals. I would tend towards that more
broad definition rather than the more detailed definition that would
include socio-economic rights. Abortion, the age of consent and various
other issues are best dealt with through the normal democratic and
legislative process and not through a Bill of Rights. That is my view
and the view of my party. However, a Bill of Rights approach can inform
how the debate on those issues takes place, but it is not the job of
the Bill of Rights to supersede the work that Parliament or the
Northern Ireland Assembly do when legislating on matters of
socio-economic importance. That is part of the democratic imperative
that must be maintained regardless of whether or not there is a Bill of
Rights.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T11:09:28"></hs_TimeCode>the Bill of
Rights has caused
controversy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T11:09:19"></hs_TimeCode>. The
forum for the Bill of Rights sat from December 2006 until March 2008
and produced what is probably one of the most non-consensual reports
that has ever been produced in Northern Ireland, which in itself is
quite an achievement. In addition, the Human Rights Commission’s
advice to the Secretary of State, which was delivered back in 2008,
also drew fierce opposition from some quarters.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T11:09:50"></hs_TimeCode>Clearly, there
is still much work to be done. I am not suggesting that we are at a
point where a Bill of Rights is ready to be drafted and put to Members
for agreement. However, the fact that there is work to be done should
be an impetus to doing that work.</hs_Para>

conclusion, as with many other difficult issues, consensus is currently
absent, whether it be on parades, on flags and emblems, on building a
shared future, or on dealing with the past and its legacy. The
Executive have convened talks, which will happen during the summer and
in the autumn, to address those issues and to seek sufficient consensus
to make progress on all  of them, in an attempt to give renewed
energy to the discussions and to end the inertia that has characterised
the process of late. I believe that is welcome. I also believe that Dr
Richard Haass agreeing to chair those talks impartially will add its
own momentum to them. However, it is very clear from research conducted
by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Consortium that a significant
majority of people in Northern Ireland favour a Bill of Rights for
Northern Ireland being implemented in line with the provisions in the
Good Friday agreement, and that that includes a significant majority of
ordinary members of each political party in Northern Ireland, including
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T11:11:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

the political and ideological impediments to reaching sufficient
consensus, I hope that today the Secretary of State will at least

last September, when my hon. Friend the Minister of State and I arrived
at the Northern Ireland Office, we have discussed a Bill of Rights with
a number of organisations and people, including the Irish Government
and the Tanaiste. Like our predecessors, we have found little—if
any—common ground among them, but that has not been for lack of
trying. We have certainly engaged extensively on this matter.</hs_Para>

course, a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland would be a matter of
constitutional significance. As such, it would be very important to
secure cross-community support if it were to have any chance of
succeeding. It is not something that could, or should, be imposed over
the heads of the people of Northern Ireland by the UK Government acting
unilaterally. That position is reinforced by the fact that the main
impact of any Bill of Rights unique to Northern Ireland would fall on
the devolved institutions. So, before we could make a move towards a
Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, there would have to be broadly
based cross-party
agreement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T11:17:17"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government would like to see this issue resolved, given the role that
the Government played in the Belfast agreement, but we cannot simply

should add that the chances of achieving broad agreement on additional
rights for Northern Ireland might be better served if some of the
advocates of a Bill of Rights were more realistic in their ambitions.
Clearly, proposals from some organisations that focus extensively on
socio-economic rights are very unlikely to gain cross-party approval in
Northern Ireland. However, if that was the route that Northern Ireland
wished to go down, the impact on the rest of the UK would also be a
factor to consider. For example, there would be complex issues to
resolve around the interaction of welfare-type human rights with the
principles of parity that currently operate in relation to the benefit

However, I welcomed her thoughts on the Alliance views on these
matters. As she said, it certainly makes sense to focus on a realistic
and flexible approach to any future Bill of Rights, which is capable of
adapting to Northern Ireland’s changing circumstances. She
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T11:18:58"></hs_TimeCode> right to say
that we should proceed with caution against anything that entrenched a
particular and restrictive view in relation to identity and against
anything that made it more difficult to resolve the sectarian divisions

matters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071671000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071671000016">Having
looked back at some of the statements that the Alliance party has
contributed to the debate, I note that there is acknowledgement that
significant hurdles are still to be cleared in arguing why Northern

acknowledge that party’s statement that the aim of policy makers

intensely difficult issue to resolve using a Bill of Rights as a
mechanism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T11:20:27"></hs_TimeCode>. That

there are reasons why further progress on a Bill of Rights will not be
easy to deliver, I hope that I can provide some reassurance regarding
the protection of human rights in Northern Ireland. It is important to
emphasise that Northern Ireland has an extensive, well-developed system
of human rights protections, through existing UK-wide
legislation—not just the legislation that happens to be labelled
directly in relation to human rights, but statutes dealing with matters
such as
discrimination<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T11:21:08"></hs_TimeCode>.
For example, fair employment legislation places obligations on
employers that are unique in the United Kingdom. In particular, section
75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 imposes a statutory obligation on
all public bodies to carry out their functions with regard to the need
to promote equality of opportunity for
everyone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T11:21:28"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, the Police Service of Northern Ireland has emphasised that it
puts respect for human rights at the heart of all its work. That is an
important part of policing practice in Northern Ireland. So
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T11:21:42"></hs_TimeCode> hope that no
one will seek to say that, without a new Bill of Rights, Northern
Ireland is somehow left as a human rights desert. That is certainly not
the
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071671000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071671000019">Looking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T11:21:39"></hs_TimeCode>
ahead, if there were agreement on additional rights for Northern
Ireland, the Government would examine how best to take things forward.
We remain open to the suggestion that work on this, including
legislation, could be taken forward by the Assembly. In our 2010
manifesto, we called for the replacement of the Human Rights Act 1998
with a UK Bill of Rights. Although that proposal did not make it into
the coalition agreement, were it to be revived in future, the relevant
legislation could include a separate section to cover supplementary
rights in Northern Ireland, as mentioned by

the meantime, both the Home Secretary and the Lord Chancellor have said
clearly that, if the Conservatives win the next election, we will seek
radical reform of current human rights law. That would include
re-examining our relationship with the European Court of Human Rights.
However, in considering the future of human rights legislation in the
UK we would, of course, give careful consideration to Northern
Ireland’s position. We are happy to include debates and ideas on

Lancashire to be entirely enforced by the HSE from Aberdeen. The HSE is

when the shale gas industry develops in the north of England, it is
important that it responds accordingly, with regulators based in a much
more localised area. Consideration must therefore be given to the

Menzies:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely correct that what is
important is not that the local council, the Treasury or the companies
benefit; they would all benefit from the development of shale gas.
Ultimately, it is vital that ordinary people in areas hosting sites see
meaningful, tangible, long-lasting and substantial benefits. I will
touch on that, and I know that the Government have made an announcement
on the
subject.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071679000024">Moving
on to the development of the UK supply chain in shale gas, some people
criticise the Minister for wearing two hats: energy and business. That
criticism is short-sighted. Having experience in both makes him
absolutely the right person to ensure that we take the right decisions
in developing the infrastructure and supply chain across the whole
energy sector, and particularly within shale gas.</hs_Para>

been much speculation in the press about the number of jobs that could
be created by shale gas. If shale gas is developed in Lancashire, it is
imperative that local people get maximum employment opportunities. From
speaking to those in the industry, I understand that a significant
number of jobs in shale gas come not from drilling for gas but from
developing the manufacturing supply chain and supporting
industries.</hs_Para>

Minister to seek close Government working with the industry to ensure
the development of a UK—indeed, a Lancashire—supply
chain. It would not be acceptable for the equipment to be manufactured
overseas when we have UK businesses with a strong engineering heritage
and a highly skilled work force in Lancashire. This is a great
opportunity to use those skills to develop a manufacturing base in the
region to supply equipment for the shale gas industry. In the long
term, an offshore shale gas industry could ultimately develop, and that
could drive a considerable amount of highly skilled, well-paid, leading
technical jobs. It is important that the north of England does not miss
the opportunity or shirk the
challenge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071679000027">I
also urge the Minister to ensure that local enterprise partnerships,
the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the gas
companies undertake a scheme to co-ordinate with local colleges and
schools to ensure that apprenticeships are offered to those keen to
enter the industry and retrain where applicable. People are key, and it

Friends who have intervened have mentioned community benefits. On the
financial community benefits from shale gas, I broadly welcome the
overall shape of the proposed package. It is absolutely right that
communities that host shale gas pads should also be the primary
beneficiaries. I know that the Government and the Minister have put in
a lot of work on that issue. I thank the Minister for his work. It is
not an easy task.</hs_Para>

to make it perfectly clear that the £100,000 paid must be per
well fracked and not per shale gas pad. I have read some ambiguity from
commentators in the press, although I never believe everything that I
read in the press. It is therefore important for the Minister to 
<?notus-xml column=202?>give some clarity that it is £100,000 per well and not per well
pad site. As he is aware, a pad can contain up to  20 wells, so
it is therefore imperative that we have clarity in order to avoid
confusion in future.</hs_Para>

principle that communities benefit from a percentage of revenue
generated. At the moment, 1% is proposed; I know that some of my hon.
Friends wish to speak about that. If it remains at 1%, the money must
be highly localised. If, however, a desire to spread the money over a
wider area becomes the prevailing mood, we have no option but to seek a
higher percentage level, as I am not prepared for the benefit to my
communities hosting shale gas pads to be diluted. That is the decision
that we must take.</hs_Para>

that a significant proportion of revenues—I believe the figure
proposed is one third—should go to the county council, as the
mineral rights authority. However, I would like the rest of the money
to be placed into a community endowment fund to ensure that the
communities that host shale gas sites benefit for generations to come.
I know that the Minister is driving much work on the issue, and I look
forward to seeing the final results. I like the thought of a National
Trust-style model, where the money is awarded to causes that benefit
the community in the long term. Those could even include major
infrastructure projects. However, it is also important that individual
people benefit. Options including direct cash payments or money in the
form of energy bills must also be explored. My constituents who host
such sites, and my hon. Friends’ constituents who will host them
in time, must be their prime

Menzies:</Member></B> If my hon. Friend were sitting closer to me, I
would think that he had read my notes, but as he is an honourable
gentleman and far enough away, I know that he has not. He is absolutely
right. We are in the early days—indeed, the infancy—of
the industry. If it goes ahead, we still have questions and
uncertainties to get through. It would be wrong to set too firm a
percentage level at this stage, but we also need clarity that when a
company says that it will pay 1%, or whatever percentage it turns out
to be, it cannot renege or change its mind when the ink is barely dry.
With the best will in the world, companies change chief executive. They
can be taken over. Governments also change. The intentions being set

not yet know how profitable it will be or how much money it will cost
to extract the gas, or what future gas prices may be. It is therefore
important that the level set is sustainable for local communities and

for Southport (John Pugh) rightly identified, that might affect any
arguments or discussions about the amount of money available at a
future stage. It is therefore incumbent on the Government to get the
balance right. At the end of the day, they will set the
regulations—I concur with the hon. Member for Fylde that what
DECC has done has been proportionate and measured—but I caution
the Minister to continue in that line, not least in the context of the

benefit is the frame in which this afternoon’s debate is taking
place, but which communities and where? There are communities of
interest, reasonably so, in the development and the possible production
of jobs, but also in the residents of the area and—not to be

the benefits or where the jobs will come from, we must look not only at
what Cuadrilla or British Gas, which has now joined the enterprise, say
about the numbers of jobs that might or might not be
created—there can be lots of arguments about that—but at
the impact on existing jobs, particularly in tourism, and on green
issues. The number of jobs and the effects that those jobs will have on
the local area from a positive point of view need to be balanced
against the potential—that is all I say at the moment—for
things to develop in such a way that tourism, the environment and the
continued enjoyment of the Fylde area by residents are

As a former member of the Select Committee who believes in

before us. We can have as many reports as we like, but at the end of

principle should apply. I make no complaint against some of the people
who propose the change because they want their business to succeed, but
in the famous words of Mandy Rice-Davies after the Profumo affair, they
would say that, wouldn’t they? Some people in other business
areas will look at it through their end of the telescope, but it is not
our job as Members of Parliament to look at it through their end of the

that in mind, I strongly urge that we proceed with caution on the
precautionary principle and probe laser-like into what the benefits

must be for our residents’ well-being and environment. The Fylde

have worked on this issue in some detail and discussed it at great
length with a wide variety of stakeholders throughout industry and
beyond. There is great consensus on the community benefit and we have
reached the stage where no one is disputing or discussing whether we
should have a community benefit scheme; we are simply discussing the
detail. There are various reasons why an effective scheme is important
and it may be best summed up in a phrase that many hon. Members have
heard before: the industry requires a social licence to operate. A
community that hosts shale gas resources and could see shale gas
development take place is entitled to ask two legitimate questions: is
it safe, and how will our community benefit from the process? It is
incumbent on the Government and industry to answer both those
questions</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071679000057">Today’s
debate is not about safety, except that, echoing hon. Members who have
spoken, we must take this forward with the highest environmental
standards, in keeping with the gold standard that we already apply to
oil and gas regulation in the UK. Today’s debate is about the
benefit to people and communities in Lancashire. It is their gas; it is
not Cuadrilla’s gas or Centrica’s gas, and it is
certainly not the Government’s gas, although the law may imply
that it is. I am not a socialist, but as far as I am concerned, it
belongs to the people of Lancashire, and it is important and absolutely
right when developing a domestic UK shale industry that the local
communities who will host that industry and new development should
benefit from their own natural
resources.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071679000058">Loosely
speaking, two benefits can accrue from a large-scale infrastructure
project. One is the natural or organic benefit: the jobs, supply chain
and activity from the very process of the investment and flow from the
activity without intervention from the Government. The other, which is
what we are principally talking about today, is the artificial cash
benefit that can be put in place by the industry through voluntary
agreements or by the Government to ensure that some of the profit and
revenue stream from the industry are shared
locally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071679000059">I
want both forms of benefit to accrue to the people of Lancashire. On
the first point, it is essential that the maximum benefit in jobs and
investment must accrue as locally as possible to the operation of the
shale gas pads. Employing local people and developing a local supply
chain is fundamental to making the industry part of the community
instead of it being an outside industry that comes in and does things
to the community.</hs_Para>

and the surrounding region, for example, the offshore oil and gas
industry supports 137,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs.
We may not see quite the same number of jobs in Lancashire, much as we
would all love to, but the highly detailed report by the Institute of
Directors estimated that there is potential for up to 74,000 direct and
indirect jobs nationwide from developing 
<?notus-xml column=207?>UK shale gas. Not all the jobs will be in Lancashire, but many will, and
it is important that when the industry and particularly the supply
chain go forward with their plans, they do their best to maximise the
number of jobs that stay locally within the
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071679000061">On
the artificial cash benefits, the proposals currently under discussion
have been alluded to: £100,000 per exploratory well and
eventually 1% of revenue from the development phase going to the local
community. Over the lifetime of a shale gas pad, that could amount to a
considerable sum, and I agree with those who have already noted that we
should remain flexible about community benefits to ensure that, as the
industry’s profitability becomes better known and we have more
information, we can ensure that the benefits remain at a suitable
level.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071679000062">I
share my hon. Friend’s concern about one fundamental and
important question. How does one define the community? Most of our
present discussions about community benefits boil down to the question,
who is the community? The judgment call on exactly who should receive a
direct benefit is often spoken of in terms of municipal
level—parish, district or county—but it is important to
note that people do not necessarily mean the parish council, the
district council or the county council. They use those words as
shorthand for the municipal level to which the community benefit should
go.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071679000063">If
the community is defined too narrowly, it may create division rather
than consensus, and I have seen that in my constituency. When
campaigning in Curdworth as a young parliamentary candidate not that
many years ago, I asked what the village’s main issue was and
someone said, “Them on that side of the village got compensated
for the Birmingham northern relief road and we over here, one road
over, weren’t.” The compensation package had caused
division in the village because the definition of who should benefit
was too
narrow.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071679000064">However,
if the definition is too wide, there are two concerns. One is simply
that if the benefit is diluted too much, it may not provide a genuine
benefit. Another danger is the message sent about the impact of the
industry. If someone living 10, 15 or 20 miles from a shale gas pad is
told that they will receive a community benefit to compensate them for
having it in the area, are we not pandering to a myth, because someone
15 or 20 miles away may not notice that it is there? The evidence is
that there will probably be no impact more than a few miles away from a
shale gas

are potentially significant benefits to not only Lancashire, but the

getting them out will add to the greenhouse gases circulating around

reasons that may or may not be correct, although I believe them.
Principally, I do not think that our energy consumption will fall much

developed by that stage to plug the gap. Other alternatives also seem
pretty unattractive. One is the extensive building of nuclear power
stations. Buying ever cheaper coal—coal is becoming
cheaper—is another. Importing gas is probably the favoured
alternative, and we will probably face a choice between using Russian,
Kazakhstani or Qatari gas or shale gas, which we have in appreciable
abundance 
<?notus-xml column=209?>in Lancashire—the shale there is much deeper than in many parts
of the United States, where shale gas is being exploited to some
effect.</hs_Para>

have the advantage of having visited one of the exploratory wells and
seen the precautions taken to ensure that what happens is not
environmentally intrusive or damaging. I therefore have a better
feeling about the regulations the industry must currently abide by,

good regulation is crucial to the successful development of shale gas.
I say that because
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:14:04"></hs_TimeCode> have also seen
some slightly alarmist anti-fracking propaganda. We have probably all
had sight of “Gasland”, with the taps that catch fire and
so on, and we have probably all heard the exaggerations about the
chances of pipes fracturing, threats to the water supply and
subsidence. People have also exaggerated the number of wellheads we
need, and they have talked about traffic densities and movements that
are unlikely to materialise—producers are unlikely to want to
move gas around by lorry if they can find a better way to move it.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:14:32"></hs_TimeCode>To be fair, a
lot of the people who object would object if all those concerns were
set aside; in other words, they have the same fundamental objection as
the Tyndall climate change group—they think shale gas is not
something we should dally with and is not something for the
future.</hs_Para>

that argument, there are clearly powerful economic arguments. If shale
gas materialises as Cuadrilla and others hope it will, that will be
good for the country’s balance of payments and it could have
huge implications for the north-west’s economy. My constituency,
which is on the edge of the Bowland special protection area, will, I
hope, benefit in some way.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:15:22"></hs_TimeCode>I am not holding
my breath on that, because we have seen false dawns locally before. Gas
was discovered in the bay, and the production facilities can be seen
from Southport beach. We hoped that that would have enormous benefits
for the local economy, but it led to Hamilton Oil sponsoring a few
events, and that was it. When one of the few fibre-optic cables from
America came on land on Southport beach, I dreamed of Southport
becoming not the Aberdeen of the north, but the silicon valley of
England, but, somehow, that did not happen; we just got a quietly
humming shed on an industrial park and little in the way of local
employment. I am not, therefore, holding my breath, but I am none the
less encouraged by the fact that the shale gas industry has made some
pretty good opening moves, which will, I hope, move us in the direction
of rebalancing the economy and provide some local community
benefit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:16:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071679000080">Through
the Treasury, the Government are concentrating principally on
incentivising shale gas development. I am in favour of that, and we

Will they simply leach out to the south-east or wherever the company
headquarters are, or will we feel the benefit locally? If I can throw
my two pennies-worth on the table, I would like to see a levy that is
channelled towards investing in permanent renewable energy in the area.
At some point, the shale gas, like all other such energy sources, will
run out. Other Members have other attitudes and other proposals.

that sense, we are pleased with where we have got to. We have had the
announcement that the compensation system will be established. We have
learned that it will be run by the United Kingdom Onshore Operators

the question from
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:19:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Fylde about the distinction between wellheads and pads.
We have also had the indication that, once production starts, 1% of all

Lancashire it will go down vertically and then horizontally. Will the
local community be defined in relation to the extent
over  
<?notus-xml column=211?>which the gas is extracted, or just where the wellhead is? I am not
splitting hairs: those things will be brought up locally, for Members
of Parliament to
answer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:21:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0001.htm#13071679000087">As
to the figure of two thirds being directed locally, does that refer to
the district councils, such as Wyre, in my case, or Fylde; or does it
mean a unitary authority—Blackpool? My major concern is about
what happens if those councils take the third or two thirds. What
commitment do we have that that will really be seen as additional to
the normal process of local government revenue grants? I have absolute
faith in my right hon. Friend the Minister and, indeed, in the shadow
Minister, the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:21:44"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West (Tom Greatrex), but let us
think of a future time, when other Ministers have come along. What if
Lancashire county council, or, indeed, the district councils, are
gaining a fair amount of money just on the basis of the 1%, and they
apply for the normal general grant? Or what if there are regional
growth fund applications for the area? Will not a future Minister say,
“Well, Lancashire has that money; it does not need this other
money”? That is my argument about additionality. We need some
guarantees about it—that the money will be additional, above and
beyond what the localities would normally expect under the local
government or business funding systems or whatever, and they will not
be disproportionately treated because there is extra money.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for
Southport<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:23:02"></hs_TimeCode> and
others hinted at one—to whether the money should go into
something like a sovereign wealth fund for Lancashire, or, indeed, a
trust fund. That might be managed by professionals, but open to
applications from the districts, parishes and counties for
funds—and major, structural funds. My other argument will be
that 1% is not enough. Big profits will be made. I understand the
strictures of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:23:14"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Gentleman: we are at the beginning of an industry. However, perhaps
there could be a rising scale as the profits mount up. There is a
serious issue about 1%: it is not enough. If the predictions about the
productive capacity of the Bowland shale are right—and it
stretches across Lancashire and parts of Derbyshire, and even that
other county called Yorkshire—5% would be a substantial amount
of money, which would guarantee to the people of those areas that
something would be left after the shale gas was gone, as it eventually
will be. That something might be renewable energy; it might be all
kinds of things, but that is the kind of vehicle that I
suggest.</hs_Para>

itself into trouble over what it can and cannot fund. The Alaskan funds
are quite interesting because of the dividends that they have been able
to pay out, on top of the future capital investment that will be
available to ensure that when the oil goes Alaska will be left with
something. That is what we are looking for. It is certainly what I am
looking for: to be able to tell people in Lancashire “We will be
prepared to put up with all this”—because I am not sure
there will be too many jobs in it—“as, at the moment, we,
or some of us, are prepared to put up with wind farms out at sea and on
the hills, and possibly a

What has been good about it so far is the degree of thought and
rationality that has been applied to wider issues of community benefit,

from Members of Parliament from all parties in the affected area; they
have the right and responsibility to speak up for their constituents.
As many have intimated, even if they have not said so explicitly, we do
not yet really know what we are dealing with. We can know only after
some exploration, when we find out what is being extracted and what
will be got out of the ground. We can then make further judgments; but
we can get to that stage only if there is public confidence and

technology is not new, but an existing technology is being given a new
or different application, and it is not surprising that there is
anxiety and concern about the impact. That is not least because people
have seen reports and films about the experience in other parts of the
world, notably the USA. It is right for Government and the appropriate
authorities to take those things seriously; because confidence is
necessary. That is why
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:29:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

the comprehensiveness of monitoring. Having all the right regulations

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:34:29"></hs_TimeCode> chemicals
used must be restricted to those that are proven to be non-hazardous
with mandated public disclosure of all the chemicals to be used,
including their toxicity levels. The integrity of each well must be
assured to prevent water contamination, with independent assessment of
the well design, the cement bond between the casing and well bore, in
addition to the composition of the casing to determine its ability to
resist corrosion. Seismic monitoring should be put in place with a
traffic-light system, to which the hon. Member for Fylde referred
earlier, as has been the case in the Netherlands and Germany. The level
of methane in groundwater should also be assessed prior to any
drilling, because a criticism that has been made a number of times
relates to potential contamination. Sometimes it goes further, and some
people claim contamination of groundwater from methane, when, as we are
all aware, methane can occur naturally in groundwater. Unless there is
initial monitoring of it as a baseline study, we cannot tell whether
anything untoward has happened. We
said—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:33:15"></hs_TimeCode>

shale exploration should be subject to an environmental impact
assessment, given that previously, smaller applications did not
necessarily need to be. We also said that we believe the monitoring

move on to community benefits, on which some important points have been
made so far this afternoon. I take a broadly similar position to the
hon. Member for Southport. When making the case, there are people who
have legitimate concerns about a number of areas that need to be
addressed, while some are against shale exploration and have a
principled, ideological position. It is fair enough for people to take
that position, but there is a need to separate those ideological
objections from legitimate environmental concerns, and that is exactly
what the regulation needs to do.</hs_Para>

terms of community benefits, the Government have acted on onshore wind,
and, given the ongoing discussions, I am sure that we will get more on
community benefits in relation to nuclear in the near future. We have
had a broad acceptance that there is a degree of disruption, that there
is a need for that to be recognised, and that there should be some
community benefit and support. However, it is not as straightforward as
it initially sounds.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:36:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Blackpool South made the point about what local impact
is, how that is best defined, and where community benefits are. The
Minister is well aware of the issue. I read a comment from him that
must have been made at the time of the announcement; he was talking
about what might impact on a particular community, but if that
community uses a swimming pool that needs to be rebuilt in an adjacent
town, how can that line best be drawn? We really need to get into the
detail of that over the next period, because there are potentially
significant financial benefits, quite apart from the impacts that
others have discussed in terms of jobs and economic activity.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071679000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000100">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:37:11"></hs_TimeCode>
want to reiterate a point that has been made. I have, in front of me,
documentation from the United Kingdom Onshore Operators Group, when it
put out its community engagement charter. The point about whether it is
a wellhead or a pad is important—the language used by the UKOOG
refers to it being per well site. That language in itself is slightly
ambiguous, in terms of it being a well site, as opposed to a wellhead.
Will the Minister try to clarify that important point?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071679000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000101">On the wider
point about community benefits, we know that in relation to the
foreshore, the Crown Estate has established a system of community
benefits. Not a huge amount is flowing into that fund at the moment,
but it will in future in relation to offshore activity. The fund is
effectively administered by the national lottery and it is appropriate
for a number of community bodies, as well as local authorities, to
apply. Will the Minister say more about consideration of that type of
model or of that as part of the model, as opposed to something being
run by an industry group?</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=215?><hs_Para UID="13071679000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000102">There is a
wider point in relation to Shetland, which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:38:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Lancaster and Fleetwood referred to. In one of my previous lives, I
was a local government officer in Scotland. It always used to gall us
that, every year, when the 32 local authorities in Scotland got their
audit reports, Shetland got the worst one in terms of sustainability of
funding, but it was okay, because it has that huge amount of money
there. In fact, with what is happening west of Shetland, it probably
has quite a lot to be able to rely on well into the future. However,
there is a point about long-term sustainability as well, which I think
needs to be reflected in the wider community benefit picture. The
Minister is well aware of the issue, and he asked how we stop funds
being swallowed up by the local authority social services
budget—I think that was what he used as an example of a local
authority budget that is always under pressure, where there is the
temptation to plug the gap, if there is additional revenue. However,
this really needs to be something additional. We do not know the scale
yet, as the hon. Members from Lancashire have made
clear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:39:37"></hs_TimeCode> in their
contributions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000103">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:39:41"></hs_TimeCode>
shall finish by reiterating a point that has been made about
regulations. Regulations need public confidence and wide acceptance,
and the same goes for the community benefits package and arrangements.
Communities need confidence in them and they need to know that they
will be appropriately and fairly dispersed and applied. They need to
see that the benefits are there for them to use in
recompense—although not formally in recompense—for the
disruption there may be during the activity that may or may not happen
in Lancashire or elsewhere in the years

hon. Friend began by rightly raising the interests of communities, and
the debate has clearly demonstrated that community interests have a
number of dimensions and apply to all potentially affected communities
across our country. I will group my comments into four areas: first,
local communities should be clear on the Government’s policy on
shale; secondly, they should be clear on when they will be engaged
locally and by whom, and have access wherever possible to objective
information; thirdly, they should be reassured about shale development
and that it will be carried out safely and in a way that protects the
environment; and finally, they should know exactly what benefits should
flow from hosting shale gas developments. I will tackle each in
turn.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000106"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:42:00"></hs_TimeCode>As
a Government, we believe that shale has the potential to provide this
country with greater energy security, an incentive to growth and more
jobs. Through the co-ordination of the Office of Unconventional Gas and
Oil, we are creating the framework to accelerate the development of
shale responsibly. Looking at the big picture to see how our various
energy sources fit together 
<?notus-xml column=216?>in the market as we transition to a low-carbon future, we quickly
realise that oil and gas will form a key part of our energy
requirements for some decades to come. We need to recognise that shale
gas development is part of a historic continuum in the development of
our domestic resources. Over 2,000 conventional oil and gas and coal
bed methane wells have been drilled in the UK. Fracking, of course, is
an established exploration technique used around the world. I see
unconventional resources as a part of the bigger picture and
continuum.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000107">As
Members will know,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:43:11"></hs_TimeCode> British
Geological  Survey has now estimated the total volume of gas in
the Bowland-Hodder shale, which includes Lancashire, at some 1,300
trillion cubic feet. Effective exploration of that resource is
necessary to help us understand how much of that gas is technically or
economically recoverable. We are therefore encouraging the safe and
environmentally sound exploration that will help us determine that.
With robust regulation now in place, there is nothing to prevent
licensees from bringing forward new drilling plans and seeking the
necessary permissions. In Lancashire, Cuadrilla has recently announced
further plans for exploration, and of course we welcome
Centrica’s recent investment in its licence in the area. We are
therefore likely to see Lancashire lead the way in the exploration
phase, which if proven will provide local communities with real
benefits and

community engagement by companies in the industry is essential to
gaining public acceptance of and support for shale gas development. We
have worked closely with the industry to encourage strong engagement
that addresses local concerns. We are therefore pleased that the
industry—through its trade body, the United Kingdom Onshore
Operators Group—has recently collectively adopted a community
engagement charter. One of its objectives is to identify and
proactively address local issues and concerns. In addition, each
operator will engage with local communities and other stakeholders,

this afternoon, to ensure that we provide clear information to the
public on the myths that tend to surface about shale, so that we can
help the public to separate fact from the fiction. An objective of the
Office of Unconventional Gas and Oil is to help people understand the
facts about shale gas, and that includes supporting local authority
engagement with communities where it can assist in resolving issues and
allowing projects to proceed where appropriate. Officials are
developing plans for how we can do that in practice and will be
engaging with local authorities—particularly Lancashire, at this

regulation is comprehensive and fit for purpose for exploration, but we
are not complacent. We want continuously to improve it, and local
communities will expect no less. A number of regulatory bodies and
Departments are involved, including the Environment Agency, the HSE, my
Department and the Departments for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
and for Communities and Local Government. The Office of Unconventional
Gas and Oil, which has no regulatory functions, co-ordinates activity
across Government on unconventional gas and oil, including on the

the community benefits, I think we all agree that it is vital that
communities that host shale benefit from the developments. As part of

proposal, which is, as has been said, to provide communities with
£100,000 per fracked well site at the exploration stage and 1%
of revenues at the production stage. The industry estimates that that
amounts to as much as £5 million to £10 million per pad,
and some £1.1 billion overall for communities in the UK. We
welcome the offer from the industry. It represents a good deal for
communities at this stage in the development of the UK shale industry.
I am pleased that the industry has pledged to keep the offer under

experience.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000117">At
this stage, the operators group envisages that community funding will
be split, with two thirds going to a local-level community fund and one
third to a wider fund at county level. That need not mean the local
authority itself; it might be a charitable or other foundation
operating at county level. The operators have pledged that at each
stage they will work with the local community funds to set out what
level of benefits would be provided on a per household basis, so that
even though communities may choose to use the funds to pay for
community-wide measures residents will understand what their share of

engage with interested parties and the local authorities involved, so I
urge interested Members also to engage in the process and to help shape
the proposals further. I assure Members that we in the Government will

traffic light warning protocol and real-time monitoring, and if any
activity over 0.5 on the Richter scale is detected the operation will
be halted and further steps taken. The British Geological Survey has a

Burstow</B> (Sutton and Cheam) (LD):</Member> I appreciate having this
opportunity to address the House on an issue that is of major concern
to my constituents, to the many staff who work at the very valued
institution of St Raphael’s hospice, which is in north Cheam in
my constituency, and to the staff who work at the adjacent charitably
run St Anthony’s
hospital.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000127">I
suspect that when the Minister saw the title for the debate, he turned
to his officials and said, “What on earth am I doing a health
debate for?” I can well understand that reticence and puzzlement
as to why a Health Minister was not invited to respond. I want to use
the debate to explain why I am grateful that a Foreign and Commonwealth
Office Minister is responding. The issues are not so much about health
care as they are about accountability, transparency and the
responsibility of trustees in discharging a public good and a common
purpose. The debate requires an intervention or some involvement from
the Foreign
Office.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000128">I
ask the Minister to intervene on behalf of my constituents to safeguard
the future of a much valued hospice and a widely respected hospital. I
ask that our ambassador to the Holy See make officials at the Vatican
aware of the concerns I am expressing. I will explain why. The
Congregation of the Daughters of the Cross of Liege is a Catholic
charity that owns and runs St Anthony’s hospital and
St Raphael’s hospice, both of which are based in north Cheam.
Together they employ 900 local people and are much loved, much admired
institutions with a strong tradition of volunteering, which is very
much at the heart of the hospice movement.</hs_Para>

of the Daughters of the Cross are six Catholic nuns, who have decided
to sell St Anthony’s hospital to a commercial concern, bringing
to an end more than 100 years of care and Christian mission for the
sick, the vulnerable and the dying. Their decision confounded and
distressed those who work at the hospital and the hospice, as well as
many of my constituents and many in the wider community who benefit
from the work of the institutions. The decision is all the more
perplexing because the Daughters of the Cross charity, according to its
latest accounts, has more than £80 million in cash
and investments, even before selling off the hospital. Lack of money is
not the problem and should not be a justification for what is being
done.</hs_Para>

the Daughters of the Cross have so far failed to explain why a proposal
for a new Catholic charity with new trustees could not form the basis
of a gracious and negotiated passing of the baton to a new generation
of trustees. Instead, Daughters of the Cross are insisting on the
withdrawal of all the existing funds currently held by St
Anthony’s hospital—some £35 million in
all—as well as a capital receipt for the disposal. In my
meetings with the charity, the trustees talk about the money being
their money. There is no recognition that the money is held in trust,
or that it is the result of co-production between the Daughters of the
Cross and those who work in the hospital and
hospice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000131">The
issue I am raising is not a religious one. It is about the behaviour of
a charity and the reputational damage that is doing. The Daughters of
the Cross is a congregation of pontifical right. It does not come under

<?notus-xml column=221?>the temporal or spiritual authority of the Catholic Church in England.
It is answerable directly to the Vatican in Rome, and critically it has
not yet obtained permission from the authorities in the Vatican that
oversee decisions to dispose of assets held by the Catholic Church. The
body with the decision-making authority is called the Institutes of
Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, whose secretary is
Archbishop José Rodríguez Carballo. As part of the
charity’s governance, it has well-established advisory
committees that bring together community and expert opinion to guide
the trustees’ decisions, to ensure that the right investments
are made and that the right development of services takes place. Sadly,
that expertise has been sidelined in this matter and not given the
weight it deserves.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071679000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000132">The chairman
of St Raphael’s hospice, Dr Ron McKeran, has written to
Archbishop Carballo, imploring his committee to exercise its oversight
role and use its discretion to stop the sale and instead fully explore
and take forward the creation of a new Catholic charity. Dr
McKeran and many others believe that the sale of St
Anthony’s will destroy the very special Christian character of
the hospital. In his view, the actions of the charity’s trustees
seem to be devoted to turning charitable assets into greater financial
reserves, rather than to turning public donations into charitable
activity. I believe that Dr McKeran’s analysis is
spot-on.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071679000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000133">The sale will
expose St Raphael’s hospice to financial uncertainty. That is
critical. At present, the hospital, as part of the same charity,
provides a hidden subsidy of around £1 million a year. There is
a symbiotic relationship between the two institutions. The hospital
provides vital services, including IT, payroll, catering, and site
services. Cutting the hospice free of its ties to the hospital,
eventually to become a stand-alone charity, would leave it facing the
prospect of a million pound funding gap.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071679000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000134">There is an
alternative: a proposal to spin out a new charity to take St
Anthony’s and St Raphael’s forward together, maintaining
the Christian mission that has flourished on the site in north Cheam
for more than a century. The trustee nuns of the Daughters of the Cross
have so far not explained why they are unwilling to appoint lay
trustees, as other similar charities have done. There could be a
managed transition with new trustees taking up the reins when the nuns
are no longer able to exercise their responsibilities as trustees. That
is more in keeping with the ethos of the charity, but the trustees are
confusing their worries about their own mortality with the bigger
picture and the purpose of the charity they founded. The trustees have
offered no explanation as to why the reserves of £80 million and
the moneys from the disposal of a very valuable site in Chelsea cannot
be used to achieve their ends.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071679000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000135">As a result
of all that, the hospice finds itself in limbo, uncertain of its future
and reliant on words of good intent, but no guarantees. I hope the
Minister understands the concern that I and many of my constituents
have about the future of St Raphael’s hospice. My concerns have
already led me to write to the Charity Commission, asking it to
investigate how the charity has conducted itself, the lack of due
diligence and the risk of financial and reputational damage. It cannot
be right for a charitable purpose to be subverted by the personal
concerns of the trustees about their own long-term involvement in the
charity. Nor is it right for the trustees to set aside the expert
opinion of their own advisory 
<?notus-xml column=222?>boards, as well as the views of the staff, volunteers and the public.
Their goal should be to secure the long-term future of the charity.
That is why I am asking the Minister to act: not to interfere in
matters spiritual, but rather to set out those concerns to the
authorities in the Vatican who have the final say.</hs_Para>

Minister ask our ambassador to raise the matter, urging that it be
carefully considered, and that the representations from Dr McKeran,
myself and others are properly taken into account? At the very least,
will he ask our ambassador to draw the attention of the appropriate
authorities in the Vatican to this debate? There is no authority in the
UK that can prevail upon the Daughters of the Cross to change its
decision; only an intervention from the Vatican can hope to protect the
future of the much loved and cherished St Raphael’s
hospice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000137">I

to the role that he has played in supporting his local community on
this challenging and difficult issue, and I am struck by the strength
of local feeling that clearly exists about the future of St

particular, the work of the hospice exemplifies the huge support that
exists for the hospice movement across the whole United Kingdom. St
Raphael’s clearly plays a very important role in the lives of
many people within the community of Sutton and Cheam. Indeed, hospices

million in Government funding that was awarded to hospices across
England earlier this year. A total of 176 hospices will benefit from
that fund. It will

hospices is vital, not least because more and more people are using
their services. Hospices need support to provide the care that is so
desperately required. Such additional funding will enable hospices to

that they provide to patients and—significantly—to give
increased support to patients’

role that faith groups can play in contributing to wider society. St
Raphael’s ethos of accepting people of all faiths and, indeed,
people of no faith is admirable; that is exactly the sort of model for
interfaith relations that the Government are keen to promote. It is
also important to say that this role of religion and faith within
communities makes a vital contribution to national life, by not only
guiding the moral outlook of many people but providing help for those

year, I looked at the financial cost for women in Wales of the policies
of the coalition Government. The study, which was based on
parliamentary questions and Library research, revealed that, directly
due to coalition policies, £1 billion would be taken away from
Welsh women. It highlighted that more than £700 million would be
lost to women in Wales as a direct result of pension changes; housing
benefit changes, not including the ruthless bedroom tax, would account
for more than £13 million; nearly £40 million would be
lost due to changes in working tax credits; and public sector pay
restraint would cut £300 million out of families’
pockets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000161">Have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:26:01"></hs_TimeCode>
things got any better since then? Clearly, the answer is a resounding
no. Things continue to get worse for women in Wales, whether because of
the replacement of well-paid jobs by lower-paid ones, sustained attacks
on public sector jobs, the increase in zero hours contracts and
part-time working, cuts to child care, or direct tax or benefit
changes, such as the bedroom tax. Whichever cut it is, women in Wales
are being hit

is this situation affecting women so badly? Women are, on average,
poorer than men. Some 64% of low-paid workers are women and in later
life women’s average personal pensions are only 62% of the
average for men. Women also live longer, often spending the final years
of their lives alone. Women are more likely to be the primary carers
for children, older people, the sick or  the disabled. Nearly
three quarters of carer’s allowance claimants are women,
confirming that women take responsibility for the majority of
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:27:05"></hs_TimeCode>. Women are
also far more likely to be lone parents. Indeed, in Wales 95% of lone
parents are women and that group is much more likely to be below the
poverty line. Women are also more likely to be the victims of domestic
and sexual
violence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:27:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000163">Given
that women use public services and benefits more than men, it is clear
that when provision is cut it will hit women even harder. The fact that
women are bearing the brunt of the Government’s deficit
reduction plans is proven by Library research. Of the £14.4
billion raised in 2014-15, through changes to taxes, benefits, pay and
pensions, £11.4 billion—some 79%—comes from women
and £2.9 billion from men. In a Cabinet with three times as many

for instance at tax and benefit changes. The coalition Government and
Ministers at the Department for Work and Pensions have consistently
described their welfare cuts as fair. Clearly, they are unaware of or
are ignoring the disproportionate impact they are having on women in
Wales. A recent Office for National Statistics study on the effect that
benefit and tax changes have had on incomes by household types
demonstrates the negative financial consequences for women and
families. That study, which covered the financial years 2010 to 2012,
shows that a lone parent household with dependent children is
£2,248 worse off.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:29:20"></hs_TimeCode> have already
established that the vast majority—95%—of lone parents in
Wales are women. For other families, the situation does not get any
better. A household with two adults and two children is nearly
£5,000 worse off. The stress on parents who are trying to
accommodate such an income fall, bearing in mind the huge hike in
living costs, adds a great deal of pressure for people who are already
working hard to keep their heads above water.</hs_Para>

report by the TUC showed that most jobs created since the recession
have been in low-paid industries such as retail, the service sector and
residential care. That was borne out by the ongoing inquiry by the
Welsh Affairs Committee into the Work programme. Nearly 8% of the
587,000 net new jobs since June 2010 have been in sectors where the
average pay is £7.95 an hour or less. Figures from the Office
for National Statistics show that long-term unemployment has increased
by nearly 100,000 since May 2010, and a shocking 86% of that increase
is among women. Young Welsh women are particularly struggling in the
labour market, with one in five out of work. In the figures released in
June, the overall unemployment rate in Wales remained unchanged at 8.4%

again.</hs_Para>

too little, too late. Many families in my constituency are struggling
with huge child care costs, which are bigger than those in many
countries around the world. The Government’s proposals will take
time to filter through and will have no immediate impact on those
families. In addition, the little bit of help that has been provided

Wales”, the number of people in Wales who work part time because

falls on women. Child care responsibilities or caring for older people
mean that many women have little choice but to work part time. Contrast
the difference between the Labour Government in Cardiff, who are
doubling the number of Flying Start places despite losing £1.4
billion from their budget, with the coalition in Westminster, who have

In many parts of Wales, particularly in places such as my constituency,
the public and private sectors are completely intertwined. If money is
taken from public sector workers, less money will be spent in the local

to those we have heard in Westminster Hall and on the Floor of the

and welfare reform, dressed up as a debate about women in Wales. We
could have been discussing the role of women in public life, higher
education or the legal sector in Wales, or the efforts that we as a
Government are making to help women in Wales smash through the glass
ceiling and take their place on boards, running companies and being
leaders in all spheres of life in Wales. What we actually had was a

reason why we are doing one of the most effective things that can be

lowest-paid workers out of income tax altogether. We have now cut
income tax for more than 1.1 million working people in Wales by
increasing the tax-free personal allowance. By increasing it to

are people who have not worked a day in their life—we have
200,000 such people in Wales, and worklessness is still a huge problem
in many of our communities. If we care about those communities and are
bothered by that, we must be serious about welfare reform. We as a

back it up, I will certainly take it to my noble Friend Lord Freud, the
Minister responsible for welfare reform, and discuss it with him. I sit
with him and discuss the impact of welfare reform in Wales, because I
am concerned about it. The whole purpose of introducing universal
credit is a more simplified system, which we want to incentivise more
work. We hope that more women will choose to re-enter the labour
market, partly on the back of the introduction of universal credit.
Some of them will be in work already, but we want them to take on more
hours if they choose to do so. We want people to be able to make the
right choices for them in their circumstances at that point in time,
and we want a welfare system that supports those choices rather than
creating negative incentives that work against the interests of the
families and individual women that we are discussing.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion (Mr Williams) for putting on
record some of the measures that we as a Government have taken to
assist with child care costs, most notably 
<?notus-xml column=234?>the introduction of the tax-free child care scheme, which makes child
care simpler and more affordable for parents to access. From autumn
2015, working families will be able to claim 20% of child care costs,
up to £1,200 per child under 12. We believe that that will
contribute significantly to helping women who want to go out to work in
Wales by encouraging those who want to do so to get back into the
labour market and take the jobs that are being
created.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071679000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/halltext/130716h0002.htm#13071679000209">To
respond to the point made by Opposition Members, I absolutely agree
that more women than men have been affected by public sector job
losses, due to the proportion of men and women who work in public
services. Nevertheless, it is true—even in Wales, where
Opposition critics said that it could not happen, because we were led
to believe that the private sector was too weak—that more
private sector jobs have been created in Wales to offset public sector
job losses. Women are taking up those new jobs. Some of them will need
extra skills training, and we are committed to helping provide that,
but I genuinely believe that the employment situation is not nearly as
grim as Opposition Members

We are seeing that across sectors. Actually, a great many women want to

review concludes that despite the determination and hard work of the
prosecution team (CPS staff and counsel), the approach to disclosure
did not consistently meet the necessary standards. It notes that this
was a very large case of about a million pages yet importantly also
highlights that a great deal of unused material was disclosed to the
defence and the number of disclosure decisions questioned at court
represented a very small proportion of the decisions
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071676000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/wmstext/130716m0001.htm#13071676000054">The
significance of the failure to disclose notes of police and CPS
contacts with key witnesses was substantial. Other errors were less
significant and some criticisms of the prosecution were unwarranted.
While many of the mistakes or oversights did not disadvantage the
defence or were capable of correction—and
corrected—during the trial, their cumulative effect enabled the
defence to undermine the confidence in the disclosure
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071676000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/wmstext/130716m0001.htm#13071676000055">The
review also found some errors of principle—in particular, the
prosecution took too narrow an approach to the disclosure test. The
narrow approach was a failure of case management, particularly the lack

work.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071676000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/wmstext/130716m0001.htm#13071676000056">Finally,
the review concluded that there was no evidence that prosecutors or
police disclosure officers made decisions for any improper reason. Some
mistakes were made in 
<?notus-xml column=66?>applying guidance but these represented a very small proportion of
all the disclosure decisions that were made and
many were discovered and corrected as a result of quality assurance
exercises. More detailed conclusions can be found within the report

review also recommends the prosecution should prepare a written summary
of the disclosure processes to be adopted including the rationale for
the parameters used when applying the disclosure tests as well as the
treatment of secondary source and duplicate material. The summary can
then be served on the defence and the court. Finally, recommendations
are made regarding the development of searchable IT systems to assist
handling of disclosure in large and complex

published in October 2012, I said that the funds from the Olympic
budget are still necessary in the transformation phase so we cannot
provide an absolutely final cost, but it remains highly likely that the
public sector funding package for London 2012 will come in under
£9

the games (PSFP) from the £377 million that I reported in
October 2012 to £528 million at end May 2013—an increase
in savings of £151 million. The £528 million includes the

the Syrian opposition protective equipment against chemical and

hoods protect against sarin gas for approximately 20 minutes, allowing
a person to move away from an affected area but not enabling them to
continue to fight. They do not require fitting or extensive training to
be effective. Pre-treatment with NAPs gives a person who is exposed to
a nerve agent, including sarin, a greater chance of reaching a place
where atropine can be administered under medical supervision. Chemical
weapons detector paper enables the basic detection of chemical weapons
agents. The capability to detect quickly whether chemical weapons
agents are present will inform decisions on whether or not to remain in
an area and so potentially save
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071676000296" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/wmstext/130716m0001.htm#13071676000296">The

reduce the use of animals, and, where animal use is unavoidable, to
refine the procedures involved so as to minimise suffering (3Rs). It is
key that we take these opportunities to ensure that replacement,
refinement and reduction in the use of animals is integral to
conducting animal research recognising that this not about baseline
numbers. The statistics published today are evidence of a significant
reduction in the use of animals for shellfish toxin testing. In 2009
the number of mice used in this test totalled 7,670 whereas in 2012

report a number of significant advances in this area. Over the past 12
months, the NC3Rs has secured new funding which has helped launch the
first 3Rs evaluation framework; made the biggest single investment in
3Rs research to date with new grant awards of £5.1 million;
supported new approaches to replace animal use with £750,000 for
interdisciplinary awards between toxicologists and mathematicians; and
awarded four fellowships for exceptional early-career scientists

and improved welfare. The wider programme encompasses collaborative
work led by the Home Office and the Department for Business, Innovation

the Home Office Minister responsible for ASPA, I was extremely
concerned to read the allegations of non-compliance at Imperial College
London (ICL) published by the British Union for the Abolition of

which may cause pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm is strictly
regulated under ASPA and I am determined to ensure that animal research
is carried out humanely and only when necessary. The provision of a
licence to an individual not only entrusts them to uphold their legal
obligations but also to behave in ways which ensure the highest
standards of animal care and welfare at all times. I take any reports
suggesting that individuals or establishments are falling short of the
high standards required by the Act very
seriously.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="13071676000487" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/wmstext/130716m0001.htm#13071676000487">I
have met with the ICL establishment licence holder and other relevant

by inspectors to licensed establishments, many of which are
unannounced, are an important aspect of determining compliance with
ASPA. An additional important role of inspectors is to advise those
working under ASPA and encourage best practice with respect to the 3Rs.
Inspectors have a right of entry to licensed establishments at all
reasonable times and ready access to all records and it is, therefore,
right and proper that they should investigate allegations when they are
made. Home Office inspectors have been investigating the allegations
against ICL at pace and I intend to publish a report later this

criminal sanctions. The requirements of section 24 are now out of step
with our policy on openness and transparency and with the approach
taken in other legislation, such as the Freedom of Information Act

academics, research bodies and other experts who contribute to the

mechanisms for how this will work at a later date but the key principle

Transport is an engine for growth and our major roads are vital to the
prosperity of our nation, connecting people to jobs and businesses to
markets. However, our roads have suffered from a lack of investment in
recent decades, and we face rising traffic in the years to come.

already under pressure, worsening the experience of motorists and
damaging Britain’s ability to
compete.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071676000441" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/wmstext/130716m0001.htm#13071676000441">That

investment in our road network, with £12 billion for road

environmental objectives issued to it by the Government and this

can be made against the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). These include
costs orders under Section 19 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985,
where an order may be made that one party pay the costs of the other
party to criminal proceedings. Such an order may be made when the court
is satisfied that the costs in question have been incurred by party A
as a result of "an unnecessary or improper act or omission by or on
behalf of” party B.</hs_Para>

also be ordered under section 19A of the same Act where an order may be
made against a legal representative that she/he pay "wasted costs".

been collecting up-to-date information on the school estate via the

full impact of the recent increases in student tuition fees on
graduates' decisions, as the new fee levels were introduced only in
2012. Student loans are different from other types of debt because they
are income contingent; borrowers will only repay at a rate of 9% of
their income above £21,000. This is higher than the repayment
threshold set for those subject to the tuition fee loan regime
implemented by the previous Administration in 2006, meaning loan
repayments are
lower.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716117000563" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/text/130716w0002.htm#130716117000563">No

customer can request a water meter and this must be installed for free.
The installation of a meter cannot, therefore, be cost prohibitive for
a customer. Where it is not practical for a company to install a meter,
or the cost of installation would be prohibitive for the company, Ofwat
obliges companies to offer customers an assessed charge. This charge
must bear as much relation as possible to the volume of water a

essential therefore that all responsible states are clear on what is
acceptable behaviour in cyberspace. Foreign and Commonwealth Office
officials have been at the forefront of this debate, including through
our membership of the UN Group of Governmental Experts, which includes
China, to find consensus on norms of state behaviour which are
underpinned by confidence building measures in cyberspace. The UN Group
of Government Experts' most recent meeting agreed a report on norms of

Lidington:</Member></B> The European Council, consisting of the Heads
of State and Government of the member states of the European Union, its
President, and the President of the Commission, has no formal
legislative power. It is charged under the Lisbon treaty with defining
the general political direction and priorities of the European Union.
Since the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 the number of subject areas
voted on by qualified majority voting in the European Council has
increased. The number remains small, however, and the decisions which
can be taken by qualified majority voting are for the most part
procedural or appointment decisions. For example, the appointment of
the President of the European Council is made through a qualified
majority vote in the European Council, as is the appointment of
double-hatted High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security
Policy. A right of veto in the European Council, however, is retained
in policy areas such as defence and most areas of common foreign and
security policy, also in the case of proposed treaty amendments, and
procedural matters such as the number of European Commissioners or the
composition of the European
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130716117000806" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/text/130716w0003.htm#130716117000806">The
Council of the European Union (“the Council”) is one of
the two legislative bodies of the European Union, the other being the
European Parliament. There are currently 10 different configurations of
the Council, each dealing with a different policy area. In each
composition, membership is made up of representatives of the
Governments of the member states, usually a Minister, who is
responsible for the area, with the chair being held by the member state
holding the presidency, apart from the Foreign Affairs Council, which
is chaired by the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and
Security Policy. Some of the subject areas decided by qualified
majority voting within the Council are education, health, the
environment, agriculture and fisheries, and equal opportunities. The
Lisbon treaty, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, also
extended qualified majority voting in the Council to a large number of
policy areas including transport, energy, tourism, and sport, and also
to certain procedural matters including amendments to the statute of
the Court of Justice of the EU. Policy areas decided by unanimity in
the Council include, but are not limited to, Council decisions relating
to the common security and defence policy, decisions on application for
EU membership by a European state and taxation
provisions.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="130716117000081" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/text/130716w0003.htm#130716117000081">G8:

in April 2013 the new delegated organisational structures recommended
by Lord Levene, we have been reviewing the operation of the Ministry of
Defence's corporate control framework and the processes that it
prescribes to ensure they are as transparent and easy to use as
possible. So far this has included simplified basic security guidance,
new business processes for managing defence infrastructure, revised
financial planning and performance management arrangements to support
the new delegated operating model, and a programme of incremental
simplification and improvement of our civilian HR policy, rules and
guidance in line with the goals of Civil Service Reform. There will be
more to do in this area as the operating model matures, particularly in
terms of further streamlining the Department's decision making process
around a single authoritative management information

Hoban:</Member></B> The DWP does not hold information regarding how
many people in receipt of benefits in 2012 suffer specifically from a
chronic pain condition. This is because for benefits that are not
linked to health conditions, such as jobseeker’s allowance, we
would not hold records pertaining to specific conditions that claimants
may have in a manner that would allow us to accurately capture the
statistics; we record the underlying health condition for employment
support allowance, (or those remaining on income benefit), those on
personal independence payments, (or remaining on disability living
allowance), or those on attendance allowance. However chronic pain may
be associated with a wide range of medical conditions and we do not
record chronic pain as a discrete entry.</hs_Para>

chronic pain is a general one that refers to persistent pain lasting
anywhere from 3-6 months. Therefore chronic pain can be a result of a
large number of diagnoses that cause pain. The medical condition of
incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance claimants and
employment support allowance is recorded using a grouped version of the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD10), and the only codes
that specifically indicate chronic pain are those for 'Chronic
intractable pain' and 'Other chronic pain', both of which come under
the general heading of 'Pain not elsewhere classified'.</hs_Para>

Under the employment support allowance (ESA) regime, claimants have to
undergo the work capability assessment. From April 2011 incapacity
benefit (IB) recipients also began to undertake this assessment. The
medical condition recorded on the claim form does not itself confer
entitlement to IB or ESA. So, for example, a decision on entitlement
for a customer claiming ESA on the basis of alcoholism would be based
on their ability to carry out the range of activities related to
physical and mental function, assessed by the personal/work capability
assessment.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><I>Source:</I></hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">DWP
