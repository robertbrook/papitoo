Commercial Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Deighton):</Member></B> My
Lords, fairness underpins the Government’s plans to reduce the
deficit. Universal credit will allow people to keep more of their
income as they move into work, while the personal allowance increases
announced by this Government will benefit 25 million individuals. As a
result of this Government’s actions, the richest pay more tax on
capital gains, more stamp duty on their homes and more tax on their
pensions, and they are less able to avoid or evade
tax.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Dubs" PimsId="3031" UID="1303117000307" xid="1109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000307">Lord
Dubs:</Member></B> Listening to that Answer, one would not be aware
that the disparities in wealth and income in this country have reached
record levels. Will the Minister confirm that 1% of the top earners
earn 10% of income? The Government are being criticised on the grounds
of their inequality policies by everybody from the bishops to the
anti-poverty lobby—people who know what is going on. Further,
does he not agree that when inequalities in a country get beyond a
certain level, as they have here, our social cohesion is
seriously
damaged?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deighton" PimsId="7002" UID="1303117000308" xid="2168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000308">Lord
Deighton:</Member></B> With respect to the 1% of the top taxpayers, the
first point I would make is that actually they are responsible for
paying 24% of income tax.  The top 10% pay just under
50% of income tax—I think it is 44%—so their contribution
to our revenues is the greatest in proportion. As for the development
of inequality since this Government came into office, the commonly
accepted measures of income inequality have in fact
decreased.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" PimsId="3285" UID="1303117000309" xid="1225" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000309">Lord

Deighton:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for that question. I am
not aware of the initial revenue yields. I asked the department
earlier, and it said that it did not break it down that way. My noble
friend clearly alludes to the importance in tax management of

unjustifiable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deighton" PimsId="7002" UID="1303117000312" xid="2168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000312">Lord

about the impact of equality and inequality on efficiency. All I can

consolidation of our

tax paid by the wealthy should be cut, public services for us all
should be cut and the incomes of the poor should be 
<?notus-xml column=3?>cut; and given that, taking these together, the effect is a

</B><B>Deighton</B><B>:</B></Member> There are a significant number of
issues in that question. At the heart of this Government’s
economic policy is that until we are able to balance our public
finances, it is extraordinarily difficult for us to grow this economy
in a sustainable way. All our policies are devoted to making sure that
we can consolidate our fiscal position and that the contribution to
making that happen is appropriately distributed, with by far the most
significant contribution coming from those who can afford most. At the
bottom end of society, we have a welfare system that works on the basis
of incentivising people to get back into work. I absolutely agree that
jobs transform lives. The 1 million-plus private sector jobs that have
been created are a welcome development in the
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000011"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Waddington" PimsId="4473" UID="1303117000315" xid="1107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000315"><B>Lord

about the increase in personal allowances is that it is a highly
progressive change in the tax system. It applies to about 24.5 million

from it in 2013-14, and it takes just over 2 million people out of the

the causes of some of these social challenges are broader than those

amount they have at their disposal is a lot less, just as my department

said on a number of occasions, we are a lot poorer than we thought we
were four years ago. Citizens Advice has been extremely successful in
lobbying and, as I have indicated, we have made more funds available.

has given the House a positive Answer, which I hope indicates that the
pro-rail consensus in this House is in good order. The Beeching report
was published 50 years ago this month. Its implementation cut off a
third of the network and deprived many parts of the country of access
to the railway. Does the Minister agree that one of the most shocking
parts of the Beeching legacy was the indecent haste with which so many
closed lines were sold off and the land built over, which made their
restoration expensive and often impossible? While the Minister’s
support for reopenings is good news, will he take a particular look at
schemes which run across local authority boundaries and which would
bring major benefits, such as the Lewes to Uckfield route and the
suburban lines around Bristol?</hs_para>

future strength and capability of our Armed Forces is dependent on
increasing our Reserve Forces to 30,000 by 2018, yet the Territorial
Army has declined by 1,000 over each of the last three years. In the
year up to this March, it looks as though the number of recruits will
be well below target. A Federation of Small Businesses survey showed
that even among members who are open to employing reservists, two out
of every five believe that the Government’s future requirement
that reservists serve and are away from their civilian jobs for one
year out of every five would negatively impact their business. What
action do the Government intend to take to accelerate recruitment to
our reserves; what incentives will be given to employers to hire
reservists; and what protection will be given to reservists to prevent
them being discriminated against in respect of both hiring and
promotion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:01:35"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000054"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Astor of Hever" PimsId="3811" UID="1303117000357" xid="1721" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000357">Lord

also remind noble Lords of the present situation for our many talented

Romania. Criminal prosecutions are pending against UK-based suppliers
in other countries. We should not allow this damage to the reputation
of our design market, potentially one of our great strengths. No
British jobs are at stake if we implement these amendments and fair
competition, as well as our international reputation, will be improved.

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to speak to
Amendment 84ZC in this group. I come from a slightly different
perspective from that of the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, because
there is particular concern among publishers that the giving of full
copyright protection to three-dimensional artistic works will impact on
those who create two-dimensional images of such works, including
publishers, museums, educational establishments and filmmakers, and
that designers taking inspiration from existing works will be
penalised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:12:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000071">There
is particular concern that this clause will have an adverse effect on
the publishers of books that include images and description of artistic
works. This consideration was wholly absent from the impact assessment.
Where such books currently include copyright material, they may
possibly come to be in breach of copyright as the images and
descriptions being used will have had their copyright term lengthened.
Furthermore, implementation of the clause will have a serious negative
effect on the future ability of publishers to produce such

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to add my support to the
comments that have been made so far this afternoon, but perhaps from a
different sectoral perspective. There are certainly a number of
concerns about how this clause will affect designers and manufacturers.
In particular, universities and colleges want to draw attention to the
fact that it will substantially affect teaching, research and design.
The ability to display photographs of designs is essential to the
teaching of design. The change in copyright terms for these articles
would mean that in future, any academics seeking to do this in a way
which is not covered by the existing exemptions—including any
digital reproductions such as displaying Powerpoint slides during a
lecture—would have to seek a licence to do so. This will also
apply to publishers reproducing photographs of industrially produced
articles, or museums which may wish to display such
articles.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000077">We
share concerns that this will frustrate the development of the creative
sector in the UK, and the teaching of subjects associated with it. As
has already been mentioned, the impact assessment focused very much on
the commercial uses of designs, such as manufacturers of replica
furniture and household goods. I believe that it should consult with
non-commercial users of designs which are currently covered by
Section 52 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988,
such

Buscombe:</Member></B> My Lords, I support my noble friend the Minister
in his Amendment 84A to Clause 67. It is a sensible
amendment that recognises that the IPO’s original Henry VIII
wording was not fit for purpose. If I may say so, it skilfully
overcomes legal and parliamentary complexities to meet this stated aim
of the Government since this clause was first introduced in another
place. As I understand it, the clause now maintains criminal penalties
for copyright infringement without inadvertently giving this or future
Governments power to introduce copyright

protection of designs is a hugely important part of the whole question

my noble friend on the Front Bench says. I understand the points that
have been made by my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones and others about
the desire of the people who might want to use this for other purposes,
but I feel very strongly that it is necessary to protect the property
rights of those who were responsible for the original design. As I
understand the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, that is
the intention that she has put
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000080">When I

amendments which my noble friend has tabled and to which reference has
already been made, I have been reassured. However, I still feel that
those who are responsible for creating the designs—they may be
designs of all sorts of artefacts and artistic works—should have
their rights properly protected. Having heard the noble Baroness, Lady
Whitaker, and having read some of the briefing on this from bodies that
represent designers of all sorts, I am not wholly satisfied that the

dissenting note in relation to what was said by the noble Lord, Lord

designs—for

improvement to extend the period of protected copyright in a registered
design from the 25 years that has prevailed for a long time
past to the proposed “life plus 70 years” period. The
effect would be to perpetuate monopolies held by designers and their

essential that there be a proper period of protection for intellectual
property and that designers and other originators of intellectual

O'Neill of Bengarve:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord
Howarth, has put his finger on the real difficulty for designers. It is
not that the period of copyright protection is too short; rather, it is
too ineffective. What is needed for our designers is some method of
ensuring that their designs are not ripped off extremely rapidly so
that they have no effective period of protection. I have heard it said
that new fashion designs that appear on the catwalks of London or Paris
are copied within a very few weeks, and the copies are then retailed in
our shops. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:24:29"></hs_TimeCode>If we
wish to protect our designers, as we surely should because they are so

something that was designed within a shorter but reasonable period of

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, as has already been
said, all of us around the House can welcome Amendment 84A. This has
been a troubled point that has caused difficulty in another place as
well as in Committee and here, so we welcome what has now been drafted.
We think it does the trick, given what it was intended to do, so we are
happy to put our weight behind it. However, it will be obvious from the
short debate that we have already had on this rather complicated set of
amendments on a rather complicated part of the Bill that not everybody
is happy with the direction of travel here. It is important to reflect
for a second on why that is.</hs_para>

debates are really all about whether the Government are right to delete
Section 52 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act and whether, by so
doing and so ending the current regime of registered designs, which, as
has been said already, has lasted for a good number of years, the
Government have really and fully considered all the issues that flow
from that decision. Implications would arise for products that are or
are about to be put out of rights protection under the present
registered design period of 25 years, and that will in future be
copyright for a period of 70 years after the death of the
designer. That is a substantial
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000089">As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:29:24"></hs_TimeCode> noble
Baroness just said—and I have a lot of sympathy for
this—there is growing concern that the whole approach, which is
reflected by this proposed change, goes against where good sense would
suggest the issues are going to go in the future. Some countries have
very little legal protection for copyright, and what there is is very
weak, and others are moving in different directions from us. What is
the point of trying to tie down longer periods during which protection
could be offered if you cannot also put forward the necessary
arrangements under which that protection is to be guaranteed?</hs_para>

is of course a case, and a very good one, to be made for letting
industrial designers have the same protection for their efforts as are
available to composers, writers and the like. However, there are still
some very real questions on this issue, which have led me to
put down the amendment, which would delay the implementation of Clause
66 and give us time to consider two very different and rather important
issues. The
first<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:29:24"></hs_TimeCode> is whether
this is the right decision, and if so how and on what basis it will be
introduced. We have not been given the detail here, we have not seen

Government have in mind.</hs_para>

and more importantly, a lot of what is being argued, or will I think be
argued by the Minister when he comes to respond, relates to the
exceptions and changes that have been forecast by the Hargreaves review
to the way in which copyright and copyright exceptions are organised.
This point was made by the noble Lord,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:28:05"></hs_TimeCode>
Clement-Jones, in relation to 2D design representations of 3D designs.
So much of 
<?notus-xml column=17?>what is going to change could, with the right sort of regulatory
framework brought in under the Hargreaves exceptions, allow some
guarantees and support for those involved. However, we simply do not
know enough about it, so surely
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:29:24"></hs_TimeCode> would be
better to see those regulations, take them through the due processes in
this House, agree them in their original form or as modified if that is
thought appropriate, and then consider whether Section 52 should be
changed and the new regime brought in.</hs_para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:28:47"></hs_TimeCode>give a bit more
detail on this. I asked the Minister in Committee, although I did not
get much of a reply and he has not included any further detail in the
letters I have received so far, why this proposal was not preceded by a
consultation with stakeholders and why the impact assessment that has
been published has very little detail about the impacts that will be
implemented by its changes.. The impact assessment, although it is not
complete, admits that the reform of Section 52 will harm consumer
welfare, as classic designs—those that are more than 25 years
old—will be remonopolised. Replicas that are currently available
at some 15% to 20% of the price of an original will no longer be
available, but no opportunity has been taken to consult consumers.
Moreover, there are those who argue that the impact assessment
significantly underestimates the other costs that will arise, partly
because of its focus on furniture and three-dimensional design, and
because it fails to acknowledge that section’s immunising
effects on certain secondary
uses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:32:09"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:29:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1303117000283" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000283">3.30

Government believe that the change would encourage innovation and
investment in design, but this is supported by the very flimsiest of
arguments in the impact assessment, and no new evidence is offered to
explain why the balance of interests between designer and owner, and
competitors and consumers, should be drawn differently today from how
it was in 1988 or indeed in 1994-95, when the Government successfully
negotiated to retain Section 52 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents
Act. As I have said, I am also concerned that we have no real idea yet
what, when Section 52 is repealed, the transitional arrangements will
be on existing stocks and on articles and designs such as wallpaper
that are out of copyright but which will now gain a further period of
protection.</hs_para>

the amendments, Amendment 84ZC would offer some comfort to museums,
teachers, publishers, photographers and film-makers. At present, they
can rely on Section 52 to justify the inclusion of their images of
mass-produced designs in catalogues, books, PowerPoint slides and
films. In the case of a number of art publishers, this freedom
represents the difference economically between a viable publication and
one that could not occur. For museums, it allows the inclusion of
images of such designs on websites and indirectly facilitates education

protect “follow-on designs”—that is, designs that
build on designs and use them to create new and innovative materials.
This is threatened by the proposed repeal of Section 52 because of the
strict test of copyright infringement that will, in effect, be applied
henceforth to the use of any design from the 20th century. The test of
infringement 
<?notus-xml column=18?>of copyright is the reproduction of any original part of the copyright
work; it does not matter how much the use has added. That means that
copyright can impede the use of design contributions that draw upon but
add to and transform a design.</hs_para>

contrast, in European design law the test of infringement of design
rights is whether the user’s design produces a “different
overall impression” on an “informed user”. This
test means that there will be no infringement where a second-generation
designer draws on existing design features but produces something that
is transformed into a new design. If copyright protection is to be
extended in time, as the Government propose, we think this is a
preferable test. Establishing impediments to follow-on designers is a
reckless move, particularly in the middle of a

that we need to be very careful here. It is well known that designers
build with and on the design ideas of their predecessors. I believe
that the extension of copyright term to “life plus 70”
will make this much more difficult because of the sheer length of the
term and because copyright protection is in many ways stronger than
design protection. In my view, this issue has not been given sufficient
weight, as we need to give careful consideration to the needs of future

exceptions, the limitation on criminal penalties does not apply. The
new clause no longer operates a separate power. It is now a way of

copyright in the underlying work. For example, a wallpaper that has

follow-on designs. There are concerns about what happens to copies of
an artistic work made after the expiry of the 25-year design protection

made, distributed or imported into the UK or communicated to the public

of points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth. He emphasised the
need for balance, and was concerned about the overly long term of
copyright. The term after the abolition of Section 52 will be the same
as for most other copyright holders. It will thus put furniture
designers of classic works in a position to be incentivised, as is the
case for any other creator. He also raised some concerns about the
benefits of design classics not reaching the greater public. Some
people see the availability of cheap replicas as good for consumers who
cannot afford the originals. However, designers argue that replicas
damage the integrity of the design industry and make British companies
less willing to support long-term investment in design than their
European competitors. Supporting British designers and offering greater
choice to consumers are not mutually exclusive and the Government hope
that the repeal of Section 52 should lead to UK designers developing
new designs in markets which become less dominated by copies of
artistic work. That would benefit consumers by offering them greater

84AA straightforwardly addresses a specific aspect—that is, the
duration of copyright in existing anonymous or pseudonymous works. The
amendment is designed to clarify the scope of the application of Clause
68. Rather more importantly, the effect of Amendments 84AB and 84AC
would be to prevent the Secretary of State being able to curtail the
period of protection in respect of unpublished pre-1988 Act films and
pre-1956 Act photographs, and in respect of other unpublished pre-1988
Act works whose authors are known and who died in the period from 1900
to 1989. This means that the copyright material covered by the
amendment will, unless published in the mean time, fall into the public

his correspondence on Clause 68; that correspondence has now extended
to quite a number of letters, which I have found extremely helpful.
However, no one would object to this clause if it simply solved a
problem about copyright protection attaching to centuries-old,
unpublished manuscripts and private charters. As regards works created
more recently, such as unpublished minutes of meetings and
correspondence from the 20th century, being within the scope of Clause
68, the Minister is clearly of the view, as he said, that these
provisions are part of the solution to the orphan works problem. In the
discussions about the copyright clauses in Grand Committee, I pointed
out that one of the difficulties was that the Government’s
policy had such an insubstantial evidence base. The Minister has now in
correspondence referred to the <I>Seeking New Landscapes</I> study by
Barbara Stratton. However, without going into great detail, there is
doubt as to whether generalisations can be drawn from that study. It
would be helpful to know what proportion of the material held by
archives and assessed as orphan is pre-20th century, and what
proportion of the 20th century material post-dates 1960. That, at
least, would give some indication of whether Clause 68 will in fact
make a significant contribution to reducing
orphanage.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1303117000284" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000284">3.45

Government have made clear that they are acting to reduce the number of
orphan works through this clause. It is thought, and the Minister
believes, that a large proportion of orphan works in cultural
connections are unpublished. Given the clear crossover with orphan
works—which is the subject of separate legislation in this
Bill—the Government should surely make clear how they intend for
unpublished works, which may also be orphaned, to be treated. In
particular, the Government should issue guidance on how a search
process to determine the date of creation will operate, and on when
potential users need to approach the orphan works licensing body; and
should make clear that unpublished orphan works will also still be

as I understand it, exercising the Clause 68 power, as

protection from the unpublished works of authors who died before 1
January 1943. Assuming that the clause came into effect before the end
of this year, it would have an immediate effect on only the unpublished
material of authors who died before 1943. It would have no effect on
post-1968 material, because for those cases the European directive
provides a term of 70 years from the end of the calendar year in which
the author died, rather than the fixed term to 2039 provided for in the

briefly to Amendment 84AD, the relationship between Clauses 68 and 69
is unclear, as I mentioned earlier, and will lead to legal uncertainty
as to what provisions apply to an orphan, anonymous or pseudonymous

likely to be orphan. Consequently, the administration should be subject
to the normal rules for orphan works, requiring a diligent search for
the rights holder. The amendment is required to clarify the scope of
Clause 68 in relation to orphaned works. If the work is an orphaned

68 contains a particular quirk of historic definitions in copyright law
that means that films and 
<?notus-xml column=24?>photographs are defined as published only when they are first hired,
sold or made available for hire. As most films are broadcast and
photographs appear in newspapers or magazines, they are not as such
published and therefore would fall under the scope of the clause.
Although on the one hand, the Government wants to use the clause to
allow organisations such as the British Library to publish mediaeval
manuscripts, it will also enable millions of commercially valuable
films and photographs to be put into the public domain. We
believe that that loophole can easily be fixed by including in the Bill
that unpublished photographs and films should fall outside
the scope of that power. The amendments solve that problem
in a clean and simple way and will give surety to concerned
rights holders but not impact of the valuable contribution that the
clause can make to organisations such as public libraries. I urge my

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak against Amendment 84AA
and the other amendments in the group. I refer back to the point made
by my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones about the scope and size of the
problem of unpublished works and grey literature. A study by the
British Library found that 43% of potentially in-copyright works
published between 1870 and 2010 were orphan works. The
figure for unpublished works, including letters, diaries, photographs
and memos is far higher, and grey literature produced by charities,
societies and associations but not for any direct commercial purpose,
also contain high concentrations of orphan works. One example of that
is a study of sound recordings of political debates in the 1960s, which
identified 350 performers, of whom only 100 could be traced, meaning
that more than 70% of the content was orphaned; 350 hours were spent
trying to clear the rights to use the material; and the success
rate—permissions received—was only 4%. That shows us the
size of the problem, which is why I am grateful to the Government for
the clarifications in the Bill and why we need to oppose the
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000128">Bringing
copyright for unpublished work into line with the existing copyright
duration would release much valuable historical data into the public
domain and would not affect unpublished works created shortly before
the 1988 transitional arrangements. As we have discussed in previous
stages of this Bill, works of these kinds are, of their nature, orphan
works. The copyright holders are incredibly difficult to identify. The
British Library notes that it still has material from the
7th century in copyright. As a result, a large amount of
material currently in copyright due to the transitional arrangements
would be difficult or impossible ever to obtain a licence
for.</hs_para>

important issues in them. At the outset, I will answer questions raised
by my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones, supported by my noble friend
Lady Brinton, about the voices concerned about the evidence for the

amount, but the National Archives estimates that around 12
million—or 42%—of the 30 million archival items held in
English and Welsh public archives predate 1891, which is over 120 years
ago. Therefore we are now likely to be 70 or more years past the date
of creation. The vast majority of these are thought to be unpublished
and would therefore remain in copyright under the current law until
2039. The law relating to the transitional provisions of the Copyright,
Designs and Patents Act 1988 is complex. The various points that have
been raised through these amendments and in debate underline that
complexity. These are important points, and it is right that we should

overriding policy objective has always been to enable use of
historically important unpublished material which has over-long

perpetual, and from 1998 it ran until 2039 at the earliest.
Because of the way the 1956 and the 1988 copyright
legislation interact, it appears that it may be possible for a film to
remain unpublished, even if it has been commercially
exploited by showing it to the public in a cinema or on television.
This is because it can be shown to the public by
various legal routes which do not technically constitute
publication: for example, public performance, exhibition or
communication to the
public.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000132">To

recognise this in the treatment of films in the regulations. Before

important for the impact assessment accompanying the regulations to
assess whether there are costs to specific rights holders or industry

my noble friend has raised a good point about the impact on commercial

relates partly to the provisions to reduce over-long copyright in some
unpublished works—which we spoke about earlier—and partly
to the orphan works licensing scheme. I can confirm that where there is
any doubt about whether an unpublished, anonymous or pseudonymous
orphan work is still within copyright, an orphan works licence could be

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
reply. In the light of it, I suppose that I should be grateful that I
do not have to trade discussion with my noble friend Lady Brinton about
the study instituted by the British Museum. There are many of us who do
not believe that Barbara Stratton’s report, <I>Seeking
</I><I>N</I><I>ew Landscap</I><I>es</I>, comes to conclusions that can
be generalised about in the way that some people have done by
extrapolating from it in a way that is not necessarily helpful,

that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1303117000137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000137">That
said, the way that the Minister has tied together Clauses 68 and 69, in
his undertaking that the orphan works provisions would come together
with unpublished works which were in copyright, is extremely helpful. I
am not quite sure how that is achieved by the actual wording of the
clause. One may wish to be rather clearer about when the duty of
diligent search applies, certainly in regulation, because it may not be
obvious from the outset that these works are orphaned and in copyright.
Some further probing may be necessary on that.</hs_para>

to the Minister for recognising it. I look forward to seeing what he

Collins of Highbury:</Member></B> My Lords, we also welcome UK
companies seeking access to growing markets across the developing
world. However, from the media reports at the weekend, the
Government’s policy was not clear. We are vehemently against
tied aid, trickle-down economics, and growth that has no focus on
either inequality or sustainability. I have two specific questions for
the Minister. Can she tell the House what steps her department will
take to ensure private sector-led projects by DfID will be required to
meet decent work and labour standards? Secondly, under what
circumstances does she believe it right that a British company should
be awarded a contract in a developing country without having to compete
in a fair and transparent tendering
process?</hs_para>

acceptance that economic growth through the expansion of businesses and
so on, is very important for developing countries, as it was in the
United Kingdom. As we have seen in China and India, it obviously has a
transformative effect. I reassure noble Lords that DfID remains poverty
focused. That underpins everything that we do. Therefore, in trying to
ensure the development of the private sector, it is so that those
long-term aims of relieving poverty are addressed. On how British
companies would be awarded contracts, as I said in the Statement from
my right honourable friend, contracts awarded to British companies by
DfID go through the EU procurement regulations. However, the focus of
DfID is always on the relief of poverty.</hs_para>

assure both noble Lords that DfID supports responsible business
standards, which are very relevant here, through various schemes such
as the Ethical Trading Initiative, the UN global compact, OECD
guidelines for multinational enterprises and so on. One striking thing
about the United Kingdom’s potential help for developing
countries is what we can offer by way of our law and justice system. I
was struck in meeting the Minister responsible for mines from
Afghanistan the other day to learn how initially they found that in
dealing with Chinese companies the benefit was probably not for
Afghanistan so much as for the Chinese companies, but that now they are
rooting it very much in British law guided by British companies. That
is an instance where it is of mutual benefit. Of course, it is of
benefit in business to the British companies working in this area, but
you can see immediately the effect in terms of the poorest in
Afghanistan. That is where the greatest benefit is. Therefore, these
things can be looked at as of not exclusive but mutual
benefit.</hs_para>

Elystan-Morgan:</Member></B> My Lords, I am left with the very clear
impression from the Minister’s Statement that there will be no
difference as far as the future is concerned in the total amount of aid
that is dispersed at every level and in every way. If that be so, I
heartily congratulate the Government. It is all very easy when the
going is benign and happy to be charitable, but it is in situations of
difficulty such as this that the true test of a community’s
charity is put to the proof.</hs_para>

Northover:</Member></B> I appreciate what the noble Lord has to say,
and I hope that he continues to say such things loud and clear, because
in a time of austerity there is a clamour of voices asking whether this
is the right thing to do. As we meet the 0.7% commitment, which we have
built to and kept to, we have a moral obligation to address the
difference in the levels of need around the world. There is also the
interest in terms of greater stability. If you are addressing the most
abject poverty around the world, that helps to stabilise things for
everybody, whether in that region or in our
own.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000150" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000150"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Tugendhat" PimsId="4350" UID="1303117000397" xid="1472" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000397">Lord
Tugendhat:</Member></B> Does the Minister agree that Africa is now one
of the fastest growing regions in the world and that we should all be
very pleased about that? Aid is now a relatively small proportion of
the disbursements that go from the developed world to what used to be
called the developing world. Remittances and direct investment have
grown enormously, and the role of aid is far less significant than it
used to be. It is not a question of this Government cutting back on
what they have been giving; the extraordinary thing about this
Government is that, at a time when they are cutting back on almost
everything else, they have been increasing the overseas aid budget by
30%. I find that barely explicable.</hs_para>

Northover:</Member></B> If the noble Lord listens to Bill Gates, for
example, he will hear how small contributions looked at globally can
leverage an enormous effect. The noble Lord is right that remittances
are coming in and there is more inward direct investment and so on, and
that is very welcome. We have to make sure that, as the noble Lord,
Lord Laming, indicated, the poorest are included in that benefit and
that there is the health and education provision to make sure that
there is a skilled workforce to benefit from this, because it is in
nobody’s interest to have countries with the instability and
inequalities that that lack of provision would ensure. It is extremely
important that we retain our commitment in this area, but at the same
time we must make sure that these other areas, such as direct
investment, grow as well and that they are to the benefit of the
poorest in these
countries.</hs_para>

the interjection that investors in mining in Afghanistan were advised
by British companies. When such advice from consultancy firms comes
from the aid programme is it subject to the same degree of open
competition? In developing countries, one sometimes hears that rather a

how such search should be undertaken. There is no amendment to this

this subject believe that it is very important that orphan works cannot
be sublicensed. The argument is clear that to permit sublicensing would
risk the distortion of the market through, for example, enterprises
that sought orphan works licences and then resold them to all comers,
circumventing the safeguards promised in the regulations. I do not know

debate, as has been mentioned, on the issues around diligent search. I
have also subsequently written to the noble Lords who spoke in that

diligent search for the all the rights holders in the work must be
undertaken. If as a result of an initial UK search there are
indications that the rights holders may be overseas, there will be a
requirement to expand the diligent search to include relevant overseas
territories. However, a balance must be struck between protecting
rights holders and making the system cost-effective for users. That is
why the orphan works working group is undertaking detailed work to
ensure that diligent search 
<?notus-xml column=33?>requirements reflect current best practice across all sectors. These

rights holders when works are not really orphaned, and it is important
to find the right balance between protecting rights holders and making
the system cost-effective. Extensive thought has already been given to
what should be done in a diligent search for different sectors,
including by the European digital libraries initiative. Existing
industry databases and registries and bibliographic publications are
just a couple of examples of sources of information that could be
searched. It is likely that searches would differ across the various
sectors, and therefore sector-specific guidance may need to be
developed. To that extent, this may help to answer some of the concerns

look for a legal owner, but we do not want a search regime that is too

84AEA would remove the option of licensing a work under the orphan

key part of the diligent search process. Indeed, it is in the
applicant’s interest to establish this fact, because if the work
is out of copyright they will be free to use it and will not need to
apply for an orphan works licence. However, it may not always be
possible to establish definitively whether a work is still in
copyright. This will particularly be the case with unpublished works,
where often key information such as the date of creation or the date of
the creator’s death is not known. Having to establish

appear on the face of it to be so. Therefore, I look slightly askance
at measures that say “streamline procedures” when
individual rights holders, if they exist, are to be ignored. I think
that we have common ground on proportionality, but the question is
where that lies. It will be useful to refer to the Minister’s

firmer commitment from the Government in the Bill is necessary to give
more reassurance to rights holders on the ECL provisions in Clause 69

as Amendment 28X in Gland Committee. An opt-out is available to

Grand Committee, the Minister committed the orphan works and extended
collective licensing working group to look into this issue as part of
its deliberations. While this commitment is welcome, there needs to be
certainty that any regulations for extended collective licensing will
include such provision. Since ECL has the effect of exercising property
rights, potentially against the will of the rights owner, the ability
to opt-out under subsection (3) of what will be the new Section 116B
must be as straightforward and easy to implement as possible. To
effectively administer the repertoire they have invested in, music
publishers will need to make catalogue-wide arrangements applicable to
hundreds, thousands, or potentially, millions of separate works. The
grant of rights and arrangements between creators and music publishers
are very often not exclusive assignments of copyright; grants can also
be made by way of licences, both exclusive and
non-exclusive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000187" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000187">It
will be unworkable to have an opt-out which is exercisable only by the
copyright owner or exclusive licensee. This would require a publisher
to go contract by contract, checking the nature of each grant of rights
and, where necessary, asking composers to sign opt-out documentation to
be sent to the body seeking to operate the scheme. If the opt-out could
be operated by the composer’s authorised representative, this
would give a publisher or other representative the right to seek the
permission from its composers to exercise an opt-out on their behalf,
which could then comprise one repertoire-wide opt-out from a rights
owner in a manageable
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000188" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000188">Practical
experience abroad is that, in the absence of this possibility, ECL
provisions can be manipulated by bodies operating schemes to make it
impossible for right owners to opt out in any manageable way. I am
informed by representatives from music publishing that one example of
this is the operation of the extended collective licensing
provisions enshrined in Hungarian copyright law in relation to the
performing right. In Hungary, one reason for the failure of
being able to rely on the opt-out came from the requirement of Artisjus
that the rights owner—not any representative—provide due
diligence evidencing ownership of each title in question. In relation
to a repertoire of many thousands of works, this represents a huge
barrier to successfully exercising the opt-out in terms of tracing the
title back to its source. It is often via a complicated chain,

Amendment 84AEB, copyright licensing bodies are indispensible in many
circumstances. For example, no composer could keep track of all the
playings of his or her song on television, radio, the internet and in
concerts, pubs, hairdressers, department stores and so on; PRS for
music does this collectively. However, this kind of licensing is
voluntary, meaning that the rights owner gave his or her permission to
PRS to license his or her works for use in broadcasts and public
performances. Extended collective licensing means that the licensing
body can also license works whose authors have not given

ECL—and we have debated this in Grand Committee—is
potentially dangerous to rights owners. A rights owner may not know
about extended collective licensing and find that his or her work has
been licensed without their permission. Perhaps they would not have
wanted it in that particular publication, or perhaps they had given
another publication an exclusive deal. Perhaps they would have charged
a different fee; if they had given permission direct, their fee would
not have suffered deduction of the licensing body’s commission.

fee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000194" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000194">The
Government’s explanations always described ECL as
“voluntary extended collective licensing”, but the fact
is that ECL allows the licensing body to license its rights without
their prior authorisation. It is government policy that the author can
opt out, but this acknowledges that the licensing body has permission
to license his or her rights in the first place. This permission is
ultimately given by the Government by authorising the organisation to
license rights that it does not in fact hold, not by the author who
must withdraw by opting
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303117000195" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#1303117000195">To their
credit, the Government have acknowledged the dangers inherent in ECL,

Government’s policy regarding safeguards for rights owners.
However Clause 69, which enables ECLs to be created by statutory

has now enunciated them. The Government have claimed that the Nordic
ECLs provide a strong precedent. However, the safeguards are set out in
the Nordic primary legislation. By “Nordic”, I mean
Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland. Setting out the

authorised body to be representative, the adoption of a code of

extended collective  
<?notus-xml column=38?>licensing. The Government have publicly committed to many of these
safeguards in some form or other. I thank my noble friend for his

them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031134000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#13031134000003">As there
are a large number of amendments in this group, I will respond to them
by reference to a set of themes. Amendments 84AFA, 84AFB, 84AGA, 84AGB,
84AGC and 84AGD are essentially consequential in nature, and so I will
not deal with them directly. Amendments 84AEB, 84AEC, 84AED, 84AEE and
84AEF seek to provide clear safeguards against an unwanted extension of
the scope of collective licensing, and to define the characteristics of
a body which can be authorised to operate ECL
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031134000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#13031134000004">The
need for safeguards is absolutely beyond dispute. A working group which
includes creators of photographic, audiovisual, literary and musical
works is helping us to develop these safeguards into draft regulations.
I gave commitments during Grand Committee on some of the issues the
working group would be asked to consider, such as those raised by
Amendment 84AED. The Government will consult on these draft regulations
before asking Parliament to approve them. The Government feel that
regulations can more easily be adapted to keep safeguards effective in
the light of market changes. Such adaptability ensures that the scheme
continues to protect creators’ interests. Regulations can also
more easily be adapted to emerging best practice; this better prevents
abuses. The Government’s approach will still allow for a
comparable level of safeguards to those found in primary legislation in
other
jurisdictions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031134000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#13031134000005">My
noble friend Lord Clement-Jones raised the issue of the Nordic
protections which are in primary legislation, a topic also alluded to
by my noble friend Lady Buscombe. The UK proposals include similar
safeguards, such as the right to opt out and a test of representation,
and a different legislative route that has been used to provide
future-proofing. However, not all Nordic ECL provision is for specific
uses. For example, the Danish Act includes provision for a
“general” ECL. Some vital safeguards are on the face of
the Bill: the right to opt out and the requirement that ECL can be
authorised only for specific types of works and rights. Applications to
operate ECL would be authorised only on the basis of significant,
demonstrable support for collective management in relation to the
specific licence. This would need to include evidence that the
applicant—a significantly representative licensing
body—has the consent of its members to apply for the
authorisation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031134000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#13031134000006">My
noble friend Lord Clement-Jones raised the issue of ECL. If I have him
correctly, he described ECL as potentially dangerous and questioned the
description of it as voluntary. Noble Lords have queried our
description of our proposals as voluntary, but they are voluntary
because the Government will have no power to impose ECL on a sector.
This is not compulsory collective licensing; it will be for a relevant
licensing body which will require the explicit consent of its members
to choose whether to apply. For non-member rights holders, I accept
that ECL, where it 
<?notus-xml column=39?>applies, shifts collective management from opt-in to opt-out. This is
why the Government are committed to a series of safeguards to ensure
ECL is authorised only when there is a demonstrable case for it, and to
make sure that rights holders have the opportunity to exercise their
opt-out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031134000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#13031134000007">In

relation to Amendments 84AEE and 84AEG, the Secretary of State will
decide whether to grant or reject an application and to set the

have the power to revoke an authorisation, should that prove necessary.
The Government believe that this may be a more efficient process than a
referral to the Copyright Tribunal. Following discussions with the

turn now to the question of the opt-out, and I hope that my subsequent
comments on the subject of exclusive licensees will be helpful to my

opt out of ECL schemes. In Grand Committee, I made a commitment that
the working group on extended collective licensing would be asked to
consider whether the right to opt out should be extended to exclusive
licensees and their representatives. The Government take the opt-out
protection seriously. If it becomes clear that an extension of the
provisions to cover exclusive licensees and representatives is
necessary, the Government will act on that basis. However, I do not
want to pre-empt the work of the working group, given my Grand
Committee commitment.</hs_para>

cultural institutions of our country hold tens of millions of orphan
works in their collections. The Joint Information Systems Committee of
the Universities Funding Councils estimated that there might be some 25
million orphan works in its sector. The National Museums
Directors’ Conference estimates 50 million in its sector. The
British Library considers 
<?notus-xml column=42?>that perhaps 40% of its in-copyright collections consists of orphan
works. As the law now is, there is no way that this great wealth of
resources can be licensed for use. Orphan works remain quarantined. In

are we speaking of? In the first instance, we are talking about books.
The British Library’s exercise, the results of which were
published in <I>Seeking new Landscapes</I>, found when it took a
representative set of titles published between 1870 and 2010 that 43%
were potentially in-copyright orphan works. There is unpublished
material in vast quantities. Take, for example, material relating to
World War I, the centenary of which we are about to start to
commemorate. There are personal photographs, letters and diaries. There
is more recent material; the Wellcome Trust has a collection of posters
about HIV and AIDS. Of the 3,674 posters, 2,601—71%—were
found to be orphans. These orphan works represent resources on an
extraordinary scale and of extraordinary potential cultural,
educational and economic value. They have the potential to stimulate
new research, extend knowledge and excite new creativity and
innovation. If they were made available to the public there would be
enhanced public interest and enjoyment of the contents of our national
collections.</hs_para>

none of those benefits is possible now. Orphan works remain in limbo.
Under the current law, if institutions digitise this
material and exhibit it, they are acting illegally. It happens to an
extent for the good reasons that I have suggested. It is absurd and
wrong that a law that is unfit for purpose should criminalise
academics, curators and professional people who are scrupulous about
copyright. They are active users and generators of copyright
themselves, and their whole ethos is to use these public collections
for the public good. I emphasise that everyone agrees that it is
essential to protect the legitimate interests of rights holders. Where
we see that certain rights holders may have genuine grounds for being
anxious about their interests, we must acknowledge and accommodate
their concerns in the regulations.</hs_para>

digital photographers, for example; it is too easy at the moment to
create a fraudulent orphan work by stripping from a digital photograph
the metadata that provide the attribution of intellectual property.
This happens—not in the great public cultural
institutions to which I have been referring, but it does
happen. Until a solution is found for this particular problem, probably
a technological solution, it would be appropriate to exclude digital
photography that originated as digital photography from the scope of
licensing of orphan works. The British Library and CILIP would be
content if that were done. Meanwhile, vast quantities of analogue
material from the 20th century are in archives which, if
they could be brought into public exposure and use, would constitute no
genuine threat to modern photographers. They would not undercut the

this amendment, we will lose the benefits of Clause 69 and Schedule
21—the benefits of releasing these orphans into the world. A
requirement that royalties and licence fees should be paid upfront for
the use of orphan works would be unnecessary and damaging. There will
be, absolutely rightly, a requirement that a diligent search should be
made before application is made to the licensing authority. If, as a
result of the diligent search to find the rights holder they have still
not been found, there is a strong probability—indeed, a virtual
certainty—that the work is orphan. The institutions testify and
can demonstrate that it is very rare that a rights holder appears. If a
rights holder does appear, where we are speaking of digital library
projects which would provide free access to students, scholars, and the
general public, it is very unlikely that the holder would require
payment: they recognise the educational and public benefit of sharing
their property.</hs_para>

the National Portrait Gallery to list orphan works on its website when
it places images of them online. Over 10 years, fewer than
10 rights holders have appeared, and all have been content that the

requite the rights holders, and those sums can be found from the cash
flow of the institutions, and certainly from their reserves. The
argument that upfront payment is a necessary insurance is wrong. It
would be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut; it would be an
unnecessary, bureaucratic, costly diversion of funds from our cultural
institutions; and it would be very damaging. Fees required to be placed
in an escrow account with the licensing authority would be sterilised.

Let me also say again that they are more than happy to pay royalties

require that licence fees be paid not for the benefit of rights
holders—who will not appear, or, if they do, will not want to

publicly funded institutions. Indeed, it would be a double tax: it
would be taxing grant-in-aid that had already been provided by the
taxpayer. Where charitable funds are in question, it would be a levy on
those.</hs_para> <hs_parafo UID="13031134000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#13031134000095">It
would be an impossible, as well as an inappropriate, burden. Public
funds have already been substantially cut to our public cultural
institutions, which are struggling to cope with their depleted
finances. An upfront licence fee would be an impost on the top of other
substantial costs that are appropriate and necessary: for example,
diligent search, which we have already spoken about, is very expensive.
A diligent search carried out by the Wellcome Trust on the AIDS posters
required 132 days of staff time—this is just one
instance. The costs of diligent search, digitisation, curation online,
maintaining online services and of the contribution for the
administration of the licensing authority would all already be there.

institutions already face major financial hurdles and costs. If extra,
unnecessary, costs are added through the requirement to pay upfront

Howarth, in this amendment. It is extremely sensible, very simple and
allows for flexibility, which is what we want. The concept of licensing
for orphan works and for extended collective licensing is important if
we are to disseminate things that we want to do and see. More and more
programmes, books and so forth now dwell on our recent past. In this
case, “recent”, when it comes to copyright, means the
lifetime of the author plus 70
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031134000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0001.htm#13031134000043">The
situation gets confusing. First, if one of your Lordships were to send
someone a postcard, the copyright—wherever that postcard ends up
and whoever buys and sells it and owns it later—would
subsist for their lifetime plus 70 years. The next confusion
is the assumption that copyright resides with the person who
wrote the document. Let us suppose that someone tries to produce a
study of an incident that happened between the wars. Indeed, a similar
issue arose the other day when someone asked whether they could use a
letter from my great-grandfather and whether I would grant copyright.
There is a certain technical problem. I presume that they had looked at
all the wills between my great-grandfather, my grandfather, my mother
and myself to find out that I was the residual legatee; or that each
was the residual legatee of each will; or that the copyright in this
particular case had not been assigned to someone else. How on earth
would you prove that? It would be totally impossible. For things that
were never designed to be commercial, the concept of trying to trace
the person who owns the copyright is ridiculous and is just a
non-starter.</hs_para>

You are telling them to act illegally. You can possibly do that as a
private person and say, “They are not going to dare to sue

other such public bodies and charities to break the law. It is the
wrong way to treat the law. As a result, we need something more
sensible. That is why this entire clause is there, to try to solve the
problem. But think of the millions of pounds involved if we charge even
one penny per potential orphan work. We heard the figures a moment ago
from the noble Lord, Lord Howarth. I do not believe that there should
be a presumption of an upfront payment unless it is a small
administrative charge. There should be no payment that tries to reflect
the number of orphan works that might be involved, particularly if it

feel that most taxpayers think that they know how to spend their money
better, so for this to be a covert tax is not a good idea. I also find

Lord Young nodding over there—when I was successful in
persuading them to accept a new definition of what an orphan work
actually was, so that people would be in no confusion as to what they
were dealing with. Unfortunately, this was the declining days of that
Government and that part of the legislation disappeared in the wash-up.
I wonder whether the Minister might look back to the <I>Hansard</I> of
that period for the redefinition of orphan works and, perhaps at a
later stage of this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:22:41"></hs_TimeCode>, bring it
back in.</hs_para>

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a very
powerful debate. In contradistinction to what have been discussing in
the immediate run of amendments, this seems to be a situation where the

legislation. My point would be, to support the comments made on this

the words that my noble friend used—underused, understudied and
undercelebrated. There is no contention that the repositories in which
these works lie are happy to pay for the cost of the administration of
the scheme that is to be used to provide access to them. The concern is
that by providing a very inflexible approach to this, these
institutions will effectively have been taxed to provide funds which
will go to the Crown under the bona vacantia rules. This seems
extraordinarily unfair and I urge the Government to think again about
this issue. I am aware that it has already been the subject of some
discussion and debate but, given that we have at least another 10 days
until the final stages of this Bill, perhaps there is still time for
the meeting or discussion that I might encourage the Minister to have.

too far. However, there are other ideas around, such as that the escrow

Lord, Lord Howarth, for his amendment. I do not underestimate the

orphan works. I have listened very carefully today to his argument. As
he well knows, I listened carefully in Grand Committee and, indeed,

principles of the Government’s proposals that remuneration is
payable for the use of an orphan work. Making payment discretionary
would risk undercutting the market. It would also risk rights holders
not receiving the remuneration that they would otherwise be due.
Therefore, to avoid unfair competition, it should not be cheaper to use
an orphan work than a non-orphan work. Where cultural institutions are
acting commercially, it seems only fair that they do not receive
preferential treatment to other parties licensing in the
market.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031134000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031134000054">I can
assure the noble Lord that in setting the tariff of remuneration the
Government will ensure that, as far as possible, it reflects the
appropriate tariff for the same type of use of a similar non-orphan
work. Where an orphan work is not being used commercially the licence
fee will reflect that. In such cases, the fee could be minimal. My
officials are consulting the competition authorities about how tariffs
are determined.</hs_para>

of questions raised by noble Lords, in particular the noble Lord, Lord
Howarth. First, he suggested that excluding digital photographs from
the orphan works scheme might be a possibility. A stakeholder working
group will be considering the possibility, at least initially, of
excluding from the scheme photographs without an analogue
context—so photographs merely taken from the internet would not
qualify for an orphan works licence.</hs_para>

Howarth, suggested removing the principle of upfront payment and his
views were very clear on that basis. We cannot, however, expect
cultural institutions to ride over the rights of creators even in the
interests of the public good. Of course we hope that there will not be
returning rights holders. We hope that diligent search will identify
any such people. However, the principle of upfront payment is an
important one. Abandoning the principle of upfront payment is a
guarantee to creators that even if their 
<?notus-xml column=49?>works are missed in the search, they will not be deprived of an income.
The fact that rights holders may be content to allow their works to be
used is not a reason for trying to reduce their legal rights. In many
cases, the payments may be minimal, indeed nominal.</hs_para>

Howarth, also raised unclaimed licence fees—an issue alluded to
by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll. The authorising body will hold
unclaimed licence fees in an escrow account. Unclaimed fees could be
used to subsidise the cost of running the orphan works scheme, or to
pay for preservation costs in public institutions or industry training.
There will be further consideration of these options with the input of
stakeholders.</hs_para>

Howarth, raised the issue of a renewable term and the fact that he was
not in favour of it. To allow for business certainty, there will need
to be some limit on how long an orphan work can be used before a new
authorisation would be required. Any returning rights holder would
receive remuneration for this period of time and would be able to stop
further use at the end of the period if they so wished. The metrics for
determining the durations of licences have yet to be decided. In some
cases, it might be a period of time, in others it might be something
else such as a print run. Therefore, there will be further
consideration of how charges are determined but licence fees will be
appropriate to the type of work and use proposed. I hope that, with
those reassurances, the noble Lord will not press his

disappointed indeed with the Minister’s reply. I have
appreciated his willingness to meet me formally and informally, and I
am sure that he understands the arguments that I am putting forward.
However, what is frustrating is that in my speech I anticipated each
argument that he put forward. There is no reason to suppose that orphan
works would undercut the market, whatever the market may be, for
whatever apparently comparable material. He did not illustrate how that
might work, and I find it hard to imagine why that should be the case.
He said that the tariff needs to be equivalent, but we are talking
about a multiplicity of different sorts of material. It is very hard to
see how a scale of tariff can be used to match things that come up as
orphan works with things that are constantly appearing anew as
commercial copyright material. He said that the unclaimed fees could be
used for several purposes. No doubt they would be 
<?notus-xml column=50?>good purposes, and it is comforting to an extent that they are not to
disappear into the maw of the Treasury, or of the general Exchequer,
but he did not deal with the point that the unclaimed fees would amass
to a very large amount of money indeed, even if, as he assured us, the
fee per item would be minimal, simply because of the volume of this
material. I was entirely unpersuaded by his arguments.</hs_para>

commitment to hold meetings with a view to achieving an amendment that
satisfies the interests and proper concerns of the great cultural
institutions of this country, I will be happy not to press my amendment

willing to do so, but if he is not willing to try once more to see

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, there is currently in many cases
an imbalance in economic power between the creator and those with whom
they are dealing on copyright. I moved an amendment similar to this in
Grand Committee, and at that time the Minister said that the Unfair
Contract Terms Act is intended to regulate only business to consumer
relations. Of course that is correct. The Minister has, however, agreed
to see what can be done by way of review within the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills of this type of
issue.</hs_para>

amendment is designed to elicit from the Minister an assurance that
this work will be undertaken. I have sent the Minister a paper
suggesting how such a review might take place. It would be an
independent review of copyright contracts for creators and would
explore how copyright contracts could be made fairer to ensure that
creators receive a fair share of the money that consumers pay for
copyright content and that the purpose of copyright in stimulating and
sustaining creativity is
met<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:45:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that such a review might consider are those with publishers,
broadcasters, record labels and film studios; creator’s
contracts with, and mandates to, collecting societies; and contracts
with internet platforms such as Flickr. Some possible solutions for the
review to explore—I am not going to go through them
all—might include whether the doctrine of undue influence that
applies when a person in a 
<?notus-xml column=54?>dominant position uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage for
himself or herself could be codified in statute law; or whether, for
instance, a right to equitable remuneration for creators is a necessary
underpinning to fair contracts for creators; and whether model licences
and codes of conduct could extend the benefit of collective
negotiations through professional bodies to a wider range of creators,
particularly new entrants to the entertainment industries and
consumers-turned-creators<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:46:35"></hs_TimeCode>.

Buscombe:</Member></B> My Lords, I support this amendment, to which I
have added my name. I support everything my noble friend Lord
Clement-Jones has already said. This amendment would go some way to
mitigate risks to the individual creators, without whom there is no
creative economy. We have here more risks of unintended consequences of
the government proposal for extended collective licensing. Already
before the passage of the Bill, there is renewed pressure on individual
creators to sign away to publishers all their rights, including rights
to income from extended collective licensing. While creators are
vulnerable to the take-it-or-leave-it approach in contracts offered by
powerful organisations, the likelihood is that creators will thus be
deprived of the compensation for the use intended by the drafters. I
should add that we have had so much correspondence in this regard that
we are looking to my noble friend the Minister for strong
reassurance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031134000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031134000066"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Jenkin of Roding" PimsId="1169" UID="13031134000555" xid="1291" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031134000555">Lord
Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, I support this amendment. As I
understand it, there has been a presumption in some way that the Unfair
Contract Terms Act applies only to dealings between business and the
consumer. Of course, there are in the field of copyright—indeed,
I suspect in many aspects of intellectual property—areas where
there is a substantial imbalance between the negotiating power of the
intellectual property owner and the prospective
licensee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:48:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Department for Culture, Media and Sport has been impressed by this
argument. I have been told that there are discussions currently going
ahead with my noble friend’s department to see if there is some
way in which this imbalance could perhaps be recognised in the law. It
might well not be possible to do it in this Bill, and on that I wait to
hear my noble friend’s argument. I would like to be assured that
the discussions going on within government—I understand this may
be between the two departments—will continue so that there can
be a proper examination to see whether this extension could be made in
some way. There is no doubt about it; someone has to deal with what at
the moment looks, to many of the people in the creative industries,
like a very unfair balance. It is part of the duty of government to see
that that is put right. I hope my noble friend will be able to give us

Earl of Erroll:</Member></B> My Lords, we need to move somewhere in
this direction, so I support this amendment. The unfairness of
copyright law recently came home to me. Someone wanted to publish a
book involving some of my ancestors, and asked whether they could 
<?notus-xml column=55?>use some material that I had at home. I replied, “Certainly, I
would be delighted”. Then they said, “We need a release
document”. They put a contract in front of me that said that
they would have total rights to this material throughout the universe,
known and unknown, in media not yet developed, incorporated and not
incorporated—this, that and the other. The only thing it did not
include was parallel universes. The contract said that I would have to
defend the copyright whenever and wherever required, at my cost. I was
not receiving anything for this; I was simply trying to be kind and
helpful to someone who was making a documentary. I asked someone legal
about it who said, “Oh, they probably couldn’t enforce it
because it’s an unfair contract”, but apparently it is
not because unfair contracts do not apply to copyright. I therefore
asked whether other people had signed this, and was told, “Oh
yes, they’ve signed them. Don’t worry, I’m sure
nothing will happen”.</hs_para>

people to sign these things. Something will come home to roost. You
only have to look at the chancel repairs bills that some people receive
as a result of things signed long ago, which come home to roost
generations later. This copyright thing would, if I had signed it,
presumably have burnt my heirs and successors as well for the period of
that copyright. This is potentially quite serious, which people
are ignoring. They think that it will go away and that it
does not matter because it is so over the top. I struck through all the
relevant clauses in the contract and said, “Right, you can have
whatever rights you want to it, but you defend it and look after
it”. I never heard any more and they never used the material,
which is sad.</hs_para>

are preventing its dissemination. We have to open up and start being

therefore, I definitely support the noble Lord, Lord

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I start by answering a
question that my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones raised at the
beginning. Well, it was more of a point, really. He said that he had
sent a paper to me on how the issue of unfair contracts could be
addressed. I confirm at the beginning that I have received this paper
and that we will consider his suggestions very carefully. It is a
little early to talk about this as a formal review, but I reassure him
that we will certainly discuss this and take it
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:53:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031134000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031134000072">However,
I thank my noble friends for this amendment. I understand that
individual creators can be at a disadvantage when negotiating contracts
with intermediaries and large organisations. However, I believe that
amending the Unfair Contract Terms Act in this way, as intended by this
amendment, would not address these concerns. My noble friend Lord
Clement-Jones is aware that we have had discussions on this outside the
Chamber. This is because the provisions of this part of the Act are
limited in scope. Section 3 
<?notus-xml column=56?>applies only where one of the parties is a consumer, or is on the other
party’s non-negotiated standard terms of business. However, we
should also consider the overarching point. Successive Governments have
maintained the principle that businesses should be able to contract
freely with each other, and that the Government should not unduly
fetter or circumscribe this
freedom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031134000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031134000073">My
noble friends have raised valid concerns about individual creators.

issue is not whether or not to amend this particular Act. As the
Minister says, the Unfair Contract Terms Act does not apply to
copyright or business-to-business transactions. Therefore, the essence
of this is that, where many of these small creators are small
businesses, we need to find a mechanism that will create a more level
playing field with some of the larger contractors with whom they want
to do business, and to find some way in which those transactions can be
reviewed in the way that I

I sent him, which I confess was drawn up by the Creators’ Rights

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I am afraid that this House will
get rather tired of my voice over the next few minutes. I beg to move
Amendment 84AHA. This amendment seeks to clarify the matters to be
taken into account by a court in exercising its discretion to award
additional damages in certain cases of copyright infringement. The
power to award such damages for copyright infringement is contained in
Section 97 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, and Section
191J covers infringement of performers’ rights. As the
provisions are identical in form, I will speak only to copyright
infringement.</hs_para>

a form of damages that are intended to have a punitive or deterrent
effect on the infringer, and are awarded in exceptional cases, in
addition to the compensatory damages based on a reasonable royalty that
are the usual remedy for copyright infringement. They are often
referred to as “flagrancy damages”. Some kinds of
copyright infringement are carried out with such flagrant disregard for
the rights of the copyright owner that it is appropriate to have a
sanction available to the civil courts that both contains an element of
punishment of the infringer and which, more importantly, acts as a
deterrent to others who might consider doing something similar. The
sanction is not often used, but has been applied, for example, where
the defendant has already been found to have infringed and then repeats
the
infringement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031134000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031134000081">This
amendment will bring the provision up to date to reflect the changes
being made by this Bill in relation to orphan works. Your Lordships
will recollect that it is proposed that before any work can be declared
an orphan it must be subject to a diligent search for its owner. There
is considerable disquiet in some parts of the creative community about
how conscientious all those who wish to use orphan works will be in
carrying out such a search. Of course, we expect that in due course
there will be some detail, which the Minister has described in detail,
of the requirements set out in the relevant regulations. They will be
designed to minimise the possibility that people will take
inappropriate advantage of this
provision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031134000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031134000082">None
the less, given the enormous potential commercial benefits, it is
entirely likely that some organisations will seek to test how little
they have to do by way of diligent search. In particular, one of the
concerns raised with me is that a potential user may argue that, as
they have carried out a search in relation to one item in a group of
works, they should be permitted to assume that the result will be the
same for the others, and that they are relieved of the need to carry
out separate searches. We debated this only a few groups
ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031134000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031134000083">The
protection that this affords to people is that before their work can be
declared an orphan and used without their authorisation, there must be
a diligent search. This simple amendment deals with the temptation 
<?notus-xml column=58?>to use the orphan works provisions in a manner that is clearly not
intended by the Bill. It spells out that failure to carry out a
diligent search will be one of the considerations that the court takes
into account when deciding whether or not to award additional damages.

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 84AHA returns to
the subject of diligent search, something that was discussed in one of
the earlier groupings. I understand and sympathise with the intention
behind this amendment. However, the Government are not convinced that a
failure to obtain an orphan works licence legally should be treated as
an aggravating factor over and above any other form of copyright
infringement. There are already provisions in the 1998 Act for special
damages, but the general principle of law at issue is that civil
redress is about compensation rather than punishment. The Government
feel that the courts should be in the best place to determine damages
in the light of the circumstances of each case. I hope that in this

requirement that the moral right be asserted is widely agreed not to be
a particularly useful concept. Discovering whether a right has been
asserted is in many cases, for practical purposes, impossible. It was
noticeable that the Minister confirmed in our previous discussion of
orphan works that it would not be necessary in certain circumstances
that a right be asserted. In the case of a photograph, for example, it
may be necessary to refer to the invoice for payment for the licence
for first publication. A consultation held following the debate on the
Digital Economy Act could find no reason to retain the requirement to
assert the right of identification, and I am aware of no body that is
strongly attached to retaining this

believe that the Intellectual Property Office has indicated that it is
proposed that a right shall be treated as being asserted, and this was
confirmed today, in respect of orphan works in the regulations proposed
under Clause 69. This amendment therefore makes an important amendment
to the Copyright Act and makes the situation uniform. All authors and
performers having the right to be identified is an essential
precondition for measures to permit licensing of orphan works and to
help to prevent the creation of new orphans. More will be required to
strengthen this right and to protect the metadata that contains the
identification of authors and performers, but this is an important
start. It would remove a serious barrier to the ordinary citizen having
a right to be identified in the first place, since they are very
unlikely to be aware of the requirement to assert. I beg to

not know about this, as it is a requirement that will be hidden in the
legislation. I cannot for the life of me understand why he has to do
this in advance, as it were. It is an unnecessary restriction and
requirement to be placed on the shoulders of an individual, perhaps an
artist, writer or musician, who says that they are the author and owner
of an intellectual property, only to be told that they have not

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord’s
proposed amendment would make automatic the right to be identified as
the author of a work. Currently Section 78 of the Copyright, Designs
and Patents Act 1988 provides that moral rights, including the right to
be identified or attributed, must be asserted to take effect. The
Government appreciate that there is a legitimate debate around the
issue of moral rights, particularly the right to attribution. Some
stakeholders would like to see the moral rights of creators
strengthened further. The Government acknowledge that there are
creators who would like to see the right of attribution become
automatic and some who would also like it to be unwaivable. We are also
aware, however, that other creators take the view that moral rights,
such as the right of attribution, can have an economic value. These
creators argue that they should be free to decide whether to exploit
that value.</hs_para>

a complex area on which creators hold strong and often differing views.
The economic question of the cost of using works is an important one.
Changing the law on moral rights would affect many groups in different
ways. It is not an insignificant question and would require a full
consultation. I hope that these words help to answer some of the
questions raised by my noble friend Lord Jenkin and that, in the light

legitimate debate. There are, of course, a number of aspects of moral
rights that are debatable, not only the automatic right stated in this
amendment but also the issue of waiver, the question of the economic
value of moral rights and so on. This amendment was a way of putting a
marker down that this is an area that is somewhat archaic. If we are
going to move on, especially when the new exceptions come into play, we
must look at further aspects of reform of copyright law, such as the
way in which contracts are made with creators, aspects of moral rights
and metadata. This is an area that the IPO could very usefully focus on
and, in the next round of legislation, look and see whether we can get

Bill. Of course, I was pleased to do so. Since then, I now find myself
on the Front Bench and fortuitously in a position to lead the
opposition position on this issue. It must also be said that the noble
Lord, Lord Gavron, is also a generous supporter of the High Pay Centre,
which has conducted a great deal of important research on this subject.
Based on discussions that the noble Lord had with the noble Lord, Lord
Marland, and others, he felt that the Government had taken his points
on board and in consequence he withdrew the Bill. To their credit, the
Government have indeed incorporated some of the points made in the
Gavron Bill, but I believe that this Bill can still be improved on.
That is what we are seeking to

the heart of the matter lies the empowerment of shareholders. Just in
case noble Lords question my position in speaking on this subject, I
add a little personal background. From 1972 to 2006, I set up numerous
businesses. Some were very successful, some were total disasters. I
will make no further reference to the Soho restaurant that vanished
without trace. I lost a packet and there were several others like that.
On the other hand, I have had my notable successes. I have been in the
IT services business most of my adult life. I created three businesses
from scratch, built each of them over 10 or more years and then sold
them. Each company became a market leader and two of them were
international operators. Not surprisingly, I dwell upon my successes
these days although it must be said that the failures made me a better
man. I learnt one golden rule: stick to what you
know<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:11:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000004">I
am a senior entrepreneur in tooth and claw. I know that success is
wonderful and failure is painful. I understand the rules of the game. I
have made this personal statement to put it all in context because the
series of amendments I have tabled, and which we are about to discuss,
centre around the rights and powers of the shareholder, with whom I
have a strong personal sympathy. The shareholders are the owners. If
the company does well, their share price goes up. If it fails, they can
lose the lot. Executives can move on; shareholders are left with a
loss. The board of directors is accountable to the shareholders and the
management reports to the board of
directors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:12:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000005">In
many small private companies, the management, the board and the
shareholders are often one and the same, but in quoted companies this
is seldom the case. That is one of the reasons why these amendments
refer solely to quoted companies. There are, of course, other
stakeholders in all companies, first and foremost, the employees, but
also the customers, the suppliers and the community where the company
is located. They are important but just for now we are concentrating 
<?notus-xml column=62?>on the shareholders and their rights to know and to control. When we
address executive pay, we are saying that this subject is so important
that the shareholders of a publicly listed company should not only be
consulted but should also vote on the policy and the actuality of the
pay packages that senior executives are to
receive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:13:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000006">Much
today is said about the shareholder spring—the hope that
shareholders will assert themselves more and, of course, we agreed
wholeheartedly with this. If we look around the world, shareholders are
flexing their muscles in all sorts of ways. In the United States, the
Dodd-Frank enactment of 2010 has significantly tightened shareholder
scrutiny on executive compensation. This is referred to as “say
on pay”. In the EU a couple of weeks ago, strong recommendations
were announced with respect to bankers’ pay and bonuses. It will
not have escaped noble Lords that just over a week ago, the Swiss, of
all people, held a referendum on curtailing bankers’ bonuses.
The proposal received 67% support among Swiss voters; 1.6 million of
them turned out to vote; and all 26 cantons approved it. Were we to
have such a referendum here, one wonders what the result would be,
although we can get some idea by looking at the attitudes of the
British public. Only 7% of those polled say that they think that the
CEO of a large company should receive compensation of more than
£1 million and only 1% think that they should be paid
more than £4 million a year. Is that any wonder when profits for
failure feature so heavily in the news? For example, last week, HSBC
announced that 204 of its global staff were to receive £1
million in bonuses and compensation—this in a year that has seen
the bank fined £1.2 billion for laundering Mexican drug money.
RBS has made it clear that a £5.2 billion loss was no barrier to
paying out more than £600 million in
bonuses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:14:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13031134000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031134000130">6.15

going any further, I want to scotch one of the more pervasive arguments
against taking firm action, which is that in a global market any such
moves will lead to CEOs leaving for countries which do not have to show
any restraint—the so-called “pay ‘em or lose
‘em” line. There is no evidence to show that this is
true; indeed, there are contrary data. Of the Fortune 500 companies,
only four have CEOs who were recruited while being CEOs in another
country. That is 0.8%. The number of CEOs who were poached from their
roles as CEOs at other companies moves up to 6.5%. Therefore, it is
disingenuous to suggest that any restraint leads to an exodus for the
facts are obvious: no matter how superb a CEO may be, taking him or her
from one company and plonking them down in another is not always a
successful ploy. Furthermore, this blackmail scenario of,
“Either you give me a whacking increase or else I am off to
another company” or, in this case, another country, is often a
bluff that deserves to be called. My advice to anyone who is faced with
this gun to their head is to show the person the door. This
applies just as much to bankers as it does to non-banking companies, as
illustrated by the annual saga of Sir Martin Sorrell’s salary,
which has come to light this

power is increasingly becoming a hot political issue. We agree with
this week’s edition of the  
<?notus-xml column=63?><I>Economist</I>, the leading article of which is headed, “Power
to the Owners”. Some people resent encroaching shareholder
power, but we welcome it. When the good folks in Switzerland seek to
ensure that executive pay is subject to shareholder approval, we can
only applaud. In the United States, shareholders in successful
companies such as Disney and Apple are becoming very assertive. In days
gone by, the only shareholder activism was the occasional nutter or the
predatory raider, but, most of all, the Wall Street walk pervaded: that
is, if you do not like the management, you can sell your shares.
However, I think the times are a-changing. The mood is also changing
here. Our laws need to keep pace with the change and that is what we

I said in my opening remarks, the Government have taken on board some
of the recommendations made in the Private Member’s Bill of the
noble Lord, Lord Gavron. The Government propose in Clause 71, headed,
“Members’ approval of directors’ remuneration
policy” that a resolution on this issue should be moved at an
accounts or other general meeting no later than every three financial
years. Something is better than nothing but we believe that this
requirement would be much more powerful if it were an annual
requirement, as proposed in Amendments 84AHAZB and 84AHBA. This is
crucial. It means that executive pay is not an issue that is engaged
with occasionally but is forced on at every AGM, in much the same way
as approval of the accounts or the selection of the company’s
auditors—it is that important. The triennial approach for which
the Government have opted seems too casual for this critical
shareholder approval. When most newspapers carried the news that Swiss
shareholders were to receive a vote on pay, they did not say how often
that would occur because it was obvious. Like so many company

what the Government consulted on and gave the appearance that they
would opt for. We believe that it is the better option when it comes to
holding boards to account. This should not, however, be equated with a
policy of short-termism in British companies. It is our belief that
companies should plan over the long-term basis. The Cox review
commissioned by the Labour Party reported last week and included some
admirable recommendations about how companies can ensure that the pay
of their directors reflects the long-term aspirations of the company.
One is that a third of executive remuneration could be paid in the form
of shares held back over five years. The Government believe that having
a triennial vote on pay will encourage long-term thinking, and this is
an important goal. However, reviewing a policy annually is not the same
as making short-term plans. A successful company will produce a plan
that stretches many years into the future, but shareholders should have
the right to challenge, enquire and ultimately hold them to account at
every annual general meeting. That is exactly what an annual binding
vote would allow them to do.</hs_para>

been some element of confusion from Ministers about why the vote is not
to be annual after they consulted on it. At Second Reading, the noble
Lord, Lord Marland, said that he imagined that there would be enormous
shareholder pressure on companies that continue their policies
unchanged, whereas in Committee, the Minister suggested that investors
were in favour of the triennial vote, saying that the Government had
considered that carefully, and that investors and companies had
welcomed the option of a three-year

Government have chosen to retain the annual advisory—as oppose
to the binding—vote, but if shareholders choose to reject a
company’s pay policy at this advisory vote, I understand that
they will not get the chance to have a binding vote until the following

ensure that boards remain conscious of the need for realism on their
pay.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000014">Now we
come to the special resolution. Amendments 84AHAB, 84AHBB and 84AHCA
would require a special resolution, rather than an ordinary one, to be
passed by shareholders in order to approve a change to executive pay;
in effect, 75% of the shareholders voting. This amendment has been
tabled as, under the rules being proposed, it would still be possible
for companies to ignore significant minorities of shareholders against
their remuneration package. We want to strengthen
shareholder power. In Committee the Minister said that the
Government were looking to the Finance Reporting Council—the
relevant regulatory body—to follow through with a commitment
made to look at whether or not a company should have a duty
to formally respond should such a significant minority of shareholders
vote against pay. However, I am given to understand that it is unlikely
to look at the matter this year. We can, therefore, be fairly certain
that no action will be taken on this in the near future, despite the
other moves, both within this legislation and elsewhere in Europe, to
look at the relationship between companies and their shareholders when

an important matter, which I would like to address today. Company
shareholders are a more disparate group than they were in the past. The
Kay review pointed out that the effect of increases in the number of UK
shareholders that live in other countries is to make it harder for them
to organise and collaborate to ensure that they get the outcome that
they want. The percentage of shares in UK-listed companies which were

the main problems with this whole area; it is not just that
shareholders find it difficult to hold companies to account for their
remuneration policies but that those shareholders are for the most
part, as he has identified, large financial institutions. They are not
as accountable as they perhaps should be to those whose savings they
manage. Has my noble friend given any thought to making those
institutions give an account of their policies on remuneration to those
whose savings they manage, and why they have taken a particular stance

if the Minister cast some light on how he interprets the undertaking of

have a group of executive directors whose pay would remain completely
unchanged for three years. Indeed, it is pretty unlikely that you would
have a group of executive directors who themselves remained completely
unchanged for three years. The overwhelming likelihood is that there
would be changes in the pay packages and the composition of the
executive group. If the Minister can assure me that any change
whatever, either in an individual package or in incorporating the
arrival of a new executive director, will mean that the matter has to
come before an annual vote, I would be able to follow my noble friend.

the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, concerning the Swiss pay reforms. It is
interesting that the result in Switzerland shows that there is
widespread global concern about the disconnect between top pay and

the UK system or part of planned reforms such as annual votes on the
re-election of directors and binding shareholder votes on executive
pay. However, the Swiss Government now have the challenge of turning
the result into law. We will be watching closely to see how this works
out in practice.

have proposed amendments to both the frequency and the type of binding
vote. Once again, I thank them for their input on this important issue.
However, the Government continue to have reservations about the reforms
that noble Lords propose. Amendments 84AHAB, 84AHBB and 84AHCA would
require the vote on remuneration policy to be a special resolution that
would require companies to secure the support of 75% of shareholders to
pass. The Government have consulted stakeholders extensively on the
level of support that should be required for remuneration resolutions.
Investors agree that the vote on pay policy 
<?notus-xml column=68?>should remain an ordinary resolution. They have expressed concern that
in cases where turnout is low, a special resolution would allow a small
number of activist investors unfairly to overturn the views of a
majority. There are cases that I can cite that fit into this category,
such as ex-majority owners who remain owners but with a minority
shareholding.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000034">A
special resolution could also cause significant disruption for
companies where a single hostile investor holds a large block of
shares. Special resolutions should be reserved for rare
issues that have a major impact on shareholder rights or company value,
such as recapitalisation or changing the articles of the company. The
Government, however, agree that when a large minority of shareholders
rejects a remuneration resolution, companies should have to respond.
The Financial Reporting Council will look at whether such a requirement
should be included in the corporate governance code.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, asked when the Financial Reporting Council
will consult on changes to the code. The council has said that it will
consider potential changes to the code in the light of government
reforms, including: first, how companies should formally respond when a
significant minority of shareholders oppose a pay vote; secondly, the
requirement that all companies adopt clawback mechanisms; and, thirdly,
the extent to which the executive should serve on remuneration
committees in other companies. The FRC will consult once the
Government’s legislative reforms are finalised and we have seen
how behaviour has evolved. However, having recently amended the code,
the FRC does not anticipate making any further changes during 2013. I
remind the House that the FRC is independent and it is right that it

84AHBA would remove the requirement for companies to put their
remuneration policy to a shareholder resolution at least every three
years and instead require that this be done annually. I thank the noble
Lord, Lord Mitchell, for the opportunity to explain further the
Government’s position on this important matter. Shareholders are
fully supportive of the fact that companies can put forward a
three-year pay policy because this will promote a longer-term approach
to pay. The option of a three-year pay policy is also welcomed by the
many smaller quoted companies that offer less complex pay packages and
that are confident that they could use their good relations with
shareholders to agree a three-year policy. At the other end of the
scale, some larger companies with more complex pay arrangements will be
likely to want to amend their remuneration policy more frequently to
ensure that targets and rewards remain challenging and aligned with
company strategy—along the lines of the comments of the noble
Lord, Lord Mitchell. In any case, we expect that where companies have a
poor track record on pay, shareholders will choose to keep a tighter
rein through an annual vote on the
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000037">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:39:15"></hs_TimeCode>
should also remind noble Lords that shareholders have a wide range of
other tools to hold companies to account on an annual basis. Opposing
the annual implementation report will trigger a binding vote on the pay
policy at the next AGM. Shareholders also have the existing right to
force a resolution at an EGM 
<?notus-xml column=69?>and have annual votes on the re-election of directors. The Government
remain convinced that giving companies the option of a three-year

precisely this question, but it was alluded to. It is important to

Mitchell:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 84AHAA speeds right to the
heart of the matter in hand. The disparity in pay between top and
bottom earners has informed much of the public outrage about
remuneration, and it no doubt lies behind the polling figures that I
mentioned previously. Had the minimum wage kept track with executive
pay since it was introduced, it would now be worth in the region of
£19 per hour. Instead, we see a very pronounced wage
discrepancy. It is felt particularly acutely here in London, where many
FTSE 100 companies and our financial sector are based. In 2010, the top
percentile here received 16.5% more than the bottom percentile. The
ratio between top and bottom pay has gradually grown over the past 30
years to the point that in both the Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays
top pay was 75 times that of the average employee in 2011. By way of
comparison, in 1979 the difference was only 14.5
times.</hs_para>

are being left behind. This is certainly not the one-nation economy
that this country needs. Therefore, shareholders should have more power
to hold to account the companies they invest in, as we argued with
regard to the previous amendment. Greater transparency about levels of
pay at the top and bottom of the company would give shareholders the
tools they 
<?notus-xml column=74?>need to make informed decisions on how they vote. This amendment gives
shareholders those tools by requiring companies to disclose the top and
bottom 10 earners outside the
boardroom.</hs_para>

moves to increase transparency on pay, so it is worth going over why we
consider there to be a need for this amendment. Most of the moves to
get companies to release more information on pay to their shareholders
cover only banking. The Treasury’s current consultation proposal
is that the top eight highest-paid earners beneath boardroom level in
banks are to have their salaries disclosed. Although it is difficult to
know the details at present, it appears as though the European capital
requirements directive IV will opt for a different disclosure proposal,
whereby the figures for those earning more than €1
million a year are to be collated and sent to the EBA, which will then
produce the numbers in a common format. It is possible that in some
institutions this could produce less information than the Treasury
proposal.</hs_para>

from the Treasury and in the European capital requirements directive IV
differ from ours in several important ways. First, they concern only
the banking sector, but this issue is not limited to that industry. Let
us consider the top pay at BP. In 2011, it was 63 times that of average
employee pay, whereas in 1979 the difference was only 16.5 times.
However, these proposals had nothing to say about the severe problem of
low pay, which, as my noble friend Lady Turner of Camden pointed out in
Grand Committee, produces many difficulties in our society. I think we
could all agree that pay at the bottom of a company should be
considered when pay at the top is set.</hs_para>

Lea of Crondall:</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly back this amendment.
I know that it is not for here and now with the present Government, but
in two years’ time it will be very interesting to see how a
Labour Government get the architecture together to relate the income
distribution of the rest of the enterprise to the incomes at board
level. That is what they have in the most successful European
societies—I include Germany, Holland and Scandinavia, and I do
not think that anyone would draw up a very different list. In answer to
the notion that these economies are not competitive, their place in
growing world market share is far superior to that of Europe generally
and certainly to that of Britain.</hs_para>

made that the banking sector is a rather special sector. I can tell you
one respect in which it is very special: people get paid enormously
more at the top than in any other sector. That is what is special about
it. It is not special in the sense that there has not been a huge
growth in the disparities in all the rest of the sectors. Anybody close
to industry will know that two things happen when pay at the top gets
to 30, 40 or 50 times that at the bottom. The first is that there is a
crossover effect in the rest of the sectors—in construction,
mining or any other sector. Banking does not live in a world of its
own, although in some respects, of course, it does. Some people say
that the banking industry is Britain’s biggest industry. When we
were young, to say that banking was Britain’s biggest industry
would have been thought a rather risible thing to say. Yet that is
infecting the rest of the economy. A lot of the best talent used to go
into the Civil Service. Now, not as much of the best talent is going
into the Civil Service. Not as much of the best talent is going to many
of the sectors that had their share of the best available talent years
ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000057">While we
are on the subject of top people and talent—and what you might
call inherited wealth, which is part of this question—the fact
is that we are failing to bring out the best of the talents and
opportunities of everybody else in society. So when one talks about 1%,
one immediately says, “What about the 99%?”. I think that
for this Government to ally themselves ideologically with the interests
of the 1% at the top is going to prove a fatal mistake.</hs_para>

and those of us who now believe what this side of the House believes,
in the challenges that we will face in two years’ time there
must be some connection between our policy of worker representation on
boards and what is happening in the rest of the company. You do not
need to be Einstein to figure out that if there is some new structure
of boards, there has to be some substructure. You cannot have a
superstructure without a substructure. Whether it is through
information and consultation bodies or any other way, it will be a
major challenge to get it right this time under the next Labour
Government. It is rather academic from the point of view of Members
opposite in the Conservative Party, but it is a very interesting
pointer to the future that this is one of the elements in the
architecture that will be
built.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000059"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Blackwell" PimsId="4025" UID="13031149000523" xid="1079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000523">Lord
Blackwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I have listened very carefully to the
speeches of the noble Lords, Lord Mitchell and Lord Lea of Crondall.
While they made some interesting points, I did not find that either of
them had any compelling rationale for this particular
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000060">We
have all agreed that the remuneration policy for those at the top of
companies has to be transparent and has to be voted on and agreed by
shareholders; that is only proper. As for the low-skilled workers on
the minimum wage, that is a matter which is voted on by Parliament in
setting the minimum wage. However, I am not sure that to juxtapose
those two thing in a company’s annual report provides any useful
information. Let us consider company A, which, we hope, does a 
<?notus-xml column=76?>great job for the community in employing lots of people, including
low-skilled workers, on relatively low wages. Offering them employment
helps them to come off benefits and thus creates a great benefit to
society. Company B, operating in the same sector, decides to ship all
those jobs off to India. Which company would shareholders—or,
indeed, society as a whole—think is doing a better job? I do not
think that juxtaposing how many people a company successfully employs
at the lower end of the skill level compared to the top end, and
comparing that with other companies, gives any useful information about
whether those at the top of the company are being rewarded
appropriately.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000061"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lea of Crondall" PimsId="1443" UID="13031149000524" xid="1309" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000524">Lord
Lea of Crondall:</Member></B> The noble Lord asked a direct question

company in a consultancy that employs only PhDs. The ratio between the
top and the bottom in that company may be relatively small. Is that a
better company than one that employs lots of people on the minimum
wage? I think that this information is almost entirely irrelevant to
any judgment about whether the pay at the top of the company is
appropriate. That is a relevant question, but this information is
potentially misleading and potentially encourages those viewing the

Kerr of Kinlochard:</Member></B> My Lords, I understand the general
points made the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, and I have considerable
sympathy for them. However, I do not understand their relevance to
Clause 71, which is about remuneration reports. The problem with
remuneration reports is that the degree of detail now required in them
means that they have become rather long and complex. An additional
requirement to include a comparison between payments made to two
categories of staff, neither of which is within the scope of the
remuneration report, would add further complexity without the
justification of relevance. Remuneration reports are about the
remuneration of directors and senior executives. The amendment calls
for the inclusion of factual material on individuals who are neither
directors nor senior
executives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000065">Such
complexities have costs. Take two plcs with 70 and 100,000 employees
across the world in, say, 50 to 85 countries. I am thinking of two
examples which I know well. Is it really necessary, for the purposes of
the remuneration report, to require them to establish with each of
their businesses in each country where they operate which are the
lowest pay rates paid, presumably to the most junior, temporary staff
of that 
<?notus-xml column=77?>country, then take appropriate exchange rates and try to work out the
unluckiest 10 in any of their operations anywhere across the world? The
remuneration report is about the directors and senior executives. The
purpose of a remuneration report must surely be to explain to
shareholders the company’s remuneration policy and the result
that it has produced for the senior individuals that the report is
required to cover, and to do so as simply and clearly as possible.
Would this amendment assist that? I do not think
so.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_11_PT_1/8702958C9F81C99B56DA449AA48A53CF95944EF1" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 March 2013">Monday,

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> Amendment 84AHAA seeks to require that
companies report on high and low pay outside the board. Taking high pay
first, the issue of high pay outside the boardroom is most relevant in
the financial services industry, as was mentioned earlier, where poorly
designed remuneration structures can incentivise excessive risk-taking.
We remain committed to having the most transparent financial centre in
the world and we have already taken significant steps forward. During
ongoing negotiations with Europe over new regulations for the banking
sector, we have argued strongly for further improvements to the
disclosure of pay below board level. As a result, the current EU
proposals would require banks to disclose the aggregate pay of senior
managers and material risk takers in bands, as well as further
information about how much is paid in total in fixed and variable pay.
We await the outcome of these discussions before deciding whether
additional UK regulation is
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000067">The
noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, raised the issue of disclosure of pay below
board level in banks and asked why the UK does not regulate. We argue
that it does not make sense to proceed with UK regulations until we
know the precise details of the European rules. Once this is confirmed,
we will decide whether we need to go further. It is not a major issue
in other sectors. In our consultation on this, shareholders were clear
that requiring all companies to report on high pay below board level
would create an unnecessary regulatory burden and so we will not pursue
this. The noble Lord raised the issue of pay below board level in
non-banking sectors, which we acknowledge is an issue. In the end, pay
reports are produced for shareholders, so they should be designed to
include information that they want. We should not clutter them with
information that they do not find
useful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T19:13:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
Shareholders and the Government share the view, however, that high pay
below board level is not a major issue in other sectors. In our
consultation, shareholders were clear that requiring all companies to
report on high pay below board level would create an unnecessary
regulatory burden, so we will not be pursuing it. That point was made
eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard.</hs_para>

matter that shareholders are increasingly interested in is how board
pay relates to that of the wider workforce. That is why companies will
have to say more about how they have considered pay across the whole of
the company workforce. They will also be required to publish the
percentage increase in pay of the chief executive officer compared to
that of the workforce. I can directly answer the question raised under
the previous amendment by the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall. It is
something that investors are asking for and is comparable across
companies, but we have no plans to mandate that companies 
<?notus-xml column=78?>adopt a standardised ratio for top to median pay because it is clear
that this measure has limitations. It is difficult to compare between
different companies and sectors. For example, an investment bank with
many highly paid staff will have a much lower pay ratio than a
supermarket.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000069">New
regulations will implement these proposals. Noble Lords will have the
opportunity to debate these regulations later in the year. I conclude
by making an overarching general point about trends in pay. It is
pleasing to note, although I acknowledge that there is still much work
to do, that in 2012 several firms, including Aviva, WPP, Centamin,
Pendragon and Trinity Mirror failed to win majority backing for their
pay reports, with several senior executives stepping down in the face
of shareholder opposition. Voting results from AGMs in 2012 suggest
that the average vote against the remuneration report was 8.9%, up from
6% in 2011. So, there is more work to be done but the trends are going
in the right direction. I therefore ask the noble Lord to withdraw his
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T19:15:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13031149000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000109">7.15

people working for companies and the fact that it is useful to see
these disparities in black and white. Indeed, it is usual for countries
in the north of Europe to do it, and they seem to be doing very well in
the world economy. The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, again made a useful
contribution. I am not sure that I agree with his position but it was
useful and not dissimilar to that of the noble Lord, Lord Kerr of
Kinlochard. Our position is that it is information that some investors
would like to know about companies: what is the disparity in those
companies? I say to the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, that I had not really
thought about it, but it must refer only to the United Kingdom. It had

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, the majority of these
amendments are minor and technical and designed to improve the clarity
of the legislation. 
<?notus-xml column=79?>Amendment 84AHH is substantive and I shall make the case for it first.
It amends new Section 226E of the Companies Act 2006, which would be
inserted by Clause 72. New Section 226E imposes a potential liability
on directors who authorise an unapproved remuneration or loss of office
payment. This amendment will ensure that, as is consistent with other
provisions in the Companies Act 2006, a director who acts honestly and
reasonably may be relieved of this liability if a court, taking into
account all the circumstances, decides that it is appropriate to do
so.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031149000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000073">Noble<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T19:18:20"></hs_TimeCode>
Lords will understand the need for there to be legal consequences in
the event of a company making a payment to a director which has not
been approved by
shareholders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T19:18:23"></hs_TimeCode>. In
the first instance, the company may seek to recover the unauthorised
payment from the director who received it. However, if this is
unsuccessful, the directors who authorised the payment can be held
liable for any losses incurred as a result. The company or its
shareholders may take action to recover these losses from them. These
consequences will act as a deterrent to the minority of directors
who might deliberately try to pay more than shareholders
have approved. However, the Government recognise that directors may
make honest and reasonable mistakes, either through misinformation or
misinterpretation of the remuneration policy. This is recognised in
other parts of the Companies Act, which deal with unauthorised payments
and under which directors who act honestly, or take reasonable steps to
ensure compliance, are not subject to liability.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031149000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000074">Unless we make a
similar provision with respect to remuneration payments the risk of
liability could hang over remuneration committees and affect the
pay-setting process. This risks making remuneration committees heavily
dependent on lawyers and overly keen to agree broad, vague policies.
More worryingly, there is a real risk that this could deter good people
from taking up important and challenging roles on remuneration
committees. Case law shows that the courts apply a rigorous test when
assessing whether a director has acted honestly and reasonably,
particularly when the director concerned is one of a large public
company. As such, we are confident that this provision will ensure that
those directors who should rightly be relieved may be, while ensuring
that those who should be held liable, are
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031149000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031149000075">We have
also proposed a handful of minor and technical amendments which will
clarify the legal drafting of the Bill on three issues, which I will
speak to in turn. Amendments 84AHB, 84AHC and 84AHK clarify how and

provisions come into force. Amendments 84AHE, 84AHF and 84AHK make
clear the different procedures that should be followed in the event of
unapproved payments in the form of shares, property and other
undertakings of the company. Finally, Amendments 84AHD, 84AHJ, 84AHL,
84AHM and 84AHN tidy up the drafting by moving some of the provisions
in Clause 74 into other clauses so that they may appear alongside the
sections to which they apply. I hope that noble Lords will support
this. I beg to move Amendment

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell,
for that, and also for his contribution on this important issue. The
proposed amendment to Section 226E ensures that those who should be
rightly relieved of liability can be, while those who should be held
liable will be. To answer his question about how one can define or
further improve on the definition of “reasonable”, the
concept of reasonableness has been thoroughly tested by the courts,
which are very rigorous in judging directors. A court might take into
account what advice a director had sought, what conversations had taken
place, and what records were kept. Of course, it remains up to the
court to decide and it will vary in each case. The court will take into
account, for example, the full context of the situation. Therefore, the
expectations of a “reasonable” director of a FTSE100
company with a strong compliance function and ease of access to
professional advisers will be much higher than those of a director of a
smaller quoted company. I hope that that takes matters forward and
helps answer the noble Lord’s question. I also thank noble Lords

represents the recommendations of the BIS Select Committee report to
the Insolvency Service, released on 29 January this year.</hs_para>

I attempt to define a pre-pack administration. I find many people do
not know what it is, and I am not surprised. It is where the directors
of a failing company seek to preserve its continuing existence after
administration by lining up replacement owners and finance before the
administration takes place—in effect, relaunching the company
with many of its creditors and minority shareholders stripped out,
while effectively continuing the existing business in another name. It
gives the business a second chance, but often at the expense of these
creditors and shareholders. My contention is that it is often
unprincipled and unfair. Usually, there is no creditors meeting and no
consultation with the court before this takes place. The sale may be to
individuals who were directors of the firm before the pre-pack
administration, and the new firm may have a similar name. As I say, the
only difference is that the new company is shorn of its debt and maybe
its smaller shareholders. Effectively, it is cooking the books. Such
firms have sometimes been known as phoenix companies, having risen from
the ashes of the old insolvent company.</hs_para>

pre-packs arose when a company in which I had a minority shareholding
interest wanted to restructure its financing to my detriment. To do
this, it needed me to sign off on a revised deal. I refused. It
threatened me with a pre-pack, a term that I had not heard of before,
but about which I learned pretty quickly. I still refused and,
fortunately, it backed down. However, I saw how that could be used as a
negotiating tactic. More to the point, I saw how the small people can
get hurt. Despite that, I am prepared to concede that pre-packs can
have a very important function. They can allow a company to continue
and 
<?notus-xml column=83?>the administrator to move quickly to preserve the business and, most
importantly, jobs. That is what all of us
want.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13031158000257" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000257">7.30

ago, I went to see the BIS Minister responsible for this issue, Jo
Swinson MP. I cannot say that it was a particularly helpful meeting.
Her approach was that pre-packs are good because they preserve jobs and
the company. My view is that they can be bad when creditors such as
SMEs are cast adrift and where employees are similarly left in the
lurch in a very much weaker position. We beg to
differ.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000005">I
believe that the time has come to have a comprehensive and independent
review into that practice to see where improvements can be made and
safeguards can be added. My purpose in introducing the amendment is to
oblige the Secretary of State to look seriously at how those abuses can
be addressed. They tell me that this is a hugely complex area and that
it will be hard to draw up appropriate legislation. Indeed, the
Government have tried and failed in this Parliament. My response is,
“Since when did we turn our backs on something just because it
is too hard?”. That should make us more
determined.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000006">I
recognise the complexities, and I do not introduce the amendment today
claiming to know all the answers. Let me outline some of the areas that
need to be addressed. The first is consistent with what I have been
arguing with regard to levels of remuneration in a company: the need
for transparency. To cite the Association of British Insurers in its
evidence to the BIS Select Committee in December 2011:</hs_para>

the heart of the problem lies in the serious conflict of interest
inherent in an insolvency practitioner devising a pre-pack sale in
secret in conjunction with the directors and secured lenders of a
failing company, and then immediately implementing that transaction as

creditors”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13031158000192" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000192">The
question that many small businesses find themselves asking after a
pre-pack insolvency is: to whose benefit is this insolvency? They find
that the answer is: those who drew up the insolvency plan and called in
the administrator. It is there that the problem lies. When parties
connected to the old company are involved in the new company, that
compounds the frustration felt by unsecured creditors. The percentage
of pre-packs which are sold to connected parties is higher than for
business sale
administrations.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13031158000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000007">There
have also been some egregious abuses. My honourable friend Luciana
Berger MP tabled a Private Member’s Bill in the other place to
amend the Health and Safety Acts to prevent companies avoiding fines by
being in administration. A construction worker, Mr Mark
Thornton, had been killed by a steel column on a building site in my
honourable friend’s constituency. A judge said that he was
unable to award a £300,000 fine because the company was in
administration. The company responsible was later bought out by its
directors in a pre-pack deal and continues to trade. That shows at the
extreme level the potential for abuse of pre-packs by connected
parties. I am proud that the Labour Party has committed to fixing the
health and safety loophole that allowed that and other such cases to
happen.</hs_para>

are strong arguments for pre-packs. To my mind, the strongest of those
is the rate of job preservation. Figures from one study suggest that
pre-packs preserve the entire workforce 92% of the time, as opposed to
65% of the time in other administrations. So clearly, they are not a
bad thing. However, a few factors need to be considered alongside that.
Pre-packs have a higher rate of failure than companies restructured in
other ways. Another is that those jobs could continue in other
companies. Also, the effect on jobs in small companies needs to be
considered, as they could be vulnerable to losing out on large payments
owed when a company goes into administration. By way of example, the
Federation of Small Businesses has told me about a publishing company
in London which had to lose a member of staff after it was not paid
£100,000 owed to them by a company that went into pre-pack
administration.</hs_para>

could the review consider? I know, for a start, that the Government are
currently looking to strengthen and clarify the guidelines under SIP
16, which is the Insolvency Service guideline. I welcome that. However,
what other safeguards could a review consider in detail? One that has
been considered is that when an administrator has been advising a
company about a pre-pack administration, before that pre-pack could be
sold, an independent administrator would have to inspect the deal. It
is true that that would add to the cost of the administration, but it
would reassure creditors and remove what some argue is one of the
clearest potential conflict of interest when pre-packs are put
together: that of the administrator brought in by the management to
organise a pre-pack
insolvency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000010">That
potential conflict of interest was recognised in 2010 by the judge in
the case of Johnson Machine Tool Company Limited, when the court did
not allow the administrator to charge his fees for pre-administration
work on the pre-pack as an administration expense. That was because the
people gaining from the work were not the management or the
creditors—exactly what the critics of pre-packs
argue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000011">Clearly,
this is a difficult question, not least because there is no set
definition of pre-pack in law. That very fact is a sign that some of
its abuses were not envisaged by policymakers in the past and that we
need a review to see whether improvements can be made and safeguards
added. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13031158000281" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000281">Viscount
Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> Noble Lords will be aware that the
administration procedure is the primary mechanism for
effecting business rescues. It is important to recognise that the
objective of administration, if the rescue of the company is not
feasible, is to provide the best return for creditors. A pre-pack sale
is merely a means of achieving that outcome and should therefore always
be in the interests of creditors. I am most grateful to the noble Lord,
Lord Mitchell, for his helpful description of pre-packs for
the benefit of the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000013">As the
noble Lord said, pre-packs can be an effective way to the
best outcome for creditors, enabling businesses to be rescued and
preserving jobs, but we recognise that there can be scope for abuse.
That scope is greatest where pre-pack sales are to connected parties, 
<?notus-xml column=85?>such as the directors or their families. Again, I am grateful for the
anecdotal evidence given tonight by the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell. That
is when most concerns are expressed, and it is vital that everyone
involved has confidence that such sales are at fair value. We have been
listening carefully to concerns expressed about the use of pre-packs,
and Ministers have met with stakeholders to discuss the issue. I am
aware that, as the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, mentioned this
evening, he recently met with the Minister for Employment Relations and
Business Affairs, Jo Swinson, to discuss the issue. We have also
invited those who have complained about the procedure to provide
evidence of abuse, so that that can also be
pursued.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000014">I
reassure noble Lords that work is already under way to improve the
transparency about pre-pack sales. There is a statement of insolvency
practice, SIP 16, setting out the information that has to be provided
to creditors by insolvency practitioners. That is being strengthened to
ensure that more information will be disclosed and that creditors will
receive that information at an earlier stage. Insolvency practitioners
will also have to confirm that a pre-pack sale is in the best interests
of creditors. That should provide greater confidence that the pre-pack
sale is justified. The Insolvency Service is proactively monitoring
information disclosed under SIP 16 reports to establish whether there
has been any abuse. Where there is evidence to suggest abuse, it is
reported to be relevant regulatory body for action to be taken. Such
action can include fines, sanctions and, ultimately, loss of the
insolvency practitioner’s licence. The Insolvency Service will
report on its findings in this
regard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000015">We
therefore already have measures in place to protect against abuse, and

occasions in both this House and the other place.</hs_para>

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> In moving this amendment, I
apologise that my noble friend Lady Hayter is unable to be present and
has asked me to speak on her behalf. I will also speak to Amendments
84AHNB, 84AHNC and 84AHND. I start by making it clear that we on this
side support the broad thrust and intent of Midata, which is to give
consumers increased access to their personal data in a portable,
electronic format so that they can use this data to gain insights into
their own behaviour, and make more informed choices about products and
services. However, to make Midata work and to build consumer confidence
in it, there are concerns which we raised in Committee and which our
amendments seek to address.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031158000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000020">Confidence is key, here
as in many other places, and a smart way to ensure that users can trust
the use and care of their data is through a redress scheme. Not only
does this give comfort in itself—people know where to go if they
have a complaint about the provision, cost or use of their
data—but it serves two other functions. One is that any
regulated person using the logo of a particular redress scheme also
signifies some assurance of quality and regulation to the user. The
second, more significant function, is that a body of evidence accrues
via such a complaints scheme of the sorts of problems or the particular
regulated persons which are causing concerns. Given that the
Information Commissioner uses a risk and evidence based approach to his
work, he is highly reliant on evidence—both of the extent and
detriment of any problems—and these are best captured by an
accessible and effective complaint or ombudsman
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000021">I
start with Amendment 84AHNA, which would require regulated and possibly
authorised persons to join a redress scheme. This would not entail
setting up a whole new redress body, as there are plenty of other
high-quality ombudsmen covering a range of sectors who could be
approved under this Bill. Without our amendment, the Bill covers
high-level enforcement, but with customers able to bring an action for
breach of regulations only before a court or tribunal or, under Section
13 of the Data Protection Act, to claim compensation through the
courts. That is a pretty 
<?notus-xml column=87?>unrealistic hurdle for individual consumers. Hence our call for a
redress scheme for individual complaints. Knowing a redress scheme is
available if things go wrong would give consumers the confidence to
harness the empowering potential of Midata.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031158000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000022">Amendment 84AHNB deals
with the costs of complying with requests. At present, the charges
reflect costs to the data supplier. Our amendment is about costs to
consumers: after all it is their personal data that they want released.
Charges must not dissuade consumers from engaging in the Midata
programme. The EU data protection directive uses the phrase
“without excessive ... expense”, but given that not
everyone is familiar with that directive, it should be added to the
Bill.</hs_para>

with strengthened consumer protections. There are risks from Midata,
especially as combining datasets into a whole-person view, poses risks
to privacy and identity. Secondly, because Midata will see multiple
parties including the consumer assume responsibility for data at
different points, liability becomes complex, with the risk that
consumers will be left exposed. Thirdly, legitimate businesses offering
third party services could incentivise consumers to provide data which
might otherwise not be accessible.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031158000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000024">Fourthly, there is the
risk of misuse of data. Businesses and third parties might, for
example, sell on and share data with their affiliates or engage in
uninvited cross-selling and marketing. Finally and pervasively, there
is security. ID fraud is a real risk as it would be easy to build a
picture of an individual, drawing on different information sources.
Given that data protection is already of huge concern for consumers, an
assurance of security is essential for Midata to succeed and benefit
consumers, who will need to be confident they are sharing their data
only with trustworthy service providers. We ask the Secretary of State
to consult widely to develop protections to ensure that the consumer
interest is represented alongside those of regulated and authorised
persons. We know that the Information Commissioner would welcome being
included on this
list.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13031158000258" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000258">7.45

84AHND, seeks to protect customer data. This arises from specific
concerns that the Bill does not reflect the security risks inherent in
providing third parties with access to customers’ banking
details. The aim of Midata is to help consumers to effectively shop
around by greater access to charges and fees on services provided, in
this case, by a bank. However information in bank and credit card
statements already reveals a vast amount of personal information, far
beyond the data from mobile phones or energy providers. While customers
might be able to use such data to make informed decisions, there could
be data protection risks to consumers if they provide such information
to third parties. Our proposals therefore seek to strengthen
third-party arrangements to ensure customer data will be protected.
Banks are bound by the common law duty of bankers’
confidentiality, which extends to all information relating to
customers, their accounts and transactions with the bank, and by the
Data Protection Act. However, if customers engage a third party to 
<?notus-xml column=88?>analyse their data, these contractual arrangements alleviate the data
protection issues for banks. This means that customers would be relying
on the quality of the third party’s security
protocols.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000026">Such
third parties who seek to process customer data released under Midata
should therefore be subject to increased regulation. Under Section 41A
of the Data Protection Act, our amendment would extend the enhanced
regime of inspection and enforcement by the Information
Commissioner’s Office to third parties who receive customer
data. While the Government already have the powers to make this change,
this amendment would ensure they exercise these powers. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000027"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13031158000285" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000285">Viscount
Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, as I explained in Grand
Committee, the idea behind the powers and Midata is simple: to give
consumers the right to request their existing consumption and
transaction data back from their suppliers in a portable, electronic
format. I remind the House that this data already exist. We are not
talking about collecting new data
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000028">In
addressing Amendment 84AHNA, I reassure the noble Baroness, Lady
Hayter, and the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, who is speaking to this
amendment, that I agree with them both that customers need to be
protected from data misuse. Service providers under Midata must comply
with all existing data security and protection rules. There are
well-established complaint and redress schemes through the Information
Commissioner’s Office in the core sectors where ombudsmen
already operate. Data controllers must notify the Information
Commissioner of data processing under Section 17 of that Act. Failure
to do so is an offence.</hs_para>

need for further measures. This is why a consumer protection and trust
work stream has been established under the Midata programme. A number
of working groups made up of privacy experts, business, regulators and
consumer groups are looking at a wide range of consumer issues. They
have been tasked with identifying and recommending existing best
practices and, where appropriate, new approaches that may be needed to
ensure the security of individuals’ data. The groups are due to
report in summer and any recommendations that they propose may need to
be reflected in enforcement provisions made under these
powers.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031158000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000030">The
role of third parties is important. Where citizens choose to provide
data to a third party, or provide authorisation for a third party to
request data on their behalf, the Data Protection Act applies. Under
that Act, data controllers do not need to comply with a request for
data unless they are satisfied that the requesting party has authority
to access it. The consumer protection and trust working groups are
looking at a wide range of issues that could emerge in a new Midata
world and the Government will want to take their advice before acting.
Their recommendations might include kitemarks, accreditation processes
and complaint handling and redress schemes, as well as other proposals.
The Government do not want to pre-empt any recommendations by setting
out detailed protection measures in the Bill.</hs_para>

84AHNB, I reassure noble Lords that the aim of our provision is to make
data more accessible. We believe that Clause 75(5)(b)(ii) will have
much the same effect as the limitation put forward by the noble
Baroness, Lady Hayter, and the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson. The
Government expect data to be provided back to consumers cheaply, and
ideally for free, but businesses may initially incur additional costs
in making data available electronically and the power allows businesses
to charge to recoup their only cost. Noble Lords may be reassured to
know that data that have been so far released under the Midata
voluntary programme have been provided to customers free of
charge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000032">On
Amendment 84AHNC, I would like to deal with proposed new subsection
(6A)(a) first. As I have said, businesses do not need to comply with a
request for data unless they are satisfied that there is a valid claim
of access under the DPA. Mechanisms that might enable this are being
considered in the working groups, so this is still a matter under
consideration. However, it is clear from our discussions with data
controllers that they will not be willing to release data to third
parties unless fully satisfied that it represents a legitimate request
from an authorised party. The methodology may vary by sector but the
additional measures proposed in this amendment do not appear necessary
at this time.</hs_para>

subsection (6A)(b), the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, has raised an
interesting point but the Data Protection Act already affords
protections in this area. I recognise the concerns in this respect,
particularly around the possible actions of nefarious or rogue
operators. However, access to Midata would not alter the current data
protection law and any criminal activity could be dealt with
appropriately, as it is now. In relation to proposed new subsection
(6B), we are working with privacy experts, businesses, regulators and
consumer groups in the working groups that I have mentioned.
Legislation would be introduced only after a period of public
consultation. Scope will exist in any regulations to place conditions
on accessing data by authorised persons. Therefore, I believe the
specific provisions set out in the amendment to be
unnecessary.</hs_para>

84AHND would extend the Information Commissioner’s powers of
compulsory entry and audit to the private sector for the first time.
This is primarily a matter for the Ministry of Justice and I am not
convinced that such a major departure from current policy can be
justified here. Its most likely effect would be to stifle innovation.
As a result, services that help people to analyse their data will not
be developed or may be withdrawn. The ICO already has investigation
powers to require information from the private sector; we believe that
these are sufficient in this case.</hs_para>

back to the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, on his assertion about claiming
compensation through the courts. I think he deemed that to be

that helps the noble Lord. In the light of my responses, I ask the

We are probably pulling in the same direction on this. In particular,
the work streams to which he referred are obviously very helpful and
seem to be widely inclusive. I am glad to hear that they will report in
the summer, at the point where they can inform any regulatory steps

concern is that there were a couple of times in the Minister’s
response where he made great play of the fact that he felt that the
companies to which requests for access to data are being made would
have sufficient ability to determine whether the request was bona fide
and therefore to be relied on, without having to have any other
cross-regulatory approvals. I hear what he says on that but would like
to read it in <I>Hansard</I> to be sure that I am right on it. At this
stage, I would say only that that sounds a slightly unlikely premise on
which to run what will be a very large amount of personal data, if this
works, and be very widely spread across a number of possible providers
and users. In that sense, it will therefore raise all the sort of
concerns that the public have about how their data are being kept and
looked after. At this stage, I would not like to push the amendment any
further and I would like to withdraw it.</hs_para>

the Government’s own amendment in this area by addressing
Amendment 84AHP. I am grateful to have received the advice of the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. Following that
advice, I have put forward an amendment to Clause 77 so that any
enforcement measures made under the power provided in Clause 76 would
be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. I have also made
changes to allow provisions relating to core sectors under Clause 75 to
be introduced using the affirmative resolution procedure. This would
apply only when regulations under Clause 76 or those applying to
non-core sectors are simultaneously proposed. I have undertaken this
because there will be times when instruments tabled under both clauses
will probably be necessary. Enabling the instruments to be considered
together and using the same procedure—the affirmative
procedure—ensures efficient use of parliamentary
time.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments respond to
points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, in Grand Committee. I
am most grateful to him for raising this important issue. It is
relevant to this Bill because it will help businesses, especially those
needing to be rescued, and as such supports the Bill’s themes.
The amendments contain powers that, when exercised, will assist
businesses in insolvency procedures by increasing the chance of
business rescue. Alternatively, where there is no chance of a rescue
they may help to achieve a better return for creditors than would be
delivered by an immediate liquidation or bankruptcy.</hs_para>

contain powers to render void contractual terms that allow an essential
supplier in the utility and IT sectors to withdraw supply from an
insolvent business. These powers would also prevent suppliers in these
sectors taking advantage of the insolvency by unfairly and unreasonably
increasing charges for that supply. Some have described such demands as
“ransom payments”, saying that where they are made, that
supplier gains an unfair advantage over other creditors in the
insolvency. They can act as a barrier to rescue and may force
businesses to close down, causing unnecessary job losses.</hs_para>

an enabling power relating to IT suppliers and those that provide or
sell gas, electricity, water or communication services that are
essential to business. By communication services, we mean services such
as telephone, fax or broadband access that may be provided to a

essential suppliers who must continue to supply and who may not demand
payment of a pre-insolvency debt as a condition of that supply. They
may, however, seek a personal guarantee from the insolvency

Government recognise that some of these proposals would affect
contractual rights. For this reason the provisions are restricted to
supplies that are essential to today’s business and which
typically cannot be sourced quickly from alternative suppliers. They
will not impact upon ordinary trade supplies. Further, this power is
only exercisable in relation to procedures where there is still some
chance of business rescue, that is to say administration and voluntary
arrangements. There are also several safeguards provided for affected
suppliers to ensure that the supplier is paid, including the right to
require a personal guarantee from the insolvency practitioner for the
post-insolvency supply.</hs_para>

exceptions to be made to this right to request a personal guarantee.
The 16th report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
noted that the provision to make exceptions is widely drawn and asked
for further information as to the circumstances in which this provision
might be used. We will consult on any use of these powers, and we
require the flexibility provided by this power to address issues that
might be flagged during consultation. Situations where it would be
appropriate to restrict the right to obtain a personal guarantee might
include, for example, where no point would be served in requiring a
personal guarantee. One example of this is if the third party had
already guaranteed

being so persuasive. That was a trick I should learn in other places. I

the reasons outlined, the necessity of IT equipment to the continuity
of a business in difficulty cannot be overstated. Frankly, without
this, there is no chance of any continuation, or of selling on, and
thus of maintaining economic activity and jobs. IT is today as central
as supplies of water and utilities. Therefore we also welcome the
Government’s amendments to add on-sellers of utilities to the
list of supplies that must continue. Given our desire to enhance
business rescue, especially in these difficult times when banks are
less than helpful, this change to prevent certain suppliers withdrawing
services to struggling businesses is a significant step forward. We are
delighted that the Government heard this plea.</hs_para>

wish to raise, covered in the amendments that have been tabled, is the
new mandatory requirement for a personal guarantee from the office
holder—the insolvency practitioner—to cover essential 
<?notus-xml column=94?>supplies. Subsection (3) of government Amendment 84C permits the
supplier to terminate the supply unless an insolvency office holder
personally guarantees any charges arising from the continuation of the
supply. This is a move away from the current legislation, which
provides for an optional personal
guarantee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000049">Although
Section 233 of the 1986 Insolvency Act contains an optional guarantee
in subsection (2)(a), when the Bank of England, FSA and HMT introduced
equivalent provisions to protect financial institutions, this optional
guarantee provision was removed, and there are now no provisions for
such personal guarantees. This position for financial institutions is
right, as we see no case for a personal guarantee from an office
holder, since an insolvency practitioner should not be subject to
personal liability when acting as the agent for the company.</hs_para>

affecting directors, who are not mandatorily subject to such personal
liability even though they have a similar relationship to their
company. Such a requirement for a personal guarantee appears
particularly inappropriate in respect of certain types of insolvency,
such as for a supervisor in a voluntary arrangement who has no control
over the business. The mandatory guarantee requirement in the
government amendment is therefore a backwards step, and our amendments
are to align the provisions with the recent regime for financial
institutions, by removing the requirements for mandatory personal
guarantees from office
holders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000051">Our
first two amendments also take this opportunity to amend the 1986
Insolvency Act to remove the optional guarantee from Section 233(2)(a)
so that the provisions for essential services in the 1986 Act are
brought into line with the protection regime for financial
institutions. It is hard to understand the requirement for a personal
guarantee, as there is no reason why insolvency practitioners should be
subjected to personal liability when acting as the agent of the
company. There is a real danger that such a requirement would reduce
use of this tool with a real threat, therefore, to business
rescue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000052">The
existence of a mandatory personal guarantee would be particularly
detrimental in CVAs where the management retains control of the
business with the insolvency practitioner acting as
supervisor. Given the limited control insolvency practitioners have
over the business, with no control over the assets, they would be
exposing themselves to significant risk by providing a personal
guarantee. It is very unlikely that any insolvency practitioner would,
in fact, go down this route. I should add that the proposed 28-day
maximum credit period in subsections (2)(c) and (3)(c) of the new
clauses is a reasonable compromise. Thus the demand for an additional
personal guarantee seems excessive. We know the Government share our
desire to maximise company rescues—often with the role of an
insolvency practitioner as key. We trust they will not undermine their

counterproductive

My<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, these
amendments seek to amend the powers being introduced by the government
amendments, to remove an important 
<?notus-xml column=95?>protection for suppliers. That protection is provided in the
Government’s amendment by allowing suppliers to require a
personal guarantee from an insolvency practitioner where they are
prevented from exercising a contractual right to terminate supply. Not
only does the amendment put forward by the noble Lord remove the
protection provided by the government amendment, it also seeks to take
away the right of a supplier to a personal guarantee in situations
where it already exists in
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000054">I
should make clear that essential suppliers who may be required to
supply the insolvent business are very likely to be owed money within
the insolvency. They are most unlikely to be repaid any more than a
small proportion of that claim through realisations within the
insolvency. Therefore the Government think it is only right that where
such suppliers are obliged to continue supplying the insolvent
business, they do so knowing that they will be
paid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000055">The new
powers do include other safeguards for the supplier, but none of these
guarantees payment of the post-insolvency charges. We do not expect
that a supplier will always require a personal guarantee, but we do
think that, as is the case as the legislation currently stands, they
should be entitled to one where they feel it necessary. It should be
noted that the right to request a personal guarantee from the
insolvency practitioner is a protection that utility providers have had
since 1986, where they are requested to continue supplying the
insolvent
business.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000056">Removing
this right at a time when we are extending the requirement to provide
supplies may send the wrong message. However, noble Lords will be aware
that the powers do contain the ability to provide for exceptions to the
right to request a personal guarantee. While it is anticipated that
this would only be exercised in certain limited circumstances, it does
provide for some flexibility in the
matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0002.htm#13031158000057">There

Government have legislated to make sure that these personal guarantees
no longer exist in financial companies, it seems slightly odd that we

is inclement and the speaking time allocated to each noble Lord is
short, I am grateful to all noble Lords who are to take part in this
debate. I recognise that, although the Minister will have to reply to
the debate on behalf of the Government and that the Government will
eventually respond to the Francis report, the report spans several
previous years. I hope the Minister can tell us when the Government
will produce their full response and what form it will take. Will they
make a financial assessment of the implementation of the
recommendations?</hs_para>

co-operation are the magic of the NHS; so said the leader of the
Opposition at, I am led to believe, a Labour Party conference. The
report by Robert Francis on Mid Staffs Hospital suggests that that
magic is gone, not only from Mid Staffs, but, judging by the daily
reports from more and more hospitals of poor quality care, from other
hospitals too. The culture that brought about the disaster at Mid
Staffs may well be more widespread. At the same time, there are
hospitals that provide excellent, high quality, compassionate care, and
we must not forget that.</hs_para>

has to be right when he says that a cultural change is required. We
need a culture that cares for patients and puts the quality of patient
care and safety first, with a shift from compliance to targets and from
financial probity to patient care. The words “patient
safety” appear on virtually every page of the report. That such
a degree of harm and suffering was inflicted on patients and that
doctors and nurses were part of the culture is hard to comprehend. As a
doctor who worked in the NHS only, I recognise the words of another
clinician, the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, who wrote in the <I>Times</I> on
4 March that for doctors, nurses and other clinical professions,
professional pride defines who they are. That clinicians had become
part of a culture of bullying, secrecy and gagging is difficult to
fathom. To change this culture, the Francis report, which extends to
1,800 pages, makes 290 recommendations covering the spectrum of the
regulation of healthcare, including patient and public involvement and
complaints handling. If the recommendations are implemented in full,
what effect does the Minister think it will have on the reforms in the
Health and Social Care Act?</hs_para>

recommendations of the report, which the Government rejected from the
outset, is to merge the financial regulator Monitor and the quality
regulator CQC, both of which failed in Mid Staffs. Experience has been
that the two organisations have not been able to work together in a
co-operative way, so why have the Government been so quick to reject
the Francis recommendation? Francis expects that all organisations,
including the Department of Health, should report annually on progress
towards implementing his recommendations. Will the Minister say who in
the Department of Health will have the responsibility of making sure
that that happens? I cannot help but feel that patients and the public
will expect the Government to take the lead.</hs_para>

followed publication of the report the Government announced the
establishment of a post of chief inspector of hospitals. The CQC in 
<?notus-xml column=100?>its response added a chief inspector of social care. Does this
fundamentally change the function, nature and the management of the
CQC? What is the role of its board and chief executive vis-à-vis
the chief inspector and his army of inspectors?</hs_para>

Secretary of State is inviting other regulators to inform him how they

From the many briefs your Lordships have received in advance of
today’s debate, all the regulators and the so-called
quasi-regulators see themselves as having a key role in making sure
that high-quality patient care is delivered and is safe. They all also
suggest that they may carry this out by inspections. If they and their
managers now see the Francis report and its recommendations as the new
targets, then they miss the point. I hope the Government do not. No
amount of inspections by expert inspectors and regulators on their own
will provide the safeguards needed, nor improve patient care. The
culture change that is required will allow well trained health
professionals to provide the patient care that the majority of them are
capable of providing and let others provide the support that enables
them to do so. Of course their performance should be monitored and
their shortcomings dealt

patient safety recommendations in the report. Two words appear
frequently. Francis felt failures at Mid Staffs were a result of
systems failures. Others have agreed, if only to absolve themselves or
their organisations from blame. Other industries such as the airline,
nuclear, transport and offshore industries are familiar with the
concept of systems failures. They also know that the same system is
operating throughout the industry and if it fails in one place it is
likely to fail elsewhere too. For example, the 787 Dreamliner was
grounded because two planes showed faults. The next step in any systems
failure is to carry out root cause analysis, implement the learning and
make changes to make the system safer. If the Francis report is a root
cause analysis of a systems failure, then a systems change is

Government’s response. In fact, there are rather more than 290
recommendations, if you add in the bullet points. There are some 10
bullet points within some recommendations. To me, the trust’s
most important decision and most important choice is who to appoint as
its chief executive, with the necessary knowledge and the team-building
skills that go with that knowledge. Hospitals are complicated and
continuous operations. No two patients present in the same way. Mid
Staffs provides 48 distinct
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:24:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0003.htm#13031158000077">The
new chief executive has her chairman and his governors, six executive
directors and four heads of clinical directorates: 10 people in
executive positions. Of these 48 services, 40 are medical and the other
eight finance, administration, and so on. I must be careful to point
out that the trust and Mid Staffs are not exactly the same thing. The
trust employs close to 3,000 employees, so the 48 services, with the
3,000 employees, are the management responsibility of the 10: the
executive directors and the heads of the clinical directorates. Clearly
with that number of employees and that number of services, there is a
need for a detailed and well understood middle management 
<?notus-xml column=102?>structure. After all, there are 120 consultants, all professionally
qualified and all of a certain

will end with one example of how one needs to look at the middle
management—the 800 in admin and estates—and the person
within that system who is responsible for bed linen. That person needs
to hold a budget, and needs to be sure that the supplies of bed linen
are as they should be, that the laundry works as it should, and that
the linen is available. If one looks back to the Francis report and
tries to find how the reports that have been done have tackled these
very detailed problems of middle management—MRI, ultrasound,
X-ray, or what you will—there is not much to be found. I
therefore urge us to concentrate our minds on the management, the
staffing, and the leadership of individual hospitals, and not to widen
our look too

Francis report outlines a huge number of recommendations that include
changes in the culture and much about policing the service to detect
poor behaviour, but to my mind, beefing up the complaints system, while
very important, comes a bit too late. We need to think more about
preventing the need for the complaints, and there is one crucial
omission; while there is a strong focus on the responsibilities of the
managers and the board, none of these people, try as they might, can be
on the wards all the time, every day of the week. They visit from time
to time. The doctors, too, come and go as they rush to their clinics or
operating theatres. The people on the wards all the time are the
nurses, and this is where we have to focus
hard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0003.htm#13031158000083">I am in
no position to criticise the nurses themselves—they do a
fantastic job, and I have personal reasons for being enormously
grateful for what they do. My aim in pointing at the nurses is much
more to do with the way in which nursing careers are organised. This is
where I believe some changes are needed. We need to bring back the
old-style career-grade sister who was in charge of the ward. Many years
ago when I was a young doctor—I am sorry that I sound like an
old fogey—the sister in charge really was in charge. She was
usually a mature woman—there were few men in those
roles—and she ran her ward with a rod of iron. Both the patients
and the doctors ran scared and were loath to cross her, but she knew
everything about every patient, and the doctors relied on her
implicitly. She would not have countenanced the sorts of behaviour that
were described so vividly in the Francis report.</hs_para>

that post? Now the role of ward sister is not regarded as a career post
at all. It is simply a rung on a ladder leading, and after a year
or so they are promoted to teaching or more
managerial roles. It is just a stepping stone to bigger and
better things that are not so closely engaged with the
patients.</hs_para>

me that it is unusual for them to find a nurse, let alone the sister,
to accompany them on their ward rounds, or indeed to find anyone to
tell them what has been happening to their patients. The solution, to
my mind, is not the heavy hand of top-down monitoring and punitive
complaints procedures, but the placing on each ward of sisters or
charge nurses in clinical career posts—I stress clinical
posts—who are given full responsibility for what goes on in
their wards and are awarded accordingly. My view is that they should be
given exactly the same salary as a consultant, since that would be
commensurate with their level of responsibility. It would be a post
that commands all the respect that you would expect of someone in such
an important position. I recognise that this idea might not meet with
the approval of the nursing professional bodies, but I ask the Minister
to consider this proposal sympathetically. It seems to me to be the
only way in which Florence Nightingale and

have a voice and should be secure in knowing that there will be
recourse for any problems that they raise. I ask my noble friend the

children and families and were overwhelmed. The

my experience, particularly of child and family social work and of
staff in children’s homes, it is vital to value those who work
directly with such vulnerable people and to provide them with the
training and support they need to do the right job. If one wishes to
create a culture of care, many factors are involved. However, a crucial
element of that is providing a caring environment in which one takes
care of and values one’s workforce. One needs to select the
right people and offer good continuous professional development,

for the vital necessity of caring for the workforce, I would be
grateful if the Minister would indicate what more might be done to make
more public the state of morale within the NHS workforce, including,
for instance, easily accessible information on staff turnover and
sickness and absence rates. Having read the Francis report, if I go
into hospital the first thing I will try to find out is the state of
staff morale in that hospital. In discussions on the Health and Social
Care Bill, we were given information from the King’s Fund or the
Nuffield Trust indicating the wide disparity in workforce morale in
different trusts. This needs to be addressed if we are to change the

and I say this hesitantly, my sense of what is sometimes the most
dispiriting thing for people working in the health service, having
spoken with them over the years, is the sense that there is another
huge reform coming through. It can seem that each time there is a new
Government or a new Secretary of State, there is a new transformation
of the health service. Respectfully, therefore, I request that the
Minister perhaps encourages his colleagues to think twice before
embarking on any major new reforms of the health service. I would
respectfully say the same thing to the opposition Front Bench. Given

Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, I am particularly grateful to Lord
Patel. For 40 years I was a Staffordshire Member of Parliament, and for
the first 27 of those years, the Stafford Hospital looked after a large
part of my constituency. It was a good hospital; I do not remember
receiving a single serious complaint in those 27 years, and I visited
regularly. In 1997 we had 
<?notus-xml column=106?>boundary changes, and from then on only a handful—relatively
speaking—of my constituents went to Stafford; the others went to
Wolverhampton, Walsall and
Dudley.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0003.htm#13031158000100">I was
devastated when I, as chairman of the Staffordshire MPs, took
colleagues whose constituents had been affected, to see successive
Secretaries of State. The terrible, tragic stories would have moved the
stoniest of hearts. It is an indictment going far beyond Stafford that
in his report, Mr Francis had to put at the top of his list of
recommendations what we should all automatically take for granted: that
it is the duty of the health service to put patients first. We should
not need to be told
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0003.htm#13031158000101">In his
report, Mr Francis makes a number of comments about leadership. He
recommends that there should be a staff college—I hope that my
noble friend will agree that that will happen. He also talks about
governors being given proper training. He is not quite so explicit when
it comes to board members, and I did raise that subject when we had a
brief question and answer when the statement was given a few weeks ago.
Everyone concerned with the running of the hospital, and with being

have to touch on a rather contentious matter, because the fact is, if
leadership is going to be effective, it has to command confidence and
respect, and it has to enjoy the support—not merely official,
but explicit and implicit—of all those people over whom
leadership is being exercised. There is, of course, a famous phrase
that the buck has to stop somewhere. One has to recognise that during
part of this terrible period, Sir David Nicholson was in charge in the
Midlands. We have to accept that he is the chief executive of the
National Health Service now. I have to ask the question, and I think it
would be wrong if this question was not raised in the Chamber this
evening: can we have trust and confidence in Sir David Nicholson to
deliver a health service that is truly worthy of our great country? I
believe that he should be examining his position very carefully. This
happened on his watch. We are told that 1,200, or thereabouts, died
unnecessarily. Somebody, Charles Moore I think it was, wrote in the
<I>Telegraph</I> the other day about the Prime Minister going to
Amritsar where fewer than 400 people were killed; 1,200 died during

could be more involved by listening to their patients or their

only the quality of their work but their morale, and give them
vocational pride and recognition. Those who wished should be given the

features of community health councils should be to be brought back.
Current arrangements through the CQC, or its equivalent in 2008, for
voicing patient concerns clearly did not function in Mid Staffs. An
up-to-date CHC-like organisation would give patients and their
relatives ready access to a representative, truly independent, body
where they could freely voice any concerns that they had about their
hospital experience. CHCs had the right to speak directly to NHS
authorities, to visit any NHS entities and attend trust meetings.
CHCs’ own meetings were open and transparent, and were often
reported in the local, and sometimes national, press. CHCs were of
course of uneven quality and received barely adequate funding. However,
they could prove to be an embarrassment to NHS administrators when
unwelcome truths were openly discussed. Perhaps it is understandable
why they were abolished by the previous Government in 2003. As the
noble Earl will remember well, I strongly opposed their closure at the

I should like to concentrate on recommendations 185 to 213, which
affect nursing and healthcare support workers. What concerns me about
this report—and indeed these recommendations—is 
<?notus-xml column=108?>how we can prioritise and implement them, because trying to prioritise
and implement 290 at the same time is, quite frankly, an impossible
task. As was said by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, time has not
stood still since Mid Staffs. The Nursing and Midwifery Council has
produced new standards for pre-registration nursing training, which are
widely welcomed by patient groups, by the higher education
institutions, by professionals and by
providers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0003.htm#13031158000110">As
we move to a fully graduate nursing profession, I trust we will not
waste time re-opening the issue of a graduate nurse workforce, as
indicated by Ann Clwyd in another place. Francis quite rightly
recommends a greater emphasis on recruiting caring as well as
intelligent students, but believing these two qualities to be mutually
exclusive is disingenuous. With less than 25% of current nurses being
graduates, it was not graduate training that caused a lack of care at
Mid Staffs. The quality of the placements where nurses receive their
practical training requires urgent attention, as does the quality of
mentorship they
receive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0003.htm#13031158000111">The
50% practical placement is fundamental to the development of a well
trained workforce, yet far too often students are dissatisfied with the
quality of the experience they receive on their placements. Fewer
placements are now in hospital settings, particularly acute hospital
settings, and staff are often too busy to give of their time. Learning
is not seen as a corporate activity and, more worryingly, core
competencies are sometimes neither practised or observed before being
signed off. At the core of this problem is the outdated view that all
registered nurses can be good mentors, and that somehow mentorship can
be added to very busy schedules with little training or additional
time. That must change. If we want our nurses to be inspired to be more
patient-centred, then the practical learning settings must be of the
highest possible standard. Mentors must care for their students, and be
valued by their
employers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0003.htm#13031158000112">Francis

first step—I hope the Minister would agree—is to have
mandatory training by the end of this Parliament, with standards for

to engage these workers. To the Minister, who is worried about
registration, I suggest that an immediate step toward independent
registration would be that by the end of this Parliament every employer
who provides direct physical care will be required to keep a register
of all their employees who deliver care. Their training records should
be available for inspection by the CQC, Monitor and Healthwatch
England, or

noble friend Lord Patel for having secured this important debate. I
declare my own interest as professor of surgery at University College,
consultant surgeon at University College Hospital, and a member of the
General Medical Council. There can only be one north star guiding the
way we operate in the National Health Service and the way we deliver
care, and that must be our patients. In his report, Sir Robert Francis
refers to a deterioration in cultures and values. We must find ways to
ensure that the cultures and the values that must attend the delivery
of healthcare are rapidly restored in our healthcare

way that this may be achieved is by revisiting the question of
professionalism. All of us in the health service today work in
multidisciplinary teams and, quite rightly, those teams are comprised
of clinicians, nurses, other therapists, healthcare assistants and
indeed managers who help us to utilise effectively the resources
available for healthcare. Those teams can work only if there is mutual
respect, but there must also be professionalism.</hs_para>

clinicians—and I talk here particularly about consultants in
hospitals—we need to move to a position where once again
consultants are accountable for the management of, and delivery of care
for, the patients for whom they have responsibility. They must have the
authority to deliver that responsibility for care, and with that
responsibility and authority they must be held accountable for the
outcomes of their patients. That is very clear. Ultimately, it is vital
that patients and the public generally recognise, and are able to have
confidence in, the fact that when they are admitted into hospital they
will be managed and be under the care of a named healthcare
professional—a consultant—who will take that
responsibility, have that authority and be held accountable.</hs_para>

management of the ward environment, it seems sensible to return to the

patient’s care might appear under the name of that patient at

the Francis report, we also see reference to broader questions of
culture and values. Part of restoring professionalism will be
revisiting once again the contract of employment for healthcare
professionals—both consultants in hospitals and general
practitioners in primary care. We need to move away from the consultant
contract being principally one of contractual obligation and take it
back to a place where it is one of vocational commitment, where
patients can be absolutely certain that there will be continuity of
care and that those with named responsibility for their care will be
available to ensure that that is discharged.</hs_para>

for restoring the culture and values in our healthcare system is
leadership. In this regard, in his report Sir Robert Francis has
paid attention to the possibility of the staff college
model. At University College London Partners, where
I have an involvement, I am patron of the UCLP staff
college. There, we have taken a model built on the Army staff college
at Shrivenham, and we have a faculty from that institution attending
our staff college to help to develop the leaders in our
healthcare system. The model is simple. It focuses, first, on the
self-reflection of those offering themselves for leadership positions
so that they might question whether they have the ability to do that,
and it then develops a leadership culture that puts at its head
responsibility for those whom one is leading to ensure that they are
developed to deliver the necessary care for the

blatant failure to do so is a clear signal that action must be taken

report. In particular, I highlight the importance of ensuring that
governors receive proper training and guidance in their roles, with
greater emphasis on their personal accountability. Quality accounts,
which Francis talks about, with complete and accurate information on a
trust’s level of compliance with the fundamental and enhanced
standards of care should be made openly available on its website, be

will draw very briefly on my own experience of chairing a public body.
What I have learnt to be critical to effective corporate governance is
that all board members should go out, be curious, ask questions and
above all listen. All board members should go out on visits, talk
directly to front-line practitioners without the management being
present, ask to see service-user feedback, and ask what has been done
about the issues raised which fall short of expected standards. The
board recently reviewed all the service-user feedback to assess its
adequacy, and looked at all the complaints, their nature as well as
their number, how they were dealt with and how they were being fed in
to a cycle of continuous improvement. I make this point simply to
emphasise that this is not an add-on or a nice to-do. This is at the
very heart of effective corporate governance. An interesting article
from the King’s Fund, which was published just before the
Francis inquiry report, looked at the way in which boards operate in
the NHS. It concluded that behaviour in the boardroom is key to the
effective management of
quality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000141" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0003.htm#13031158000141">It is

Hayman:</Member></B> My Lords, like others I congratulate my noble
friend Lord Patel on initiating this debate. I declare an interest as a
member of the General Medical Council, like the noble Lord, Lord
Kakkar. That interest, of course, translates into a responsibility. So
many organisations, including the GMC, have a responsibility to study
Francis, to understand what went wrong, and to play their part in
putting it right for other parts of the National Health Service. In
particular, the GMC needs to consider its own leadership role in
driving standards up; it must be not just the policeman but the coach
of professionalism and high standards. It must address that
tremendously dangerous disengagement from management that we saw
illustrated and which defines professionalism, not as the noble Lord,
Lord Kakkar did, but very narrowly as care of one’s own patient
rather than responsibility for the whole clinical environment. One of
the chilling things about Francis was how many people who were not bad
people felt either disempowered or “aresponsible” in
terms of what they could see going on elsewhere in the
hospital.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0003.htm#13031158000143">The
noble Lord, Lord Willis, said that as parliamentarians we had some
responsibilities, too, in not having discussed the issues of values and

certainly spent many hours on structures and funding

that much of the energy that has gone into reorganisations has sapped
energy from the absolute fundamentals of what the NHS is about. Francis
gives us the opportunity not to turn this into 290 new boxes to be
ticked, but to look at the fundamental purpose and values of healthcare
that need to be subscribed to, understood by and championed by those
responsible for governance and professional leadership and those
responsible as managers. I was brought into the NHS 30 years ago by a
hugely talented and committed NHS manager, Alasdair Liddell, who died
tragically and suddenly on New Year’s Eve last year. The

efficiency. To ignore that goldmine is hugely damaging. There are very

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, I recognise that Robert Francis
performed an important public service in his first report by
identifying appalling failures at the Mid Staffordshire trust. However,
as others have said, things have moved on since then. Frankly, I found
Francis’s second report much more of a curate’s egg. His
call for candour and more transparency in the NHS deserves our support,
as does identifying board members and managers who are not fit and
proper persons. The CQC needs to improve its effectiveness, especially
in its use of provider registration, but I hope the Government will see
the 290 recommendations as an à la carte menu from which they
can select judiciously.</hs_para>

key questions. First, is there good evidence in this second report that
the behaviour at Mid Staffordshire was widespread? I have read very
carefully the 115-page executive summary—probably the largest
executive summary I have read in my life. I did not find in that
summary compelling evidence about the widespread failings that have
been identified across the NHS. After the expenditure of £13
million on producing this second report, I would have expected to be
more convinced than I was. Without appearing complacent, we must avoid
tarring 1.3 million NHS staff with the Mid Staffordshire brush,
particularly if we do not have the evidence to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0003.htm#13031158000157">Secondly,
is it right to concentrate such huge new efforts on monitoring and
regulating hospital care? We know that too many people in acute
hospitals should not be there. The estimates vary from 25% to 40%. The
NHS operating framework has identified this problem for some time. I
found nothing in the Francis report touching on this issue. If we now
put huge amounts of regulatory effort into hospital care, presided over
by a new, shiny chief hospital inspector, we miss a critical point for
the future sustainability of the NHS. If we really want to hold David
Nicholson to account, we should concentrate on what is being done to
change the commissioning of services so that many fewer elderly people
are admitted to and moulder in the medical wards of acute hospitals.
That is the real systemic
failure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000158" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0003.htm#13031158000158">Lastly,
I would like us to question whether the answer to failed regulation is
more regulation. I question the good sense of new criminal sanctions
for staff and 
<?notus-xml column=117?>board members. We already struggle to get good board members for what
can seem a rather thankless task. Will there really be more
whistleblowing if staff think they might send a colleague to jail? We
need a better rating system for hospitals, but also for GPs and
community services, with more publicly-available standardised
comparable data for the NHS service providers. This is a topic that the
Government rejected amendments on during the passage of the Health and
Social Care Bill. Perhaps they might like to think again on this
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031158000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-0003.htm#13031158000159">The

first point is to focus on a patient-centred culture. Having researched

and standards that are set, and unless they are open, transparent and
activated, we will have another Mid Staffs. To avoid this, there must
be strong cultural leadership. Do the Government intend to grasp this

budgetary constraints, it would nevertheless be helpful if minimum

examining the recommendations from this report, we must also remember

day after day, to the satisfaction of those for whom they care.
However, it is vital that there is regular updating though
post-registration training, as this is of such importance in this time

Lord Patel, my great fear is that we may be in danger of creating a
massive bureaucratic edifice in dealing with what essentially was a
failure in one trust. It is worth repeating that Mr Francis
said that what happened in Mid Staffordshire was caused by a serious
failure on the part of a provider trust, which did not listen
sufficiently to its patients and staff or ensure the correction of
deficiencies brought to the trust’s attention. Like
my noble friend Lord Warner, I find it
difficult<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:29:52"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:29:58"></hs_TimeCode>

made about whether the target-based performance approach impacted on
quality of care and, indeed, on the involvement of clinicians in their
organisation. I defend targets. I remind noble Lords that in 1997 we
had the spectre of very long waiting lists. There was a patient charter
that said patients should be treated within 18-months—even that
was not being met. The result of the target 
<?notus-xml column=119?>approach has been to reduce waiting time limits to 18 weeks.
When one had long waiting times, patients suffered and some people
died. I do not think we should ignore it.</hs_para>

as a foundation trust chair and can say that, seen from the front line
at the moment, we have a system under extraordinary pressure. Patient
numbers are up, primary care accessibility is problematic and cuts in
local government services reduce their ability to take patients out of
hospitals and into their homes or care homes. Everywhere systems are
under huge pressure. I think it is grossly unfair to ignore those
pressures while, as the Secretary of State has consistently done in
speech after speech, pointing out to the NHS its alleged
deficiencies, without acknowledging the impact of the resource cuts or
the uncertainties of the changes being brought about. As my noble
friend Lord Warner pointed out, they will do nothing to deal with the
big issue we all face, which is the number of frail elderly in our

the way that the system allowed such horrific events to go on unchecked

better position than before to prevent the sort of catastrophic
failures of care seen at Mid Staffs because we now have a system which

before. Francis’s report outlines the serious consequences that
occur when regulators do not communicate with each other properly and
work in silos rather than in partnership. The reforms will enable us to
allow for stronger and better regulation. From April 2013, Monitor will
be the sector regulator for healthcare in England, and with the Care
Quality Commission it will jointly license providers of NHS-funded
care. Both have new duties to work more closely together and promote
the interests of people who use healthcare services. The Care Quality
Commission will have a new chief inspector of hospitals with powers to
ensure that the system acts quickly to tackle unacceptable care. We are
currently considering Francis’s specific recommendations on

is clear from this report that during previous times of change in the
NHS patient care and safety have suffered. What is also clear from the
Francis report is that the system needed to be restructured precisely
because patient safety was falling through gaps. I take the point made
by a number of noble Lords about regulatory burdens, and we have
commissioned a review by the NHS Confederation to consider how
bureaucratic burdens on providers of NHS care can be reduced. The focus
of the review is to consider how to reduce the burden of inspection and
data collection on the providers of care so that they can focus more on
the delivery of safe and effective compassionate care. That is why one
of core objectives for the NHS Commissioning Board, as set out in the
mandate, is to ensure the NHS provides safe care for patients, and it
will be developing a new patient safety strategy to deliver on
this.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_11_PT_1/C162AA115DA7635189D003F36C778ABF74BE571D" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 March 2013">Monday,

establish and operate systems for collecting and analysing information
relating to the safety of the services provided by the health service.

Committee of the reasons for Operation Atalanta to begin with. It was
not just about commercial shipping, which we most know it for. It was
about protecting the World Food Programme, which was keeping vast
numbers of people alive and away from starvation in Somalia itself, and
getting that product to the port of Mogadishu was quite a challenge. It
was also technically about protecting Somalia’s fisheries and
has actually been pretty successful at that, but not of any great help
to the Somalis. It was also about helping the commercial shipping side
in terms of repulsing piracy on one of the world’s most
important trade routes. Atalanta itself is one of three organised
operations; Atalanta is the European Union one and there is
NATO’s Ocean Shield, while Combined Task Force 151 is a
coalition of other countries. There are also a number of independent
operators as well, which we will come back
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:32:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000006">I
shall set the scene by coming back to the 2010 report, in which we made
a number of specific observations and recommendations. We had the World
Food Programme leasing ships that were probably the slowest
that ploughed the oceans anywhere on the globe. Why? Because they were
the cheapest. However, that meant they were the most vulnerable and,
because  
<?notus-xml column=2?>of the way that the charter agreement was, they did not allow military
contingents on those vessels so they had to be shadowed by very
expensive and scarce warships from the areas of issue right the way
through to port. There was a lack of tanker refuelling, which meant
that the best naval vessels had to go backwards and forwards to port in
order to refuel, wasting a lot of time. If pirates were captured, there
was often nowhere to send them or try them, because western navies were
reluctant to bring those pirates back to their own
shores<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:33:33"></hs_TimeCode>. The
insurance companies seemed to be oblivious to the problem or not to
care about it. As far as they were concerned, it was a loss, they got
their income and there was an occasional “hit” in terms
of ransoms that had to be paid out, but there was no responsibility on
the part of the insurance
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:33:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000007">The
Indian Ocean and the Gulf are a vast ocean, yet there is very little
air surveillance. In fact, Luxembourg had to rent a private plane on
behalf of Atalanta, which was used as surveillance out of the
Seychelles, and that was about all there was to begin with. There was
an undisciplined merchant fleet, which is still a problem to some
degree, and many masters did not pay attention to the convoy systems or
the various other ways of repulsing or at least putting off piracy
attention. We also encountered the issue that the European Union and
NATO seemed not to be managing to get on very well operationally, as
always.</hs_para>

was the result of that? In 2010 there were 174 attacks and
47 pirated ships. More than that, however, through this effort we
managed to displace this problem from the Gulf right out to the
Indian Ocean as a whole, so it became a far more difficult
problem. Somali piracy, which is part of the private sector and private
entrepreneurship to a large degree, found new ways of modifying the
model through mother ships and all sorts of other ways, so that it
could be more successful over that broader area. That brought major
economic issues—we often forget this—to those littoral
states in east Africa, whether it be Somalia itself, Tanzania, Kenya or
the Seychelles. Because people feared to transit those waters or go to
port in those areas, there were direct economic consequences. Tourism
was also
affected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:35:34"></hs_TimeCode>. The
one area that did benefit, I am told, is the fisheries stocks. No one
dared go there, so the fisheries did well. Unfortunately, the Somalis
themselves probably did not benefit much from that.</hs_para>

is the situation now? In 2012 the attacks decreased from 174—in
2010—to 36; instead of 47 pirated ships in 2010, we
only had five. In 2013 so far—these are early days,
admittedly—there have been only two attacks and no pirated
vessels whatever. During that whole time, the World Food Programme has
not suffered one loss. So, in some ways, the prime reason for Atalanta
has been
successful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:36:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000010">Why
has this happened? My colleagues and fellow noble Lords will no doubt
go through this. However, the reasons include very strong international
co-operation, not just between those three forces but also between
independent nations. This includes China, which for the first time has
operated outside its regional area; India, Russia and even
Iran—although that is one country where the co-operation has not
been so great. The international effort has led to success. There has 
<?notus-xml column=3?>also been real practical working at sea, even at a practical level
between the European Union and NATO, which must be a first. Merchant
fleet behaviour has become much better through the work of Northwood.
Surveillance and intelligence using the Seychelles as a base has worked
well; air surveillance has been far more effective and consistent; and
intelligence has been
shared<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:37:21"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:37:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000011">The
committee also recognised that there has been a more robust approach.
We are regularly reminded that this is a constabulary operation, not a
military one, and that the use of force therefore has to be
proportionate and used carefully. However, we generally regarded the
raid on the coast as a successful instance of putting down a marker to
show that the European Union force was serious in terms of its intent
regarding pirate bases. Also, armed guards are now allowed on most of
the merchant fleet. Our own committee was against this originally but
we have changed our mind on that. However, I would be interested to
hear the Government’s view on how the programme has worked.
Perhaps most significant of all, in his evidence to us Alexander
Rondos, the EU special representative, described Somalia and its cities
as having bustle and growth, although he saw it as an economy without a
state<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:38:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000012">What
are the lessons we learnt? The obvious ones are that there is disorder
where there are weak states and where the rule of law does not go to
the borders; and that regardless of whether that is due to religious
militancy or, as here, private sector entrepreneurship, it is very bad
for nationals and for the international community. We have seen a
different sort of piracy in west Africa as well and we will need to
tackle that over time, too. We also know that it is good to have a
comprehensive policy. We now have a much more comprehensive one in
terms of the European Union’s Horn of Africa policy in Atalanta,
the EU trading mission for Somali troops and increasing the coastal
capabilities of all those states through the EUCAP NESTOR operation. We
felt that the Gulf states should be more involved, but we know that
until we solve problems onshore in Somalia, those operations will have
to remain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000013">I
congratulate a number of actors on their work, the Seychelles in
particular. The Foreign Ministry of the Seychelles came and gave us
evidence. It worked strongly and very responsibly with the community.
At Northwood, we saw a most professional operation which was hugely
international in its scope. We felt great confidence in it and it has
clearly been a major part of success. However, I commend perhaps most
of all the international co-operation between all those forces; for
example, between the UK and France—one of the French warships,
FS “Surcouf”, has a UK Lynx helicopter on it. I also
commend the Seychelles, Kenya and Mauritius on the trial and
imprisonment of pirates. However, I remind my fellow Members of this
House that four vessels are still being held; that is, 108 human beings
are still being held as hostages in those conditions. We have a ready
business model that can be used elsewhere in the world. I believe also
that we have failed to see the needs and the hopes of
the  
<?notus-xml column=4?>Somali people in judging this operation. Perhaps looking inland, as well
as out to sea, is something that we need to learn from this otherwise
successful operation. I beg to move.</hs_para>

find it absolutely intolerable that a committee such as ours sits for a
number of weeks or months, takes evidence and brings a lot of people
kindly to give evidence before us; we produce a report in August; the
Government respond shortly afterwards; but we cannot find time for the
House to debate it until the following March. I find this quite
intolerable. We have a government Whip who is kind enough to be with
us—it is nothing to do with him—and I hope that he will
pass on to the usual channels and those who organise our business that
we really must treat Select Committee reports in a better way than
this. I find it very unsatisfactory indeed. I say no more about
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000015">I should

thing I want to do is to welcome the reduction in incidents of Somali
piracy during the past year or so. This is a very significant fall and
reflects great credit on the various military and naval forces which
have helped to bring it about. I suppose that it has been helped
particularly by the fact, referred to by the noble Lord, that a great
number of merchant ships now have armed guards on them. We heard
evidence that this has had a salutary effect on potential pirates, who
find that there is a certain amount of fire directed towards them when
they start attempting to board merchant
ships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000017">As the
chairman said, the committee changed its mind over this matter. In the
earlier report, I think that a number of us were a little anxious lest
we moved into a situation where oil tankers with a huge amount of
inflammable material aboard started being attacked by rockets fired by
pirates. There is a danger that, over months, as a response to armed
guards on ships, the pirates might start using much more lethal
weaponry which could lead to a major attack on a ship causing it to
catch fire. So far, however, having armed guards has been a big
success<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:45:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000018">The
chairman did briefly refer to another success—that 1,000,000
tonnes of food has been brought into Somalia under the World Food
Programme. This is a wonderful record in an area where there is a great
deal of belligerence. Many people would say that they did not deserve
it, but of course starving people always deserve it and we should
salute those who have taken in this 1,000,000 tonnes of food

episode which has helped to reduce the number of incidents was the
single land attack on one of the harbours used by the pirates. I am
glad that Admiral Potts said that we would do it again. There has been
a certain amount of criticism about attacking a land target but it was
quite right to do it and I think the committee agreed with that. When
we went to Northwood I suggested that it would be a good idea 
<?notus-xml column=5?>to have another one just to show that it was not a one-off. I may sound
rather belligerent but it did have an enormous salutary effect and
another attack should not be ruled

responds, I hope he will speak about the political progress that has
been made in Somalia itself. From our committee’s report and
from the comments of virtually everyone who has spoken about the crisis
in Somalia and in the seas around it has been agreed that, on the
ground, the long-term solution is a political one. This is very
important and I hope the Minister will talk about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:47:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000021">I
am very disturbed indeed to hear that the newly elected President has
decided to release 959 pirates by way of amnesty. Again, I hope the
Minister will explain this because, from the brief I looked at which
said that the President had given an amnesty to 959 pirates, I am not
sure whether they were convicted, or that they were held and awaiting
trial, or that they were known to be pirates to the civil authorities,
such as they are in Somalia. I am interested to know quite what the
basis of this amnesty is. We are told that the amnesty does not extend
to what I would called the godfathers—the evil plotters who have
been organising these attacks and who have been receiving vast amounts
of money in ransoms. I am glad to know that the godfathers have not had
amnesties but it would be helpful to know about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:49:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000022">I
turn now to the future. It seems to me that those 959 pirates who have
received an amnesty and are now free to get up to their monkey tricks
again. The godfathers are presumably still there, ready to organise
such things. Again, I hope the Minister will talk to us about the
future. As the number of attacks has been so significantly reduced,
there will be a temptation by NATO, the Americans, the European Union
and others who have been involved to say, “Oh well, it is much
less now—we can relax our presence”. I am sure that there
will be political pressure, particularly given the pressure on all the
militaries around the world, to say that they are going to reduce the
military and naval presence there. Having done so, however, there is a
danger—because the pirates have received an amnesty and the
godfathers are still there—that it will all start up again using
the assets which have been used
previously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:50:36"></hs_TimeCode>. I

very much hope the Minister will speak about—I will try to fill
in for a moment until the Minister has got his brief; I quite
understand that one has to do that—is the fact that we said in
our report that it was important to enthuse the Gulf states about
attacking the pirates and causing the incidents to be reduced. Quite
honestly, however, the Government’s response to our suggestion
that the Gulf states should be encouraged to take a much more active
part was pretty wishy-washy. I will not read aloud the
Government’s response but they gave us four answers to that: we
have a headquarters in Bahrain; there are port facilities in Oman;
there is co-operation in Dubai; and a whole lot of countries came to a
conference in London. With great respect, that is not at all what we
meant. These Gulf countries are earning monumental amounts of money for
their hydrocarbon exports. As far as I know, their physical assistance
in all of this is not as 
<?notus-xml column=6?>great as it might be. I hope the Minister will look into this and say
whether a much more positive approach can be made to our suggestion, in
paragraph 87 of our report, to get those states much more actively
involved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:52:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

concerned that we were told during the inquiry that quite a few
convicted pirates were going to be returned to Somalia from Kenya, the
Seychelles and other places. It seemed to some of us that to send them
back to prisons in Somalia was not very clever because one could not be
sure of the security around those prisons. We were told that the United
Nations was building a prison and that it would be properly supervised.
Given that 959 pirates have received an amnesty, does that mean that
the United Nations prison will be redundant and not used? I do not know
who these 959 pirates who have received an amnesty are, but it seems to
me rather a strange decision that the prisons within Somalia are secure
enough to hold convicted pirates. It would seem to me to need a great
deal of expert outside supervision to ensure that those prisoners could
not be freed. I look forward to hearing what the Minister
has to
say.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13031157000306" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000306"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:54:24"></hs_TimeCode>3.55

Davies of Stamford:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow
the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, and I think I agree with
everything that he said on this subject. I learnt from him—no
doubt there is something wrong with the way that I get information on
these kind of incidents but I had not heard about it—about the
950 pirates being amnestied by the Government of Somalia. I
totally share his anxiety, indeed his horror, at that news and put it
to the Government that it should have consequences. Unless there was
consultation with the EU in advance of that decision being made by the
Somali President then consequences really ought to flow, because it is
quite inconsistent with the kind of collaboration and mutual confidence
which one had understood had been developed over the past few months
between the EU on the one side and the Somali Government on the other.
The consequences should be in terms of aid or other forms of support
which will be felt, in measured degree, by the Government of Somalia.
If we just allow this incident to go uncommented on and unsanctioned,
we shall be encouraging similarly bad behaviour in the future and shall
lose that sense that we need to act as a team and keep in
close co-operation with the Somali Government—we need to consult
with them about things but they need to consult with us as well, and we
expect their support. The cost of capturing these pirates is very
considerable and the idea that they should be released in this way is
quite
horrific<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:55:56"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:55:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000026">I
will make three points, two of which will be approving—indeed
congratulatory—points about the report and one of which will be
more hortatory, or perhaps slightly critical. First, although there are
other very good examples which I will not mention but which we all have
had before our eyes, this seems to be an extraordinarily and
particularly good example of the success of the European common foreign
and security policy. We have managed to make considerable
progress—the figures have already been mentioned—in
dealing with this great threat and have managed to do 
<?notus-xml column=7?>so with tremendous leverage in the case of this country. We have almost
not contributed any military units at all. We have contributed one of
Her Majesty’s ships, a Royal Naval vessel, for a few months and
of course contributed very importantly by providing command and control
and logistical management of the exercise from PJHQ. We have obviously
done an extremely good job there, and I add my own words to the words
of congratulation that have already been spoken. I am of course very
familiar with PJHQ—it is a wonderful body and a superb
organisation, and it is not surprising to me that it has done such a
good job. On top of that contribution, we have got all these vessels
together. It would have been nice to have even more resources but we
have contributed very considerable resources. It is an example of the
leverage that can be generated by the common foreign and security
policy and of the success that we can
have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:57:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000027">Eurosceptics
tend to say that we do not need an explicit EU policy and that we can
just have a series of ad hoc coalitions where a lot of countries agree
in their assessment of the problem and are prepared to do something
about it. That is a very inadequate answer indeed. If you do not have a
common foreign and security policy, you do not have the mechanisms and
the tried and tested procedures there for, first, evaluating the
threat, which is very important, and then for managing the response.
You do not have the long-standing commitment and sense of solidarity;
everybody just starts off saying, “Is it really in our national
interest to do this? Do we really want to do it? How much will we be
compensated by allies if we do it?”. You have to start afresh
again, negotiating all these things from scratch, and every operation
has the weaknesses and dangers of an experiment rather than being an
ongoing, tried and tested policy where people have the confidence, know
the procedures will work, and are familiar and happy with the
decision-making process. This is a very good example of how we need a
common foreign and security policy. I do not know that the Government
are particularly interested in my contribution to their balance of
competences review—they would probably dismiss me as a Europhile
and anyway a member of the Labour Party, and so would not be interested
in what I say—but I hope that the point gets included in the
evaluation of the balance of competences review when it comes to the
European common foreign and security policy. In fact, it would be
monstrous if this was not taken into account as one of the examples of
the success of that
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:59:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000028">The
second point I wanted to make, which is again very much approving, is
to congratulate the committee on having been pragmatic enough to review
its original position on two matters. One was the attack on the
pirates’ land bases and the second was on having armed guards on
ships passing through the pirate zone. The committee reviewed its
original position in the light of evidence and experience and came up
with absolutely the right policy solution. It strongly
supports—as do I—the initiative taken to deal with some
of the land bases. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, that it
may be necessary to take further action. If it is, I hope that the
authorities concerned will be encouraged to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T15:59:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

have proved their worth. It is not necessary to carry heavy armament
for this purpose: a couple of general-purpose machine-guns, one on the
port side and one on the starboard, will be enough effectively to deter
the sort of pirates with whom we are dealing in the Indian Ocean. The
committee was very good on that. It did not just come up with an

my third point, about ransom payments, I take issue with the committee.
I have spoken on this in the Chamber, so noble Lords may be familiar
with my views, which have not changed. The committee’s
recommendation comes in paragraph 51 on page 18, which
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13031157000269" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000269">“We
reiterate our previous conclusion in our 2009 report that those
involved in assembling ransoms in the United Kingdom have a duty to
seek consent for its payment and that not to do so, if necessary by
filing a Suspicious Activity Report, may result in the commission of a
criminal offence. We request that the Government now respond
substantively to this
recommendation”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13031157000237" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000237">This

criminal payments. They are rewards to criminals for criminal activity

are also very substantial—not that that makes a difference to
the principle—and run into tens of millions of dollars on a
regular basis. It has become something of an industry and is now a
regular feature of the insurance market in London. Lloyd’s makes
ransom payments that are transported by all sorts of dramatic means to
the pirates in Somalia. This is simply not a situation about which we
as legislators should be complacent. It is quite clear that these are
criminal offences. They are payments to criminals for criminal purposes
and they should be illegal. It should not be a question of reporting
the matter through a suspicious activity report. The payments should be
seized by the Serious Fraud Office or whichever arm of the police is
responsible for monitoring illegal payments of this kind, and we should
make sure, if the law is not robust enough to deal with the matter in
this way and does not make it a criminal offence to make ransom
payments to terrorists, pirates or any other form of criminal, that we
change the law to make sure that it does exactly
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:02:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000032">I
am very disappointed and very sorry that the committee did not come to
that conclusion. It does not explain why it did not, and in its report
did not even examine the suggestion that I am making—unless I
missed it, and I hope I did not. I would be very interested during the
rest of the debate to hear from Members of the Committee about why they
feel that the present legal situation is adequate, and why a suspicious
activity report is the furthest they envisage going in dealing with
this matter—which after all, if it is not dealt with effectively
both by the physical measures about which we have been talking and also
by measures controlling flows in the financial markets, will become a

Jay of Ewelme:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, greatly welcome the
opportunity to discuss this report by Sub-Committee C. As I am about to
be rotated—perhaps in this context I should say
helicoptered—off the committee, perhaps I may also pay tribute
to the stewardship of the committee by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. I
say “stewardship” because I am not sure that Liberal
Democrats accept the concept of
chairmanship<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:04:06"></hs_TimeCode>. I
also welcome the chance to comment—as did the noble Lord, Lord
Davies—on a European Union activity that is working well, and to
which the UK has made an important and perhaps even determining
contribution. I will come back to that general point at the end of my
speech<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:04:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000034">I
welcome, too, the way in which the effectiveness of Operation Atalanta
today draws on the lessons from its own operations at the start. I
think that there is a lesson here perhaps for other European Union
operations and policies too—that there needs to be a constant
rethinking in the light of experience. The first example which strikes
me in particular is the stronger co-operation between Atalanta and NATO
and others including India and China. I think that the way in which
this has become a much more international anti-piracy operation is very
impressive. The second example is the inclusion of security teams on
board ships. The committee did indeed have reservations about this at
first but, in the light of experience, it, too, changed its mind. It is
clear that having security operations on board has proved itself in the
past couple of years or so. Finally, as the noble Lord, Lord Teverson,
pointed out, persuading the World Food Programme to provide larger and
quicker ships to reduce their vulnerability to piracy, which has had a
very marked effect on the ability of the programme to deliver food to
populations in Somalia and elsewhere who really need it, is something
which I greatly welcome, too. However, I welcome in particular the
realisation that piracy is largely the result of chaos and instability
within Somalia, which has effectively for the past 20 years or so, with
a slight improvement recently, been a failed state.</hs_para>

as part of a broader EU approach to the Horn of Africa, not just an
operation in its own right. The Horn of Africa strategy adopted at the
end of 2011, including the training mission in Uganda for Somali
security sector training and the mission to strengthen coastal defence
capabilities through the region—the horribly named EUCAP
NESTOR—have not only been very worth while but add up to an
overall approach by the EU to the Horn of Africa that is admirable. At
the same time, it is encouraging that some economic and political
stability is emerging at least in and around Mogadishu and that the
influence of al-Shabaab is at least for now—and let us hope for
longer than now—on the decline. Ensuring that that continues
must be the main aim of EU and our own policy from now on. This should
largely be an African task, not just an EU or western task, although it
is very hard to see how EU and western help will not be necessary in
the foreseeable
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000036">It
seems to me that the African Union will have a key role to play here.
It has huge challenges at present, and it has weaknesses, but it is far
more effective than 
<?notus-xml column=10?>it has been in the past. I hope that the European Union and the UK will
continue to do what they can to strengthen it. It would be very helpful
if the Minister could say something about
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000037">At the
same time the EU must focus its development on capacity building in
Somalia. I declare an interest here as the chair of a medical aid
charity, Merlin, which operates in Somaliland, Puntland and Somalia
itself. Britain, like the EU, has an important role to play in helping
with education and medical aid both through its own funds and through
the help that it gives to non-governmental
organisations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000038">I
should like to branch out just slightly from Somalia and look at two
other African issues that have arisen since our report was
produced—as the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, said—some
months ago. The first is Mali and the second is piracy in the Gulf of
Guinea. Sub-Committee C has expressed great concern about the
destabilisation of Mali and the impact that that could have on Britain
and on wider European interests since the break-up of the country two
years ago. The attack on the oil refinery in southern Algeria and the
recently—alas—proven murder of hostages, including a
British hostage in northern Nigeria, show only too clearly how
developments apparently remote from us can affect us and damage us
directly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000039">I
would not accept the argument that these attacks are the result of
western action. We have a role to play in supporting west African
countries in countering al-Qaeda, Boko Haram and other terrorist
groups, but I do not underestimate the difficulties in doing it.
I greatly welcome the help that we are giving the French in
what could still be a long and unpredictable campaign in Mali. I
believe that our contribution there really matters and is
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:10:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the debate on Somali piracy is the growth of piracy in west Africa, in
the Gulf of Guinea. In some ways this seems to be of a different kind
of piracy from that in Somalia, including attacks in port—for
example, in Abidjan in the Ivory Coast—and it is centred more on
stealing cargo for money than on kidnapping ships and crews for ransom.
The effect of piracy in west Africa can be particularly dramatic on
fragile economies, increasing insurance rates but, much more than that,
reducing revenue—by up to 70% in the case of Cotonou, the only
port in Benin. That has had a pretty dramatic impact on the state of a
fragile
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:10:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031157000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000041">From the recent
Parliamentary Statement in another place by the Foreign Office
Minister, Alistair Burt, I am glad to see that the Government are
taking the growth of west African piracy seriously. I am also glad that
the Royal Navy is deploying at least one ship in the Gulf of Guinea and
is working closely there with the French. When the Minister responds
could he say whether that deployment has been stepped up in the light
of the growth of piracy in the Gulf of
Guinea<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:11:30"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000042">I
would make one final point in drawing some of these threads together.
We see a mixture of piracy, conflict and terrorism in Somalia, Mali and
the Gulf of Guinea—all of these seem a long way off but this can
affect our interests directly. As a nation with global interests and,
as a member of the UN Security  
<?notus-xml column=11?>Council, of NATO and of the European Union, with global responsibilities
too, we cannot stand aside from nor ignore instability of this sort.
Nor, given budgetary pressures of which I am sure the Minister is only
too aware, can we respond to them on our own. We also need to recognise
that political influence, development and military intervention where
necessary, need to be looked at together—as has been the case in
Somalia—and not as separate activities. As we have seen in
Somalia, the European Union is uniquely able to do this, by bringing
together actions through its defence policy and its common foreign and
security policy. All of those are important for the African countries
themselves, for the EU and, I would argue, for Britain as well. None of
those policies is perfect; all would be better with the full engagement
of the United Kingdom, and British interests would be well served too.
In the context of common foreign and security policy and of bringing
together policies in Somalia, that argument is relevant to our policy
towards the European Union in a wider sense where critical,
constructive engagement can be in our interests and can make a real
difference to the policies of the European Union itself.</hs_para>

colleagues and the staff on what is an excellent report. It is a
tribute to the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and I
would like to pay him a general tribute as he is stepping down. He has
been an excellent chairman of this committee and we have produced a
number of very good reports in recent
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:14:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000044">I
turn to the report. Operation Atalanta has been a success, as has the
EU’s foreign policy—there is no question about that. This
is partly due to the efficiency of the operation under UK leadership,
which I hope people will focus on. We saw that leadership in operation
at the command and control centre at Northwood, which we visited as a
committee and very much admired. It is an amazing place and it was
quite spectacular to see it in
operation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:14:55"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course there has also been the co-operation with the other
international organisations: the US-led combined maritime force; the
NATO-led Operation Ocean Shield; and with other countries such as
Russia, China and India. All that has obviously been very helpful,
too<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:15:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

have the game-changer of putting armed guards on ships, which has been
backed by a regulatory system that is becoming increasingly effective.
As colleagues have noted, the committee changed its mind on this. The
facts changed and so we changed our minds—that is a sensible
thing for a committee to do. The truth is that having armed guards on
ships has proved a highly effective deterrent. So far, no ships
carrying armed guards have been successfully pirated. That in itself
speaks for that
idea<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:16:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the building-up of a judicial system to deal with culprits. There are
101 in prison in the Seychelles and 147 in Kenya. I hope we are going
to hear something from the Minister about this. I am not saying that he
is responsible for what the Somali 
<?notus-xml column=12?>President has done, but it is important. It ostensibly drives a coach
and four through the whole policy. If the Somali President comes along
and gives amnesty to 959 pirates, what are we to say about the rest of
them in prison elsewhere? This will clearly have to be looked at rather
more
carefully<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:17:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

point in the report is that the mandate of the operation should be
extended beyond December 2014. That is an important signal that the EU
and the international community are not going to walk away from their
obligations to clear the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden of piracy.
Interestingly, there was a meeting of the European Economic and Social
Committee on 24 January, attended by the shipping industry and
seafarers generally. They very much endorsed the position in our
report<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:17:56"></hs_TimeCode>. The
noble Lord, Lord Jay, made strongly the point about the importance of
attending to the political development in Somalia and of getting rid of
the conditions in which piracy can
flourish<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:18:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

strongly supports the Horn of Africa strategy: the combination of
diplomatic, financial and operational tools which provides some
opportunity for a sensible and coherent response to all the awful
crises facing the region. Alongside Atalanta, you now have
NESTOR—the EU’s training mission for Somali security
forces—as well as the appointment of the special representative
for the Horn of Africa, which we welcome in our

Lord Jay, I turn to the west African issue. The trouble with piracy,
particularly if it is successful, is that it is very infectious.
Although the background is different, Somali piracy is increasingly
mirrored in what is happening in west Africa. Armed hijacking is on the
rise in the Gulf of Guinea, the waters of Nigeria, Benin, Togo and
Ivory Coast. It is interesting that many of these incidents involve
vessels transporting petroleum products. The UN Office on Drugs and
Crime explains this by the booming black market for fuel in west
Africa. Clearly, this is a rather sinister situation growing up here
and it needs watching very carefully indeed. It is essential that there
should be a response not only by the region’s Governments but by
the international community so that west African seas do not become as
dangerous as the Indian Ocean has been,
but—fortunately—now is
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000050">I want to
ask the Minister several questions. What are the UK Government and the
EU doing to meet the threat? Can the Minister—I share the point
of the noble Lord, Lord Jay, here—confirm that the Royal Navy is
deploying units to west Africa and working in conjunction with France
and the United States? Is there a case for applying some of the lessons
that have been learnt in Somalia and the Indian Ocean in west African
waters? Can the strategy and models that have been used successfully in
this area be used also in west Africa? I know that it is a different
situation but we ought to learn some

a last point, we must not forget the cost of piracy. At the European

patrols, armed personnel on vulnerable ships and the military operation
on land-based criminals have all, as we have heard, contributed to
diminishing the threat of piracy in the region. However, none of these
activities represents a viable, or indeed a desirable, medium to
long-term strategy. Political, economic and social stabilisation is the

we reported, the EU has now formulated a strategy for the Horn of

counter the argument that the EU presence represents yet another
hostile foreign military force, as some see it, the EU needs to make a
commitment to protect and monitor fishing in Somali waters. There has
been a call for the mandates to be revised to protect Somali waters
from illegal fishermen and those who transport toxic and other
dangerous materials. When we received the evidence, we considered
recommending that Operation Atalanta should undertake greater
protection of Somali fishing grounds, but we concluded that a naval

pirate gangs have turned to land-based criminal activity such as
kidnapping aid workers, tourists and journalists in Somalia and Kenya

learn skills, undertake internships and gain paid work. EU development
aid should also be directed towards providing alternative livelihoods

Teverson, and the European Union Committee for the report that we are
considering today, which is a follow-up to the 2010 report on the
European Union’s naval operation Atalanta. The noble Lord, Lord
Teverson, gave us a comprehensive introduction on the present state of
play, the key issues involved and progress made since the previous
report. I do not, therefore, intend to refer to all the issues which he
so ably addressed and which are referred to in the

report indicates an improving situation as far as the levels of Somali
piracy are concerned, with a significant reduction in the number of
pirated vessels and hostages in June 2012 compared to June 2011, as
well as much greater practical co-operation between organisations and
nations. However, the report certainly does not suggest that the
problem has been solved. The committee welcomed the EU Atalanta attack
on the pirate land base and, in their response, the Government agreed
with that. The committee also reported that it had changed its view on
having armed guards on ships, in light of the fact that no ship
carrying armed guards has been successfully pirated and violence has
not apparently escalated.</hs_para>

the committee, though, that those involved in piracy were increasing
their activity on land, including kidnapping on shore, and that the
smaller number of successful attacks had led to an increase in the
level of ransom demands and greater violence. Indeed, the view appears
to be that piracy will never be eliminated except, hopefully, in the
longer term and that the realistic objective must be to make sure that
it is contained. As a key part of that objective of containment,
Operation Atalanta’s mandate was renewed in 2012 until the end
of 2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000081">I
should like to raise a few points of relative detail about the report
and the Government’s response. I note that, when the previous
report was discussed in this House in November 2010, the response was
given by the Foreign Office Minister. Today, the response to the
European Union Committee’s follow-up report is being given by
the Defence Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever. I am not
sure whether the change in department responding to the debate
represents any change in the Government’s priorities and
approach to the issue of Somali piracy, Somalia and the EU’s
Operation Atalanta, or whether it is simply an issue of the
availability—or flexibility—of government Ministers. It

committee expressed the view that any reduction in effort would quickly
result in a renewed upsurge of pirate activity and that the mandate of
Operation Atalanta should be extended beyond December 2014 to send a
clear signal that the EU would not walk away from confronting piracy in
the Indian Ocean. Rightly or wrongly, I rather took it from that that
the committee may not wholeheartedly share the view that a decision on
the renewal of the operation’s mandate should wait until the
middle of next year, as appears to be the intention. The
Government’s response to the report did not specifically address
the issue of whether and when the mandate should be renewed, so it
would be helpful if the Minister could say whether, on the basis of the
situation on piracy as it is at the moment, the Government would or
would not support renewal of Operation Atalanta’s
mandate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000085">When
the committee’s earlier report was discussed in 2010, there was
general agreement that the long-term elimination of piracy would be
secured only through addressing the underlying causes of instability
affecting Somalia. That clearly remains the view. The
committee’s report and the Government’s response set out
the developments that have occurred and the steps that have been taken
since the earlier report by the EU, the UN and the international
community to help to improve the prospects of stability in Somalia. As
the Government’s response says, fundamental to the EU’s
efforts is the principle of encouraging greater African ownership,
including by the African
Union.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000086">The
committee is to be congratulated on the thoroughness of its work,
including the follow-up report, which has highlighted the considerable
progress that has been made and the reasons for it. Let us hope that
that progress proves to be soundly based and that, despite some of the
information that we have been given in the debate today about the
release of those involved in piracy, it will ultimately lead not only
to the eventual end of piracy but to a safer, more secure and more
prosperous future for Somalia and its people in particular and for the

successfully contained, constrained and deterred acts of piracy. None
the less, the UK’s longer-term aim is to eradicate the
underlying causes of the instability that affects Somalia and gives
rise to acts of piracy, and several noble Lords have made that point
today. This can be achieved only by addressing the root causes of the
problems in Somalia. EUTM Somalia and EUCAP NESTOR, launched as part of
the EU’s contribution to an overall strategy for the Horn of
Africa, aim to provide a comprehensive solution to Somalia’s
problems. In time these missions, alongside AMISOM, will create a
secure and stable Somalia, remove the incentives for piracy and develop
the capacity of coastal states in the region to police their own
coastlines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:48:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000089">The
UK remains fully supportive of Operation Atalanta’s mandate and
is committed to the continued command of Operation Atalanta from
Northwood for the current mandate, which expires in December 2014.
International pressure on the pirates must be maintained in order to
prevent a significant resurgence of activity. While any formal decision
to extend Operation Atalanta’s mandate beyond 2014 is unlikely
to be taken in the immediate future, the EU has demonstrated a firm
commitment to its counter-piracy efforts, including through enhancing
the mandate with agreement on the use of autonomous vessel protection
detachments and the disruption of pirate logistics dumps. Additionally,
the launch of EUCAP NESTOR and a growing EU diplomatic role send
further strong signals of increasing EU engagement.</hs_para>

degree of maritime co-operation between the three core international
counter-piracy forces—the EU’s Operation Atalanta, the

NATO’s Operation Ocean Shield—is among the best that we
have ever seen. The three operations provide a variety of effective
framework opportunities for third-state contributions to anti-piracy
efforts to further enhance international co-operation, evidenced
recently when Royal Thai naval forces commanded a Combined Maritime
Forces task force from a UK vessel. The shared awareness and
deconfliction mechanism has also helped to ensure that military efforts
in the region are effectively co-ordinated between international
partners<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:50:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000091">The
threat from piracy remains a serious problem, but results and trends
suggest that Operation Atalanta, in conjunction with other measures to
counter piracy, is proving effective. For example, as of 7 March this
year, two vessels and 60 hostages were being held off the Somali coast,
the lowest levels held by pirates since September 2009. I hate to
correct my noble friend but two vessels and 48 hostages were released
over the weekend, so the figures that I have quoted are the accurate
ones. This compares favourably with May 2011, when 23 ships and 503
hostages were held. Attacks and pirating of vessels are down by over
75% during the past 12 months. However, I emphasise that these gains
remain reversible and it is vital that we do not relieve any of the
considerable pressure that is currently being brought to bear on the
Somali

the Seychelles. A new 60-cell block was opened there in September 2011

turn to the specific questions asked by noble Lords. The noble Lord,
Lord Jopling, asked what political progress had been made in Somalia.
Real political progress has been made there in recent months. The
transitional period concluded on 10 September with the election of a
new president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. This was a significant moment in
Somalia and an important step towards a renewed political process. The
London Conference on Somalia in February 2012 brought the international
community together to support this process and, for the first time in
years, it was run in consultation with the Somali people through their
elders. They led a process to draw up a new constitution and formed a
new parliament which elected a new president.</hs_para>

is clear that, after two decades of conflict and instability, the
people of Somalia want to usher in a new era of peace, security and
democracy. Recent political progress marks a new chapter in their
history. The end of the transition is the best opportunity in years to
make progress towards peace and stability. Already, people are

noble friend Lord Jopling and the noble Lord, Lord Radice, mentioned
the 959 pirates who were released. They asked what was the basis of the
amnesty and why did this not apply to the “godfathers”.
This amnesty referred to the boys who had committed acts of piracy at
sea but did not apply to the financial backers or the senior leaders of
the pirate action groups. My noble friend Lord Jopling asked for
the Government’s response to the committee’s
recommendation for an increased contribution from the Gulf states. We
are working closely with a number of the Gulf states, particularly the
UAE, Bahrain and 
<?notus-xml column=22?>Oman, and organisations such as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
The UAE has commanded the Combined Maritime Forces Combined Task
Force 151 and Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait and the UAE all provide

friend Lord Jopling also asked whether, as the number of attacks
reduces, there is a temptation to relax our presence there. Military
response must remain proportional to the threat until the root causes
of piracy have been addressed ashore. This is now occurring via EUCAP
NESTOR and other capacity-building initiatives. Meanwhile, Operation
Atalanta, NATO and the CTF 151 continue their deterrent
patrols which deliver the time and space to allow development activity

noble friend asked whether pirates would be returned to Somalia. The
committee did not consider this to be sensible given the level of
prison security. He asked would the UN prison remain unused. The UN has
refurbished a prison in Somaliland which is currently housing convicted
pirates returned from the Seychelles. Work is on the way to building
additional penal facilities. This is crucial to Somalia’s

ransom payments was wholly inadequate because these are criminal
payments. Companies assembling ransoms in the UK must seek consent from
the Serious Organised Crime Agency prior to payment. The Government do
not make or facilitate substantive concessions to hostage-takers,

can, predominantly in terms of training and capacity-building: HMS

other international and UK unilateral activity. All the
symptoms—terrorism, piracy and migration—are a result of
the causes of instability in Somalia. EUTM does not currently link

open this debate on the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny
Committee’s report. The committee was grateful to the many
organisations and individuals who responded to our call for evidence;
to the Minister for Government Policy, Oliver Letwin, who gave evidence
to us; and to the clerks—Kate Lawrence, who is now on a well

main issues in our recommendations reflected the concerns expressed in
the very large number of submissions that we received in response to
our call for evidence. The Government did not ask for evidence, so I
hope that the responses to our call for evidence will have been
helpful. We urge the Government to ensure that the review of the
consultation principles that were announced last July reflects the
concerns expressed in the evidence, in particular a widely expressed
preference for a 12-week standard duration of consultation. We ask the
Government to recognise that six weeks is regarded as the minimum
feasible consultation period, except in exceptional circumstances; to
ensure that consultation periods do not clash with holidays or peak
periods of activity for the target group of consultees; and to engage
with key interest groups prior to launching consultations, so as to
reach agreement with those groups on the broad
outlines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:13:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

review should be started in January—we are now in
March—and that its findings should be published by Easter. There
are no plans to add to the evidence, which is already to hand. We
recommended that the review should be carried out by a unit independent
of government and that a stakeholder reference group should be
convened, containing members from across civil society, to provide
input for the review
team<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:14:12"></hs_TimeCode>. We also
asked the Government to recognise that a “digital by
default” approach to consultation was very likely to exclude a
large proportion of our society, and in particular vulnerable groups.
We asked the Government to demonstrate that wider engagement with
vulnerable and so-called hard-to-reach groups was being delivered in
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000122">In

soon as possible a single website listing open consultations in the
order in which they close, for the benefit of the many organisations
that respond to invitations to give evidence to consultations. We
further recommended that the new principles should explicitly commit
departments to publicising timely responses to consultations and to
strengthening the role of the Cabinet Office in the co-ordination of
consultations.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:16:27"></hs_TimeCode> also

the responses to our call for evidence will be allayed by the findings

recent history is littered with examples of government action where
successful consultation could have averted enormous wastes of
parliamentary time, government time and money, the time and money of
other people, embarrassing government climbdowns, reversion to the
drawing board and so on. Most recently, my noble friend Lady Thomas of
Winchester, in the debate last week on the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee’s report on strengthening statutory
procedures for the scrutiny of delegated legislation, cited the lack of
consultation on a crucial part of the Social Security (Personal
Independence Payment)  
<?notus-xml column=27?>Regulations, which had to be changed by the DWP at the last minute and

successful example of consultation, on the other hand, was the
Department of Energy and Climate Change’s handling of the

views on a revision to the 2011 regulations, and the issue of
workability in relation to reporting and verification requirements was
thereby resolved in the most recent statutory instrument, thanks to
proper

effective consultation to the process of government appears before your

to listen to the views of interested parties sometimes gains support

usually means that the policy, which has been conceived within

foresee all the detailed impacts of policy proposals. Those at the
receiving end usually can, and may thereby contribute to the avoidance
of mistakes. In our experience, some departments struggle to
understand the use—the validity, even—of parliamentary
scrutiny as a disinterested process rather than an unwelcome but
necessary interference in the project management of an item of
secondary legislation, far less the intrinsic value and necessity of
consultation. As always, the extent of hoisting in this necessity
depends on who you are dealing with. Some departments get it better
than others; some learn it faster than
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000130">All
who have worked in government have been impressed from time to time by
feelings of profound frustration. Why can we not simply get on with the
job when it is so obvious what needs to be done in the public interest?
Why does the car not move forward when we press the accelerator? Why is
the system so furred up, obstructed by endless consultations, reviews,
inquiries, inquiries into inquiries, judicial review, human rights and
so on? Conversely, we all, when at the receiving end of government
activity that we do not like, sometimes feel that the world is being
run by people in Whitehall who have descended from Mars, speaking only
Martian, and have not the slightest knowledge of or interest in the
concerns of ordinary people upon whom their whims and diktats are
arbitrarily inflicted without a by-your-leave. To govern by consent in
a modern democracy requires for success a resolution of those two
conflicting states of mind. I hope that the committee’s report
and this debate will make a small contribution to enhancing that
success. I beg to

Hart of Chilton:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, am a member of your
Lordships’ Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee, whose 22nd
report for 2012-13 on the Government’s new approach to
consultation we are considering today. The report was published in
January this year and responded to by the Government in February, and
here we are debating the matter in early March. Unlike in the previous
debate, there can be no complaints about tardiness in that respect; on
the contrary, compliments, not brickbats, are due to the usual
channels. I am in complete agreement with the speech by our chairman,
the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad. I pay tribute to his distinguished
chairmanship of the committee, not just on this occasion but throughout
his
tenure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:23:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000132">Accordingly,
I simply wish to emphasise and repeat some of the key issues that have
arisen. First, I was very surprised that the Government, in bringing
forward what they called new principles of consultation, failed to
carry out any consultation themselves. In my view, the importance of
the proper process of consultation in initiating new or revised policy
cannot be underestimated. Much of my earlier career was spent reading
and responding to consultations so I suppose I have a special interest,
but proper consultation, in my view, is the essential oil for the
engine of government. It test-beds the underlying principles with those
most likely to be affected. It checks the support or opposition that
will be forthcoming. It affords the opportunity to discover mistakes in
assumptions, methodology or technical background. Last but by no means
least, it forms part of a healthy participatory democracy; its presence
strengthens confidence in government and its absence weakens democracy
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000133">It
follows that the process of consultation must afford sufficient time
for views to be obtained, analysed and, in certain cases, responded to.
Any perceived short cuts risk confidence being eroded or lost
altogether. So, in the absence of any prior consultation exercise, the
committee carried out its own by calling for evidence and, as the noble
Lord, Lord Goodlad, has said, we were gratified by the extensive and
constructive response. There was certainly no doubt about the
importance that witnesses placed on consultations, but there was some
scepticism about whether the Government shared that view. In
particular, there was criticism over the time allowed to participate.
There was a preference for 12 weeks for issues of importance or
complexity, with a minimum of six, and the period selected should not
fall over bank holidays, summer holidays or periods of peak activity
for the target groups.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031157000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000134">Prior consultation was
something that the Government should engage in with key stakeholders to
seek a consensus on the broad outlines of the matters to be consulted
upon. With a significant percentage of the public not connected to the
internet, the approach of “digital by default” left some
excluded and others constrained. There was a feeling that the
Government sometimes failed to realise the complexity of some of the
issues being consulted upon and the capacity of organisations to
respond with speed. There was often a lack of response to consultations
once they had 
<?notus-xml column=29?>taken place, leaving an impression that the consultation process was
just an exercise to be got through as quickly as possible.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031157000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000135">Our recommendations to
the Government recognised the strength of many of these issues, and
suggested ways in which the principles could be improved. Our
conclusion was that the new principles, in many respects, were failing
to provide the consistency and transparency that the public are
entitled to look for in consultation exercises. Accordingly, we urged
the Government to launch an independent external review of their new
approach to consultation without delay, meaning a start in January and
the publication of findings by Easter this year. Although the
Government have accepted the principle of a review, they are not
treating the matter with the urgency that we recommended and that it
deserves.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031157000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000136">For
my part, I have misgivings about whether the Government, even now, have
really appreciated the important part that consultations play in the
formulation of policy and in winning the confidence of the public,
which was one of the avowed intentions in forming the coalition and
embarking upon office. Speed is not the prerequisite hallmark of good
governance; full and proper consultation most certainly
is.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13031157000316" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000316">5.28

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, some people might wonder why the
Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee has given so much attention to
the issue of consultation. With the unremitting tide of secondary
legislation—except that tides go out as well as keep on coming
in—almost invariably the question is prompted, “What has
been the response to consultation on this?”. If the answer is
not apparent, then the question is asked, “What consultation has
there been?”. Our splendid advisers, for whom my admiration
grows weekly, have extraordinarily sensitive and alert antennae to
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000138" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000138">It is

had to take her name off the list this morning because of the weather.
I believe that she is waiting for updated weather reports to see how
long she can stay. The debate reminded us that it is often secondary
legislation that has the greatest impact on individuals. We hardly need
reminding of this since so much contentious legislation bites through
statutory instruments. We might think that as the amount of primary
legislation grows, the amount of secondary legislation would 
<?notus-xml column=30?>diminish, but that seems not to be the

agree with the proposition that was the starting point of the

tick-boxes have a place as aide-mémoires. We do not need to
abolish tick-boxes to avoid being ruled by them. Consultation is
important not just because, like everything government does, the
instruments need to be seen from the point of view of those
affected—for all the reasons explained by the noble Lord, Lord
Hart of Chilton—but because Whitehall does not always know quite

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, I was making the point before the
Division that the content of instruments and consultation are not
simply technical matters. Our committee received a great deal of
evidence on the subject when we put out a call. I shall quote a
comparatively small amount—although I am going to quote quite a

new Principles have retained all of the previous authority of the
Government while reducing the scope for individuals and groups to
prepare useful submissions. Yet, within the latest incarnation of the
No. 10 website, the message is positive and encouraging, and the linked
site Inside Government is clear and easy to follow … The
contrast between the Principles and the No. 10 site is glaring -
Governments must not create difficulties designed to deter the public.
In turn, the public has a responsibility to understand the policy and
explicit questions asked within a consultation … Individual
members of the public generally struggle to be heard as the collective
forces of lobbyists, media, and protest groups set about their
respective quests. It is understandable that single-interest groups are
forming as a response to perceived indifference, often spawning other
groups holding alternate opinions. The internet enables such groups to
form quickly and at low cost, perhaps inspiring the media … to
provide their online readers with facilities to comment directly on
articles, swiftly followed by site moderation: give the public a stick
and anonymity and they will use
both”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13031157000144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000144">The

Bichard:</Member></B> My Lords, I have experienced consultation from
several different perspectives during my long years. I have experienced
it as a local authority chief executive, as a senior civil servant, as
a quango chair, a chair of several major voluntary organisations, and
as a non-exec of a private sector organisation providing services for
the Government. These experiences have taught me some important
lessons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:51:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

a rule, and with some honourable exceptions, civil servants
instinctively do not much like consultation because it rather slows
down the process of implementing their favoured proposal and can throw
up some inconvenient but valid objections which even—heaven
forbid—Ministers might find convincing. For many of the same
reasons, some Ministers and quango chairs are sometimes inclined to
circumnavigate the consultation process while, in contrast, voluntary
organisations and private providers much value consultation because
they often feel that the frequent changes to government policy and
operating procedures could and would benefit from more, not less,
consultation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000151" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000151">From
these various experiences, I have been convinced that policy can be
greatly improved as a result of effective consultation. There are many
examples of that having happened. It has not yet been mentioned that
consultation is also much more likely to ensure that legislation and
policy changes are introduced with public support rather than in a
hostile
environment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000152" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000152">Consultation
matters, as the chairman of the committee of which I, too, am a member,
so eloquently said. This is a serious and important matter. It is not
arcane. It is not just a matter for the nerds, or something that can be
swept into the long grass. Not only does it matter, it needs to be
regulated to ensure that it is conscientiously and thoroughly
undertaken.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000153" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000153">Strangely,
before the Government introduced these new guidelines, there was, as
has already been said, advice in place. It had been agreed with the
voluntary sector and other interested stakeholders, and seemed to be
working rather well. Although it set a uniform 12-week period for
consultation, common sense accepted that sometimes a shorter period
would be needed, and that happened when necessary. But perhaps, without
having time to look at the statistics which demonstrated that this was
being operated sensibly, Ministers were convinced by their officials
that this was all taking up too much time, was excessively bureaucratic
and was delaying the implementation of vital government policy, and so
the new guidance was
issued.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000154" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000154">Oddly,
since it was about consultation, it was not felt necessary to consult
those affected. Nor was it felt necessary to prohibit commencing
consultations at the start of holiday periods when those affected might
not be available. Surely no one would do that deliberately. However, it
has happened rather a lot to be a coincidence. It was not even felt
necessary to require departments to publish a response to consultations
so that respondees could at least see that their views had been
considered rather than peremptorily ignored. Of course, if people 
<?notus-xml column=33?>cannot see that their views are taken note of they very quickly decide
that it is not worth being involved in a consultation at all.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:55:15"></hs_TimeCode> commitment, as
has been said, was made to digital consultation as the norm, with no
attempt to identify groups for whom this would cause serious problems.
No commitment was made at publication for an independent review of how
these new arrangements were
working.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000155" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000155">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:55:34"></hs_TimeCode>
has been said that when the Minister appeared before the Select
Committee, he appeared to concede significant ground on all these
points. Perhaps it would have been helpful to make clear that
consultation during holiday periods was not desirable; perhaps it would
have been useful to publish some analysis of responses; and maybe an
independent review would have been helpful. But the Minister’s
later, more considered response suggested that all these matters would
merely be looked at as part of the review; not now to be undertaken
independently and externally but by the Cabinet Office—which is
not perhaps entirely dispassionate on the matter—with advice, it
seems, from an advisory committee. At this point I am trying to recall
which episode of “Yes Minister” contained this storyline,
because I am absolutely certain that there was one. I have been away

that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:56:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000156" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000156">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:56:36"></hs_TimeCode>
final irony is that these changes have been made to inject a sense of
urgency into the policy process and to reduce bureaucracy. So far their
introduction has provoked widespread opposition and criticism. It has
caused the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Select Committee to discuss
the proposals on at least four occasions, with the Minister attending
one of those; it has led to the establishment of a review; and it has
led to the establishment of an advisory board and the likelihood of
many further debates when the review is
published<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:57:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000157">Perhaps
most important of all, it has suggested that the Government’s
commitment to the big society and listening to the voice of civil
society is more about rhetoric than a genuine desire to listen to the
views of interested parties—especially, I am sad to say, if
their views are inconvenient. I suggest that it would be better, even
now, to revert to the previous guidelines and, if not, to have a
properly independent review carried out with greater urgency than we
have seen so

agree with him and the other committee members on the importance of the
basic issue; efficient secondary legislation and engagement with the

introduced in 2008 were necessary to restore confidence because in some
respects the issue of consultation had become a music hall joke in
which the “departmental book of dirty tricks” would have
indicated such things as a 10-week consultation period starting on 25
July, or a six-week one starting on the first week in December. I have
come across both in years gone past. So glaring have some of these
examples been in the past that it was quite impossible to believe that
the timing was an innocent accident as opposed to being the fruits of
calculated design aimed at circumscribing the practicability of any

Having myself been a regular consultee, involved in consultation

do not say for one minute that brief consultation periods are wrong. I
can think of one last summer that concerned the matter of signatures
necessary for parish councils to make payments and the impediment that
the previous rules presented to electronic payments—I declare an
interest here as president of the National Association of Local
Councils—where the consultation on the solution involved a very
limited pool of interests. The participants had already sought
resolutions that their national body lobby the Government to revise the
regulations and make the necessary changes. It was important,
particularly in the context of local government finance, to do
something sooner rather than later, so arguably a short consultation in
the summer holiday period was reasonable in that situation. Even there,
though, a two-week consultation would, frankly, have been a complete
nonsense. There must be a minimum, as suggested by the

exactly what that means: in short, it is impossible, under a very
curtailed consultation period, to make a proper response. Eventually,
it falls

try to knock something out for themselves and hope that it actually
meets with the general view of the committee. It is not a satisfactory

I think we need a more elaborate and more sophisticated approach than
that crude subdivision but the idea of a simple impact assessment,
assessing the gravity of effects multiplied by the numerical instance,
seems to be along the lines of a risk assessment and that type of
approach that is now well understood in government and outside. There
are always going to be cases where the matter is urgent but I do not
think that we are ever going to be dealing with emergency measures by
way of consulting the world and his boy. However, where the consultees
are a small and identifiable group of, say, specialist manufacturers, I
can see that a very short and targeted consultation might well be fine
in that
situation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000165">Consultation
must be an intrinsically organic and human-scale exercise. It has to
operate at a reasonable speed for the typical consultee, having regard
to their characteristics. Those include their age, their ability to
absorb technical detail and their educational attainment, as well as
competition for their valuable

noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, referred to my comment in the consultation
about the “digital by default” approach. There are a
number of issues here. First, taken at face value, that is not the
answer. Significant numbers of people do not have digital access.
Secondly, many of those who have such access do not have more than
basic computer skills. Thirdly, not everyone is comfortable filling in
a form online, regardless of their ability with a computer. Fourthly,
it is very easy to limit the utility and type of response that one can
get from a consultation process by the manner and design of the
electronic consultation form, and in particular the space allowed for
certain types of answer. Some consultations specifically ask for
answers to particular questions that the consultor wants answered. The
answers are not necessarily the comments that the consultee wishes to
give<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:06:11"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:06:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000167">It
is very important that we get this right. It will be damaging if the

and range of issues that can be raised, by the matter not being set in
its proper context or by the issue being too complex because it has not
been unpacked sufficiently. All those things militate against good
consultation. I share the committee’s view that the

Scott of Foscote:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord,
Lord Goodlad, on securing this debate. Formally, it is a debate on the
report of the Select Committee of which he is the very efficient
chairman and of which I have the honour to be a member—as does
practically every other noble Lord in the Room. I agree with everything
that has been said about the report and the importance of consultation,
but I will say a few words of my
own<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:07:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000169">The
purpose of consultation must be to improve the quality of proposed
legislation, whether primary or secondary. It is much more important in
relation to secondary legislation than to primary. With primary
legislation, a Bill will have gone through the House of Commons and
will go through its stages in the House of Lords. It will become public
property. From time to time there will be comments in the newspapers.
Members of the House will receive letters from interested persons,
sometimes expressing support and sometimes expressing misgivings. They
will be fully informed in that way about the merits and demerits of the
proposed primary or secondary legislation before the matter comes to a
head<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:08:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000170">With
secondary legislation, what is the opportunity for members of the
public to make those sorts of observations—of support or
criticism, as the case may be? If an affirmative resolution of the
House is required, in due course the legislation will come before the
House. Either it will start in the Moses Room and go to the Chamber or
it will be dealt with entirely in the Chamber. However, the notice
might not be sufficient to alert interested members of the public to
what is afoot. With secondary legislation that requires a negative
resolution to prevent it coming into effect, there will be no notice to
the public at all. Every now and again, a regret Motion may be tabled.
In that way a debate of which the public may become aware will take
place, but that is a relative
rarity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:09:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondary legislation that is going to come into effect without any
express resolution, and which requires a negative resolution to prevent
it coming into effect, is much more common. How, without prior
consultation, are defects in secondary legislation of that negative
character going to become apparent and acted
upon<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:10:08"></hs_TimeCode>? Prior
consultation, in my respectful opinion, is essential in all cases where
the statutory instrument in question is going to come into effect
unless there is a successful regret Motion preventing it coming into
effect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:10:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000171" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000171">The
importance of that is obvious and does not need overstating. The
importance of the consultation is, first, that defects not necessarily
apparent to the Minister or civil servants who have drafted the
statutory instruments in question can be brought to their attention and
revisions can be made before it is too late for them to be made. The
pros and cons of the proposed secondary legislation can be brought to
the attention of those who will be affected by the legislation. They
may be affected because their interests will be involved by what is
proposed. They may be affected simply 
<?notus-xml column=37?>because they are very knowledgeable about the subject matter of the
proposed legislation. In either case, they are people whose comments
may be very valuable to the Government for the purpose of obtaining the
effective and sensible legislation that must be the aim of the
Executive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:11:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000172" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000172">The
importance of consultation cannot be overstated. However, effective
consultation requires that there be communication with the right
people. As I have said, they will be people with a particular knowledge
of the subject in question and whose interests are likely to be
affected by the proposals that will be embodied in the statutory
instrument that is under review. They are the people who the Government
should consult with before drafting and putting forward the proposed
secondary legislation. There is no reason why that cannot be done but,
if it is going to be done, it must be done effectively, and if it is
going to be done effectively then it must be done with sufficient time
for two things to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:12:40"></hs_TimeCode>. First,
there must be sufficient time for the persons who are being informed of
the proposals—the persons with whom the consultation is taking
place—to think about it and draft a response. Secondly, there
must be time for the Government to consider the responses and to act on
them as they may think
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000173" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000173">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:12:21"></hs_TimeCode>
proposition that there can be a consultation in two weeks is absurd.
That suggestion is no more than a request, perhaps, for a fig leaf of
consultation that can be held up for public relations purposes as being
a consultation when in fact, because of the absence of any time
adequate for a proper consultation, it will be nothing of the sort. It
will not deserve the description of a consultation. The proposition
that two weeks might be adequate is, in my respectful opinion,
laughable. It demeans a Government who put it forward as
sufficient<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:13:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000174" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000174">The
proposal that there be a flexible time limit is of course acceptable in
principle. Twelve weeks as the norm has been satisfactory, but maybe
there are cases where that could be abridged, or shortened to some
extent. A minimum of six weeks appears to me to be a sensible limit to
place on the abridgement possibilities.</hs_para>

requirements of genuineness in the consultation process, consultation
might be described as being plainly a good thing. However, it is not a
good thing if inadequate time is allowed for responses to be given or

purports to be a consultation becomes no more than a public relations
exercise in hypocrisy. That, plainly, cannot and should not be

I joined this House nearly three years ago, I spent 50 years in
politics in one form or another, 43 of them as a local councillor. In
my innocence, though, I was quite unaware of the degree to which the
scrutiny conducted, particularly at the other end of the Palace of
Westminster, was so inadequate. It is undoubtedly better in your
Lordships’ House. Having said that, though, it is clear that the
process of scrutiny is not as good as it should be, and that is partly
a function of the consultation process.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:16:37"></hs_TimeCode> first came
to my attention when we discussed the changes that were to be made to
the Public Bodies Bill. It was quite clear that decisions had in fact
been made and that the consultation, to the extent that it did occur,
was something of a
sham.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000179" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000179">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:39:31"></hs_TimeCode>
think that I coined the term “pre-legislative
implementation” for some of what happened under the aegis of
that Bill, and I am glad that the Constitution Committee is looking
into that. I recall particularly the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of
Holbeach—I do not blame him personally for this—giving
constant assurances that there would be consultation in connection with
the regional development agencies, and that each would be considered on
its merits. In the event, there was no consultation at all and they all
went. I do not blame the noble Lord for that; the decision was clearly
taken somewhat above his pay
grade<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:17:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Goodlad, referred in his speech to contributions from Mars. I can
reassure him about that; one item that has been subject to consultation
is the reform of the Outer Space Act. On page 26 of the
committee’s report it will be seen that 14 weeks were devoted to
possible consultation on that, in contrast to four weeks for the
statutory instruments concerning the delivery of structural
funds—a matter of more immediate concern, it might be thought,
to all save those particularly interested in astronomy and the like.
Equally, when looking at the Department of Health, one sees some
strange discrepancies. Page 32 of the report points out that making
nursery milk schemes more effective had an 18-week consultation whereas
consultation on the membership of Healthwatch England, a matter that
itself particularly concerned scrutiny, took only five weeks. Clearly,
something is amiss with all
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:18:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000181" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000181">I
respectfully differ somewhat from the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Scott, on the assumption that we should deal only with
secondary legislation. Experience of the Crime and Courts Bill in
particular underlined that consultation took place very late; indeed,
material was introduced into your Lordships’ House halfway
through the passage of the Bill on the basis of consultation
that had taken place after the Bill had been launched. In another
context, on transforming bailiffs, months elapsed between the end of
the consultation and a government response being provided, well into
the course of the Bill. So
while<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:19:28"></hs_TimeCode> in many

of us see is that there is an increasing reliance on secondary
legislation to fill in the details not included in primary legislation

Thomas of Winchester:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, applaud the
committee’s report and strongly endorse its recommendations. I
will just say a very quick word about why consultation is so important,
particularly for disabled people. I absolutely accept that there are
many sorts of disability, but let us take the disability of somebody
such as me, with mobility problems. No one except a disabled person, or
their carer or helper, can know what it is like to be disabled. That is
why consultation, for this group of people, is so important. People
have their eyes opened when they either go round with a disabled person
or when they put themselves in a wheelchair. I know a lot of MPs have
done just that to see what conditions are like in their constituencies.
I note that many of the responses that the committee has highlighted
are from charities with a lot of disabled people in them. I will not
speak about the PIP regulations again but they are an absolutely
classic example of why consultation is so
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:21:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000184" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000184">The
other thing I will highlight is that a single website for publicising
government consultations would be invaluable. At the moment they are
all over the place and it is quite a scandal that the Government are
expecting some organisations to respond in a very short timeframe.
After all, the people in these organisations are usually paid very
small amounts, because the organisations are funded by voluntary
donations, with no state support. To make these people look all over
the place for consultations from the Government is ridiculous. I
thoroughly endorse the robust language of the report and hope that the

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I first thank the noble Lord,
Lord Goodlad, and his committee for a welcome and extremely useful
report for your Lordships’ House. This is the second debate on a
Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee report in the past two weeks
to which I have responded on behalf of our Benches. If I am honest, my
first reaction on looking at the reports was, “This could be a
bit dry”. However, it actually goes much deeper than that. Not
only have I have enjoyed participating in, and learnt an enormous
amount from, these two debates, but they go right to the heart of our
democracy and our role in your Lordships’ House as people who
scrutinise legislation. It shows the House of Lords at its best: it is
looking at the process of government not in an academic or remote way
but in a very practical way and examining the impact of these proposals
on parliamentary scrutiny. It has also—I cannot overstate
this—given a voice to those who had serious concerns about the
changes 
<?notus-xml column=40?>that the Government have made to the principles of consultation but who
had not been given an opportunity to express their concerns or to be
consulted in any way, to try to influence that policy before it came
in. The House owes a debt of gratitude to the committee for providing
that opportunity for a proper consultation on this

have been quite eager to hear today’s debate and the
Minister’s response. The main reason is that, having read
through the Government’s statement from July, the reports and
the appendices, and the government response, I am still not totally
clear what problem the Government are seeking to address by changing
the rules and having this new statement of principles on consultations.
I hope that we will hear from the Minister today what the problem is
that the Government feel has to be addressed and what the evidence base
is for the change that has taken place. The Minister’s statement
in July is quite clear as to the Government’s stated objectives:
that consultation must be proportionate, in terms of time, scale and
type; that there should be real engagement rather than just a
bureaucratic process; and that thought should be given to with whom
Ministers should seek to engage so that there can be a targeted
consultation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000187" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000187">However,

its report, the committee acknowledged that that document was produced
for consultation and engagement with those parties who had an interest
in such matters. From looking at the way in which these new proposals
have been put forward and handled and, from reading the report, the
Minister’s first response has led to considerable suspicion that
the Government’s priority is to curtail consultation and
accessibility to it. The proposals for two areas of the process were
announced in a Written Ministerial Statement issued on the last day
before the Summer Recess. The Statement made clear that these were now
to be the principles, though the Government would have a post facto
look at them if they received any representations. That sounds very
mealy-mouthed. Of course there would be representations. The Secondary

already contained such scope for flexibility. In the wider context, 
<?notus-xml column=41?>when the Prime Minister spoke to the CBI in November 2012, suspicions

how does the attitude of the Prime Minister square up to other stated
aims of this Government, to foster a new politics of citizen engagement

would welcome comments and assurances from the Minister here today,
because the Government will have to show by practice and example that
suspicions that they want to curtail consultations are unfounded.

is much in the statement the Government made in July with which we can
all agree. The first purpose of consultation should always be to use
the knowledge, skills and information from consultees to improve policy
formulation or implementation. I appreciate that no amount of
consultation is going to change a key manifesto commitment or policy
aim of the Government. But there are few consultations that fulfil
those criteria. Many seek the views of those with expertise; the
committee used the expression “expert critique”, which
seems very
apt.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000193" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000193">One
concern regarding the new principles is the removal of the requirement
to provide feedback to participants. Both the Centre for Public
Scrutiny and the Association for the Conservation of Energy expressed
concerns, and the committee raised this with the Minister. In his
response when he met with the committee, the Minister accepted that the
feedback would be “very reasonable”, but he failed to
make a specific commitment. The committee is right to highlight this as
a recommendation. There should always be a timely response with
feedback, otherwise the whole process of consultation becomes
flawed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000194" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000194">As a
slight aside, there is a serious point about the credibility of
consultations. There is a great danger that consultation, in itself, is
losing credibility with the public. A large proportion of the public
now feel that many consultations, not just those of central government
but of local government and other organisations, are a sham. The reason
is that, too often, nothing significant 
<?notus-xml column=42?>changes as a result of consultation. We will all know of examples where
a majority oppose an issue being consulted on, and yet it goes ahead.
In my local area there is a consultation as to whether blood tests
conducted at two local hospitals should be bussed up to Bedford for the
testing to take place. I have not found anybody in favour of it yet,
but it seems to be going ahead, which is quite
wrong.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000195" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000195">A

worry about that because consultation is extremely important, as the
committee highlighted in its report, in helping the Government produce
good legislation. Any Government should welcome that. If the whole

are less likely to see changes in key policies from consultation than
we would from consultations on implementation. There is often a
reluctance to make significant changes, especially when preparatory
work has already been undertaken during the consultation period. It is
clear that pre-legislative scrutiny has been useful in ironing out
potential difficulties and problems, but when such scrutiny or
consultation is inadequate we see the kind of problems that we saw even
last week: the Government had to revoke a key order which formed part
of the Health and Social Care Act. Adequate scrutiny could have avoided
that taking place.</hs_para>

consultation, has to be genuine and not a process or exercise. If a
Government have no intention of listening or making any changes, than
it is frankly irrelevant whether it is two or 12 weeks; it is wasting

Ireland. There had been a consultation exercise for the standard

a single thing having changed in response to that consultation. When I
asked about it, there were clearly two or three significant points.
However, as the noble Lord, Lord Bichard, said, when work has been
undertaken and a report has been prepared, there is a reluctance to
change. I am pleased to say that, on that occasion, we did respond to
the consultation and

will emphasise four points and ask for the Minister’s comments.
First, what is the problem that the Government are seeking to resolve?
In its report, the committee is very clear about the amount of
consultation that takes place. The Prime Minister’s comment that
everything had to be consulted on for three months was not the case.
The committee looked at statutory instruments between November 2010 and
November 2012 and found that there was a 12-week consultation in only
around 25% of cases. Clearly it was not the case that everything was
consulted on for three
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:39:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000200" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000200">Further
evidence was provided to the committee by Oliver Letwin, showing that
it was not the case that everything was consulted on for three months,
even though there was quite a lot of change. That led to the committee
to observe
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13031157000297" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000297">“it
would be helpful to the wider public debate if the Government were to

consultations”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13031157000259" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000259">The
Government do not give their case any credibility by failing to
acknowledge that. I would welcome the Minister’s comments on
what the problem was and why this had to be brought forward, given the
comments made by the committee on that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:36:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13031157000201" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000201">The
second point is about “digital by default”. We all know
that it is cheaper and easier for the Government to consult via the
internet. However, as we have heard, not everyone has internet use. The
committee’s report identifies that 23% of people do not have any
access to the internet. Last year I received several very neatly
written letters from a young man who was highly intelligent but had a
form of autism. He was a savant. His letters were very detailed and had
drawings attached. He had wanted to be part of a government
consultation, but his contribution had been sent back because he had
not put it on the appropriate form and had not replied via the
internet. It is inappropriate when somebody who wants to respond is
prevented from doing so in such a
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:37:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000202" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000202">The
committee made a number of helpful recommendations. Unfortunately, they
were not addressed in the Government’s response. It would be
helpful if the Minister would say exactly what is meant by
“digital by default”. There is a lack of clarity,
particularly when there has not been a response to the points made by
the
committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:37:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000203" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000203">The
committee also made very helpful suggestions on engagement. It is clear
from those who responded to the committee’s consultation that a
lot of people want to respond, to engage and to be helpful and useful
to the Government. Many made very valid points about why the
consultation should be 12 weeks. I draw the Minister’s attention
to the submission from the Institution for Occupational Safety and
Health, which makes the point that as a key stakeholder it can provide
invaluable information and suggestions that consulting bodies may
otherwise fail to consider. Its members come for practical health and
safety input and for help in determining what is workable, effective 
<?notus-xml column=44?>and enforceable. The institution states that it needs 12
weeks to get that kind of information together in order to be helpful

agree with the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, that there

agree with the committee on both review and oversight. I thought that
the Minister’s response was trying to be helpful in terms of the

points that Oliver Letwin made about the reasons were
unreasonable, but they seemed to be taken account of in the
committee’s recommendation. If the Minister could explain why

not by defending the current Government, because I am aware that these
are structural problems of government and of the way in which the
Executive deal with the legislature and vice versa. I am conscious, as
I think back, that I first used to worry about Henry VIII clauses when
I was in opposition many years ago. In reading back to the 2007-08
consultations, I come across phrases like “consultation
fatigue” and “the struggles of the Better Regulation
Executive”. Indeed, I have a dim memory that my wife was on the
Better Regulation Advisory Council at the time, and would come home
very frustrated with some of the problems that it was facing about all
the different contradictions in attempting to improve regulation and
consult with the widest number of parties but nevertheless to reach an
end to it.</hs_para>

Hart, rightly said that speed is not the universal hallmark of good
government, but of course delay over extended periods is not the
universal hallmark of good government either. If one looks back at some
of the other areas in which successive Governments consulted
most—airports policy in south-east England, for
example—one could not say that one ever cut short consultation
on that process. Over the past 30 years, the occasional decision by a
Government, whichever Government it was, to override one or two of
those consulted parties might have been a good idea. Consultation does
not necessarily lead to consensus. I have been involved in
consultations over House of Lords reform over the past 20 years, and we
have not quite reached consensus on it yet through each successive
process of
consultation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000213" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000213">One
of the starting points for the current Government on consultation is to
say to departments, “The earlier that consultation is engaged
in, the better”. A process in which you more or less decide what
it is you want to do and then, when you have decided, you carry out a
12-week consultation process in which you ask everyone what they think
about what you have decided is actually a very bad thing. It would be
much better and more constructive—this is part of what the
Cabinet Office has been saying to departments—to engage with
your stakeholders as early as possible, before things have hardened
into a consensus within Whitehall, so that you learn where the
obstacles are likely to be and you can actually have a worthwhile
exchange of views. That of course means that the Government are likely
to consult first with the visible stakeholders and that there is always
the problem of those who might be excluded or those who want to be
involved. A later-stage consultation in which you allow others who you
might not have thought of in the first instance to come in nevertheless
is there to be added at the later point.

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I was saying when we broke

long-running problems in how government

will try to answer the four questions that the noble Baroness, Lady
Smith of Basildon, has raised as a focus for dealing with this
extremely broad subject. After all, when one talks about consultation,
one is covering a very wide range of subjects. What you need to do when
consulting about, for example, the patterns of dog ownership and how to
address identification of dogs—on which, on a digital
consultation, some 27,000 individual replies came in very
rapidly—is very different from when you are discussing an issue
on land planning, the school curriculum or even perhaps on caravan
sites. We have to have different sorts of consultation patterns to some
extent for different sorts of
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000219" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000219">The
problem that the Government are seeking to resolve is how to make
consultation more effective as government becomes more
digital—the digital revolution provides a great many
opportunities for us—and as the Civil Service gets leaner and
therefore, unavoidably, slightly meaner. We note that a number of
people have remarked that government has not been good at responding to
consultations. Certainly that is part of what the review will need to
take into account: how do we ensure that if you are
consulting—and the formal consultation processes, which often
come very late in a policy-making process, are the ones which really
matter here—government is able to take the consultations into
account and to provide a timely
response?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000220" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000220">On
the “digital by default” issue, the Government are moving
to a single gov.uk website. One of the things I am most excited about
within government is 
<?notus-xml column=47?>the whole government digital proposal; how far we are beginning to
transform the way in which government relates to the citizen as we go
through the next digital
revolution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031157000221" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000221">When
I first began to be involved in this, I did not believe the DWP
statistics about how many benefit claimants were interacting with
government digitally. It is of the order of 25% and is expected to go
up to about 70% within the next six to seven years. I found this very
difficult to believe, but I now understand that we are all beginning to
move along the digital corridor much more rapidly than we expected.
People who do not see themselves as computer-enabled nevertheless have
complex mobile phones through which they are beginning to interact with
government. Part of what we hope we are able to do as we make
government more open, and make access for the individual and for
particular groups more available, is to make the process of
consultation easier. There will be a single website, which will list
all available consultations. This comes out of the whole governmental
“digital by default” proposals.</hs_para>

meant by “engagement” takes us into a broad set of
issues, in which my noble friend Lord Goodlad raised the question of
what we meant by “government by consent” in a modern
democracy. I am conscious that part of the problem of how consultations
are organised is that consultation now means dealing with a wide range
of lobbies and interested groups, which perform the function
that 30 to 40 years ago was often performed by political
parties, which sorted out the range of political priorities and began
to crunch through how you reconciled different priorities. Now that
political parties are very much weaker and smaller, we have masses of
single-issue groups, volunteer organisations, advocacy bodies, lobbies,
interests and protest groups. Travelling back on the train from my
party’s spring conference yesterday, I found myself sitting
opposite a leading member of a major advocacy group who said that his
biggest problem was “all the lobbies”, by which he meant
the interested groups with which he competes and for which he wants to
see, as do others, a statutory register of lobbyists, which will
control their interactions with the Government. We all understand now
that the battle over consultation and access to government, which will
come up in a further discussion when the Government produce proposals
for a statutory register of lobbyists, would take us yet again into
this question of transparency, access, government response and so
forth.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031157000223" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130311-gc0001.htm#13031157000223">The
noble Lord, Lord Scott, talked about the need for the Government to
communicate with the “right people”, but consultation
probably also has to be communication with the wrong people as well as
the right people. At least, one has to be prepared to listen to the
wrong people from time to time, although of course we recognise that
communication and consultation early in the process has to start with
the most logical stakeholders. However, we do not have to communicate
only with them. We have to be careful not to communicate simply with
the loudest people, or the best organised or funded.</hs_para>

groups, when we are dealing with major aspects of aviation policy there

particular effort. The Government are well aware of that. It will also
come into the review.</hs_para>

Lady Smith, remarked critically on the Prime Minister’s comments
that, if there is no need for a consultation, we should not have one.
Oliver Letwin, in his evidence to your Lordships’ committee,

minor and technical changes, such as a change in the name of an
authority, do not need lengthy, expensive consultation. However, there
are other areas with widespread

noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, talked about small organisations
struggling to respond quickly, especially NGOs and local authorities. I
emphasise that the consultation principles explicitly protect the
compact with the voluntary sector, and we are well aware that the
voluntary sector is one of those that are most actively concerned to be
included in the consultation process. I reassure the noble Lord, Lord
Goodlad, that the evidence presented to the committee will be taken

of expedients as ways of minimising the reality of consultation while
going through the motions. Again, I suspect that that is a universal

early enough stage in the process. A formal consultation after you have
taken the principal decision is itself sometimes bound to lead to
disappointment for those who come in. We are trying to move towards a
more flexible and faster system of consultation where appropriate. I

consumers and business, on any illicit trade and any broader social

This landmark 
<?notus-xml column=44?>conference, scheduled to last six months, is set to prepare the ground
for a new draft Yemeni constitution which will then be put to the
Yemeni electorate in a referendum. The National Dialogue is a
Yemeni-led process supported by the UN Department for Political Affairs
(UNDPA) with technical assistance and bringing in a wide range of
international expertise. It will be supported through a UN led
multi-donor trust fund. We encourage the EU and non-governmental
