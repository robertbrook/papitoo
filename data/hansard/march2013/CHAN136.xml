need to introduce an independent commissioner and we have, we believe,
a very effective inter-departmental ministerial group, chaired by my
hon. Friend the Minister for Immigration. Crucially, that group
includes not just representatives from Departments across Whitehall,
but also from the devolved Administrations, and we believe that that is
working well. It is necessary, however, to consider continually our

simply about supporting local communities. We believe in the use of

service. During that time his contributions have varied from
investigating counter-espionage, developing and implementing key
policies on security, and, most recently, countering the threat of
international terrorism. He has experienced the service evolving over
the years and as director 
<?notus-xml column=1285?>general has led the service through particularly challenging times of
change and unrest, including the aftermath of the 7/7 bombings. His
tireless work helped to ensure the delivery of a safe and successful
Olympic and Paralympic games last year. I commend and thank him for his
invaluable contribution to public safety and national
security.</hs_Para>

about 1,000 more such appeals, which extends the time it takes to

Secretary of State for Health (Mr Jeremy Hunt):</Member></B> The
current system of policing and enforcing the entitlement of foreign
nationals to free NHS care is chaotic and often out of control. At a
time when we are having to face the challenges of an ageing society, it
places a significant and unjustified burden on our GP surgeries and
hospitals and may well impact on the standard of care received by
British
citizens.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032510000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0001.htm#13032510000193">As
the Prime Minister said earlier today, the Government are determined to
ensure that anyone not entitled to receive free NHS services should be
properly identified and charged for the use of those services.
Currently, we identify less than half of those who should be paying and
collect payment from less than half those we
identify.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032510000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0001.htm#13032510000194">We
also have some of the most generous rules in the world on access to
free health care. Our rules allow free access to primary care for any
visitor to the UK, including tourists, and free access to all NHS care
for foreign students and temporary visitors. But ours is a national,
not an international, health service, so last year, under my
predecessor, we began a wholesale review of the rules and procedures on
charging visitors for NHS care, with a view to making the regime
simpler, fairer and easier to implement. In particular, we focused on
who should be charged and how the rules can be applied and enforced
more effectively. We have examined the qualifying residency criteria
for free treatment; the full range of other current criteria that
exempt particular services or visitors from charges for their
treatment; whether visitors should be charged for GP services and other
NHS services outside hospitals; establishing a more effective and
efficient process across the NHS to screen for eligibility and to make
and recover charges; and whether to introduce a requirement for health
insurance tied to
visas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032510000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0001.htm#13032510000195">The
initial phase of the review has concluded and we will shortly start a
consultation on a range of options, including plans to extend charging
to some visitors and temporary residents who were previously
exempt so that the default qualification for free NHS care would be
permanent, not temporary, residence; ending free access to primary care
for all visitors and tourists; introducing a prepayment or insurance
requirement for temporary visitors to pay for NHS health care; and
improving how the NHS can identify, charge and recover charges where
they should apply. We will retain exemptions for emergency treatment
and public health issues.</hs_Para>

closely with medical professionals, NHS staff and partner NHS
organisations during the consultation and then seek to introduce agreed
changes as quickly as possible. We will need to take a staged approach,
because some changes are likely to require primary legislation before
they can be introduced, which will take longer to put in place.
However, some changes can be made immediately, and we should proceed
with those as quickly as possible.</hs_Para>

Hunt:</Member></B> The directive to which the right hon. Gentleman
refers was issued by an independent NHS body, not my Department. The
sorry truth is that it is consistent with the current rules on access
to primary health care, which is what we believe is wrong. I think that
one of the big problems in the current system is that we have free
access to primary care for anyone visiting the UK, however short their
visit is. Through that access to primary care, they get an NHS number,
which should not entitle them to free care but is often treated by
hospitals as such. That is what we have to put right. He is absolutely
right that we need a system that properly identifies whether people
should have care that is free at the point of access without
impinging on the ease of access for British citizens, which is one of
the things they treasure most about the

Hunt:</Member></B> What my right hon. Friend says bears very careful
consideration. He is absolutely right that primary care is a critical
access point, and we need to look at that. We also need to look at the
burdens we place on GPs. I think that ultimately the easy way we will
do that is through proper digital patient records, which will allow NHS
professionals to find out about the medical history of people accessing
the NHS at any point, including whether they are likely to be eligible
for free
treatment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032510000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0001.htm#13032510000201">With
regard to hospitals, my right hon. Friend makes a very interesting
point about an overseas visitors manager. One of the problems we have
is that the incentives in the system positively disincentivise
hospitals from declaring foreign users of the NHS. If they declare
someone not to be entitled to free NHS care, they have to collect the
money from that person themselves, whereas if they do not declare the
person not to be entitled to free NHS care, they get paid automatically
by their primary care trust or clinical commissioning group. The
incentives in the system have acted to suggest that this is a much
smaller problem than I believe it
is.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032510000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0001.htm#13032510000202"><Member ContinuationText="Andy Burnham" PimsId="2376" UID="13032510000537" xid="81" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0001.htm#13032510000537"><B>Andy
Burnham</B> (Leigh) (Lab):</Member> The NHS must not be open to abuse.
Where people do not have entitlement to free treatment, steps should

hospitals have rightly had a legal duty to recover any charges owed
from overseas patients. The previous Government proposed a number of
further steps, including amending immigration rules so that anyone with
substantial medical debts is not allowed back into the country. We
welcome efforts to build on that, while always guarding against
overblown rhetoric, which does not help the immigration debate. We
therefore need more precision and clarity from the Secretary of State.
First, on the scale of the problem, as ever with this
Government’s announcements, there is already confusion to clear
up. Earlier today, the Prime Minister’s spokesperson put the
cost to the NHS of health tourism at £10 million to £20
million. On “World at One” this lunchtime, the Secretary
of State said that he thinks it is more like £200 million. So
which is it? Will the Secretary of State publish the evidence he has to
support his
claim?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032510000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0001.htm#13032510000204">Secondly,
we need more detail on what the Government are proposing. Has the
Secretary of State consulted with those in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland on any proposed changes? There are practical questions on which
health professionals will need reassurance. We have heard in the news
today about the problems in the UK Border Agency. What assurances can
the Secretary of State give to health professionals that they will not
be used to plug the gaps that have been created by the
Government’s severe cuts to the front line of the UK Border
Force? Will they be given a simple way of checking eligibility and not
be burdened by extra bureaucracy? Will these changes apply equally to
planned and emergency care? If so, that could put health professionals
in a difficult ethical position. Does the Secretary of State agree that
care should always be provided in life-threatening situations, and will
he take this opportunity to reassure health professionals on that
important
point?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032510000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0001.htm#13032510000205">Finally,
the Secretary of State told “World at One” that one of
the main reasons he was doing this was to relieve pressure on accident
and emergency departments, particularly in London. While we commend
moves to prevent abuse of the system, could he not better achieve his
aim if he was not planning to close so many A and Es in
London?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032510000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0001.htm#13032510000206">The
Government have made a lot of assertions, but there is a real lack of
policy clarity and evidence. Unless the Secretary of State can provide
convincing answers to my questions, the House will be left with the

years and did absolutely nothing about it. What was missing from the

Labour’s total failure to control our borders during a period in
office that saw a quadrupling of net migration. We do not know how many
people are residing in this country illegally, but in January the
London School of Economics published a report stating that it could be
nearly 900,000 people, in which case the cost will not be a few
millions but many, many times that. In 13 years, Labour did not change

we await the coroner’s report, but the police have said that
there are no suspicious circumstances. Miss Meadows apparently
complained to the press about their harassment—about them being
camped outside her house, their attempts to pay parents to obtain
photographs of her, and, failing that, downloading photographs from her
family’s Facebook pages. To be on the receiving end of such
behaviour must have been tortuous for her. An online petition against
the actions of the <I>Daily Mail</I> has now received in excess of
110,000 signatures in just two days. The Press Complaints Commission
failed her and is widely considered to be discredited. Therefore, can
you, Mr Speaker, advise MPs on how complaints can and should be taken

if there are no sons, it will go to another male descendant. Now is a
good time to consider this issue, as the Succession to the Crown Bill
makes its way through Parliament. Like the majority of hon. Members, I

why male-preference inheritance would continue to apply in hereditary

Government that the Bill should focus on the monarchy, but we now have
an opportunity to get rid of the current discrimination. The recent
changes in the monarchy leave the aristocracy two steps behind,
because, as it stands today, a woman such as Her Majesty the Queen can
inherit the throne in the absence of
men.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032510000282" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0001.htm#13032510000282">The

aristocracy; this is symbolic. It is about the principles of fairness

situation is complex. Older baronies were created by means of a writ of
summons to Parliament. These baronies became heritable over time and
tend to descend through the bloodline, with preference for males, but
not excluding females. Later peerages were mostly created by patent.
These peerages typically descend to the male heir; however, special
remainders have sometimes been granted for war leaders such as Nelson,
Kitchener and Mountbatten that give the peerages an extra chance of
survival. In Scotland, peerages vary according to their limitation,
which could be to a male heir, an heir of either sex or a series of
named individuals.</hs_Para>

“Debrett’s Peerage and Baronetage 2011”, there are
just 13 hereditary peeresses in their own right: six in England and six
in Scotland, while one—Countess Mountbatten—is a peeress
of the United Kingdom. In the majority of cases these days, a peerage
is a dignity only and is not necessarily bound up with real estate.
However, in some cases there is a direct link, known as an
“entail”. I will not dwell at length on any individual
story that brings to life this unfairness, as these are personal,
family situations. However, there are many examples that we can
consider, such as Baron Braybrooke, whose title will go to his fourth
cousin once removed, rather than one of his eight daughters, whom I am
sure are more than competent to succeed. The Duke of Rutland’s
three daughters will not inherit their family seat, Belvoir castle. Of
the 92 hereditary peers taking their seats in the House of Lords, there
are only two women: Lady Saltoun and the Countess of Mar. This is clear
evidence that there is something not right about the current
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032510000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0001.htm#13032510000287">I
am calling for a consultation on the issue today because I believe that
in society we should have equality when it comes to gender. Women have
proved time and again that they are more than capable of any task in
business, politics, the community or public life. The role of women has
changed dramatically in the course of history. In this day and age, it
is therefore quite wrong that women are so unlikely to inherit
peerages. I agreed wholeheartedly with the noble Lord Fellowes of West

rather laughable now, in a world where girls are significantly
outperforming boys in education and where the skills of financial
management and accountancy are far more important than those of
physical warfare. We have come a long way in terms of women’s
rights in many areas—the right to vote, to become a Member of

Different approaches could be considered, including asking the monarch

allowed families to change the rules voluntarily; or passing an Act of
Parliament to create a new statutory framework. The UK would not be

front-line services and keeping council tax down. Of course more
savings need to be made to pay off Labour’s debt, but we are on

housing market is critical to Britain’s economic success, yet
one of the most tragic effects of Labour’s toxic legacy was its
impact on that market. Whereas Margaret Thatcher gave a generation the
hope of owning their own homes, Labour crushed their dreams, leaving us
with a planning system bogged down by arcane rules and regulations,
house building falling to its lowest peacetime rate since the 1920s,
rising prices, falling mortgages, and tenants with no hope of buying. A
lost generation of people were forced to stay where they were, living
their best years in the hope that their lottery numbers might come up
or the bank of mum and dad would bail them out. This is truly a toxic

me deal first with our reforms of the planning system. Labour’s
top-down, centralist approach built nothing but resentment. Its
regional strategies added a layer of red tape that paralysed planning.
By the time of the general election, six years after Labour’s
Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, only one in six councils had
adopted a core strategy and only one in four had a five-year land
supply.</hs_Para>

Labour’s approach lead to better co-ordination. The regional
spatial strategies of the unelected regional assemblies contradicted
the regional economic strategies of the unelected regional development
agencies. Fortunately, the Localism Act 2011 is now scrapping
Labour’s regional planning. The national planning policy
framework has streamlined 1,000 pages of confusing Whitehall guidance
and placed local plans in pole position—safeguarding the green
belt, introducing a new protection for valuable green spaces, amending
bureaucratic change-of-use rules to make it easier to get redundant and
empty buildings back into productive use, and kick-starting brownfield
regeneration.</hs_Para>

not want to talk about housing starts, because the figures are bad, so
instead they want to focus on completions. Let us have a look at them.
The facts are pretty stark. The number of completions in 
<?notus-xml column=1315?>England in each of the first two years of the coalition Government was
lower than in any one of the 13 years of the Labour Government. In
other words, we completed more homes in every one of those years than
the Government have managed in either year since they were elected.
Indeed, the Secretary of State has the dubious distinction of presiding
over the lowest level of completions by any peacetime Government since
the mid-1920s. That is some achievement. No wonder the construction
industry has been so hard hit. Eighty thousand construction workers are
out of work, and output has fallen by 8.2%, contributing a
great deal to the absence of growth in the British economy. The rate of
home ownership has fallen, and there are 136,000 fewer home owners than
when the Government came to power. That is hitting the youngest
hardest, because the average age of a first-time buyer is now
37.</hs_Para>

will have to make proper assessments of their housing need. On the
Prime Minister’s announcement today on council and social
housing and migration, the Secretary of State knows that people cannot
just get off a plane and get a council house. He will be familiar, of
course, with section 160A of the Housing Act 1996, and he will know
that councils already have the power to put in place allocation
schemes, because the previous Labour Government issued guidance in 2009
and an increasing number of them are doing so. It would be helpful if
we could get clarity about precisely what is being proposed, given that
the housing lead of the Local Government Association, Councillor Mike
Jones, who is a Conservative, has queried the need for the guidance,

looking to councils to identify housing need, but I say to them that
the Growth and Infrastructure Bill will not assist councils in doing
so, because clause 1 threatens to take away the power of local
communities to decide whether housing is provided. The planning
Minister, who is being very vocal, said that “vanishingly
few” councils would be caught by that provision. However, to
judge by the latest figures, as many as 21 local authorities could be
stripped of their democratic accountability in taking decisions on
housing planning applications if developers choose to go straight to

the effect that the decisions taken by the Chancellor, the Secretary of

for Work and Pensions will have on people on low incomes and their
homes. So far in this debate, we have talked about the need to build

consequence of what the Government are doing is likely to be rising
rent arrears. That is exactly what councils and housing associations up
and down the country are anticipating. Last week, the evidence from the
universal credit pilot showed rising rent arrears. That is creating a
lot of uncertainty, not least for housing associations. A number of
them have had credit rating downgrades recently. If lenders think that
housing associations will have difficulty collecting rent, it could put
up their borrowing costs, which could impact on their balance sheets
and their ability to borrow. Ultimately, it will affect their ability
to build the homes that the Secretary of State says he wants to see.
All of that will create huge challenges for families, councils and
housing associations, not least because of the debt that people will

thing to do is to cut the top rate of tax, the Secretary of State for

the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has brought in the bedroom
tax. What is so astonishing is that they are both singling out one

2.7% in 2016 and 2.8% in 2017. The forecast turns on one central OBR
assumption that might be wrong. The OBR assumes that there is quite a
large negative output gap—that, in simple terms, there is a lot
of slack in the economy. Forecasting or estimating the output gap is
very difficult. If its assumption is wrong, and if the output gap is
smaller than it says, a huge amount of the £120 billion a year
last year and the coming year is structural rather than cyclical. If

Budget day, the Chancellor said two important things about monetary
policy. First, he explicitly said that the Financial Policy Committee
must co-ordinate better in future, under Mark Carney, with the Monetary
Policy Committee. At the moment, the regulators are pulling in
different directions. The MPC has pumped in £375 billion by
printing electronic money in exchange for purchasing gilts from the
commercial banks, but that credit is not flowing into the real economy.
On the other hand, the Financial Services Authority, and its successor
body the FPC, are telling the banks not to lend any of that money and
to rebuild their capital position to de-leverage. Those two impulses
fight against each other and it is entirely sensible for the Chancellor
to say that the FPC and the MPC must co-ordinate better.</hs_Para>

Chancellor talked about forward policy guidance via thresholds to
commit to looser monetary policy for a set period. That has had a good
effect in Canada and the United States, and it will give British
business the confidence that interest rates will not be jacked up just

off.</hs_Para>

the Office for Budget Responsibility points out, the recession is

Frankly, on the evidence presented by the Chancellor last week, I see
little evidence that it is going to happen. As a result, we are

Chancellor’s Budgets and autumn statements. The problem is that
these sunny uplands are moving to the right each time he stands up. I
cannot for the life of me see why anything will be any different in
2017 from the bleak outlook we see today. The problem is that as long
as we have low growth we will have high levels of borrowing, and debt
is now expected to peak at 85% of our GDP. When we advocate a different
approach, the Conservatives and the Liberals say that we are talking
about borrowing more, but this Government are borrowing more than they

Government’s Budget response on infrastructure is fine, but it
does not come along for two or three years. On housing, I agreed with
everything that my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds Central

last week’s announcement is more likely to create yet another
housing bubble by driving up asset prices. Indeed, some of it might
even sow the seeds that gave rise to the sub-prime mortgage problem we

State for Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for

break through this logjam and get more housing built, prices will go up
and up and people will face the same difficulties they did in the past.
The irony is that we are not prepared to build houses, but we are
prepared, it seems, to finance the inflation of a bubble in housing
prices. That is absolutely the wrong thing to do. The bedroom tax
illustrates the problem; there simply are not the houses for people
whose income is being cut to move to. That illustrates the need to
improve our housing infrastructure, although the problem applies to
transport and energy as well. I do not object to some measures in the

Governor, but with the best will in the world we cannot expect him to
do everything the Government are supposed to be doing. It is useful

do not think, however, that the sort of measures the Chancellor has in
mind and which the new Governor might announce in relation to forward

before that quantitative easing has played its role and stabilised the
banking system—I have supported what has been done so
far—but there is little evidence of what additional QE would do
for our economy. The risk is that the money simply goes into the bank

urgent decision on the carbon price for offsite generation for
zero-carbon homes. The Red Book says that the decision will be taken by

second point I want to bring to the House’s attention is the
excellent news of more investment in homes for rent, with £225

Like everybody else in the

I do not believe we should listen for a moment to the shadow Secretary
of State for Communities and Local Government and his complaints, when
his Administration reduced the stock of affordable homes by 420,000 and
sold so many homes without having a replacement policy—a policy
that Labour itself now admits was a failure. I welcome these housing
measures in the Budget, but there is still much more to do to improve
the quality of our 20 million existing homes and to build the many more
we need to the highest environmental standards. I look forward to the

than being just London-based. Rather than cutting those people’s
pay by 1%, putting more money in the pockets of these workers would be
an excellent way to stimulate demand across the country. Instead, the

4,000 will be taken out of paying tax altogether. Before the Budget, I
suggested to the Treasury that we set an aspiration for future years
that nobody on the minimum wage should pay income tax. I know that the
Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who is not in his place, shares that

make decisions; the state governments make many of the big decisions on
investment, which is why we need to turbo-charge our approach and get
these offices across these countries quickly. The Government, together
with UKTI, should provide practical help by taking on office space in
these key cities, basing sector experts from the UK Government and UKTI
there, and working with local enterprise partnerships to get out there
and allow SMEs low-cost desk and office space for three, six or 12
months. The synergies that will be created as a result of all these
companies coming together in one location, with sector focus and where
we can also get local advisers involved, will do a huge amount to boost
our exports. We want to go from having one in five SMEs exporting to
having one in four, which is the European average. That will add
billions of GDP to our economy. UKTI is doing a great job with the

can best be measured by looking at the plan from 2010 and the Office
for Budget Responsibility forecasts attached to it. Two crucial
elements were going to support that plan and those forecasts. I recall
saying in the debates that followed that they seemed to be the two most
solid pillars on which the Government were building, but that, as far I
could see, there was nothing underneath to support them or the
OBR’s very optimistic forecasts. Those two elements
were: manufacturing exports—exports on the visible account; and
the increase in output from manufacturing. We were told to expect a
10%—I believe the figure given was 9.8%—increase in
output from the business sector, but what have we had in the two years
to the end of 2012? An increase of less than 5%—barely half what
was projected. The hon. Member for Reading West (Alok Sharma) said that
we are doing well on exports—I am not sure whether we were more
interested in exports or Reading—but compared with what was
projected and with what we need the outcome in those two years has been
terrible. I believe that the projected figure was 6% and we achieved
minus 0.3% to December last year in the value and volume of
exports.</hs_Para>

saying it is easy, but one thing I am sure about is that either the OBR
has no idea about forecasts or we need to reconsider the OBR model, as
it continually gets everything so wrong. My right hon. Friend the
Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling), the former Chancellor,
was kind enough to say that he thought the estimates were
optimistic—that the sunny uplands kept moving to the right and
that the further out the OBR went, the more optimistic it became, but
that was the case from the very beginning and nothing has changed. We
should now be in those sunlit uplands. I do not understand why the OBR,
with its much-vaunted independence, continues to get things so
hopelessly wrong. Somebody needs to rethink that model. It is not
enough to take responsibility out of the Treasury and pop it somewhere

part of the Budget that I thought might lead to some positive movement
concerned the construction industry and the house building sector in
particular. In an intervention on the Secretary of State, I welcomed
the Firstbuy initiative, and a development on the old Jaguar site in
Coventry has made quite a contribution, but the extension of the
mortgage scheme, which is much bigger, is—yet again—a
measure that has not been thought through. The problem with this
Government is that they are totally incapable of thinking anything
through. They should not be consulting on whether millionaires can have
subsidised mortgages for second homes. That should have been ruled out
in principle right from the beginning, before the consultation began.
Many things require consultation, but not that. I cannot imagine why it
was left in as an option—well, I can; things were not thought

while Rome burns, as it were. Central to it all is the attitude of the
Treasury and the Chancellor. If the Chancellor has lost self-confidence
to such an extent that it impacts on confidence in the business
community and consumers in the UK, he must consider whether he any
longer has the vision, courage and self-confidence—whether he
ever had those things is, of course, another question—to do what

with the general point about the £10,000 income tax threshold

next year, 4,000 individuals in my constituency will not be paying tax.
More important for hon. Members to understand is the fact that the
average total family income across Lancashire is approximately
£26,600, and next year those people will pay no tax on their
first £10,000 of income. To me, that is a huge selling point in
increasing confidence. People will be able to go out to work and the
Government will promise that we will not touch the first
£10,000. It seems remarkable that we are in such a state that we

we in Lancashire are still not satisfied that the regulatory regime is
right. We welcome the Chancellor’s commitment to an office for
unconventional gas and the tightening up of those regulations, but
people in Lancashire need to see that the regulations are thorough and
tight. Given that farmers still take water directly from the water

once—in fact, not for the first time—we agree. If
Lancashire is to be used to fill the energy gap and if Lancashire will
see fracking across the county, we need to understand that it is not
Texas and landowners in Lancashire do not own the mineral rights. The
Chancellor will gain through the tax system, companies will gain
through their profits and, presumably, the Duchy of Lancaster or the
Crown Estate will gain through the tax on mineral rights, but the local
councils will gain precious little. I was pleased that the Chancellor
said in his Budget that there would be specific proposals to allow
local communities to benefit, but I tell the Ministers on the Front
Bench that Lancashire expects more than one or two parish hall roofs to
be fixed. We want to see something that will return money to Lancashire
when the gas has been fracked, if that fracking is to go ahead. I need
to make that clear.</hs_Para>

infrastructure, hon. Members talked about growth. For me, the key point
was the Chancellor’s phrase about “clearing the economic
arteries”. In the north-west, that means something substantial
and we have had that from this Government. We have had the biggest
investment in rail for the last 30, 40 or 50 years. It was all right
Opposition Members saying that that would happen in future—it is
happening now. I point to my own station in Lancaster, where
£8.5 million is already being spent to vary the signalling so
that trains can turn around in Lancaster and more platforms can be
used. That is the small-scale work. Only last week, the Department for
Transport finally agreed the M6 link road, which will be a bypass for
Lancaster to the port of Heysham. It will bring thousands of jobs
through a scheme for which the first plans were produced in
1948—that is perhaps a lesson to us all. It has taken this
coalition Government to agree the money to get things moving and get
the growth.</hs_Para>

Peter Hain</B> (Neath) (Lab):</Member> Contrary to
the Chancellor’s mantra, Britain’s return to recession
was not made in Europe. It was made in Britain by the severe fiscal
squeeze that the Chancellor launched nearly three years ago. Problems
in the eurozone spell trouble for the UK economy—of course they
do—but the Chancellor never mentions the fact that Britain has
benefited from the recovery of the USA economy, which accounts for 20%
of our trade, and is currently growing four times faster than the
eurozone is slowing, because the USA took the route of economic
stimulus and stuck to it. Britain set out on the same path under Labour
after the banking crisis, and the economy began to pick up. However,
the coalition veered off as soon as the Tories and Lib Dems took
office, turning the road to recovery under Labour into the road to
ruin.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032527000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0002.htm#13032527000070">Cutting
too far and too fast means that the Chancellor has missed all his key
targets. In the year that is ending, his target deficit—the
cyclically adjusted current deficit as a share of gross domestic
product—is twice what he originally said it would be. Next year,
the Office for Budget Responsibility expects it to be four times what
he planned. He has also missed his public sector debt target: instead
of falling to 67% of GDP in 2015-16, under the Budget it will fall to
85% two years later, in 2017-18. That is a surreal definition of
success: debt falling upwards. Salvador Dali would be
proud.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032527000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0002.htm#13032527000071">Zero
growth has forced the Chancellor to accept higher borrowing
targets—more than £200 billion higher over five years
than he planned in 2010. Most of the cuts that have been announced have
yet to hit home. Cuts and austerity will continue Britain’s
economic inertia, with more disastrous, scorched earth economics to
come. Growth, not cuts, should be the priority. Sadly, there is plenty
of spare capacity in the UK economy, which could easily grow quite
quickly for a few years by taking up the slack, with borrowing,

driven demand out of the economy. Getting the economy growing again, as
I said, is the key to cutting the deficit, then stabilising and
bringing down the debt burden. Once the economy is growing again, it
will be much easier to deliver any remaining tax rises or spending cuts
that may still be necessary because, as Jonathan Portes says, jobs will
be plentiful, real incomes will rise and companies will invest
again.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032527000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0002.htm#13032527000075">The
Tory charge is that Labour would increase borrowing. The answer is,
yes, in the short term, we would, but to reduce borrowing in the long
term. Borrowing 
<?notus-xml column=1342?>more today can mean borrowing less tomorrow by getting the economy
growing again. President Obama’s 2009 stimulus package added to
the US federal deficit in the short term, but as US interest rates
fell, spending and output rose, and dole queues shortened. As a
proportion of America’s expanding GDP, its overall deficit has
shrunk every year since 2009, contrary to what has happened to our
deficit. A budget boost that triggered real recovery in Britain could
follow the same pattern, speeding up the growth of UK national income,
cutting the deficit as a proportion of GDP and causing the debt burden
to fall.</hs_Para>

the Budget should have been about, but old habits die hard as the
coalition partners continue to peddle their big deceit. First, they
said that the entire global banking crisis was caused by Labour
recruiting far too many nurses, doctors, teachers and police officers,
and that the trigger for the world financial collapse—sub-prime
mortgage defaults in the USA—was all Labour’s fault. The
second big deceit is their claim that today’s public sector
deficit was caused by excessive Labour spending. To quote utterances of
almost every Conservative MP as if on a dreary looped tape, too much
Labour borrowing led to too much national debt, so the cuts are all
Labour’s fault. They never admit the truth. They never say why,
if spending was “out of control” and wildly excessive,
the Chancellor in September 2007 committed a Tory Government to
matching Labour’s public spending plans for the next three

years of steady economic growth under Labour allowed us to pay down
debt by the equivalent of £90 billion today, saving taxpayers
some £3 billion a year in interest payments. We did fix the roof

Chancellor is playing a peculiar game of leapfrog with himself. Every

welcome the Budget on behalf of the almost 4,000 hard-

constituency—companies such as Dutton Contractors in Middlewich,
which I visited on Friday and had the privilege of opening two new

is a farmer. It sells and transports building construction materials.
The son, Richard Dutton, has so developed the business recently that it
now has 80 employees. The decision in the Budget to further stop
Labour’s planned fuel rises is worth £7 to every family
each time they fill up a family car, but it is worth considerably more
to companies such as Dutton Contractors, which has a fleet of vehicles,
so it very much welcomes the

Anne Begg</B> (Aberdeen South) (Lab):</Member> As time is short and
lots of hon. Members still want to speak, I will concentrate my remarks
on two matters: something I was disappointed not to find in the Budget
and something I was completely surprised to find in
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032527000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0002.htm#13032527000119">The
thing I was disappointed not to find was any change in the
Government’s attitude to what has become known as the bedroom
tax. I was not naive enough to think that they would make a complete
volte face having realised it is such an insidious and wrong-headed
policy, but I did think there might be some movement on the kinds of
people in households who should be completely exempt. I am thinking of
households with a profoundly disabled child or where a house has been
specially adapted for someone with a disability. The Government say
that people who have had their house adapted can apply for a
discretionary housing payment, but it should not at the discretion of
the local authority to decide whether it is affordable to pay the rent
on a house that has been specially adapted for an individual.</hs_Para>

who has had to adapt a number of houses, I know how difficult it is,
how expensive it can be, and how upsetting it can be for the
individual. I also 
<?notus-xml column=1348?>know that very often the adaptations are made
specifically for the individual, so if the family has to move out of
their home as a result of not getting their housing benefit paid in
full, the house will not necessarily be any good for any other disabled
person. This is wrong-headed—it should never be discretionary. I
hope that it is not too late for the Government to make sure that that
group of people is exempt from the bedroom
tax.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032527000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0002.htm#13032527000121">The
thing I was surprised to see in the Budget was the change in the date
for the introduction of the new single-tier pension. I recognise that
this might be a bit academic for hon. Members in the Chamber today, but
my Select Committee, the Work and Pensions Committee, was asked to
carry out the pre-legislative scrutiny of the changes to the state
pension. The Bill that was published had a start date of April 2017,
and we had taken all our evidence on that basis. We had asked the
industry whether it could be ready by April 2017 and asked the various
user groups whether that was a reasonable time scale.</hs_Para>

all that evidence and done the scrutiny work that the Government had
asked us to do, it came as a complete surprise when we found in the
Budget that the date was to be brought forward by a whole year and the
measure will now be implemented from April 2016. It makes a mockery of
the pre-legislative scrutiny process that we were not able to do our
job properly and ask the right questions. Just a week before, the
Minister responsible had said that there would be no
slippage in the timetable and that April 2017 would be the
implementation
date.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032527000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0002.htm#13032527000123">One
might think that perhaps, because the Budget was covered by all the
usual purdah arrangements, the Government were unable to tell us that
the measure was going to come in a year earlier, but the information
was leaked and was all over the papers the Sunday before. Clearly, the
Government knew they were going to change the date. This was obviously
very tempting for the Chancellor given that some £5.9 billion is
generated by bringing in the change to contracting out, because no one
will be contracted out under the new single-tier pension. I am very
angry, as you can tell, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this was landed on my
Committee at the very last
moment.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13032527000169" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0002.htm#13032527000169">6.56

Smith</B> (Crawley) (Con):</Member> The Budget reaffirmed the
Government’s economic strategy of focusing on reducing the

created and the deficit reduced by a third since the general election,
Great Britain is clearly on the right course.</hs_Para>

issue, however, that I would have liked my right hon. Friend the
Chancellor of the Exchequer to address—tackling the severe
inherited levels of air passenger duty. That was a missed opportunity

business travel to stimulate trade and investment, and to help
hard-working families who want to visit their friends or family or to
take a well-earned family holiday.</hs_Para>

Labour Government inherited a very modest level of APD and, over time,
significantly increased the rates, particularly for long-haul travel.
Since taking office, my right hon. Friend has recognised this problem
by delivering a temporary one-year freeze and limiting 
<?notus-xml column=1349?>increases to the level of inflation. While this
action has been very welcome, we should be going further to undo
Labour’s damage. Most countries do not charge an international
air travel tax at all, but of the handful that do, the UK has by far
the highest such tax—more than double that of the next highest
charging country, which is Germany. Levying the world’s highest
air passenger tax is not a sustainable position for an island nation
seeking to increase international trade and to attract millions of new
in-bound visitors.</hs_Para>

significant public concern about APD. Hon. Members have received
hundreds of e-mails from constituents, and over 200,000 people have
contacted their Member of Parliament to say that APD rates are too
high. However, public concern has not, until now, been supported by
detailed and credible evidence. Four airlines, including Virgin
Atlantic, which is headquartered in my constituency, and EasyJet, the
majority of whose services go from London Gatwick airport, commissioned
an independent report by PriceWaterhouseCoopers that provides that
missing analysis. It makes interesting reading with regard to the
nature of APD and its role in the UK economy. It finds that APD is the
highest tax of its type in the world by a considerable margin; that it
is a highly distortive tax that is at least as damaging to the
economy—and probably more so on a pound for pound
basis—than corporation tax, and second only to fuel duty among
major UK taxes; and that UK businesses in aggregate pay about
£500 million in APD each
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032527000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0002.htm#13032527000128">The
report’s main analysis relates to the impact on the economy and
tax revenues if APD were to be abolished. The report’s modelling
suggests that by abolishing APD the UK could boost its gross domestic
product by 0.45% in the first year, with continuing benefits through to
2020. Abolishing APD would also increase investment by 6% and exports,
including earnings from foreign tourism, by 5% between 2013 and 2015.
Abolishing APD would pay for itself, with increased business growth
leading to higher tax receipts from other sources, outweighing the lost
APD revenue, and it would lead to the creation of up to 60,000 jobs
between now and 2020. The report acknowledges that it is uncommon but
not unprecedented for tax cuts to pay for
themselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032527000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0002.htm#13032527000129">Even
though this has been a step too far for this Budget, I hope that I have

contributor to the UK economy and the Exchequer and to boosting growth

businesses in my constituency and throughout the

commend the Government for upholding their commitment to spending 0.7%
of gross national income on international development. Given the
current economic climate, it is understandable, though regrettable,
that, despite the fact that this allocation represents a small fraction
of overall Government expenditure, it comes under continuing pressure.
However, by standing by the commitment, the UK is showing
leadership in the international community. Aid well spent is a powerful
tool to tackle severe global poverty, to assist some of the poorest
nations in becoming more self-sustaining and to support global justice,
human rights and security. Moreover, although it is spent abroad, it
also contributes to protecting our own national
interest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032527000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032527000135">In
that vein, I also welcome the fact that at the same time as the
Treasury is seeking to tackle tax avoidance in the UK—which we
all welcome—it has also committed to prioritising dealing with
international tax avoidance by UK companies, which is depriving many
nations from the transition from aid to trade. I hope that it will be
robust in its
actions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032527000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032527000136">I
also welcome the increase in the personal tax allowance, which will
lift many of those in the lowest paid employment out of tax altogether.
If it were part of a package of measures to tackle poverty more
comprehensively, it would be even more welcome. However, as I noted
last year, as an anti-poverty measure it is neither the most effective
nor the most targeted approach. Although the poorest working families
will benefit, raising the personal allowance will also benefit many
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032527000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032527000137">In
the time remaining, I want to comment briefly on measures that will
impact on Northern Ireland in particular. I welcome the reduction in
corporation tax, which is a particularly sensitive issue given
our land border with the Republic of Ireland, where corporation
tax is significantly lower at 12.5%. Although it would not be a silver
bullet, the devolution of corporation tax has been identified by
industry, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee and the Northern
Ireland Executive as an important tool in stimulating the economy and
attracting inward investment. The UK-wide reduction, though modest, is
a step in the right direction and will also lower the potential cost to
the Northern Ireland Assembly should this tax power be devolved, as
many of us wish. It is disappointing that that devolution was not
announced in the Budget. I trust that the Prime Minister will have more

The cost of fuel, for example, is a particular pressure, with Northern
Ireland consumers facing the highest petrol and diesel prices in the UK

and our international competitiveness, so I welcome the cancellation of
the fuel duty increase that was planned for September. The cost of
energy generation more widely is also greater in Northern Ireland and
the exemption from the carbon price floor is a welcome measure for
energy producers and consumers

the Chancellor offered no good news on another significant cost of our

but if we are to support essential connectivity, reduce business costs
and grow our inbound and outbound tourism sectors, both of which
contribute significantly to the Northern Ireland and UK economy, the
Treasury needs to look at the issue again. A recent report by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has been referenced by the hon. Member
for Crawley (Henry Smith), indicated that reducing or abolishing APD
could stimulate growth and lead to the raising of more revenue, rather
than less. The Treasury appears to have dismissed that analysis, but I
urge it to do its own study on the impact of APD on
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032527000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032527000142">There

a good thing but, at a time when unemployment figures in Northern

match aspiration with real opportunity is much more important. I remain
to be convinced that this Budget will do that for the people whom I

years but who had now, through no fault of her own, been made
unemployed, could not find a job and was in negative equity. That
brings home to all of us the human nature of what we are dealing with.
Although we may bandy statistics across the House, we are dealing with
a desperate situation—for which, by the way, I do not blame the

do not support cutting for the sake of cutting. If Tesco has a problem
in its bread department, it sells bread more efficiently; it does not
cut the number of loaves it sells. I agree about that, but the Labour
party cannot give simplistic solutions based on more wasteful spending,
nor can it constantly say that our problems would be solved if we
restored the 50% tax band, when every study proves that it reduced
revenues to the Treasury. As we know, the top 1% of earners pay 24% of
all tax revenues. Labour has to come up with something more

was predicted in 2010. Any Budget giveaways—I accept that this
Budget is politically astute—will be soaked up by inflation
rising faster than wages. That point has already been made about the 1p
cut in beer duty. One would have to drink five pints every night for
seven nights to save 35p a week. I am not sure that will impress
anybody. The cut in corporation tax is welcome, but that is only a

I broadly welcomed the Government’s schemes to encourage people
to buy new builds and to assist people with mortgage deposits. With the
demise of building societies, banks have a virtual monopoly on
mortgages. The percentage that is required for a deposit has been
rising steadily, especially for first-time buyers. That has created an
environment in which people who 
<?notus-xml column=1354?>are more than able to pay for a mortgage cannot get
one because the tens of thousands of pounds that they need for a
deposit are
unachievable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000021">However,
I then started to consider the broader picture and the details of the
schemes. First, it has been revealed that the Government’s
mortgage scheme will not exclude people who are buying a second home.
What about a third or a fourth home? How does that help people who are
starting out? Not only are the Government pressing ahead with tax cuts
for millionaires, it now seems that the mortgage scheme will help
people, no matter how high their income, to buy a subsidised second
home worth up to £600,000. Secondly, what interest rate will be
charged, or will it be an interest-free loan? Thirdly, is it right that
the taxpayer will effectively be underwriting the banks? The state will
be facilitating banks to make profits on these
mortgages.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000022">My
main question is, where are all the new homes for people to buy? The
Government’s schemes mean that more people will be trying to buy
the same number of houses. That will just push up the cost of a house
unless more homes are built. The Government announced an extra
£225 million for affordable house building, but according to the
OBR only £125 million will be spent before 2015. That figure is
dwarfed by the £4 billion cut in the funding for affordable
housing that the Chancellor made in his first Budget. That stopped a
very successful affordable housing scheme in Rotherham that was run by
Transform South
Yorkshire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000023">House
building is at its lowest rate since the 1920s and the situation is
getting worse. Housing starts fell by 11% in 2012 to below 100,000. The
impact of that is that the Government have put 80,000 construction

has proposed some practical measures to address that problem. We called
on the Chancellor to use the money raised from the 4G mobile
auction to build thousands of affordable homes to stimulate the economy
and tackle the housing crisis. To improve the housing stock, we
recommended that VAT on home repairs, maintenance and improvements
should be cut to just 5%. To help young people who want to get on to
the property ladder, the CBI’s proposal of a housing individual
savings account should be considered. We also advocate giving
first-time buyers a stamp duty holiday on properties worth up to
£250,000. Finally, I support Labour’s recommendation to
bring forward long-term infrastructure investment in schools, roads and

package is part of building a stronger economy and a fairer society,
and includes a number of measures to support home ownership, new
development and affordable housing. Over the past year or so, there has
been agreement across the House that stimulating the construction
sector is key to stimulating growth. It is a win-win situation with
more jobs and more money created for our economy, without particularly
sucking in imports. It is estimated that each extra home built each
year creates jobs for three to four construction workers and those in
associated industries, thereby improving business confidence.</hs_Para>

previous debates we have identified issues on the demand and supply
sides of the housing market, and many have argued that the problem is
not with planning as such. On the demand side, measures in the Budget
have the potential to extend the supply of new houses, perhaps
converting some of the hundreds of thousands of non-implemented
planning applications into homes. Meeting the needs of those willing
and able to buy, and the aspirations of those wishing to be home
owners, is important, and will give this generation the same
opportunities as my generation. At times tonight I have wondered
whether the Labour party actually believes in encouraging home
ownership.</hs_Para>

home ownership is not the whole solution to our housing problem. I
represent an area—Purbeck—that has a very high
house-price-to-wages ratio and a high proportion of second homes.
Although I am keen on the two schemes to stimulate mortgages, I am not
keen on them subsidising second homes as that would make the situation
in Purbeck and Dorset even worse. I like both schemes, however, because
they involve first-time buyers and second steppers, and I think that we
must put a shock through the whole market.</hs_Para>

there is a but—I think we have to do a lot more. I like the buy
to rent stimulus, but we need to increase the supply of affordable
housing over and above what we want to do and have done already. In the
next phase we ought to look at the capacity of councils to borrow money
for building housing, at direct building by councils, and at supporting
arm’s length management organisations, which is incredibly
important. An ALMO in my constituency is ready to start building but
cannot get the borrowing

Morrice</B> (Livingston) (Lab):</Member> I welcome the opportunity to
speak in this important debate, because the Budget last week revealed
the true scale of the Government’s economic failure. As the next
election grows closer, the Chancellor faced a test. He needed to boost
household incomes and help cut the cost of essentials, but neither of
those was forthcoming and his Budget failed to do enough for low-income
households.

an eye fixed firmly on the next general election, the Chancellor is
pinning his hopes on a housing boom. His make-or-break blueprint for
rebuilding the economy is unlikely to make a difference to the
nation’s finances, as the focus has clearly shifted towards
manifesto writing, positioning and early electioneering ahead of 2015.
More than ever, taxpayers will now underwrite the mortgages of hundreds
of thousands of home buyers, and take stakes in newly built houses in a
multi-billion pound attempt to stimulate the struggling economy.
However, he risks causing another unsustainable boom in the housing
market, putting billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money at risk
and offering little hope to hard-pressed working families who are
struggling to get on the housing ladder for the first
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000036">We
face the biggest housing crisis in a generation, but the
Government’s housing and economic policies will make it worse by
stoking house prices rather than helping families find a home. The
Government have insisted that homes sold through the right to buy
scheme will be replaced with more affordable housing on a one-for-one
basis, but the Budget included £4.5 billion of funding for
housing, with only £225 million of that to be spent on
affordable homes. If we do not tackle the fact that we are still not
building enough homes, we will create another housing bubble that will
continue to push house prices out of reach of the
majority.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000037">Not
only is the Chancellor pressing ahead with a tax cut for millionaires,
it now seems that his mortgage scheme will help people, no matter how
high their income, to buy a subsidised second home worth up to
£600,000. Surely people struggling to get a mortgage, and those
who want to own their first home, must be the priority for
help, rather than the small number who can afford to buy a second home.
If the Government concentrated at least some effort on collecting taxes
from international corporations that operate in this country, and
closing some of the loopholes in the tax system, there would be more
money to go
around.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000038">With
the coalition’s axe in full swing, I am appalled that the
Government place so much effort on reforming the benefits system and
punishing the sick and most vulnerable in our society, while those at

financial sector is at the heart of the economy. Huge, multi-million
pound payouts to “banksters”, while citizens cannot 
<?notus-xml column=1357?>even afford to feed themselves, undermine any
efforts to break with the past and are a timely reminder that the
country is being run by the rich for the rich. As the rest of the

Morris</B> (Halesowen and Rowley Regis) (Con):</Member> Few things are
as natural as the aspiration to own a home, but for too many of our
constituents, the aspiration is too often out of reach. The high cost
of housing is one of the most frequently raised issues at my surgery.
The problem affects not only would-be first-time buyers, but many going
through family breakdown. The deposit typically required for a mortgage
on even a small starter home is higher than many working
families’ annual income. Without parental support, raising that
sort of money can be nearly impossible. The “help to buy”
schemes announced last week will help to put home ownership back within
the reach of hundreds of thousands of our
constituents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000044">I
am delighted that the Chancellor is extending right to buy further, so
that council tenants can buy the homes in which their families live and
local authorities will receive receipts from the sales, to be used to
build new social housing. I am proud that, while under Conservative
leadership, Dudley built some of the first new council housing in the
area for a generation. Right-to-buy receipts, and the doubling of the
affordable homes guarantee programme, will mean that more councils and
housing associations will be able to build new social housing for local
residents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000045">Last
week’s jobs figures showed another increase in the number of
people in work—the number in Halesowen and Rowley Regis is now
the highest ever—but the fact remains that many people aspire
more than anything else to a job that will give them more independence
and create a better life for themselves and their families. I remember
from I was setting up my own small businesses 
<?notus-xml column=1358?>that nothing was more rewarding than being able to
offer somebody their first job, or to offer work to a person who had
been unemployed for some time. Hon. Members know that Governments
cannot magically create sustainable jobs, but they have a
responsibility to do everything possible to avoid putting barriers in
the way of those who can. Every £1 that we add to non-wage costs
represents an additional barrier to small and medium-sized businesses
taking on extra employees. That is why I am pleased that the Chancellor
has launched his scheme. The £2,000 employment allowance is a
direct boost for new jobs. It will help to bring more people into work

which were drawn up following a national vote. That generation wants to

unsustainable deficits. The continuing turmoil in the eurozone is a

their proposals, I hope that they will discount any chance of the loan
guarantee being used to support the purchase of second homes, and that
it will go only to families that otherwise would not be able to buy a
first home of their own. After I was first elected in 1997, I
campaigned against the policy that had been introduced by the
Conservative Government of providing a 50% council tax
discount for second homes. In that case, hundreds of millions of pounds
were being used every year to subsidise the wealthy buying second
homes, when thousands of local families could not afford their first.
This Government are finishing off the job. I persuaded the previous
Labour Government to remove as much as they possibly could
of the second home council tax discount, and that was the right step
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000060">Before
I was elected to this House, I worked with housing associations and
others to find a way of constructing a new lower rung on the housing
ladder through shared equity and shared ownership schemes. The rural
exceptions policy allowed exceptions to be made on the edges of
villages and towns, where planning permission would not normally be
granted, to meet local housing need. It allowed the schemes to go ahead
and meant that the development price of land was significantly lower
than would have been the case if they had been given unfettered
permission to develop the land and build properties at prices that
local people could not afford. The exceptions approach and shared
ownership were clearly the way forward. The problem was that in rural
areas only two lenders, Nationwide and Halifax, were prepared to put
money into shared ownership developments.</hs_Para>

lenders question whether they are prepared to put their money in and
support local families who are trying to get on to the housing ladder.
Such properties do not result in the level of default—the amount
is 0.45% in shared ownership as a whole, which is significantly less
than that for rural housing stock—that a lot of lenders pretend.
If the Government are looking at ways to tighten the definition and
develop their loan guarantee scheme so that it will apply to families
who desperately need help, I urge them to look at the shared ownership
sector. They should find ways to enable the situation to come to life,
but not just on the first, initial purchase; 
<?notus-xml column=1361?>they should try to ensure that on the second and
subsequent purchase they can facilitate and work with housing
associations so that these families can move on. The lack of confidence
that this market can have a life of its own is holding it

fundamentals that are remorselessly driving this country into a
semi-permanent stagnation is to degrade the high office of Chancellor.
The home loans scheme has more than a whiff of sub-prime about it,
luring those without the means to buy a house they cannot afford and
thereby fuelling a housing bubble. The child care voucher is limited to
where both parents are working and offers five times more to the
richest fifth than the poorest fifth. And the penny off a pint of beer
does not do much to compensate for the 9% cut in real wages that the
OBR now expects by 2015 compared with
2009.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000081">All
this populist flannel misses the point. The real point is the total
abandonment of any serious attempt in the Budget to tackle the
fundamental problems of a desperately ailing economy. The tragedy for
the people of this country is that during this depression we have
Herbert Hoover at the controls, when the whole country is crying out
for a Franklin Roosevelt. The harshly unrelenting facts of
Britain’s inexorable decline speak for themselves. The OBR has
been forced to halve the growth prediction this year, which it made
only three months ago, from 1.2% to 0.6%. The deficit
reduction—the ostensible aim of the whole brutal austerity
machine—is going into reverse. The deficit now expected in 2014
is £120 billion—twice what it was expected to be just
three years ago. By the time of the election in 2015, the Government
will have been forced to borrow an extra £250 billion more than
was forecast in 2010. With the plans in the Budget, any hope of the
Chancellor’s achieving a firm and sustainable recovery is simply
delusional.</hs_Para>

any Budget is its macro-economic strategy. Uniquely, in this Budget,
there was no credible strategy. The Chancellor’s policy is still
so destructive and the failure so massive that it is difficult to avoid
the conclusion that the real objective is not deficit reduction, but to
dismantle the public sector and shrink the state. One simply has to
ask, “Why is the Chancellor so wilfully blind to an
alternative?”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000083">An
alternative must start from recognising that when the household and
private sectors are deleveraging, there cannot be a recovery if the
public sector does the same. It starts from recognising also that
monetary policy alone—throwing £375 billion of
quantitative easing at the banks, dropping interest rates to the floor
and letting the exchange rate fall by 25%—cannot by itself
produce growth; or, as Mark Carney would put it, not much
“escape velocity” there. An alternative also starts from
accepting that until the collapse in aggregate demand is tackled, there
will be no recovery.</hs_Para>

be engineered and paid for? There has to be, initially, a public
sector-driven investment programme in house building, infrastructure,
energy, transport and low-carbon technology until such time as the
private sector can take over. That can be paid for by borrowing
£30 billion at the dirt-cheap interest rate of 0.5%, or
£150 million a year, which would rapidly pay for itself by
taking back into employment 1 million workers, whom it is currently
costing the country £10 billion to keep on the dole. However,
this does not have to involve any public borrowing at all. The
nationalised banks, RBS and Lloyds, could be instructed to prioritise
lending 
<?notus-xml column=1365?>to key infrastructure manufacturing projects, or the
ultra-rich—the 14,000 millionaires who are about to get a
£2,000 a week tax give-away—could be capital gains taxed
on the £155 billion of gains they have made over the last three
years, according to <I>The Sunday Times</I>. Or, instead of hosing down
the banks with another huge tranche of quantitative easing, the money
could be diverted to direct investment in
industry.</hs_Para>

am not going to pretend that I am an economist or that I necessarily
understand banking regulation or the complexities that go with it, but
I think that we cannot ignore the reasons why we are in this mess. To
my mind, it was Bill Clinton and the American Administration who,
wanting to encourage the less well off, especially among the
Afro-Caribbean community in the United States, to buy their own homes,
consequently created a sub-prime market in the 1990s. By weakening
financial regulation, the US and British Governments created a new
class of specialised mortgage lenders that subcontracted their
liability. By failing to put up interest rates, the US Federal Reserve
and the Bank of England allowed the housing market to overheat. That is
the reason why we created this major
crash.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000108">In
2001, when the Labour Government created a budget deficit, they
continued to make our problems much more disastrous than they needed to
be, and they failed to control public expenditure, adding to our
financial woes. In addition, the Bank of England failed to manage our
inflation target and our monetary framework. Not only the Treasury, but
the Office for Budgetary Responsibility have some way to go because
they have failed to get their forecasts right in the
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000109">As
my hon. Friends know, the Bank of England is responsible for managing
the inflation target, but it is the Treasury that actually sets that
target in the first place. For the last two years, I have been banging
on and asking how those criteria have been set, but I have failed to
get a reply. Plainly, something has gone very wrong indeed. The Bank of
England is consistently failing to hit its inflation target. In
producing a Budget, monetary policy cannot be divorced from the
economics. 
<?notus-xml column=1369?>In the years before the credit crunch, monetary
conditions were too loose. There was an asset price bubble, house
prices rose very sharply and if the banking crises had not erupted,
general inflation would have been an even more serious problem.
The Bank of England accommodated a serious asset price bubble with a
huge and unsustainable level of domestic household debt. People have
rightly criticised bank and financial market regulation, but much less
attention has been given to defective central banking and overly loose
monetary conditions that made possible the household borrowing and
financial leverage.</hs_Para>

that the time has now come when the role of the central banks should be
scrutinised properly. We must learn the lessons, the limitations and
the defects of the inflation target regime. There has been a serious
lack of transparency in the way the Bank of England conducts monetary
policy. The details of its forecasting model, the assumptions it uses
and the forecasts it generates have not been publicly available. Its
public documents have been disappointing in respect of their clarity
and presentation, and I am afraid that the inflation report has failed.
I am firmly of the view that we need a proper review of the inflation
target, how it is set out and how the central bank conducts its
business.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13032535000161" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000161">8.18

reason for our financial loss was the fact that we are one of the main
financial centres in the world. Given that there was a global banking
crisis, of course we were likely to take the hit more than other
countries. We should also bear in mind that up to 2008, while Labour
was in power, the actual borrowing costs were low. Indeed, they are
still low. That is because in the United Kingdom our bonds are strong
and are performing well, because people know that the Bank of England
is there to step in if there is any problem, and, of course, because
over the last 300 years the UK has never defaulted on its debt. The
Government try to blame austerity, saying, “We must introduce

believe that blue-collar workers out there, and the general population,
understand the challenging economic climate, and agree that we need to
tackle the deficit. The Chancellor stated that it had now been cut by
one third, not one quarter, and that according to the Office for Budget
Responsibility, we are on course to fulfil our fiscal mandate. However,
tackling the deficit, although right and necessary, cannot be our only
message. We need to reinforce and go further in regard to some of our
flagship policies, taking low-paid workers out of tax and freezing fuel
duty. Above all, blue-collar workers want to see more money in their
wallets at the end of the month, and I believe that we are on course to
achieve that. The Budget demonstrates that our priorities—the
Government’s priorities—are in the right place.</hs_Para>

the Opposition often comes to the Dispatch Box and accuses the
Government of being “out of touch”. The Budget shows that
we are on the side of workers, of families, of people who want to get
on and make a better life for themselves. It shows that the Government
have their priorities at heart—the right priorities. Our
priorities are in the right place when a Budget raises the personal tax
allowance to £10,000 from April 2014, which means a tax cut for
24 million people. As a result, some people will pay £700 less
in income tax than they did in 2010, and 2.7 million will be taken out
of tax altogether. Our priorities are in the right place when fuel duty
is being frozen once again, which makes this the longest freeze for
over 20 years. Pump prices will be 13p lower than they would have been
as a result of Labour’s plans, leaving the average motorist with
£170 more in his or her pocket. We are helping the aspirational
workers, but we are also helping the entrepreneurs, the risk-takers and
the employers. The small businessman has faced, and still faces,
numerous challenges. Things are not easy, but, as a Government, we can
help to make things easier, and help to make those businesses succeed.
The fall in fuel duty will help them, too, but more importantly the
package of business reforms will make a real difference in the pockets
of businesses up and down the backbone of this
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032535000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0003.htm#13032535000135">We

are taking people out of tax: 450,000 small businesses—one third

Chancellor takes similar steps to increase the allowance in future
Budgets. Taking more small businesses out of paying the jobs tax will

week, when listening to the Chancellor deliver his fourth Budget and
its dreadful assessment of the state of the British economy, it was
hard to believe that if everything had gone to plan for him and we had
managed to pull off what he proposed in the emergency Budget, we would
be well down the road to balancing the books and debt would be peaking
this year as a percentage of GDP. Such a plan now seems nothing more

we would be the next Greece, all but destroyed business and consumer
confidence, before the measures in the emergency Budget were even on
the statute book. When the Government’s agenda did bite, the
combination of that, the collapse of confidence they had already

three issues I would like to address in the brief time available to me,
the first of which is manufacturing. I agree entirely with my hon.
Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman) that this Government
have done some good things in that regard. I am pleased that there are
Members on both sides of the House who, like me, are passionate
about manufacturing, a sector in which a fifth of my constituents still
work. However, the Budget speech made no mention of the “march
of the makers”, and it did not address the two main issues that
still remain: that such businesses cannot borrow money when they need
to; and that they feel that the Government do not give them sufficient 
<?notus-xml column=1374?>strategic direction, be it on renewable energy, High
Speed 2, aviation policy or anything else. I hope the Chancellor has
had time to read the excellent report by the former director of
the Institute of Directors, Sir George Cox, on short-termism in
the UK economy. I hope he will take on board its main recommendation:
that we need to develop a coherent and workable modern industrial
strategy if we are to remain competitive. I agree with Government
Members when they say we are in a global race, but at the moment we do
not even have a map of the course.</hs_Para>

despite the job creation record that Government Members like to
emphasise, unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, is still a
major problem. We know enough about the Work programme to know that it
has not been a success. Due to the combination of a lack of jobs
generally and an inadequate payments system, it has not had the impact
it should have had. We had on the statute book a range of measures that
were getting people back into work; the future jobs fund, for example,
should never have been dropped. Much of the Government’s
borrowing—they announced £245 billion on top of their
2010 figure—is paying for the costs of failure. It is not
unreasonable to wonder what might have happened if we had invested a
fraction of that sum in putting people back into work.</hs_Para>

point is about the equity of the Government’s agenda and how
things have been shared, because the lower down the income scale people
are, the harder they have been hit. The contrast between the tax cut
for millionaires in the next few days and the bedroom tax is startling.
The latter is a tax on people struggling with their child’s
disability, struggling with their own or their partner’s ill
health, or struggling to be a good parent in the event of the breakdown
of their relationship. The fact that it may lead to higher costs for
the Exchequer, as families are forced to move into higher-cost private
accommodation, flies in the face of all reason. On this measure, more
than any other, we need another famous Budget U-turn.</hs_Para>

with some specific Budget measures. I welcome the concessions on fuel
duty, which does have a real impact on household income, and the
scrapping of the beer tax escalator, which will benefit real ale towns
such as Stalybridge. The nod towards the Heseltine report is also good,
but it could have gone so much further. Had the Government pursued the

continues to bump along the bottom with little or no growth in GDP and
the revised OBR figures of only 0.6% growth for this year was a dark
cloud over the whole Budget. In Wales, the situation is bleak, with the
Office for National Statistics reporting 8,000 fewer jobs in the Welsh
economy in the three months up to January. The austerity strategy set
out in the 2010 comprehensive spending review aimed at the elimination
of the deficit by the end of the Parliament has failed. The fiscal
position is considerably worse than that forecast three years ago and
worse even than that forecast this time last year—and that is
with nearly 80% of the cuts yet to be delivered. We estimate that up to
another 50,000 public sector jobs will lost in Wales in the coming
years, following the 24,000 already lost. The Budget noted that Wales
will get £161 million towards capital spending, but that
conveniently masks the fact that there has already been a 40% cut to
the capital spend budget from the CSR and that the re-allocation
announced last week would come from strained revenue budgets.</hs_Para>

freeze in fuel duty, but argue that it would be much better to have a
long- term solution based on a stabilising mechanism. The
announcement on when the £10,000 income tax personal allowance
will be reached is welcome, as that is a long-standing Plaid Cymru
policy. The £3 billion in infrastructure spending is also to be
welcomed although, admittedly, it is a fraction of what is needed and
was more of a political gesture than a serious economic intervention.
We support the announcement of the introduction of an allowance of
£2,000 a year from April 2014 for all businesses and charities
to be offset against their employers’ national insurance
contributions, as it will give businesses incentives to take on extra
workers. We also support the move to change the terms of reference of

all-party group working with the Office of Tax Simplification on the
concept of a new flat tax for the smallest businesses, through the
format of the business structure, so that whether it is a company, a
sole trader or a partnership, there is a new mechanism. I appreciate

businesses that are paying business rates what they get for their
money. The Chancellor and his team have been keen to enable those of us
who pay income tax to see where that income tax is going, but the same
argument ought to be true of business rates. Many business people say
to me, “But I don’t get my bins emptied in the same way

can look at two aspects of that, the first of which is housing in the
north-east. Again, we heard a number of lip-service announcements made
in the Budget. I am pleased that the Government finally seem to be
waking up to the fact that there is a housing crisis, but they appear
to be stoking demand for housing, rather than looking at how to
increase supply urgently and drastically. The Chancellor—he is
probably the only one who thinks this—says that the fundamental
overhaul of planning laws is helping homes to be built and businesses
to expand. I think that he is wrong on both counts. House 
<?notus-xml column=1380?>building is falling and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds
Central (Hilary Benn) said earlier, so is the speed with which planning
decisions are being made. Research from the House of Commons Library
confirms that no peacetime Government since the 1920s have presided
over fewer housing completions than this Government have over the past

been spent under Labour’s plans. That has knock-on effects for

Kwarteng:</Member></B> I happen to be a balanced budget Conservative.
Even at the time, before I was elected to this House, I completely
disavowed any move to stick to Labour’s spending. I thought that
it was a big mistake at the time and I am quite happy to say that in
this House. I think that it was entirely a mistake to do what 
<?notus-xml column=1381?>the Labour Government did and run deficits at a time when the economy
was growing at 3%. It was absolute madness to run deficits at 3% of GDP
when the economy itself was growing at 3%. Not even the most
starry-eyed Keynesian has ever suggested that we should be running
deficits while the economy was expanding. As a direct consequence of
this irresponsible period, in 2010 we were left with the largest
peacetime deficit and the highest deficit-to-GDP ratio of any of the
OECD countries. That period of stewardship marks the ultimate disgrace
of the Labour party in terms of managing the national economy. We have
now reached the point where we are borrowing £100 billion a year
and the national debt is going up, as people have mentioned. As a
consequence of this high level of deficit financing, we are going to
leave a national debt in years to come that is higher than it has been
for generations.</hs_Para>

proposals have Labour Members come up with during this four-day debate?
Their answer is simply to borrow more money and to spend more money.
They would accelerate our downward path and we would end up, as one
economic commentator has said, with Club Med levels of debt similar to
those of Portugal and Greece—without, unfortunately, the good
weather. That is what Labour Members are leading this country towards.
Members of the public will be absolutely astounded that Labour Members
have expressed not one shred of remorse, regret or acknowledgement.
They live in a world in which they did nothing wrong. Everything has
been blamed on the coalition Government, who have tried to clear up the
appalling mess—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> Labour

down the country realise and acknowledge that the Labour Government
were entirely irresponsible. What solutions have the Labour Members
come up with? Absolutely none. It is embarrassing to listen to some of
their speeches. They talk about more growth despite the fact that the
eurozone is flat on its back. They talk about more investment despite
the fact that we are borrowing more money than we ever have before.
When one asks them where this money is going to come from, they repeat,
“The bankers’ bonus tax”, as though that would pay
for absolutely everything they wish for, although it has already been
spent about 100 times. It is depressing to see Labour Members, who
fancy themselves as the next Government—they are very confident,
I notice—offering such poor, ill-thought-through and pathetic
solutions to a grave national crisis. People watching this debate at
home will be appalled, frankly, by the level of argument, contribution
and solutions that Labour Members have contributed.</hs_Para>

and not practical policies drive the Government, so instead of helping
with social housing, the Chancellor extended the right to buy, which is
at the root of much of the problem of social housing supply. As private
landlords win out, we lose vital social assets. When the Government
extended the right-to-buy scheme in April 2012, the Secretary of
State—he does well to smile—promised one-for-one
replacement. How many have we seen? Three hundred and eighty-four new
homes have been built to replace 3,495 sold, which is a 90% loss of
socially rented

the new homes bonus has an unfair impact. It is designed to incentivise
local authorities to approve new housing development but is calculated

wealthier areas, and from Labour councils to Conservative and Liberal
Democrat councils. For example, it is estimated that Sheffield council

their austerity, their new taxes and their extreme cuts, and yet two
years later, our borrowing is still growing at an alarming rate.
Despite the Government’s austerity, the Chancellor is expected

year, the UK economy went through a double-dip recession. The
Government’s failure on deficit and debt reduction is colossal.
Lack of growth has meant huge Government borrowing to pay for the cost
of their economic failure. The Chancellor has failed the test he set
for himself. The economy is flatlining, prices are rising a lot faster
than wages, the deficit is going up, and the UK has lost its triple A
credit rating. Instead of delivering a credible Budget that demands
confidence in our economy, the Chancellor delivered a downgraded Budget

his policies and so left room to manoeuvre when he saw them failing.

to keep digging. We needed bold and decisive action last week, and a
Budget that would kick-start the economy and help millions of people up

trumpet is, to a degree, illusory. It represents, in part, the fact
that the working-age population has grown, so it is hardly surprising
that more people are in work. It represents to a degree a

right to provide a public subsidy to a young couple wanting to buy a
new and perhaps larger home for a growing family, why is it wrong to
subsidise the same family if they want to remain in social rented
accommodation and also need more space as kids grow and develop? As my
hon. Friend the Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie) said, Government
support to buy a home or get a mortgage will be of no use to those of
my constituents who are either not working or in short-term insecure
employment, which means that they are not attractive to mortgage
lenders and have no choice but to rent.</hs_Para>

support working families on the lowest incomes and those on out-of-work
benefits feeds across to other policy areas. The child care
announcements will benefit many better-off families, but as the
Resolution Foundation pointed out, only 40% of those on universal
credit will benefit from the maximum 85% rate, while those looking for
work will not get any help at all when engaged in a job search. The
same is true of the increase in the personal tax threshold, which is of
no help to those on very low wages whose earnings are too low for them
even to pay tax. The poor and the working poor have therefore once
again totally missed out in the Budget, and as a result deprived
families and communities will become more
deprived.</hs_Para>

Shannon</B> (Strangford) (DUP):</Member> I welcome the many good things
in the Budget, but I want to focus on one omission. The Prime Minister
and the coalition have suggested that marriage should be recognised in
the tax system, but yet another Budget has not recognised it. Other
countries across the OECD have recognised it, but Great Britain has
not. That point has to be underlined. The Prime Minister was right to
commit to bringing us back into line with international best practice,
and the benefits of marriage to individuals, families and society are
considerable and plain to see, yet the Government have again singularly
failed to deliver.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032541000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0004.htm#13032541000003">The greater
benefits of marriage reach out beyond the family structure, leading to
stronger and more cohesive communities. The Relationships Foundation
has shown that the cost of family failure has increased to a staggering
£44 billion, which means that failed relationships across the
United Kingdom cost the taxpayer £1,470 each per 
<?notus-xml column=1390?>year. In that context, the Government should be
doing all they can to support family stability, and that is best
secured by supporting marriage. They should be encouraging and
supporting marriage and the bond of commitment, not making it harder to
marry in this country than across the rest of the OECD. Again, the
Government have failed to address that issue.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032541000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0004.htm#13032541000004">In recent
years, the Government have said repeatedly that they back recognising
marriage in the tax system, but the reality is very different. It was a
headline commitment in both the Conservative manifesto and the
coalition agreement. If that is not enough, public support for a
transferable allowance is plain. A 2012 YouGov poll showed that 70% of
people who expressed an opinion supported a tax allowance for married
couples. So why the inaction?</hs_Para>

2012, I asked the Exchequer Secretary two questions on this matter.
First, I asked whether the Government would honour their commitment to
recognise marriage in the tax system. He did not answer. Then I
asked him about implementation. Nine months later, I hope to get an
answer to that question. I want to quote what I said that
day:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13032541001174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0004.htm#13032541001174">“Recognition
of marriage in the tax system will require HMRC to make various
operational changes, particularly in the IT systems. Can he reassure us
that this preparatory work is already under way so that when the
Government bring forward legislation to recognise marriage in the tax
system there is no further delay? If he cannot do so tonight, will he
make it an urgent priority to make a statement to the House setting out
the time that will be required to change the IT systems and announce
that he has instructed that work to begin in readiness for the
introduction of the transferable allowance
legislation?”—[<I>Official Report</I>, 3 July
2012; Vol. 547, c.
880.]</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13032541000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0004.htm#13032541000006">This
issue is even more pressing today because, unlike the last Budget, this
Budget is quite possibly the last opportunity the Government will have
to introduce the necessary Budget resolution if transferable allowances
are to be up and running by the next election. If they take more than
12 months and the Government wait until the 2014 Budget, that means
there will almost certainly be no transferable allowance in place at
the next election. That would be tragic. I very much hope that the
Minister will be good enough to answer the question today and explain
either that the process will take significantly less than 12 months, so
that the system can be introduced at the Budget and fully implemented
within the time frame of the coalition agreement—that is, before
May 2015—or that the Government will amend the Finance Bill so
that the IT changes can start now.</hs_Para>

no doubt that last week’s Budget certainly lived down to the low
expectations that were billed for it. This was a Budget for lower wages
and downgraded credit ratings; a Budget for lower confidence but higher
debt; a Budget for poorer productivity, low growth or no growth at all
in the economy. The Chancellor has 
<?notus-xml column=1391?>been forced by his own failure to extinguish his deficit reduction plan,
but keeps on whistling in the wind to convince his Back
Benchers—perhaps even to convince himself—that he is
sticking with it. This Government—or at least the largest part
of this Government—were elected promising painful decisions in
the short term, but said it would all be worth it in the end. As my
right hon. Friends the Members for Neath (Mr Hain) and for Oldham West
and Royton (Mr Meacher) said, although there has been pain for
some—especially the most vulnerable in society—three
years on, Britain has not advanced one
jot.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032541000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0004.htm#13032541000010">The
economy has flatlined, the country’s debts are mounting and now
even the Office for Budget Responsibility says that deficit reduction
has “stalled”. So much for the Chancellor’s plan
A. After three years of austerity, stagnation and ever higher national
debt, where has it left Britain? The triple A credit rating has been
humiliatingly downgraded. The OBR says that this Budget will reduce,
not increase, the prospects for growth this year, and all the time the
Chancellor’s borrowing plans are being revised
upwards, now reaching an astronomical £245 billion higher than
forecast.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032541000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0004.htm#13032541000011">When
the Chief Secretary to the Treasury replies, he will pretend that this
is a Budget to build an aspiration nation, but it is just more of the
same failed plan from a desperation Chancellor, presiding over a
stagnation nation. As a result of his failure, the UK economy has grown
by just 0.7%, compared with the 5.3% forecast at the time of the 2010
spending review. Now the failed plan of this failing Chancellor stands
squarely in the path of progress, holding back the economy, making the
situation far worse and digging us even deeper into the mire. As my
right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)
said, Britain now faces the real prospect of a lost decade of economic
decline, with confidence sapped and businesses retreating from
investment in the productivity we need to keep pace with our
competitors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032541000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0004.htm#13032541000012">Yet
after four days of debate on this Budget, those on the Government
Benches are still in denial, while mystery surrounds some of the
details of the Treasury’s accounts and the measures announced.
As my hon. Friends the Members for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg) and
for East Lothian (Fiona O’Donnell) said, we know that the
Government plan a bedroom tax on some of the least well-off in the
country, starting next week, which contrasts with their plans to offer
subsidised mortgages, potentially to those who want to buy a second or
third property for themselves—the spare-homes subsidy, as
Ministers might like to characterise it. Under this Government, it
seems that there is one rule for the rich, but only one room for the
poor. Despite all the other competing priorities for tax and deficit
reduction, the Chancellor has failed to propose any change to the
obscene timing of the millionaires’ tax cut—a cut in
income tax for the richest 1%, which will we vote against
this evening.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032541000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0004.htm#13032541000013">When the
Chief Secretary stands to speak, I am sure he will trumpet the changes
to the personal allowance—it is what the Liberals believe they
have achieved in their short period of collaboration. Before the right
hon. Gentleman gets too excited with his achievement, let us take a
look at it for a moment. The changes to direct 
<?notus-xml column=1392?>taxes and benefits, including cuts to tax credits and child benefit,
mean that the typical family will be £600 a year worse off by
the next election—and that is before we include the hike in VAT
to 20%, the cuts to maternity pay or the education maintenance
allowance, or the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast of lower
wages by the time of the next election. Those tax rises and cuts more
than offset what the Government are promising in several years’
time on child care or changes to the personal allowance. Even the 1p
taken off a pint of beer sinks without trace compared with the 5p the
right hon. Gentleman has added through VAT.</hs_Para>

right hon. Gentleman gets to his feet, perhaps he will explain to the
House what sort of an achievement he thinks it is for him and his
Liberal Democrat colleagues to prop up the failed plan of this failing
Chancellor, which lightens the load for the typical millionaire by
£100,000 while making life tougher for ordinary families up and
down the country. Perhaps he will explain why there is no return yet of
the 10p starting rate of tax to help millions of low and middle-income
families, as we had hoped, and no sign of a mansion tax to pay for it,
as the right hon. Gentleman’s Liberal colleagues had promised.
<I>[Interruption.] </I>Will he tell hon. Members why there is no bank
bonus tax to fund a jobs guarantee for young people out of work?

missing out on the chance to repeat the bank bonus tax, the Chancellor
has gone soft on the bank levy. The banks paid £900 million less
this year than the Chancellor said they would, on top of
the £700 million less than they should have paid in the
bank levy in the year before. Never mind the Chancellor; I would like
to ask the Chief Secretary to explain his own support and that
of his Liberal colleagues for the squalid plan to give away company
shares to workers who sign away their employment rights, which even
several former Tory Ministers, including Lord Lawson, could not

around reducing the national debt, yet it has risen by 38% on his
watch. We know that his woeful performance, placing the UK in the
relegation zone of G20 nations on economic growth, has unsurprisingly
torn his deficit reduction promises to shreds. We know, too,
that the Office for Budget Responsibility says that borrowing this year
will be the same as last year and the same next
year—“stalled” is the word it uses. Frankly, there

us for a moment just pause and reflect on the Chancellor’s
overriding political desperation to prove that the deficit is still
falling. This incredibly coincidental, manufactured figure of
£100 million is the sum total of deficit reduction he has
sweated buckets to achieve from last year to this. This is not a
deficit reduction of 1%; it is not even one tenth of 1%. At that rate,
it will take more than 1,000 years to clear the deficit and balance 
<?notus-xml column=1393?>the books. That is not a deficit reduction plan; it is a millennium
goal. A deficit reduction from £121 billion to £120.9

Chancellor’s embarrassment demands that the whole of the Budget
should revolve around that one desperate political fig leaf. Everything
has been sacrificed in the failing Chancellor’s drive to spare
his blushes. There has been the last-minute dash for £11 billion
of in-year cuts in health, education, transport and local services in
recent weeks—all in time for midnight next
Sunday—including the axing of at least 800 nursing posts from
the NHS so far this month. There has been the invention of what the
Chancellor called “exceptional inter-period flexibility”
to push at least £1.6 billion of this year’s spending
into next year’s accounts. There has been the reclassification
of the UK’s contribution to the European Investment Bank in the
accounts, which helpfully takes £1.3 billion out of the spending

which we announced in this Budget, will not only send a clear message
that Britain is open for business, but will increase the return on
those businesses’ investments and incentivise economic growth.

offensive. We know that for a stronger, more balanced economy, we need
growth across different sectors, and we need growth up and down the

investment in Bristol before the Budget; it is why we are supporting

taking from the rich and giving to the poor, but everyone who was

For this purpose, section 24A(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007

years before the tax year 2013-14 as
if—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) in paragraphs

our local economy. Six hundred and fifty people work there. These are
good jobs that pay well, and in which people learn great skills. This

companies that make a huge contribution to our employment, tax revenues

climate policy are having a particular impact on industrial energy
prices: tax, carbon prices and renewable subsidies. Of course, those
apply in other European countries, but the United Kingdom Government
have not listened to the calls from energy-intensive industries in the
UK for help of the kind that the German and French Governments give
their industries. That has two effects. First, it makes it very
difficult for our companies to compete now, and secondly, when it comes
to investment decisions and securing the long-term future of these
industries, the global companies of which they are part are
increasingly opting to move elsewhere. Morgan Ceramics, for example,
tells me that it recently moved 300 jobs from the UK to
France.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303265000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0005.htm#1303265000201">We
have an urgent problem. Climate policies have added about 21% to
current electricity prices, and the Energy Intensive Users Group
estimates that the figure will rise to 58% by 2020. New extra
climate-related taxes are likely to exceed current profits for many of
our energy-intensive companies within the next few years, which means
that their viability is in question in the medium term. Let me give two
figures that illustrate the problem. The wholesale price of electricity
in Germany in 2014 is forecast to be €40 per MWh, while the
price in the UK is forecast to be €60 per MWh—and that is
before taxes have been taken into account. That should be contrasted
with the help that is being offered by Governments. The UK Government
have provided a £250 million mitigation package to protect
industry from the cost of the carbon prices floor and the EU emissions
trading scheme. Of course, that mitigation is welcome, but the German
Government are offering €5 billion in energy tax rebates
to their energy-intensive industries, so we can immediately see that
the concerns about a level playing field are very
real.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303265000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0005.htm#1303265000202"><Member ContinuationText="Nic Dakin" PimsId="5672" UID="1303265000294" xid="1143" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/debtext/130325-0005.htm#1303265000294"><B>Nic

(Gregory Barker):</Member></B> I congratulate the hon. Member for Corby

been an invitation from his distinguished predecessor but it fell with
the by-election. I would be happy to visit Corby, not least as the
Minister with responsibility in the Department of Energy and Climate
Change, but also, wearing my other hat in government, as the Minister
for business engagement with India. I am a huge admirer of the
extraordinary achievements of the Tata group. I regularly meet its
people, from both the steel part and the other parts of the company,

debate, not least because our energy-intensive industries make an
important contribution to the UK economy and it is vital to keep them
competitive. 
<?notus-xml column=1444?>These industries are also vital to regional economies, particularly
because, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, not only do they support
jobs—good, well-paying, satisfying jobs that people can build
careers on—but their products are important in the transition to
a low-carbon economy. Some people might think it strange that, as the
Minister with responsibility for tackling climate change, I have made a
point of making the case for recognising the contribution that
energy-intensive industries make to our economy and urging that they
get special treatment, but I see no contradiction in that at all. I
have made it clear since coming into this job in 2010 that we take the
challenge of decarbonising the economy very seriously and are
determined to deliver our commitments, in line with the Climate Change
Act 2008, which was passed under the previous Government. However, we
are equally clear that decarbonisation must not mean
de-industrialisation. On the contrary, if we are going to build the
low-carbon infrastructure—the renewable energy
assets—that we need in the UK, we will need to bring forth a new
age of engineering. There are huge opportunities, in not only steel,
but a range of sectors that are necessarily energy-intensive. There are
huge opportunities to become more energy-efficient, to drive innovation
and to become more competitive, but these industries cannot subvert the
laws of physics. There is only so much that many of them can
do.</hs_Para>

when I first came into the job that those industries were not suffering
in quite the way they suggested and that the playing field with Europe
was not so uneven, but I was continually lobbied by a number of
industries, not least the ceramics industry, which does a very good
job, and decided that I would only get to the bottom of it if I went to
Germany myself. It is no coincidence that Germany, which over the past
decade has seen a massive increase in its share of the global market
for manufactured goods, particularly those from advanced manufacturing,
saw at the same time a massive deployment—probably the largest
single deployment in Europe—of renewable energy. The two have
gone neatly hand in hand, and Germany has managed much more effectively
than we have to ensure a better balance of policy, supporting the
deployment of renewables with the necessary subsidy to drive those
nascent industries to cost competitiveness with their fossil fuel
equivalents while being sufficiently differentiating in its approach to
protect energy-intensive industries.</hs_Para>

fundamental difference, however. In Germany, as I found out, the burden
of policy falls overwhelmingly on the consumer, not on industry. The
balance is completely different from that in the UK. The hon. Gentleman
rightly pointed out that €5 billion supports the
energy-intensive industries in Germany, but replicating that model in
full here would entail a considerable rise in consumer bills and I am
sure that he would not advocate that.</hs_Para>

constrained, particularly in light of the deficit we inherited and the
absolute imperative of bringing down the national debt, but we are
determined to be as flexible as possible. That is why when I came back
from Germany—I went there with a number of major
energy-intensive companies, visited the plants and spoke to German
policy makers—I lobbied hard within Government to make the case
for greater differentiation for the energy-intensives. That, along with
the efforts of other colleagues, resulted in the £250 million
package.</hs_Para>

coalition Government who understand the imperative of supporting
appropriately our energy-intensive industries, but I do not pretend
that £250 million is the last word or is even enough in the
longer term. The fact is that if we are to support our energy-intensive
industries and watch those manufacturers grow, they will require more
support. I have made it very clear that the £250
million is the first step in a longer term programme of support
recognising the need for greater fiscal differentiation, but it must be
aligned with our deficit reduction programme.</hs_Para>

I can reassure him that we will shortly announce the outcome of the
BIS-led consultation on the £250 million package. That will

was seeking. We must also still obtain state-aid clearance from the EU
for the carbon floor price consultation. In addition to that and the EU
emissions trading scheme, we are seeking permission from the EU to
begin to put the building blocks in place for a more German-style
approach to the architecture. Following the consultation with
stakeholders, which closed in December, we have been analysing
responses to ensure that compensation is targeted at those industries
that are most at risk of carbon leakage, subject to final state-aid
approval. As I have said, we will publish those results shortly. As set

<?notus-xml column=1447?>to remember that many of the exemptions applied to those industries have
distributional impacts. If industry does not pay them, other
electricity consumers need to pay more. As the Minister responsible for
fuel poverty, I have to bear in mind those distributional impacts and
fairness for those who pick up the bill.</hs_Para>

something briefly about gas security, which is topical, particularly
given what has appeared in the newspapers over the weekend and the cold
snap that we are suffering? We are aware of industry concerns about
current high gas prices and low storage stocks, but while high prices
in a spike are uncomfortable, they are a sign that our market is
working and that we are attracting the gas that we need through a
diverse range of infrastructure. Price volatility is not something that
we can completely remove, and nor should we seek to do so, from our
market. It is the key mechanism that enables our market to balance
efficiently at the lowest cost to consumers, and it incentivises
investment in new infrastructure such as storage.</hs_Para>

resilient to global events, and has spare import capacity built in.
However, we take gas security and the risk of harmful gas spikes
seriously, and we are  
<?notus-xml column=1448?>determined to do more. We are working with Ofgem to review our market
arrangements, to ensure that they continue to provide secure supplies
to consumers at a fair price. At the same time, we are diversifying our
energy mix to reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels, and have
put in place robust policies to cut energy demand.</hs_Para>

I very much welcome this debate on energy-intensive industries. I
commend the hon. Member for Corby on making a compelling case. He is
right to hold the Government to account on this issue, but I can assure
him that we take it absolutely seriously. We are determined to do more
within the context of the difficult economic and fiscal situation that
we inherited, but we recognise the benefits of acting now to ensure
that we maintain these industries at the same time that we build a
secure low-carbon future. Those policies are designed to deliver
efficient, low-carbon, secure and affordable energy supplies.</hs_Para>

have used the tragic death of their beloved son as a mechanism to
achieve what they hope will be a lasting and inspiring legacy. 
<?notus-xml column=380?>Oliver was just 12 years of age when he died of sudden arrhythmic death
syndrome. He excelled at sport, but his family were totally unaware of
his condition until they received the tragic news of his death in March
2011. Quite simply, Oliver could have been saved if an automatic
external defibrillator had been to hand. However, despite their utter
devastation at the loss of their child, Mark and Joanne decided to try
to prevent other parents from having to go through the same heartache
that they had, which has led them here to Westminster and

actually is. I drew out some statistics, which I will
share<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:40:00"></hs_TimeCode> with the
Chamber: some 250 people die every single day in the UK as a
consequence of sudden arrhythmic death syndrome or one of its
counterparts, and some 270 schoolchildren die in British schools from
SADS each year. The disease kills more people in Britain every year
than lung cancer, breast cancer and AIDS combined; it is an absolutely
huge issue, and it is fantastic that the OK Foundation has brought it
to our attention in Parliament, because Oliver’s story is like
that of any of the 60,000 SADS victims across the country each and
every year.</hs_Para>

is a term that is used to describe a group of medical conditions that
lead to sudden, unexpected and life-threatening instability of the
heart rhythm. It has also been commonly referred to, as it is in the
motion, as sudden adult death syndrome, but given its propensity to
strike in children, it is now often referred to simply as sudden
arrhythmic death syndrome. In the majority of cases, the unstable heart
rhythm—the arrhythmia—develops a rhythm called
ventricular fibrillation, in which the ventricles, which are the main
pumping chambers of the heart, lose all rhythm and regularity and start
beating at rates in excess of 250 beats per minute. Ventricular
fibrillation causes sudden collapse, seizure-like activity and cardiac
arrest—in other words, the total loss of heart
function—but if it is diagnosed quickly and if cardiac massage
and shock from a defibrillator are applied, normal heart rhythm and
signs of life can be restored.</hs_Para>

was like something out of an episode of “Casualty”:
someone picks up two paddles, says, “Stand
back—clear,” and applies the shock to the person through
that method. It is not like that. An AED is a small computerised unit
that talks someone through the process, so believe me, literally anyone
can use one. That will destigmatise the use of these devices for

the saddest things is turning up at someone’s house and finding
people just standing around, worried or frightened that if they attempt
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, they will cause more damage. Actually,
the training that is necessary is minimal. I therefore commend not only
the e-petition, but the words of the hon. Gentleman up to now.

have defibrillators on the outside of buildings, which was their big
cause towards the end, so that if someone collapses in the street,

cause is a genetic problem affecting the heart. I believe that targeted
expert assessment of families in which there is a high risk of
inherited cardiac disease or in which there has been a sudden
unexplained death will lead to a considerable decrease in the number of
SADS victims annually. No one is claiming that that is a panacea; it is

Rotheram:</Member></B> Again, I could not agree more. John Moores and
other universities have done fantastic work. I looked at some of the
material from the Football Association. It runs the association
football medical screening programme for youth trainees, which involves
the screening of 750 youth players. The International Olympic Committee
has recommended that all countries screen their athletes to minimise
the risk of SADS. That 
<?notus-xml column=384?>indicates the benefits of screening, so let us look at  an early
intervention strategy for at-risk groups as an initial
step<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:48:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000038">Even
in the past week, it has been pleasing to see the Football Association
and the British Heart Foundation form a £1.2 million fund to
ensure that 900 defibrillators are made available to clubs in
non-league football and the women’s super league. That is real
action that will make a real difference, but although it is encouraging
that sport has woken up to this condition and recognised what I would
term its social and moral responsibility, there is more work for the
medical profession to do and more support for the Government of this
country and our partners across the developed world to
give.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000039">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:49:32"></hs_TimeCode>
simple ECG can expose whether a patient has irregular electrical or
structural problems with their heart that can lead to SADS. Currently,
however, standard cardiovascular risk assessment screening is not as
precise as it needs to be in identifying symptoms relating to sudden
cardiac arrest, which is why the British Heart Foundation is
undertaking vital research into the genetics around SADS, on which it
hopes to publish a report shortly. In the meantime, the Government can
play a leading role in encouraging pathologists and coroners who
determine that a person has died of SADS to inform immediate family
members to ensure that they receive an ECG at the earliest possible
opportunity. The Government should also support the medical
industry’s work to improve the scientific precision of
screening. Such Government measures should form part of the proposed
new national strategy to improve heart safety and reduce preventable
deaths from sudden cardiac arrest, as set out in the
motion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000040">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:50:42"></hs_TimeCode>
hope that today’s debate and any subsequent debates will achieve
a number of things, but it is pivotal that the imperative relationship
between CPR and defibrillators is exposed: a defibrillator on its own
cannot save a life; CPR on its own has an outside chance of saving a
life, but the two together have a more than 50% chance of saving a
life. How do we know? Ask people such as Fabrice Muamba. His collapse
on a football pitch, in front of thousands of spectators at White Hart
Lane and millions watching on television, was perhaps the most graphic
illustration of SADS, and his recovery is the best example of what can
be achieved with swift and targeted
intervention.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000041">Bystanders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:59:53"></hs_TimeCode>
witness more than half the cardiac arrests that occur in public, but
not enough people have the life-saving skills to help those heart
attack victims. CPR is the first action in the chain of survival and is
crucial in the first minutes after a cardiac arrest, because it helps
keep oxygen moving around the body, including the brain, which is why
the British Heart Foundation campaign tells us to phone 999 and press
hard and fast to the beat of “Staying Alive”. It is a
simple message, which works, and we have all seen it on television. CPR
essentially buys a patient time. A defibrillator starts the heart, but
cannot be used on a still heart, so unless CPR is administered, a
defibrillator is effectively
useless.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000042">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:56:18"></hs_TimeCode>
point is crucial, and is at the heart of—forgive the
pun—why colleagues and I, in consultation with my right hon.
Friend the Member for Leigh, chose to include first aid in
today’s motion. Medical experts believe that CPR combined with a
defibrillator shock can triple the survival chances of somebody who has
suffered a cardiac arrest outside hospital. I shall repeat 
<?notus-xml column=385?>that: it can triple survival chances. That is extraordinary. CPR and a
defibrillator shock can buy paramedics time to arrive, prevent serious
brain damage and ultimately increase the chance of a full recovery. I
am not sure that there is any need for further debate. If
someone’s child or loved one had a cardiac arrest, would they
not want to triple their chance of
survival<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:53:32"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

Rotheram:</Member></B> It is an excellent point, which I will mention
later in my contribution. The hon. Lady is absolutely right. If we
persuaded the Government, Government bodies, large organisations or a
combination of people to purchase AEDs, the price would plummet because
they would order in bulk. I think they are £1,200 to
£1,500 per unit at the moment, but empirical evidence from other
countries shows that, when they are purchased in large volumes, their
price comes down to almost 40% of the original cost.</hs_Para>

I shall address directly what the Government can do to help, and it is
simple: legislation. It can be done in a controlled and progressive
manner and, in the current economic conditions, it need not cost the
earth. Legislate first in education: enshrine mandatory emergency life
skills training in the curriculum; ensure that every child who walks
out of school at 16 or 18 possesses life-saving skills, and ensure that
this Parliament, here and now, commits to having a new generation of
life savers. We have the support to do it. Will we need to come back
with another 100,000 signatures to get the Government to act? According
to a British Heart Foundation survey in 2011, 86% of school teachers
agree that such skills should be part of the curriculum, 78% of
children said that they wanted to be taught how to save
someone’s life in an emergency, and 70% of parents thought that
children should be taught emergency life skills in school. When we
place emergency life skills education in the context of my earlier
point about the relationship between CPR and defibrillators, we begin
to see just how many lives we could save daily, monthly and
yearly.</hs_Para>

Government, though the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills,
should introduce legislation such as the Canadian province of
Manitoba’s Defibrillator Public Access Act. In Canada, public
consultation and medical expertise identified the most likely places
for a person to suffer a cardiac arrest—apart from in hospital,
of course—and legislated to ensure that all those buildings,
such as gyms, football stadiums, golf courses, schools and airports,
had to have an AED fitted by January 2014.</hs_Para>

is also a financial argument: fitting AEDs could save the NHS millions
of pounds, because survivors would not need the same
degree of critical care or, potentially, aftercare.
To discredit further the myth that it would be too expensive, let us
once again put it into context: a defibrillator costs about the same as
a PC and if we put AEDs in public buildings, that cost will come down,

are. She is right in that, just as there has to be a chart that says
where the fire extinguishers or first aiders are—where someone

the envelope of affordability, we in Parliament have a duty to act. In
times of austerity, when we look for ways of saving money and reducing
the burden on the NHS, investing in screening research and equipping an
entire future generation with emergency life-saving skills that will
keep people alive, increase survival rates and reduce the demand on
hospital care is a step we should all support. Every minute that goes
by after a person has suffered a cardiac arrest reduces their survival
chances by 10%. Although CPR can keep the heart going, it is not enough
in itself. Britain should aspire to achieve survival rates such as
those in Seattle, where more than 50% of sudden cardiac arrests lead to
a full recovery. Our survival rate is currently somewhere between 2%
and

is the time to act and for Parliament to say, “Enough is

to increase, for teaching CPR

legal requirement for a defibrillator to be installed in all schools

alive to the issue and really changed my views. It has made me quite
passionate. Becoming a first responder has been the thing that I have
been most proud of in my life. I am prouder of that than getting
elected to this place. Before that, my proudest achievement was passing
my driving test on the sixth or seventh occasion. Being a first

had terrible ambulance response rates. I met the ambulance service and
it set me a challenge to do something about it, so we set up a scheme.
We have 10 volunteers. My staff in the Goole constituency office have
all been trained and they provide cover during the day as first
responders. In the evening, members of the community provide cover. We
have all become good friends. We are all from different walks of life
in the town. They cover evenings and I cover weekends, along with one
of my councillors, who lives just round the corner.</hs_Para>

volunteers do a fantastic job. They get no publicity for it, which
perhaps we as MPs get. They deserve all credit for the lives that they
save and the impact that they have. I have seen the impact in my short
time doing such work. We set up the scheme about six months ago. 
<?notus-xml column=388?>We never expected to be as busy in our community as we have ended up
being, having attended about 45 calls in our first four months, which

want to talk about the training to prove how easy it is. We did our
training as first responders over a weekend. It was two full days. The
training included oxygen therapy and training for the other types of
incidents that we attend. The CPR and defibrillator training took place
on the first day. We practised scenarios and it was incredibly simple
and easy. It is as simple as the hon. Gentleman said. The
defibrillators spoke to us. The first thing they say is, “Tear
open packages. Place one pad upper left.” I do not like hearing
that now. It strikes fear into me, having had to use them. They talk
people through the procedure and the training really is simple. I came
away from that training thinking to myself, “How on earth can
people not know how to do this?” It is staggering that we
require people to be trained in all kinds of other things in their work
environment. People have to learn the inside-out of all sorts of health
and safety legislation for various jobs, but we do not teach people
something as simple as starting chest compressions on somebody. As the
hon. Gentleman said in his speech, people fear that they can do more
harm than good, but if someone is in cardiac arrest, people can do no
more harm than
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:07:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000059">So,
we got our scheme up and running and we had our weekend of training. We
do ongoing training every month. We have just had a weekend at the Hull
York medical school in Hull going through various scenarios to try to
enhance our skills, but that is an add-on to the basic training. I
thought that we would not get many calls to begin with, but we were
very busy. One of the first calls that I attended was a cardiac arrest,
which, sadly, was at the furthest point of the three-mile radius that
we cover. I got there first, within about six or seven minutes. Even
though we had done all our training, I thought that six or seven
minutes would be all right. It was a pretty terrifying drive on the way
there for my first cardiac
arrest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:09:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000060">I
turned up in my first responder uniform and all of a sudden everyone
was looking at me. However, the training kicks in and straight away I
was doing chest compressions, getting the defibrillator up, getting the
oxygen going and barking instructions at people to get what was needed
from the bag. I thought, “If I can do this, anybody can.”
It was the confidence gained from that weekend of training that led to
my trying to resuscitate somebody. Unfortunately, it was not
successful. I drove away that night, got home and thought about it. It
had taken me a few minutes to get there. When I arrived, people were
already there. A neighbour had tried to start CPR, but of course that
was done through instructions over the telephone. The gentleman was not
old and I thought to myself, “If only somebody had been there to
start instantly. Why don’t we all know this?” I became
passionate about it. Most of our calls tend to be for heart attacks,
diabetics and strokes, which can end in a slightly more positive
outcome.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000061"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:09:21"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:09:18"></hs_TimeCode>The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:09:47"></hs_TimeCode>
second cardiac arrest that I attended was in a nursing home. A
responder from the neighbouring scheme and I were the first people on
the scene. On that particular occasion, nursing home staff had not
commenced CPR, for whatever reason, and I thought, “Well,
why—in nursing homes?” There are so many
calls—just on Saturday night, my phone went at 2.30 am about a
cardiac arrest 
<?notus-xml column=389?>at a nursing home in Goole—and they increasingly tend to be from
nursing homes. I thought, “Why do we not have a defibrillator in
every nursing
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:10:29"></hs_TimeCode>?” I
notice that the state of Texas passed a law in 2009 to require a
defibrillator in every nursing
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:10:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000062">The
Minister obviously cannot respond about the curriculum, although I am
sure that she will pass such comments on to the relevant Minister, but
she could do something about nursing homes. One of my requests is that
she simply requires every nursing home, at its own expense—for
heaven’s sake, most of them are private organisations—to
have on site a defibrillator, which costs less than £1,000,

live two doors away from a nursing home in my village. As a result of
reading about what we have been doing locally, the parish council is
proactively trying to get a defibrillator in the nursing home for
general community use. That is something that we can achieve simply and
without great cost to the taxpayer. The same goes for assisted living
centres or sheltered housing complexes, where we should require there
to be
defibrillators.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000064">I
have to say—playing a little to the gallery—that, since I
started first responding, I have become such an admirer of our
ambulance crews and their work. I am playing to the gallery, but of
course we are not allowed to refer to people in the Public Gallery. I
have seen how busy those guys are. They are constantly called out and
they are called out more and more, for which they do not necessarily
get credit. They are the true last emergency service: when all else
fails, the ambulance service is called on. They sometimes struggle to
respond to all the calls in our areas, and there is no doubt that we
must do something about that. Demand on our ambulance crews for service
is increasing every year, and we must follow through on that with
proper resources so that we do not end up with their taking too long to
get to a cardiac arrest or other
emergencies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:12:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000065">As

multi-faceted approach. In many ways, it has to come from the bottom
up. We need people in communities to say, “I will be trained and
I am happy to filter down that training, and I am even happy to knock
on some doors to raise some money to get defibrillators in our
communities.” A lot of parish councils have money in the bank,
so we should go to them as well. We need a bottom-up approach through
volunteers and the Olympic legacy, as the Minister says, but there is
also a role for the Government to say to nursing homes and schools,
“We want and expect you to provide a defibrillator, which is
relatively cheap,” and of course to say the same to businesses.
Is it not true corporatism to bring all three of those elements
together? As I have said, there is a role for businesses in looking

the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg), who has left the
Chamber, spoke about the print media. Although I accept that they can
have a positive role to play in promoting such issues, it is a
double-edged sword, because their coverage of bereavement is often both
intrusive and inaccurate, so we should not indulge in an orgy of
congratulation. If the Press Complaints Commission had had any teeth,
the print media would often have been condemned for the way they have
covered
bereavement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:23:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000083">I
shall cover some of the same ground as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:23:23"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Liverpool, Walton, but with perhaps a slightly different
perspective. He was right to say that as much knowledge as possible
needs to be disseminated about how to keep blood pumping, which is
basically what we are talking about, and about the use of
defibrillators. If we talk to people about being trained so that they
will be able to act if a defibrillator is available—this issue
was brought out well by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:23:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:24:06"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Brigg and Goole and by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:24:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend—the thing they are concerned about is not necessarily
being taught how to use the modern device, but whether they will be
able to recognise accurately what they are confronted with. That is
often a barrier for many people, but I say rather brutally that the
alternative to making a mistake is taking no action at all, which can
be fatal. In many cases, that is the choice that people are confronted
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:24:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000084">My
second point is about the availability of defibrillators and training
in how to use them. Yes, we need them in schools and in public
buildings, but there is also an argument, which should be debated, that
they should be available in every workplace of significant size. At the
end of the day, the powerful case that was set out by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:25:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Liverpool, Walton to address the situation hinges on
having both defibrillators available and people able to use them.
Indeed, the more defibrillators that are available in more diverse
places, the more lives will be saved.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend mentioned the availability of fire extinguishers, which is
a really good comparison; another is smoke alarms. The impact that
smoke alarms have had on detecting fires has been phenomenal. We are
now at a point where almost every household has, or should have, a
smoke alarm installed. I am not saying that every household should have
a defibrillator, but the more widespread these safety and intervention
measures are, the more effective they can
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:26:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000086">Finally,
there is an overpowering case for screening. For several years now, I
have been involved in the all-party group for cardiac arrest in the
young, which does an excellent job in campaigning for widespread
screening. Personally, I would like every young person to have the
opportunity to be screened, because regardless of whether they believe
that they might have a problem, the availability of screening would
mean that they would, wherever possible, know what happens—in
other words, 
<?notus-xml column=393?>we are talking about screening age groups that might be vulnerable to
this sort of problem. However, screening is not easy to access at the
moment. Also, where there has been a fatality or where someone has been
diagnosed as being vulnerable, there is often a genetic component, so
it is possible that other members of the family might be vulnerable as
well, but in one case in my constituency, siblings wanted to be
screened after they had tragically lost their brother, but they had to
go to great extremes and be extremely persistent to access the
screening service. That is clearly a problem that needs to be
addressed.</hs_Para>

will take just a few moments to highlight some of the excellent work
taking place in West Lancashire that is helping to save lives and to
reduce the number of deaths caused by sudden cardiac arrest. John
Marshall was an incredibly talented young footballer from Ormskirk; he
had represented England on 12 occasions and had been signed by Everton
football club. Devastatingly, John died the day before his Everton
career was due to start. John’s family—his mother
Maureen, dad John, and sister Hayley—have spent most of the last
18 years raising awareness and raising funds, so that other families do
not have to suffer the terrible loss that they
did<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:32:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000093">Thanks
to the fundraising efforts of the Marshall family, working with CRY,
free heart screenings were made available to young people at Edge Hill
university—in fact, the latest screening event took place just
10 days ago. Alison Cox of CRY has said that since John Marshall died
in 1995, more than 10,000 young people under the age of 35 have died
suddenly from undiagnosed heart conditions, yet around 9,000 of those
young people could still be alive if they had been tested for heart

now move on to the work of Sue Murrin-Bailey, the former West
Lancashire borough council mayoress. Providing defibrillators was one
of her chosen charities during her year as mayoress; she worked
tirelessly to raise funds and that work has continued since her term as
mayoress ended. At a school where Sue is a governor, a parent collapsed
with cardiac arrest: luckily an ambulance was nearby, so that parent
was saved, but the case highlighted the need for much-needed
life-saving equipment to be nearby.</hs_Para>

raised the money and purchased the equipment, Sue and the North West

appear to be planning restrictions that are delaying the installation

yellow boxes in conservation areas. Perhaps we should put a higher

Murrin-Bailey has been working with the North West ambulance service to
identify the best locations for the equipment, through hot spot mapping
to identify where the highest incidences of cardiac arrest are found
and where the equipment is most needed. Once a defibrillator is
installed, the NWAS catalogues the location on its database, which
enables the location of the defibrillator to be provided to anyone when
a 999 call is made. That information is vital when we consider that the
use of an AED within four to eight minutes of sudden cardiac arrest
increases the survival rate by 75%. All
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:35:21"></hs_TimeCode>of these things

people experiencing sudden cardiac arrest are reliant on the people

better informed public will not come about through telepathy or
osmosis. The public need help and the Department of Health is surely
the best equipped agency to lead nationally. As the Minister will
understand, up and down the country, organisations, bereaved families
and local communities have not been waiting for the Department of
Health to take the lead on SADS. People have been out there doing
something—raising money and providing equipment—but they
recognise that more action needs to be taken now, so that more deaths
can be prevented. What people want is the Department of Health to work
with them in making a difference, in saving lives and in reducing the
number of deaths caused by sudden cardiac arrest. Surely that is not
too much to ask?</hs_Para>

Members have already mentioned the British Heart Foundation’s
high-profile “Staying Alive” campaign and information
film on hands-only CPR. The House will be relieved to know, Mr Amess,
that I shall not attempt to sing it or repeat it, but that was a
successful campaign. It is reported that in November 28 lives were
saved by people who learnt how to administer CPR from the advert headed
up the footballer Vinnie Jones, or were inspired by it to take further
lessons and coaching, and I imagine that that number is even higher
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000108">I
was surprised by the UK’s record on emergency life-support
skills. A British Red Cross survey found that only 7% of people in the
UK have first aid skills, compared with 80% of people in Scandinavian
countries and a similar figure in Germany. I was surprised, because in
the area where I grew up and have always lived, there was quite a
strong tradition with the St John Ambulance, and so on, so I expected
the figures to be higher, but perhaps it is a function of the society
in which we live. That is a major omission and I hope that the Minister
takes note of
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000109">A
further survey of public support carried out by the British Heart
Foundation found that 73%—almost three quarters—of
schoolchildren wanted to learn how to resuscitate someone and give
first aid, and more than three quarters of teachers and parents agreed
that it would be a good thing to be taught in schools. I hope that the
Minister will speak with her counterparts in the Department for
Education and press for these life-saving first aid skills to be a core
part of the national curriculum, to ensure that all young people leave
school equipped with the ability to save a life. That would be really
worthwhile.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000110">We
know that time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:42:17"></hs_TimeCode>
matters when cardiac arrest occurs. For every minute that passes
following a cardiac arrest and before CPR is administered, the chances
of survival are reduced by around 10%. Although CPR can buy more time,
defibrillation is the only effect treatment for cardiac arrest caused
by ventricular fibrillation, where the heart quivers and stops pumping
blood around the body.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:42:32"></hs_TimeCode> British
Heart Foundation has found that, for every minute that passes without
defibrillation, chances of survival decrease by 14%. We have heard how
CPR can improve the chances of survival. We have also heard about
research that shows that applying a controlled shock within the first
five minutes of collapse provides the best chance of survival. It is
therefore essential that defibrillators are readily available,
particularly in places where there is higher incidence of cardiac
arrest or where it might be difficult for emergency services to arrive
quickly.</hs_Para>

Live” campaign in my region, promoting the use of defibrillators
in public places, particularly gymnasiums, where there is a greater
risk of cardiac arrest occurring both before and after strenuous
effort. I am pleased to note—we did a bit of a
survey—that all the local authority and council-run gyms in the
north-east have defibrillators and staff trained to use them. It has
been reported, however, that 80% of private gyms do not have some form

Tweets, apparently. Anyway, I got them, read them and responded. There
was a good bit of pressure, but we had already decided, because we have
a campaign group that has been battling. People power has brought this
debate here, and we had our own people power in our ambulance campaign
in the east midlands, which was resolved today—the Minister will

our area, we put forward the idea that, rather than have all our
ambulance stations closed, going down to none, we should have them kept
open and have three. We have won. All three are being kept open, as a
result of people power. The number of fully crewed ambulances with
qualified staff will remain as is, rather than being cut. I asked for
six guarantees—I put it in writing—and got the formal

the “Save Our Services” campaign, which just so happens
to include Councillor Adele Mumby and Mr Gavin Briers, community first
responders, and various others, has campaigned with me and the local
council on this matter. I said, “Look, I’ve seen some
figures that say Bassetlaw has a less than 2% survival rate. However,
in Lincolnshire, it is apparently 11%. Hang on a minute. I don’t
know who’s not been informing me about this, and I’ve not
seen these figures before, but if our survival rate is under 2%, and
Lincolnshire’s is 11%, something’s wrong.” When I
looked into it, the community first responders were clear about what is
needed: they said we need defibrillators everywhere in our community
and we need training.</hs_Para>

with some. I have heard a lot of medical jargon, but we will not be
using any of that, because I cannot follow it, and I am the MP. Many of
my constituents will have more medical knowledge than me, but some will
not be able to follow that jargon, so we will keep the campaign really
simple. It is going to be like this. Every school will have to have a
defibrillator; those that do not will get a visit from me to hold their
governors to account. I do not care who funds this: the council, the
county council or the school governors. The Lions are also raising
money. What I do care about, though, is that the defibrillator is
registered with the ambulance service, which can then do the training

available, if any shop wants me; they would regard that as good
publicity. They can have the Minister if they really want. The sticker
will tell people the defibrillator is in the shop. To me, that is a
really obvious step.</hs_Para>

I want more than that. We give a lot of money to sport. Another mate of
mine got taken ill playing football. I pulled my hamstring, and he
thought he had pulled his, but it was far worse. Luckily, we got him to
hospital, because he had a heart attack just outside it. He lived, and
he is perfectly fine now. However, that made me think, and it is part
of the motive behind the campaign. Where are the defibrillators and
trained people in all these community sports facilities? We give these
facilities money. There is the Football Foundation, which my right hon.
Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) knows well. I think it
spends £30 million a year. It should be built into the small
print that people should get defibrillators when they get the money for
their fancy new facilities.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:55:06"></hs_TimeCode> does not
matter whether it is public money, football money or lottery 
<?notus-xml column=400?>money. The Minister could be raising this issue with these bodies. The
Government are also rightly putting money into school sports. We could
use the leverage provided by money going into sport to say that
defibrillators should be part of the deal. If we do that, we will get
them without the Government having to put in lots of money; indeed, if
they follow my suggestions, they will not have to put in any
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000128">I
have two other suggestions that are also cost-free. On the planning
system, people are always asking for planning permission. We have heard
how the system can work against what we are trying to do, but, used
sensibly, it can work for us. If someone wants to get planning
permission to set up a new shop, a new factory or a new community
centre, having a defibrillator should be built into the planning
conditions; that is really simply, and it does not cost the state
anything. Yes, it will take some time to make that happen, but we can
establish the principle in council policy, and that is what we want to
achieve with our campaign in Bassetlaw. People will retrofit. They will
jump the gun.</hs_Para>

me, the Minister is a good friend of the unions, and it would be great
if the shop steward and the health and safety rep negotiated to ensure
that every workplace with such a representative—it will tend to
be the bigger workplaces—has a defibrillator. Indeed, it might
be more than one if we are talking about some of the big workplaces in
my area, which employ 1,000 to 2,000 people. There might be
plenty of trained people throughout the work force who know what to do.
That is an easy win; it is good publicity. Those suggestions are all
cost-free for the Government.</hs_Para>

have a final suggestion. The Minister will like this, because it suits
her area, just as it suits mine. I have about 80 parish councils in my
area, and they are elected—well, allegedly, because there is
never an election in most of them. However, through the democratic
process, they are anointed as the village representatives. I shall
contact them and go to those who are reticent. Every parish councillor
should be trained up. Every parish, every village and every estate

that everybody else knows.</hs_Para>

we get our act together, we can do something significant, without it
costing the Government money. It is pure coincidence that
Bassetlaw’s campaign is happening now. We waited until we had
won our ambulance campaign. I did not want people going round saying,
“You’re only doing this because you lost your ambulance
stations.” No, the proposals are additional to the professional
staff at the ambulance stations and all their brilliance. Now that my

every minute that passes in a cardiac arrest the chance of survival
falls by 10%. CPR increases the chance of survival and prolongs the
time a person remains in a shockable condition. If a defibrillator is
used to administer a shock the survival rate increases to 50%. On
“Casualty” it looks as if CPR makes people suddenly
awaken and sit up. Of course, it does not. CPR simply keeps blood and
oxygen pumping around the body, which means that the heart can still be
shocked back into a rhythm. All the time someone is not breathing, and
their heart is not pumping, part of their body and brain is dying. CPR

she came for a meeting with an Education Minister, which, sadly was
cancelled, but can hopefully be rescheduled. One morning last year,
Samantha woke to hear her father on the telephone to the emergency
services, telling them that he thought her mum was already dead.
Samantha did not hesitate. Even though her mum felt cold to the touch,
she started CPR. Of course, CPR is very tiring and after a few minutes
she was exhausted, so she showed her father what to do and coached him
to take over, although he had never had any training. Thanks to
Samantha her mum survived and is alive today; she came to Parliament
with her daughter. She is alive because Samantha learned life-saving
skills at her swimming club. They are campaigning for all children to

I even introduced a ten-minute rule Bill to ask the Government to do

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:06:37"></hs_TimeCode>Far too many
companies and organisations are worried about the consequences of
having a defibrillator. No one has ever successfully been sued for
attempting to save someone’s life. As so many hon. Members have
said, a defibrillator cannot be used on a person unless they are in a
shockable condition. It tells the user what to do: where to put the
pads and whether a shock can be administered. Companies, businesses and
community groups should be far more worried about how they would feel
about someone dying, when if they had only invested in a defibrillator

them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000146">Will
the Minister talk to her colleagues in the Department for Education

imagine anything worse than seeing a loved one collapse, and finding
out afterwards that I could have saved them if I had known what to do.
I have, I hope, made sure that that will not happen to me; I
have become a Heartstart tutor. However, we need to give all people the
skills, confidence and tools to save lives. As a firefighter in my area

Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton. While that work has been
taking place, we have sadly seen further tragedies. Of course, we have
spoken today about the loss of Oliver in Liverpool. He was another
outstanding young sportsman whose talent was taken away from us.
Oliver’s dad, Mark, was in a similar position to my constituent:
he was not warned about the potential risks and, obviously, I am sure
he now thinks about that all the

to my constituency, we have also recently lost a very young boy. Ciaran
Geddes was seven years old, and he died in April 2012 playing football
on his own. He was a member of the Winwick junior football club, who
play in the same Warrington junior league in which my son used to play.
That brings it very close to home, and it was such a young life.
Ciaran’s mum, Marika, is now campaigning through the
Ciaran’s Cause charity, which has given 27 defibrillators to
schools across Warrington, with 10 more to be given soon. Marika says
that, with every defibrillator the charity gives, she feels that Ciaran
lives on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:14:28"></hs_TimeCode>. Three

absolutely spot on, because we see incredible activity across all four

Communities are pulling together, raising funds and donating
defibrillators to schools and sports clubs, which brings me to my main
point: leadership is now needed at national level to co-ordinate that
activity and to bring clarity to the whole situation so that the public
know where to find a defibrillator and how to use one. I hope I can
persuade the Government to work with Opposition Front Benchers on that.
There is no politics involved here; this is about saving lives where we
can and doing things to make human progress in this country. Other
countries are more focused than we have been, and because of that they

feeling is that provision is too random at the moment—it is
happening in some places and not in others—and we need clarity

clinching fact for why we should do more is that across the world,
survival rates are very variable. According to the British Heart
Foundation, in this country between 2% and 12% of people who suffer a
sudden cardiac arrest survive, which is way too low. Elsewhere, in
Seattle, as has been said, 50% of people survive, and in Japan, a
public access campaign for AEDs has resulted in an immediate increase
in rates of survival with minimum neurological impairment for
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.</hs_Para>

is absolutely clear, so what about policy? What did we do while we were
in Government? We must be honest. I am not here to say that we did
everything right, but we did something. On the back of the focus on
heart services, we introduced the national defibrillator programme in
the middle of the last decade. It made a modest amount of funds
available to purchase defibrillators to give to local organisations.
However, I think that a mistake was made. As the programme was wound
down, responsibility was passed to ambulance services.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032523000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000163">There are two
ways of looking at that. On the one hand, ambulance services have been
doing brilliant work ever since as they have taken on the
responsibility to improve communities’ capacity to respond. It
is fantastic to see representatives of the ambulance service here
today. I have certainly been impressed by what I have seen in the
north-west. The team there is working with communities across the
region to build their capacity to respond. The ambulance service has
done good work, but national focus on the issue was lost when
responsibility was passed down to the ambulance services, and we must
acknowledge
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000164">That
brings me to the crux of what I wanted to say, particularly to the
Minister. I think that, between us, we can develop a set of simple
policy calls that could make a difference and save lives. I will
identify three in particular. As hon. Members have said, there is a
compelling case for putting emergency life skills on the national
curriculum and for making time available, perhaps as part of the
personal, social, health and economic education component, to provide
training for all young people. No young person should leave school
without knowing how to provide CPR and use a defibrillator, because it
is not all about defibrillators or CPR—the two together are
important. If we train young people in those skills, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Bassetlaw said, they will go home and talk to others
about them.</hs_Para>

what the British Heart Foundation does in schools. The courses that it
delivers for young children are outstanding. It would be easy to add
such courses to the national curriculum. My children tell me all the
things that they are doing in school: the things that they are learning
to make in home economics, and the kings and queens that they know
about. It is odd that we do not ensure that every young person in this
country leaves school at 16 knowing how to save a life. What more basic
skill could we give them during their school
years?</hs_Para>

Percy:</Member></B> On the right hon. Gentleman’s attack on
kings and queens, as a former history teacher, I attach importance to
learning about them. An easy way to do what he suggests without
crowding the curriculum too much would be simply to require all PE
teachers to have the training, so that they can disseminate it as part
of PE, which is required all the way through school. It would be a
simple way to teach it without crowding the
curriculum.</hs_Para>

learn about kings and queens. Yes, it must be possible. We are talking
about a one-off course lasting a couple of hours. Surely it is possible
to find the time to deliver it. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman’s
suggestion is one way to do so. My point is that every child should
leave with a certificate to say that they have done the course, they
know how to use the skills and they are confident in using
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000168"><B><Member ContinuationText="Julie Hilling" PimsId="5581" UID="13032523000237" xid="1017" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000237">Julie
Hilling:</Member></B> A number of schools across Bolton West are
already teaching emergency life support skills and Heartstart skills
through the British Heart Foundation. They are teaching those skills in
different ways: some are using half an hour during the registration
period; some are teaching it as part of PE; some are teaching it as
part of biology. There are multiple places within the curriculum, but
the important thing is that they are taught as essential skills.
Schools can then work out where best to teach them. They can be taught
in half-hour blocks, and two hours a year is
nothing.</hs_Para>

Burnham:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right. Let schools decide, but
let us make it a clear legal requirement that they teach those skills.
That is how to make a difference: by having a population that is much
more educated in emergency first aid and CPR. The difference that it
can make is huge. The Department for Education appears to be highly
resistant; I do not know why. Surely we could link it to science or
biology. Surely there are ways to deliver that teaching that are not
irrelevant to the rest of the curriculum. That is our first request.
Can we have a clear requirement?</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton asked, is there not a
case for a screening programme, particularly for at-risk young people,
such as those who play lots of sport? I know that the UK National
Screening Committee has considered the issue, partly because I asked it
to, but still no firm recommendations have been made. Will the Minister
consider it? It could be delivered for incredibly small amounts of
resource in NHS terms; a screening test costs about £30 pounds.
It should be available to any parent who wants to make use of it,
particularly for young people who play sport every week. My son plays a
lot of sport, and I watch him play every week. I have still not had him
tested. It crosses my mind all the time that perhaps I should. It
should be an easy thing to do; it should not be hard to find. The time
has come to provide more screening.</hs_Para>

main point is to ask the Minister to give serious consideration to
setting a minimum legal requirement for the number of defibrillators in
public places. The time has come for that to be required by law. Hon.
Members have referred to fire extinguishers and smoke alarms. There
comes a point when technology allows something to be made much more
widely available in public places and buildings, and I believe that we
have reached that point with
defibrillators.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000172"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr George Howarth" PimsId="1031" UID="13032523000239" xid="290" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000239">Mr

Burnham:</Member></B> I am sure they could. That is my appeal to the
Government. I am not being prescriptive and saying that I want this,
that or the other. A compelling 
<?notus-xml column=408?>case has been made for schools because of the loss of young lives.
Shopping centres are also a possibility because of the footfall, as are
train stations, airports and so on, and workplaces, particularly where
people are under the extra pressure of carrying out intense physical
activity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032523000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032523000174">The
Government can advise on what the minimum requirement might be, but it
is important to have one. Then we would have national clarity on where
the public can expect to find a defibrillator. They would know where to
locate one, because defibrillators would be required by law.
Communities are crying out for it, and we do not have clarity at the
moment. Earlier in the debate, someone asked where we would find a
defibrillator in Parliament. I would not know. We need to start
thinking about clarity and signage. If we did so, we might be able to
have a national open register of defibrillators. It is not beyond the
wit of man to ensure through an app on a phone that people in a
situation where somebody had fallen could find out in real time, via
modern technology, where the nearest defibrillator was. An effort could
then be made to locate it as soon as possible.</hs_Para>

could be done. Lives could be saved. There is no excuse for
complacency. We are not talking about huge amounts of money. This House
could apply its mind to the issue, bring a little more focus to it and
make proportionate and sensible requirements for where defibrillators
must be located. Those locations could be publicised, and the public
could be educated about how to use them. Why are we not doing it? We
should be. I am not making a political point; I am being as critical of
our time in government as I am of the current Government. We should be
doing it. The case for action is unanswerable.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton has done us all a huge
service by requesting this debate, which is long overdue. Other
countries are way ahead  of us in putting a proper,
thought-through policy in place at every level: education, screening,
prevention, and response through public access to defibrillators. My
three requests can be given fair consideration by the Minister; if she
were to act, we would secure something momentous for the people who
have campaigned so vigorously on the issue over recent years. They know
and people outside know that it is right to make a change, and some
communities are just getting on and doing so; they are not even waiting
for Parliament to do something, and that alone should be enough to make
us think and act. If we made a commitment now, I am certain that in a
matter of years we would see those statistics improve and more lives
being saved which, at the end of the day, is the best memorial we can
give to Oliver King, Ciaron Geddes, Daniel Young and all the young

I am going to be somewhat of a fly in this otherwise rather pleasant
ointment, because I do not agree with everything said about
legislation. My view is that we do not need legislation. We already
have all manner of programmes locally. I am not denying that our system
is patchy and that some parts of the country are clearly doing a far
better job than others, but it is understandable why the previous
Government decided to put defibrillators and training down to the local
ambulance trusts: they know their communities best and they are the
people to ensure delivery, to the best of their abilities, to meet the
needs of their
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:35:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032536000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032536000005">I
usually flinch from legislation, because it can take a long time to go
through this place and because when we start to be prescriptive, we can
run into all sorts of dangers. We have accepted that different
communities have different needs, and I pay tribute to the hon. Member
for Bassetlaw for his compelling case for defibrillator training to be
rolled out through our communities, depending on the nature of the
community. For example, his constituency has a large number of parish
councils—mine does not have as many, but it matters
not—and he discussed putting pressure on and working and
campaigning with the parish councils to start installing
defibrillators. The parish councils can look at their own communities
and at what would suit the needs of those communities. He then made a
good 
<?notus-xml column=410?>point about work forces and the possibility of defibrillators in every
place with more than a certain number of employees, and that is where
the debate begins, because the difficulty with legislation lies in
whether we look at  a workplace with 50, 100 or 1,000
employees. The hon. Gentleman described how he could work with the
trade unions in his patch and in effect, as a result, roll out a
campaign of asking the work forces whether they think something is a
good idea in a particular workplace or not in another. If we begin to
prescribe, however, we will not deliver the sort of service that we
want<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:37:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032536000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032536000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andy Burnham" PimsId="2376" UID="13032536000050" xid="81" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032536000050">Andy
Burnham:</Member></B> I realise the situation is slightly unusual: the
Minister is defending the policy of the previous Government and I am
asking her to reconsider and to go further. She said that ambulance
services are best placed because they understand their communities. I
partly agree, but the problem is that ambulance services do not have
the power to insist on defibrillators going where they are most needed.
The ambulance services are not the planning authority or the owners of
the big buildings; they can only use persuasion and cannot ensure that
defibrillators go where they really need to go, where lives can be
saved. That is why legislation is necessary. If she is worried about
overly burdensome legislation, it could start with a simple requirement
to have a defibrillator publicly available in towns of, for example,
30,000 or more; it could be a modest requirement to get the ball
rolling, as other countries have

basically, there has to be a starting point. Even if the threshold is
30,000, once automatic external defibrillators are in place, they are
there for life, and we can then start to concentrate on places with
fewer than 30,000 people. We could do that for large factories or

will return to where this debate started—the subject of sudden
adult death syndrome. Starting with screening, often when there has
been a case of a sudden cardiac arrest, many people say,
“Screening will have a big impact in the future.” As the
right hon. Member for Leigh will know, the UK National Screening
Committee, an independent expert body that advises Ministers about all
aspects of screening, assesses the evidence for screening against a set
of internationally recognised criteria. No doubt that is why the right
hon. Gentleman listened to and followed its advice, which is that,
while screening has a potential to save lives, it is not a foolproof
process. The footballer Fabrice Muamba suffered cardiac arrest, and
many of us will remember what happened to him at the game. We have
heard many people describe the amazing medical assistance that he was
given—I cannot remember for how long he was unconscious, but it
was an incredibly long time—and that young man has made a
remarkable recovery. However, I am told that he had received several
screening tests throughout his career.</hs_Para>

UK NSC reviewed the evidence for screening for the most common cause of
sudden death in those under the age of 30, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
including looking at athletes and young people who participated in
sport. A number of the cases that we have heard today involved,
invariably, young men or boys who died while playing sport, notably
football. The UK NSC concluded that the evidence did not support the
introduction of screening. Sudden cardiac death is a complex condition
and is difficult to detect through screening; there is no single test
that can detect all the conditions, nor is it possible to say which
abnormalities will lead to sudden cardiac death. However, in line with
its three-yearly review policy, the UK NSC is again reviewing the
evidence. This time the review will go further than only looking at the
evidence for screening for HCM and will cover screening for the major
causes of sudden cardiac death in young people between the ages of 12
and 39. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:50:41"></hs_TimeCode>

example, placing defibrillators in Liverpool primary schools. That is,

Foundation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032536000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/halltext/130325h0001.htm#13032536000028"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:51:50"></hs_TimeCode>Ambulance
trusts have had responsibility for the provision of defibrillators
since 2005, and in my view they are best placed to know what is needed
in their local area. However, it is important to recognise that
defibrillators help only in a minority of cases. The majority of
out-of-hospital heart attacks—up to 80%—happen in the
home. Bystander CPR doubles survival rates, but it is only attempted in
20% to 30% of cases. It is clear that although defibrillators play an
important part, we have to bear in mind, as I said, that 80% of heart
attacks, if they do not happen in hospital, happen at home, and I
absolutely concede that there is a real need for an increase in the
amount of people trained in CPR, because we know that that also plays a
hugely important part in ensuring that people who have a heart attack
survive
it.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:52:52"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

excellent points have been raised in the debate. What we have seen
demonstrated during the past three hours is the clear and absolute
desire for Parliament to act. I understand that the Minister has a
difficult job. There are obstacles and challenges to overcome in
relation to cardiac arrest and SADS, including raising awareness and
overcoming people’s initial fear of helping someone who has
sustained a cardiac arrest. The hope is that this debate will have
teased out some of those

so that we push this issue to a vote, because I genuinely believe that
defibs will save thousands of lives every year. No one in their right

concept of SCE operating as a self-contained business unit has been
diluted by recent changes to the defence operating
model, in particular the centralisation of MOD corporate services.
These changes, coupled with tighter manpower controls being applied to
the agency, in common with all areas of the MOD, have meant that the
efficient and effective delivery of agency objectives is now much more
dependent on decisions taken elsewhere within the MOD. Moreover, the
SCE operating context is changing significantly. The draw down of
British Forces from Germany will see the number of SCE schools reduce,
on current numbers, to 12. Managing this transformation without
compromising educational standards, either in those schools that are
closing or those that remain, will require sound policy decisions
rooted in educational realities and informed directly by the needs of
children and service families. The continued separation of policy
making from delivery, as required by the agency constrict is therefore
no longer
helpful.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1303257000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/wmstext/130325m0001.htm#1303257000060">The

consumers more than the costs borne by the trader for the use of a
given means of payment is laid down in the Consumer Rights (Payment
Surcharges) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/3110). The guidance will indicate
the kinds of costs which the Department considers may be reflected in
any payment surcharge but it cannot change the requirements of the
regulations nor is it a substitute for them. In practice, the size and
nature of those costs will vary with the type of business concerned,
the particular means of payment and the contractual arrangements on
which the business relies to use those means. It will be for each
trader who wishes to impose payment surcharges to assess the costs it
incurs which are exclusively attributable to using a particular payment
means and to ensure that the payment surcharge does not exceed those
costs.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13032531000005" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0001.htm#13032531000005">Copyright</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13032531000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0001.htm#13032531000016"><B><Member PimsId="4684" UID="13032531000053" xid="667" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0001.htm#13032531000053">Mr

billion on reducing the risk from flooding and coastal erosion over the

available towards any worthwhile flood and coastal erosion risk

Benyon:</Member></B> The water industry regulator, Ofwat, does not hold
data by local authority area but by water company. Prior to
privatisation in 1989 customers were billed by regional state-owned
water boards and since privatisation the regulator has set price limits
for water companies. Every five years Ofwat sets price limits for the
water and sewerage companies. This is the amount they are able to
charge customers and this process is 
<?notus-xml column=899?>known as a Price Review. At Price Review, Ofwat sets a five-year price
cap to which the rate of inflation is added annually. All companies
have a charges scheme, which must be approved by Ofwat on an annual
basis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032532000522" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0001.htm#13032532000522">Prices
reflect the amount of revenue each company must collect from its
customers in order to maintain high quality water services and the need
to finance day-to-day activities and to invest in the necessary
infrastructure. These costs differ from region to region. At a

depend on whether a customer is metered or
unmetered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032532000523" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0001.htm#13032532000523">The

plans to make an assessment of the provision of free community internet
access points across the UK. The Government's broadband policies and
programmes are focused on ensuring that as many people as possible have
access to broadband where they live. Our broadband programme is aiming
to ensure that 90% of the population has access to superfast broadband,
with the remainder of the population having access to at least 2 Mbps
service. In addition, the recent auction of spectrum will lead to the
competitive provision of 4G mobile broadband services from the summer,
with one of the operators having an obligation in its licence to reach
at least 98% of the population. Other broadband technologies are also
available now, including fixed wireless and satellite which is capable
of serving almost 100% of UK premises. Furthermore, the Universal
Offers initiative launched in January this year by the Society of Chief
Librarians (SCL) commented that most public libraries provide digital
access for the community and have done so for some time.</hs_Para>

the Children and Young People's Health Outcomes Forum recommended in
its report published last year that a survey be developed to support
measurement of outcomes for children and young people with mental
health problems. In “Improving Children and Young
People’s Health Outcomes: a system wide response”,
published in February 2013, we said that the Department would be
working with partners to develop a programme of work to explore
detailed options and development costs to implement new or extend
existing data sources and measures. This programme of work will
consider surveys to look at mental health in children and young people,

options.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13032537000035" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0002.htm#13032537000035">Multiple

have been produced based on information held from two administrative
sources; these are the Gemserv database on the location of electricity
meters, and data from xoserve and independent gas transporters on the
location of gas meters. Subtracting the number of gas meters from the
number of electricity meters produces a broad estimate of the number of
off grid properties. However some households can have more than one
electricity meter associated with their property (for instance, a
supply for communal facilities such as-stairwell lighting or a lift).
Additionally, the standard gas industry definition of domestic use uses
a consumption threshold, with any consumer using less than 73,200 kWh
of gas per year being classed as a domestic user; it is estimated
that—Great Britain wide—this definition allocates around
2 million small business users as domestic. Furthermore a small number
of meters (less than one third of 1%) do not have sufficient
information associated with them to be able to allocate them to a
specific area. The underlying data on the number of gas and electricity
meters in each local authority is available on the Department’s

Offenders who are claiming benefits often start and stop claiming
benefits a number of times, which results in the deduction from
benefits order ceasing and needing to be re-applied for when the

in the prison system. It is crucial that they are assured that any
privileges earned in prison are gained through hard work and
appropriate behaviour. I am therefore looking closely at the policy
around the incentives scheme for prisoners as I want to be clear that
these incentives and privileges, including access to in cell
television, are pitched at the right level and that they have
credibility with the public. The outcome of the review will be
announced in due
course.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032543000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0003.htm#13032543000185">Under
the current system, access to in cell television is available as a key
earnable privilege under the incentives and earned privileges (IEP)
scheme in all establishments across England and Wales. Prison Service
Instruction 11/2011 refers, a copy of which is available in the House
of Commons Library. The IEP scheme must consist of at least three tiers
(basic, standard and enhanced). Access to in-cell television is
restricted to prisoners who have earned standard or enhanced level, is
a forfeitable privilege, and prisoners are charged for use. The
provision of in-cell television is self-financing from the rental
payments made by
prisoners.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13032543000015" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0003.htm#13032543000015">Probation</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13032543000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0003.htm#13032543000186"><B><Member PimsId="5618" UID="13032543000793" xid="1153" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0003.htm#13032543000793">Priti

Hurd:</Member></B> Although we recognise that these are tough times for
the charitable sector, the Government is taking a range of steps to
strengthen the sector. These include the £600 million Big
Society Capital and the £20 million Investment and Contract
Readiness Fund. We are also helping, ambitious voluntary and community
organisations to access the capital they need to expand their services.
Our £10 million Innovation in Giving Fund provides funding to
support ideas that have the potential to create a step change in giving
and the £20 million Social Action Fund supports the development
of proven models of social action. Following Lord Hodgson's report
Unshackling Good Neighbours we are addressing the burden of regulation
that hampers charities and the recently announced Charitable
Incorporated Organisation will introduce a new simple legal structure
designed solely for
charities.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1303263000006" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0003.htm#1303263000006">Electronic

Efficiency Report. The strategy sets out how government will redesign
its digital services to make them straightforward and convenient so
that all those who can use them prefer to do so. During the financial
year 2012-13 GDS has saved at least £36 million by
closing Directgov and BusinessLink and bringing Government services and
information together under a single domain GOV.UK. Further estimated
annual savings of at least £50 million are expected from the
migration of departmental websites to GOV.UK. And in the first six
months of this fiscal year GDS has enabled cross Government savings of
at least £400 million by helping Government become a
commissioner of IT instead of a buyer of IT. All of these changes could
have been made by the last

that the number of civil servants in Central London is higher than it

programme of estate rationalisation across Central London in order to
reduce the cost of offices and to make savings for the UK taxpayer. The

clearly states when the explicit consent of the devolved legislatures

should be consulted. Cabinet Office guidance also emphasises the
importance of engaging with the devolved Administrations during policy
development. Similarly, for the ongoing programme of triennial reviews
of non-departmental public bodies, we are engaging with devolved

malaria deaths in at least 10 high burden countries between 2010 and

interventions the Department for International Development (DFID)
directly supports the Affordable Medicines Facility for malaria (AMFm).
The majority of those in the most-at-risk groups, including the poor,
access their anti-malarial treatment from the private sector. AMFm
responds to this by ensuring that high-quality, effective anti-malarial
drugs in the private sector are subsidised to make them affordable to
these most-at-risk
groups.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303263000257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0004.htm#1303263000257">DFID's

that particular concerns have been raised about the way the work
capability assessment (WCA) works for people with mental health
conditions, Professor Harrington asked leading charities Mind, Mencap
and the National Autistic Society to make recommendations to refine the
mental, intellectual and cognitive descriptors used in the WCA as part
of his second independent
review.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303263000827" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0004.htm#1303263000827">Professor
Harrington agreed with us that further evidence was required to
establish whether the charities' proposed descriptors would make the
assessment fairer or more accurate, and recommended a 'gold standard'
review. As such the Department has committed to conducting a systematic
evidence based review (EBR) of the existing and proposed WCA activities
and descriptors in order to make the WCA fairer and more
accurate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303263000828" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0004.htm#1303263000828">Since
summer 2012, DWP has worked extensively with the charities to ensure
there is a single assessment that combines recommendations from the
mental functioning and fluctuating conditions groups and that the
descriptors are suitable for testing. We also have a steering group in
place, chaired by Professor Harrington to oversee the review. We expect
the testing of the alternative assessment to be in spring 2013 with a
final report to be published later in the
year.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1303263000039" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130325/text/130325w0004.htm#1303263000039">Social
