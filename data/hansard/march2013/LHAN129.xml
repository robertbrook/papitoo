Answer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:08:26"></hs_TimeCode>. When
added to the tremendous boost to home ownership that the Chancellor
announced in the Budget today, it will be widely welcomed.
However, does she share my concern that recent research has shown that
the average age of a first-time buyer in the United Kingdom
is now 35 compared with 28 10 years ago and 24 in
the 1960s? Does she agree that there are immense social as well as
economic benefits to home ownership? Will she ensure that there is no

noble friend on managing to put down this Question on the day when
there have been such helpful announcements in the Budget about home
ownership. I agree with what he said about the difficulty for younger
buyers in the market. I also agree that the aspiration of home
ownership is extremely high and that is why I am particularly delighted
that the Chancellor announced the £3.5 billion housing package,
which includes an equity mortgage scheme, Help to Buy, as well as
important changes to the right-to-buy scheme, all of which will help
not only those mentioned by my noble friend but others in

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, we have had a couple of debates in this
House on the essential nature of getting proper housing for older
people. I agree with the noble Lord that that would be helpful. It is
up to local authorities to make their own plans and strategic decisions
about the property that they need, which will of course include that
which is necessary for older people so that they can either downsize
and use their homes or have new build for

Maddock:</Member></B> My Lords, I am sure that my noble friend is aware
that the various housing benefit changes are affecting the income
forecasts for many social landlords. As a result, some social landlords
are finding it difficult to borrow against those forecasts for new
social housing. Can my noble friend tell me how the Government are
responding to this, given that we have made a commitment to build more
social homes for rent? Can she also say whether any of the
announcements made in the Budget today will assist in this
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:11:14"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, the announcement supporting privately
developed housing will certainly assist. We are also very supportive of
housing for rent and we have invested in it quite heavily over the past
months and years. There is a complete recognition that housing for rent
is essential. There is £10 billion of support for the delivery
of new private rented housing as well as a further grant of £300
million for affordable housing. The Government are moving as far as
they can to invest in the areas mentioned by the noble

thing in relation to this question is to get new housing moving? As I
understand it, my noble friend said 170,000 was the figure in the
current year. On top of that, we have two incentives from the
Budget—the equity loan and the mortgage guarantee—plus
the right-to-buy provisions. Does that not all suggest that, whereas
the previous Government had the princely total of 113,670 new houses

friend knows, on providing new housing. The initiatives which have
already been taken by the Government for first-time buyers give support
for that. The NewBuy Guarantee, which gives access to 95% mortgages for
new-build homes, FirstBuy equity loans, the right to buy, and the Bank
of England’s Funding for Lending scheme all indicate that this
Government are very supportive of housing and recognise that it helps
not only people get their homes but helps the construction industry,
which is necessary to get
growth.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_20_PT_1/25A6954420096C492DAAA7C403204659D9FCF6A3" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 March 2013">Wednesday,

impact assessment, including analyses of the economic and carbon
consequences, for any regulation that affects the private sector or
civil society, or significantly affects public services. The Government
published the draft communications data Bill in June 2012 and it has

e-mail with an attachment can cost about 4 grams of carbon for each
e-mail? If you scale that up for the amount of data that the Government
are asking to be retained over the next few years, the cost runs into
the tens or hundreds of millions of pounds for each piece of
legislation we pass. This also causes a massive problem in the amount
of electricity that is needed in data centres. Considering that the
country is facing an energy shortage, do the Government not agree that
perhaps an impact assessment in respect of the data that are required

interception, which is governed by a separate set of rules. Although we

seems that the electricity cost is greater than that of some small

Nevertheless, because there has been a delay, can the Minister assure
the House that the pay uplift will be made available on time in April,

Rosser:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government have made as nifty a
U-turn as a London taxicab on implementing the X-factor supplement
recommendation. Yet the contract for the chairman of the Armed Forces
Pay Review Body, Alasdair Smith, is not being renewed. He said that,
because of the late decision and the time needed to make another
appointment, his successor will miss the first half of the
year’s programme of work, including all the visits to members of
the Armed Forces that are a hugely important part of the role. That
statement indicates that this was a sudden decision by the Government,
made following receipt of the pay review body’s recommendations
at the end of January, since just over two weeks later Alasdair Smith
was told that he would be finishing at the end of this month. In view
of their hasty U-turn, will the Government now offer Professor Smith a
further term as chairman? After all, he will have the confidence of
members of the Armed Forces since he upheld the independence of the pay
review body—or is that the

the increase to X-factor. The Prime Minister’s decision not to
extend Professor Smith’s appointment represents broader

1970 and is paid as an addition to base pay. It is paid to reflect the
relative disadvantage between the conditions of service experienced by

Hill of Oareford:</Member></B> My Lords, there are two separate issues.
One is the need for emergency legislation, the other is to do with the
timing of the Easter Recess. I know that there is a lot of strong
feeling in the House about the timing of that. I recognise that. A
number of noble Lords have made that case to me directly. In these
circumstances, the usual channels, just as was the case when the noble
Baroness, Lady Royall, was Leader of the House and, before that, Chief
Whip, do their best to give the House notice and to order the business
in such a way that we can land things when we aim to. We do not always
succeed. We do our best, and in doing so we have to strike a balance
between the business before us and the costs—the best part of
£500,000—of this House sitting for a week.</hs_para>

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, I have always been a strong supporter of
employees owning shares in the companies that they work for,
particularly smaller companies. In my own history, virtually everyone
had shares in the company that I built up in the 1980s and 1990s.
Obviously, the principle is observable in groups like John Lewis. It is
self-evidently very positive, not just commercially but when people
feel part of the business for which they are

is being blind if they do not perceive that employment law has strayed
across the boundary of discouraging employment. There are good reasons
for much employee protection, a cause that has been fought for over
almost 200 years. However, we are now in an area where—dare I
say?—there would not have been just 1 million new jobs created
over the past year; if employment law was not so discouraging of taking
on new people, there might have been 2 million new jobs. Again, in my
own history I have seen too often how people are put off by the costs
and risks involved. This House is slightly out of touch if it does not
perceive that employment law actually discourages us in succeeding
economically and producing more
jobs.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13032054000173" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000173">3.45

say that when the

proposed, I was somewhat sceptical. I did not quite see the logic of
tying the two together, but I am by nature a contrarian and as the
great and the good were all frightfully critical, I thought the scheme
deserved better investigation and consideration. On balance, I think it
is a perfectly 
<?notus-xml column=595?>sensible and reasonable trade off. It is obviously not suitable for
everybody; it is not going to be of any interest to individuals who,
candidly, are just working for the pay and are not involved in or
supportive of the enterprise for which they are working but, as I have
said previously, it will be of great interest to those who are
ambitious, who have confidence in their own ability and who want to
work hard and make a success of the business they are working for. Why
should they not have a worthwhile stake in that? It will also be of
interest to those who have worked for a business for a number of years
and become part of its woodwork. In both cases, the key point is that
people have the self-confidence to believe that what they contribute to
the business is that which ensures their
employment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032054000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000073"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Martin of Springburn" PimsId="5460" UID="13032054000264" xid="2012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000264"><B>Lord

who had shares in the company I built did not give up their employment
rights, albeit that at that time they were not quite as discouraging of
employing people as they are today. The point I was making was that I
believe hugely in employees owning shares in their business. On the

where I hope to encourage the Government further, albeit that it is
Budget day today. The limit of only 2,000 shares on which you do not
pay tax is too low. There is complete misthinking by the Treasury.
Without this legislation, there would be no additional tax whatever
because no one would have any more shares to pay any tax on, so it is
not a question of losing tax revenues, but of the potential for forgone
tax revenues that would not exist if the scheme did not
exist.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032054000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000077">On the
forgone bit, the issue is that if people have worthwhile
equity—£20,000 or £30,000—if they are going
to have a tax bill of £10,000 or £15,000 including
national insurance, they will not be able to afford to do it. People
will not have that sort of money lying about in the bank to pay that
sort of tax bill. To borrow money to acquire shares in a relatively
high-risk small business is not a particularly wise thing to do because
it may not succeed and you may be left with the money you have borrowed
and no asset against it. The Government ought to think again about the
tax position of shares under the employee shareholder scheme. I repeat
that I think the starting point is wrong. 
<?notus-xml column=596?>It is not a tax cost, but how much tax will be
forgone as a result of this scheme. The point is simple: unless there
is a larger amount with no tax and national insurance liability, people
will not take it up so there will be no tax revenue anyway.</hs_para>

clear. Imagine working for a smaller business, which might employ 10 to

success in this country is the number of businesses growing in new,

businesses trying to out-compete you and products coming in cheaply
from China. Not all these businesses are going to succeed. If you are
enthusiastic, you can certainly say, “I really want to make this
succeed. I would like to take advantage of this scheme. I candidly
think that my existence in this company is not about employment
protection law, but is due to my working my butt off to make a success
of it”. People will want to take advantage of it. However, if
they are going to be given a large tax bill, they will either not be

Earl of Erroll:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak only to this
amendment. We will have the debate on whether employees should give up
rights for shares when we deal with the next amendment. I restrict
myself purely to the tax issue here. It is a serious point, because I
have hit this when I have been offered share options. Because you
receive the benefit, theoretically, you are meant to pay income tax on
it in that year. You do not really have any money to pay it with
because you have not yet been paid. If you are rich, you can use these
benefits and invest in start-up companies using the SEIS: the Seed
Enterprise Investment Scheme. However, you must have some other income
against which to offset it, so taking this up is of no interest to the
average employee. They have no other outside income. They will have
nothing to pay the tax with because of the cash flow: they are being
forced to pay a tax when they have not yet received the money.

they could make tax-free gains of £50,000. This is therefore a

first point—and here my noble friend Lord Flight has not shown
his normal attention to detail—is that there can be no question
of anyone purchasing the shares. It is a condition of the scheme that
the shares are given for free. In effect, we are producing a tax-free
handout. One of my worries was how, in an unlisted company, perhaps a
start-up company, you value the shares. The employer might have a
particular view of the value of the shares, as might the employee. The
expense and difficulties involved in valuing these shares would be
considerable.</hs_para>

hope my noble friend Viscount Younger will not mind me reading out what
he says in the letter about the tax treatment of the shares:
“When an individual receives shares as part of an employment
agreement, these are usually subject to income tax in the same way as
that person’s salary”. That is correct, and it is what my
noble friend Lord Flight is trying to address. However, he goes on to
say: “In some cases income tax will be chargeable on the value
of the shares at the time that the employee receives them. However,
where certain conditions are attached to the award of shares, for
example a requirement to stay in the job for a period, or a no-sale
requirement, any income tax that would otherwise be chargeable on the
award of the shares may be reduced or removed. In such cases, income
tax would be chargeable on the shares at a later date. The precise
detail of how the tax rules will apply to an employee shareholder
depends upon the type of shares that are awarded. An employer should be
able to confirm to an employee shareholder what type of shares they
have received”.</hs_para>

muddle. Are they shares which they hold, shares that vest at a later
date, or shares that have to be sold back at a particular value? You
need to have clarity on that before you even begin to
consider the tax treatment. The normal tax treatment in employee share
schemes is that the shares given usually vest over a period of time,
and it is the point at which they vest that tax becomes payable. It is
very unclear how that would work in the context of my noble
friend’s amendment. Would the £25,000 apply when the
shares were vested, and if they are simply options, or the ability for
shares to vest subject to particular conditions, how does this offer
the employee, who is giving up employment rights, any kind of
security<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:58:19"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032054000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000089">I
entirely understand why my noble friend has tabled the

from the employee’s point of view, and the tax rules are

dead-weight cost of this amendment would be enormous, because anyone
working for a company who had no possibility of being fired would want

James of Blackheath:</Member></B> My Lords, I feel mounting concern as
a result of what I said in Committee about this clause in a discussion
on the financial assistance Act. What we have just heard makes my
original anxiety even greater. I asked the Minister at that time
whether he would give an opinion as to the application of the Act to
this clause. I think the situation has got even worse. Where there is
in effect a deal between a company and the Inland Revenue to give
somebody a tax advantage, or at least a complicit arrangement whereby
they co-operate for it, surely there is a breach of the laws that were
brought in at the time of the Guinness and Blue Arrow fraud cases and
that prohibit any company from giving financial assistance to any
employees for the purchase of its own shares. This seems to me to be
exactly what is occurring here. It is highly dangerous. We cannot have

Stewartby:</Member></B> My Lords, I will not follow in detail what my
noble friend Lord Flight said in his excellent introduction to this
debate, because he said most of what I would like to say, but much more
eloquently than I could. What comes out of this debate, despite the
various points that have not yet been cleared up, is that this is a
voluntary activity. Employee shareholders would come about only if the
shareholders wanted them to and voted for them without coercion. It is
an experimental proposal, and although I do not share the doubts that
some have about its merits I do think it is potentially a somewhat
complicated

best thing to do when you have a proposal of this kind is to test it
out. If you do not pass the legislation, you will never have a chance

suitable for high-risk, rapid-growth businesses.

would now like to speak to Amendment 49C. As noble Lords have said, we
will have a chance to debate the fuller aspects of the clause under the
next amendment. In effect, this amendment calls for up to
£25,000 of share value received by employee shareholders to be
free of income tax and national insurance contributions. I note my
noble friend’s considerable knowledge of this area from his time
shadowing Treasury Ministers and from his chairmanship of the
Enterprise Investment Scheme Association, but on this occasion his
proposals are not in tune with the underlying aims of the policy. The
employee shareholder status is not a new tax-advantaged employee share
scheme or an investment incentive, although it may be used alongside
existing reliefs in these
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:03:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:04:22"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:03:39"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:04:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032054000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000098">In
practical terms, the cost to the Exchequer of pursuing this amendment
would be prohibitive. A tax relief of that sort of magnitude would make
it necessary to attach a great many prescriptive rules to ensure that
benefits were targeted and to prevent abuse: for example, by businesses
using it as a means of transferring taxable income into employee
shareholder shares. I acknowledge that my noble friend Lord Forsyth of
Drumlean made these points rather eloquently. This would have the
effect of introducing considerable complexity to the new status,
working against our stated aim of offering a new option that is
flexible and accessible to a wide range of companies.</hs_para>

course, tax policy has a part to play in this new employment status. We
have listened carefully to concerns that the income tax position could
be a significant disincentive for some individuals. We recognise that
this could be an issue for a very few and have addressed it. It is a
long-established fact, and certainly not unique to employee
shareholders, that when a person receives shares as part of their
employment, they may be liable for income tax and national insurance
contributions on those shares. This is a consequence of the normal tax
rules and the way in which income gained from employment is taxed. We
must also remember that when an employee shareholder sells their
shares, gains from the first £50,000 of shares given to an
employee shareholder will be free from capital gains tax, which is part
of the wider aspects of the
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032054000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000100">I
informed the House that the Government were considering an option which
would allow the first £2,000 of shares to be given to employee
shareholders without incurring income tax or national insurance
liabilities. The Chancellor announced in his Budget earlier
today the decision to proceed with that option.
This means that, typically, if an employee shareholder were
to receive shares worth £2,000, no income tax or national
insurance contributions would be chargeable when they received them. If
they receive £2,500 worth of shares, any tax would be due on the

different types of shares would be treated and what this meant in tax
terms for individuals in employment. When a person agrees to become an
employee shareholder, the employer should be able to tell them what
type of shares they will receive. The types of shares an employee
shareholder receives may vary, as I think my noble friend indicated.
First, they could be non-restricted shares. These are shares awarded
without any ongoing conditions, limitations or requirements that affect
their market value. If an employee shareholder holds non-restricted
shares, they are usually in the same position as an external investor

restricted shares are shares awarded with conditions, limitations or
requirements attached that reduce their value. For example, an employee
shareholder 
<?notus-xml column=601?>may not be able to sell their shares for a certain
period or, if they leave the company, they may not be able to retain
their shares. The employer may agree to buy the shares back from the

forfeitable shares are restricted shares awarded on the basis that
within a certain period of time, or on the occurrence of certain
events, the employee shareholder may have to forfeit them and in return
will receive less than their market value. When the tax is payable on
these shares will depend on the type of shares that are offered. As my
noble friend Lord Stewartby said, this is a voluntary arrangement,
under which the individual will go into an agreement with the employer,
and the type and status of the shares will be decided with their
agreement. That will then lead, by agreement, to the point when the tax
will be
payable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032054000108" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000108"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T14:55:00"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Brinton" PimsId="5945" UID="13032054000274" xid="2149" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000274">Baroness

Perhaps I should declare an interest in that I have been given shares
in the form of restricted stock on the condition that if I left the
company or was dismissed the shares would be forfeited. Could
conditions that effectively took away people’s employment rights
be applied to restricted shares? How would that be defined? If it is

raised by my noble friend Lady Brinton. If there are too many employee
shareholders to make this work, there may indeed be no room for another
employee shareholder. I say again: the opportunity is voluntary and the
terms are to be agreed between the employer and the employee. That is
all that needs to be said. It is exactly why we are not being too
prescriptive with this system. We are providing an opportunity for
employers to take up this scheme and for employees to share in its
risks and rewards.</hs_para>

Flight:</Member></B> My noble friend Lord Forsyth makes a fair point.
If tax is to apply, it is difficult to determine how the value of the
shares in question is to be assessed, given that they may have certain
characteristics. However, I will turn that point on its head, in that
it is an argument for there being no tax bill at all because the
problem goes away if there is none. My basic point is that common sense
states that no one will be much interested in a deal whereby you give
up your employment rights for just £2,500 of equity. There
should be potential for much greater gain. Something like seven out of
10 smaller businesses in this country tend to fail as a
result of taxation being too high and the public sector too large. The
situation is not like that in Hong Kong, which is much more
successful.</hs_para>

would be of high risk for people in SMEs. I repeat my point: it is not
a question of the Government losing revenue; they will not get any
revenue under the clause as it stands because not many people will take
advantage of it. Therefore, the Government will not lose any revenue.
If they believe in the principle, which I believe in very strongly,
there has to be an attractive risk/reward ratio. To my mind, one way or
the other, that requires the value of shares on which there is no tax
charge to be more than £2,500, although my figures are
essentially for

that I think should be given a try. It has some powerful arguments in
its favour but, if it is to work, there needs to be a sensible number
of shares that is worth having and is not subject to a tax charge.
People are thinking about this in the wrong way. It is not just a
question of the principle. If you are a youngish man or woman granted,
say, just £10,000 of shares and you have to find £5,000
in order to take them up, that is a lot of money. You will not have
that sitting around in the bank; you will have to borrow it against an
asset, but a bank would 
<?notus-xml column=603?>not lend you the money because it is too high a
risk. Even if you find someone who will lend you the money,

Pannick:</Member></B> Your Lordships now come to whether Clause 27
should stand part of the Bill. As noble Lords have heard, the clause
allows for an agreement by which an employee can receive shares worth
£2,000 or more at the date of issue and then lose his or her
rights to claim unfair dismissal, statutory redundancy pay and other
employment
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:17:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

heavily criticised in the debates in Committee. There was—I put
it as moderately as I can—very little enthusiasm indeed for it
on the government Benches or on other sides of the House, with the
conspicuous exception of the noble Lord, Lord Flight, whose main
argument in defence of the clause, if I understand him correctly, is
that the deal will not be very attractive and therefore not many people
will take it
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:18:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032054000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000123">There
are four main objections to Clause 27 that the Government failed
adequately to answer in Committee. One could identify many more
objections but I will confine myself to four. The first is that the
clause is objectionable because the employment rights were
created—and have been protected by all Governments, Conservative
and Labour—precisely because of the inequality of bargaining
power between the employer and the employee. To allow these basic
employment rights to become a commodity that can be traded by agreement
frustrates the very purpose of these entitlements as essential
protections for the employee, who lacks effective bargaining
power<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:18:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032054000124" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000124">The
second objection concerns the jobseeker. Under the clause, an employer
will be able to refuse to offer employment to applicants who decline to
enter into a Clause 27 agreement. The irony, of course, is that the
worse the job market for employment, the more willing the applicant
will be to give up his or her employment rights in order to take the
job, and the worse the job market, the greater the employee’s
need for these basic protections against unfair dismissal and
redundancy.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=604?><hs_para UID="13032054000125" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000125">The application of
Clause 27 to the jobseeker is particularly indefensible because the
Government have now issued guidance, which was promised at Committee
stage but which we did not have, that makes it very clear
that a person will lose their jobseeker’s allowance if he or she
refuses to take a job offer on Clause 27 terms; that is, they will lose
basic employment rights. The guidance says that the terms and
conditions under which the job is offered are not a good reason for
refusing to apply for the job. There is a very limited exception which
refers to the financial implications of receiving the shares, to which
I will come in a few
moments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:20:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032054000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000126">The
absence of protection for the job applicant means that Clause 27 does
not simply allow for an agreement to give up employment rights. In
practice, it imposes on the jobseeker considerable pressure to take
employment on Clause 27 terms. Clause 27, read with the guidance, will
mean that the jobseeker is being made an offer which he or she cannot
refuse—an offer that they must give up their employment rights.
That is the second
objection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:21:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032054000127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000127">The
third objection to Clause 27 was explained in Committee by a number of
Peers from the government Benches—I stress, the government
Benches—who have business experience. They said that the
provision would be positively damaging to industrial harmony and would
not be used by any sensible employer. Since this is Report stage,
perhaps I may briefly report to the House what noble Lords from the
government Benches said. The noble Lord, Lord Vinson, stated
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13032054000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000160">“the

of the noble Lord, Lord Deben, in Committee at col. 294, the
Government’s approach is “mystifying”. In
Committee, at cols. 298-300, the Minister told the House that the
Government calculated that 6,000 companies would be interested in
Clause 27. The noble Lord promised the Committee that he

fourth and final objection to Clause 27 is that the employee and the
prospective employee will not be given the minimum necessary protection
to understand what they are being asked to give up. The Government have
refused to accept that statutory rights should be lost only if the
agreement is in writing and if the individual has received legal advice
on the consequences of the agreement from an independent adviser.
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:25:40"></hs_TimeCode> has
specified such conditions in Section 288 of the Trade Union and Labour
Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 in the context of a compromise
agreement to settle particular employment disputes and tribunals.
However, no such protection will apply
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032054000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032054000132">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:25:52"></hs_TimeCode>
recognise that the Government have published general advice to
employees, but that is really a poor substitute for specific advice to
employees from an independent adviser in their particular
circumstances. The need for advice is particularly important when the
value of the shares when issued may well be higher than their value
later on and when there are tax implications for the employee of
receiving the shares if they are worth more than £2,000. As I
understand it, the employee or prospective employee who enters into an
agreement to give up his employment rights for shares with, say, a
nominal value of £3,000, will get a nasty surprise when he or
she receives their next month’s pay packet. In the real world,
the jobseeker and the employee need to know the

should note that the majority of micro- and small companies do not make
large returns for their shareholders in the early
years. That

the employee currently in a firm can choose not to take part, the
applicant on jobseeker's allowance would have no such luxury—a

to go back a step to the coalition agreement’s commitment to
growth. With such a key strategy in mind to help SMEs, we should do all
that is within our power to assist them. Clause 27 would do
the opposite. If an employee has the choice between a company that
offers the usual employee benefits and another that exchanges these
rights for shares in the company, the evidence suggests that employees
would rather maintain their benefits, especially in the current
recessionary climate. That was corroborated by my own experience
speaking with employees working for high-tech SMEs who are bemused that
they would want to demotivate their staff during the very difficult
early days of a company when it is developing products and just
beginning to enter the marketplace and unlikely to be making a profit,
let alone anything that they could distribute to

gains tax mentioned in the Bill—after a company is founded,
especially during this period of low consumption and investment, it has
to find ways of motivating employees to help get the business off the
ground. It might offer flexible working hours and shares without links
to a cut in employment rights. The founders of such firms have been
offering shares without any removal of rights for years, and it works.

the use of unfair dismissal tribunals which help SMEs by placing a cap
on the costs of discrimination claims. Without the benefit of these
tribunals, the courts could become clogged with costly discrimination
suits that may drain the funds of the very businesses we are trying to
support. The clause is then doubly debilitating. It removes employment
rights that protect the employee from discrimination and at the same
time it leaves SMEs vulnerable to very expensive discrimination claims,
should an employee feel the sting of the loss of basic rights like
statutory redundancy pay and rights to training and flexible working.
The example given by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, in the previous
amendment of an employee being sent up the blind alley of having to
accept terms that mean that they would be forced into redundancy, but
the contract saying that the shares would be lost if the employee was
made redundant, absolutely exemplifies the point. I believe that a

workers, this lingering economic downturn has given them little choice

With this clause, JSA claimants will be forced into taking jobs that
sap their benefits in return for shares in the company. For those who
may already have faced not just one but multiple redundancies through
no fault of their own, that will not be attractive. I am grateful to
the Minister for his letter which sets out the exact terms here, but I
fear that it has in fact been unhelpful in that Jobcentre Plus decision
managers will now not be able to accept an applicant’s
reasonable and real fears about reductions in employee rights when
considering a continuation of JSA if the applicant has turned a job
down. Although this clause might intend to give employers a choice, it
does so at a significant cost to employees. We must avoid creating a
coercive environment for jobseekers, many of whom rely on these
benefits to enhance their skills and improve their quality of life,
lest we discourage job seeking, something the Government are trying to
do the opposite of, and encourage reliance on welfare.</hs_para>

for an employee to feel that he or she has a real stake in the success
of a company, this employee shareholder scheme will do little to
benefit the average worker. The guidance provided by the Minister fails
to invite employees to take legal advice or even employers to encourage
them to do so. It only says, “Read about the shares and what
they are and talk to the company about the type of shares”. A
company trying to offer shares is not exactly going to say,
“This is dangerous and you may well lose money”. Most
employees will not be able to afford to pay the upfront costs of income
tax and national insurance, and may not benefit at all from the capital
gains tax exemption, given the current annual individual exemption
limit of £10,600. This means that only the most senior employee
shareholders on high salaries will benefit from this new scheme, not

rights from individual workers without seeming to do so. The clause
seeks to get workers voluntarily to give up employment rights by
pretending to make them part-owners of the company. We are told that it
will be entirely voluntary to become an employee shareholder. Will it
really, when there is so much unemployment and consequently high
concerns about employment security? People will be told that it is in
their interests to become employee shareholders and that it will offer
better internal progress, possible promotion and security, so that they
do not have to worry about these old-fashioned employment rights.

which previous generations fought hard to establish. The Government
want tame workforces, where employers can hire workers—cheaply
of course—and get rid of them easily when no longer required; in
other words, disposable people. It is really surprising why this should
be regarded as modern when it takes us back about 120 years. I do not
believe that people should ever be regarded as disposable. I oppose
this clause because that is what it is all about. The possession of
shares in no way compensates for the loss of employment rights such as
the right not to be unfairly dismissed, the right to a redundancy
payment in suitable cases; the right to flexible working, and the
rights relating to constraints on the notice about maternity and
parental leave. I do not really believe that it is intended

that they could not be introduced in quite that form, so we have
Beecroft by the back door, to persuade workers voluntarily to give up

enough to give employees who have such unfortunate experiences recourse
to an employment tribunal; employment law must discourage the behaviour
from taking place at all. Likewise, redundancy payments are a modest
but important safeguard for employees, providing a minimum cushion to
support people who have lost their jobs and have family and financial
commitments. Employees acquire these rights only after two years of

affected by the requirement to give longer notice periods when
returning from parental leave. They will find it more difficult to take
up the employee shareholder status and may be indirectly discriminated
against in the recruitment process as a result, either being overlooked
by potential employers or pressured into accepting the status as a
condition of a job offer. Whatever the take-up of this new employment

eleventh month, when the charity thought it was all about to happen, he
said, “I have not signed it yet and I have just gone to see some
lawyers”. He is now trying to plead all the discriminations. I
cannot see how he can, and nor can anyone else, but the cost of
fighting that will be phenomenal. The fear of everyone, particularly
the trustees of the charity—who are terrified—is their
exposed position if he wins because the case can be proceeded against
them. That is the bit that noble Lords forget about. They live in a
dream world where we have a fair legal system, tribunals think fairly

Forsyth of Drumlean:</Member></B> My Lords, I think that this is a
positively dreadful clause. Perhaps I should declare three
interests as a former Minister of Employment, as chairman of a start-up
run by my daughter and as someone who has set up a number of businesses
in the past. I could not believe the clause when I read it. It seemed
to involve two really good things. I have much sympathy with what the
noble Earl had to say about the burdens placed on businesses and the
costs of going to an employment tribunal, but that is an argument about
the extent to which employment protection legislation should apply and
the costs associated with sorting out whether there has been an
injustice to employees.</hs_para>

share ownership is a very desirable thing up to a point. It can go too
far if your salary and your savings are tied up in the shares of the
company that is your employer but, as a general principle, giving
people a stake or encouraging people to take a stake in the business is
part of being a good and successful employer. I very much agree with
what my noble friend Lady Brinton had to say about creating
a culture in a company where people can feel part of a team and
motivated. The idea in this clause has all the trappings of something
that was thought up by someone in the bath, taking these two ideas
together and believing that they made for a great scheme. In fact, it
is damaging to both. I do not propose to reiterate the careful and
precise arguments that the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, made in moving
this amendment, which I support and which I will vote for if he chooses

important thing in all this, leaving aside the details, which the
Government have clearly not thought out, is the principle that
employment rights, although the noble Earl may feel that they go too
far, are enshrined in statute and are not negotiable. They give the
employee a position where the employer cannot ask them to give up those
rights, because they are enshrined in statute. What I find offensive
about the clause is that it does not seek to argue, as I would, that
the Government’s proposals to extend maternity leave are costly
and unnecessary. I would not go down that track. If those rights are in
place, it is essential that the employee is not put in a position where
he is under pressure from the
employer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T17:01:26"></hs_TimeCode>. The
clause is an absolute gift to the Gradgrinds of this world because they
will be able to use it to force people to give up employment rights,
which are essential, although we might differ over what their extent
should be. It is a foolish measure for that

for the practicalities of the clause, shares are not defined. I am not
going to repeat the points that I made in our debate on the previous
amendment about the difference between options, shares, shares that
vest and the tax implications of that. As a Conservative, I am very
proud of some of the employment legislation. The noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, referred to the 1992 Act, which says that in seeking
compromise agreements, advice is to be taken. Normally the employer
pays for that advice up to a certain figure, which is normally up to
£500 or £1,000. However, having to go through the whole
business of valuing shares of over £2,000 and getting advice
will at the end of the day cost more than £2,000. The valuation
of shares in unquoted companies is extremely difficult, especially in
start-ups where the employer might think that he has the next Google on
his hands and that the shares are worth considerably more than the
employee. How does one set about that valuation, and what are the
implications of
taxation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T17:02:58"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032058000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032058000022">In
his letter, my noble friend Lord Younger says, “Oh well, this is
something that would be put on the self-assessment form”. How
would you reach a view on what the value should be? If I may switch
sides for a moment, if I were an employer, why on earth would I want to
give away shares in a company to employees who I had doubts about and
thought I might want to sack? Why would I want to
give away shares, which are 
<?notus-xml column=615?>a very expensive way of raising capital or rewarding
employees, especially in a start-up, if I had doubts about
the competence of the employee? You would not want to do that. If I
were an employee in those circumstances, why would I want to take on

thing that I find extraordinary is the attitude of the Business
Secretary, who led a great media campaign when the Beecroft proposals

away the entitlement to redundancy payments. This proposal is worse

do when they have perhaps 20 or 30 former employees who they

opportunities—you do not need to be a smart accountant or lawyer

which should have been available to this House at an earlier stage and
should certainly have been available to the other place, which says
that if someone refuses to take this deal they are no longer able to
obtain jobseeker’s allowance. That is absolutely unacceptable,
and I am astonished that the coalition would even think of bringing
forward such a measure. This is a very ill thought through attack on
the employment rights of individuals that creates complexity for small

a passionate believer in—and advocate of—the stakeholding
society, the stakeholding community and, of course, the stakeholding
workplace. Applied to the workplace, the stakeholder principle can
deliver workplace harmony, increase productivity and change the
culture. I want to see all British workers benefit from the success of
their companies, but instead of a few shares that may benefit only a
few who have given up their rights, why can we not have a more
imaginative approach, for example, a profit-sharing scheme through
which everyone can benefit from the prosperity of their company while

issues around investment, research, plant and equipment, people and
education. What is needed in the workplace is good industrial
relations. Indeed, someone should tell the Chancellor that you cannot
build a world-class economy by creating first-class and second-class
workers. Under these proposals we would have two groups of workers:
workers with rights but no shares, and workers with shares but no
rights. What about those who work in the public sector: nurses,
doctors, those who sweep our streets or teach our children? Where is
their reward for good industrial relations? Where there is harmony in
the workplace, Clause 27 is guaranteed to bring

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, as I suggested in our debate on the
previous amendment, I accept that some improvements could be made to
this clause, and it is unlikely that its take-up will be substantial if
it goes ahead as it is. I also certainly agree with the principle that
it has to be voluntary. If it was the case—I am not sure that it
is, despite the advice of the noble Lord, Lord Pannick—that
people lost their jobseeker’s allowance if they did
not accept employment, I think that is wrong. But this House should

really are engaged at the SME

very interesting that nearly all those opposed to this
clause had nothing to comment on the extent to which employment law
has clearly become discouraging of employment and
has, in a sense, gone too far in the protective direction,
generating massive income for lawyers, with too many vexatious claims.
This clause is, in some senses, no more than a perhaps not totally well
thought out attempt at an experiment to see what happens and
whether we can agree, with benefits to the employee, to have much less

let me put these arguments of principle aside for a moment. The policy
is internally flawed in two key respects. First, its key rationale is
that it will promote growth by reducing employment law red tape for
companies. In fact, as the Law Society argues cogently, it will create
more red tape, not less, because it is bound to lead to costly
litigation. In particular, it will lead to a rash of claims of
discrimination because discrimination will be the only avenue for
aggrieved employees to pursue once they have no rights to redundancy

second respect in which this proposal is internally flawed is that the
Government claim—the noble Viscount repeated the claim in the
previous debate—that this is an entirely voluntary new
employment status, with no coercion on anyone to accept it. The problem
is that on any fair assessment this claim is simply not true. There is
no requirement in the Bill for employers to provide independent advice
to those being offered these shares-for-rights jobs. It is therefore
likely that individuals, particularly the more vulnerable and low paid,
will not be properly aware, if they are aware at all, of the rights
they are forgoing in return for shares worth as little as £2,000
at the time they are issued—shares that could easily be
worthless by the time they come to sell them. That is why, in
Committee, we supported amendments requiring independent advice to be
made available before individuals sign shares-for-rights contracts, but
the Government refused to accept those amendments. This being the case,
Clause 27 stands condemned by the Equality and Human Rights Commission,
which says in its advice to your
Lordships:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13032062000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032062000090">“A
failure to include effective safeguards in the proposals would make it

being told by the Government that they stand to lose their income if

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, we have discussed the
employee shareholder clause at length, and some Members of this House
in Committee questioned the merits of establishing a new employment
status. Several noble Lords raised concerns about who will use the new
status, the quality of the guidance, to whom it would apply and when it
would be available. Concerns were also raised about income tax and
jobseeker’s allowance as it applies to those who are seeking
employee shareholder status. I am grateful to noble Lords from all
sides of the House for their contribution to the debate, and I want to
take some time to address some of the main concerns about the new
status—and it is a new status. I acknowledge the
negative comments that have arisen today, but it is the
Government’s belief that there is demand for a new employment
status of employee shareholder, that it will be used, that it will
benefit employers and individuals, and that, in turn, it will help the
economy to
grow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032062000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032062000031">We
believe that the two existing employment statuses of worker and
employee do not offer enough flexibility to employers or offer real
opportunities for individuals who want to share the rewards of a
growing business. There is support for this new employment status, and
we have evidence of that from the Institute of Directors, the British
Venture Capital Association, the Federation of Small Businesses, Stuart
Rose and, at the other end of the scale, from the heads of many small
businesses, including Will Butler-Adams, the chief executive of
Brompton Bicycle Ltd, and Jamie Murray Wells from Glasses Direct. I

creating a new employment status with fewer rights than employees have
but more rights than workers have, we are providing a new contract type

their workforce. This new employment status will support this
Government’s ambition of securing a strong UK labour market
where individuals can have greater and potentially more rewarding
access to the work they want. Employers can secure the labour that they
need at the right time in order to capture new markets and sell their
products in an increasingly competitive global

balance in favour of these types of companies as they seek to attract

shares that will not be subject to capital gains tax, as we have heard
today, and it is a radically new approach to taking people
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032062000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032062000034">We should

position. Of course, the risk remains that the shares held may decrease
in value, emphasising the greater risk and reward-sharing that this
employment status represents. I think that those points on the negative

today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032062000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032062000037">I now
turn to how the new status will work. We must all remember that before
an individual can be considered to be an employee shareholder,
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of new Section 205A(1)
introduced in Clause 27 stipulate that three criteria must be
fulfilled. This means that if an individual does not agree to be an
employee shareholder, they cannot become one; it means that if an
individual does not receive at least £2,000-worth of shares,
they will not be an employee shareholder; and it means that if the
company tries to charge for the shares or does not give fully paid up
shares again, the individual will not be an employee shareholder. If
the individual signs what looks like an employee shareholder contract
without all three qualifying criteria being fulfilled and still works
for the company, that person is likely to be an employee and will be
entitled to all the employment rights associated with that
status<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T17:38:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032062000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0001.htm#13032062000038">The
new status confers more advantages than beneficial tax treatment alone.
I intend to give a much more positive picture than that given by
several noble Lords today, including my noble friend Lord Forsyth. Let
us consider what this means for the employer of an employee
shareholder. An employee shareholder is more likely to generate ideas
for growing the company and will have a greater incentive constantly to
strive to improve a product, effect a sale or streamline a system.
Because the employer knows that the employee shareholder is an owner,
the employee shareholder is more likely to be listened to. The employee
shareholder status is more likely to encourage co-operation and
cohesion between the employer and employee shareholder as their
personal goals are more
aligned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T17:39:48"></hs_TimeCode>. I

up on a number of questions. There were quite a few and I may not be
able to answer them all. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, stated that no
evidence was provided about the number of companies that might be
interested. I believe he will know that last year the Government
published an impact assessment. The background to how we came to the
figure of 6,000 businesses is that there are a large number of
businesses within the UK. In 2012 figures, it is estimated that there
are about 4.8 million, not all of which will be able to use the
employee shareholder status, as only companies can issue or allot
shares. That is essential for the employee shareholder status to
operate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T17:43:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

businesses in the UK are registered companies: that is, around 2.7
million. However, not all are estimated to have employees beyond the
self-employed owner-manager of the company or a single employee
director. This figure is probably less than 1 million. In 2010-11,
around 9,000 companies were operating any form of approved
tax-advantage share scheme in the UK. There will be more than this
operating non-tax-advantage share schemes. Our approximate estimate,
therefore, is that around 6,000 companies, as I said in Committee, may
use the employee shareholder status, although I acknowledge that it
could be more or less. Employee shareholders are a new option for
companies, which they can choose to use when it suits their
circumstances. It is not so much about whether the figure is 6,000,
4,000 or 7,000; the point is that the opportunity is there for
companies to pick this up, or not, as is their
wish.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_20_PT_1/DF6D740AB642EB13A82D354D4B4CFAA60E4CE03A" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 March 2013">Wednesday,

return to the subject of the jobseeker’s allowance. The noble
Lord, Lord Pannick, as I mentioned earlier, supported by my noble
friends Lady Brinton and Lord Forsyth, questioned whether it was
reasonable to require JSA claimants to take on an employee shareholder
role. If down the road a jobseeker was seeking a job where benefits
might be lost, it would be because they had reached the point when they
were defined as a mandated jobseeker. It would be very unlikely and
unusual, we think, for an individual to reach the point at which they
were mandated, be offered an employee shareholder job and then turn it
down. There may be one or two, but it is very unlikely.</hs_para>

explicit that the prospective employee shareholder applicant should be
treated exactly the same as any other applicant, with the one exception
of their financial resources being such that they could not pay the tax
bill right at the start. If that is the case, the argument made by the
noble Lord, Lord Pannick, myself and others is that, first, that
penalises those who are concerned about losing their rights.
Secondly—and this is the core question—is it voluntary?

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> It is indeed voluntary, but I would
like to clarify that when it comes to a jobseeker seeking a job, they
are treated in exactly the same way as other statuses. That is because
we believe it is important to move jobseekers into work as quickly as
possible, just like other statuses. Periods of unemployment, as we
know, can have a most damaging effect on individuals’ long-term
employment prospects and indeed earnings. That is why the jobseeker
allowance regime focuses on moving claimants into any work as quickly
as possible. This remains the case for the

they are offered this particular position. We think it is right that

employment status which offers a different set of rights and mandatory
share ownership. The status is not compulsory for companies to use and
it will be suitable only for those companies that want to share
ownership with their workforce. We must remember that employee
shareholders will retain the majority of employment rights, including,
for example, 
<?notus-xml column=628?>automatic unfair dismissal rights and the right to be paid the national
minimum wage. As I said earlier, we have been consistent that the new
status will not suit all people or all companies, but for those who
choose to use it, the employee shareholder status offers more

be mutually beneficial. Employee shareholders will have a greater
interest in the performance of their employer as it is linked to the
value of their shares. We consider that employee shareholders are more
likely to request flexible working if they think it will help them and
the company, and do not need the statutory right to request. Further,
employee shareholders can still make non-statutory requests for

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business,

Lords, the amendments in this group make consequential provisions on
the clause that the House agreed on royal charters and make some minor
and technical improvements. Following the Government’s
acceptance of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, earlier
this week in relation to royal charters, we have brought forward a
clause dealing with the extent of this provision. We have by that
amendment limited the extent to England and
Wales.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032062000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032062000066">The
Government have been clear that they respect the right of the Scottish
Government and Northern Ireland Executive to consider how they wish to
respond to the recommendations of the Leveson report. Only last week,
the noble and learned Lord, Lord McCluskey, presented the report of his
expert panel on how Lord Justice Leveson’s recommendations could
potentially be implemented in Scotland. The body created by the royal
charter would be capable of operating throughout the United Kingdom,
including Scotland and Northern Ireland, should the devolved
Administrations want it to. The Government have been clear that whether
it does so is a matter for discussion with the Scottish Government and
the Northern Ireland Executive. However, it is important that we
observe the boundaries between our respective powers, and it is for
this reason that the extent is limited to England and Wales. This is
because the measures, were they to have UK-wide extent, would also
prevent Scottish Ministers or Northern Ireland Ministers from
exercising their royal prerogative to make recommendations to Her
Majesty in Council in respect of these devolved matters. It is
therefore an issue that should be discussed more fully with the
devolved Administrations to allow them the opportunity to
comment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032062000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032062000067">It is

Prime Minister announced in the House of Commons on Monday, the
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and the
Advocate-General for Scotland will shortly have discussions with
Scottish Ministers. Such discussions will also be held with Ministers
of the Northern Ireland Executive. Those discussions will consider
whether the extent of the new clause should be amended to go beyond
England and Wales, during consideration of amendments in the other
place. The amendments before us also amend the Long Title of
the Bill to reflect inclusion of the new clause, and provide that the
clause will come into effect on Royal

previously—are given the same definition as in Section 92(1) of

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the
Minister for introducing these amendments. We are broadly happy with
the majority of them. I have just a couple of points concerning the
territorial issues he talked about in relation to the royal charter,
which may have eluded me. I am sure that he will be able to put me
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032062000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032062000072">As I
understand it, the royal charter will operate across the whole of the
United Kingdom but the intention of government Amendment 12 is to
restrict the effect of the entrenchment clause—which was passed
in this House on Monday—to England and Wales. However, if it is
subsequently decided that the measures should be enacted for Scotland
and Northern Ireland, what are the Government’s intentions? I
think the Minister said that he expected that these discussions would
be concluded by the time we were in receipt of any comments that the
House of Commons might want to make on the Bill. If my arithmetic is
correct, that is only three or four weeks away so we are putting rather
a tight timetable on it. In the unlikely event that these discussions

this subject. We have left the Agricultural Wages Board in a very
difficult position. The substance of the matter was carried on 7 March
and clearly the Government have the primary authority to abolish
the board. In fact, they already had because it was in the
Public Bodies Act. The difference is that the Public Bodies Act
required a stringent and enhanced system of scrutiny to be followed
before abolition could be implemented. We are now in the ludicrous
position, after a very late amendment to the Bill, in which the only
public body that is not subject to an enhanced scrutiny
process—which this House insisted, after some very difficult and
bitter debates, must apply to all public bodies—is the

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I apologise to the noble Baroness. We
almost missed this amendment as well so I quite understand the hurry.
This indicates the rigidity of our procedures because my original
intention at Third Reading, given that we got a printed copy of 
<?notus-xml column=636?>the Bill that had the Agricultural Wages Board in it only yesterday, was
to insist that an equivalent procedure be written into this Bill for
dealing with the implementation of the abolition of the Agricultural
Wages Board in the same way as that applied to every single other
public
body.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032064000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032064000002">That is
not in order for Third Reading and, obviously, I accept the advice of
clerks in these matters. I have therefore concentrated on a very narrow
area which was not fully debated last time, although we touched on it
in some detail. However, there was no amendment before us then that
required a further economic assessment from the Government of the
impact of the abolition of the Agricultural Wages
Board<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:20:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032064000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032064000003">The
fact of the matter is that there was considerable confusion at the
previous stage as to what the economic assessment was. The Government
have not produced the kind of Explanatory Memorandum that is required
under the Public Bodies Act, but there was a document called the
“economic assessment”, which went with the rather
curtailed consultation and clearly indicated that the main effect of
this Bill would be a significant reduction in the aggregate income of
agricultural workers by nearly £0.25 billion over the next 10
years. Those were the figures provided by Defra via the Minister and
the impact
assessment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:20:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032064000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032064000004">On
the day that we last debated this matter, and having queried whether
that was still the Government’s position, I received a letter
from the Minister which said, “No, no, these figures were all
got up”—I paraphrase slightly—“by the
consultants”, and that the department did not believe a word of
it. He said that the consultants had advised at the top end of the
range, whereas the Government thought that the outcome would be at the
bottom end of the range. That is not a very satisfactory position in
any circumstances and it is certainly not satisfactory when we are
abolishing a body which has existed for many years and is the only one
in this cull of the quangos which specifically tries to protect the
living standards of a group of rural
workers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:21:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032064000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032064000005">In
the debate that followed, all sorts of interpretations came on to the
agenda. I tended to agree, because I am conventional sort of person,
that what the department had told us was probably right. Therefore, I
agreed with the statisticians who were advising Defra. The Minister had
already indicated that he did not really agree with them; others of his
supporters said various different things. Some, whom one might
characterise, perhaps unfairly, as being of the landowning tendency,
said that it would be all right because they already treated their
chaps decently, which is fair enough; other people said that the
international competitiveness of English agriculture—because the
other parts of Britain do something different—was dependent on
being able to cut wages. Some of those people were the very same people
who argue rather the opposite when it comes to banking, but let us let
that pass. Others—I think that the noble Lord, Lord Cavendish,
was among
them—argued<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:22:33"></hs_TimeCode>
that agricultural wages were excessive already and were greater than
those of hotel workers. That seemed rather to prove my point, because
the wages councils in the hotel and catering industries were abolished
some years
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:22:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

it was clear that there was no compatibility between the various
interpretations of the best estimate of the outcome as compared with
the Government’s own figures and as compared with the
Minister’s position and my position. There are four or five
different interpretations. That is not good
enough<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:23:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032064000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032064000007">I
am therefore proposing a very modest amendment: the Government should
come up with a new economic assessment before they trigger the
commencement proceedings on this Bill. Surely everybody who spoke in
that debate and everybody who has an interest in this area should be in
favour of that, because we want a robust economic assessment. Whatever
we may think about the abolition of the board and whatever opinion we
may have about the need to raise, reduce or protect wages, we should
get a better economic assessment before we do it. That is
really all my amendment
proposes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:23:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

benefit for the Government: it would take a bit of time and it would be
interesting to know what timetable the Government have in mind for the
implementation of abolition. After all, discussions on this
year’s round of wages have already started and would normally be
for implementation in October. In effect, if the Government let that
round go, the Agricultural Wages Board’s underpinning of wages
would run until October 2014 at least.</hs_para>

Government need a bit of time because there are a number of issues
which do not relate to wages but are covered by the agricultural
system. One of them is the situation relating to Wales, which wants a
different outcome. The position on Wales is not resolved by the
Government’s clauses as they now stand in the Bill, so they need
a bit of time to sort out the Welsh situation. They also need to deal
with the non-wage aspects of the agricultural wages order, in
particular those aspects that deal with tied cottages for permanent
workers and those that deal with adequate accommodation for migrant and
seasonal workers. It is only the Agricultural Wages Board which
provides that migrant seasonal workers are required to have one bed
each rather than 20 of them sharing a six-berth caravan, as
was the situation prior to it being regulated by the wages board. So
those matters need sorting out. Some protection is needed in law or in
regulation once the board

am doing the Government a favour by putting forward this amendment. The

yet—we need, before the Government implement this clause, a
clear economic assessment which the House and another place can debate

agricultural wages order grade minimums. It is reasonable to conclude

current contracts will remain the same—that is, 41% above the

The latest impact assessment states that if demand remains strong
relative to supply, as evidence suggests is likely to be the case,
wages are unlikely to be eroded as farmers will need to attract
workers. The important point here is that if farmers want to attract
workers, they will have to continue to pay at least what the worker
might expect from comparable work outside farming, which is several

he was a Minister in Defra. I admire his tenacity as far as the
Agricultural Wages Board is concerned. I do not want to rehearse the
arguments we went over when discussing this issue a couple of weeks ago
but I will comment on the proposed amendment. I declare an interest as
a farmer in Northumberland but I am not a landowner. I also chair the
Better Regulation
Executive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032064000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032064000020">I
want to deal with the process of the impact assessment. The Regulatory
Policy Committee, the RPC, scrutinises all impact assessments as
submitted and scrutinised this one. It is required to present the range
of possible outcomes as a consequence of a decision such as
this—I commented on this during my speech in Committee. It has
to look at the worst-case scenario, which is that over time wages fall
to the national minimum wage. The point I made in the debate
was that that is absolutely unlikely to happen because of
the demand there is for agricultural workers. The differential in wages
that exists now, as referred to earlier, will continue and
may widen because once you remove the Agricultural Wages Board the
market will itself respond. In my view, farm employees will then be
even better

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, I took part in the earlier discussions. I
apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for missing the first of his
lambent sentences. I am concerned about what he asks for. The noble
Baroness wanted it because she felt that somehow or other this would be
a patronising view. The National Farmers’ Union is not being
patronising; all it will do is produce the figures. There is nothing
patronising in that. You cannot have a negotiation to produce the
figures. They are the figures, they will be the figures and we shall
know what they are. Rather like speeches I have heard from the noble
Baroness on this sort of subject before, she talked about a world that,
if it ever existed, has long
passed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032066000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032066000002">It is
that that concerns me about the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty. I live in the country and own some land there—not much,
but around the house in which I live—and I know the farmers
round about. I find it insulting that farmers are the only group of the
population that cannot be allowed to run their labour relations within
the general context of the national system. As a countryman, I find
great annoyance at the way in which urban people talk about farming
as if it was so alien to the normal practices of
life, so divorced from the normal issues of the
marketplace and so unconcerned with the future, comfort and family life
of its workers that it needs a special arrangement
that no one else needs and that everyone else has 
<?notus-xml column=640?>shuffled off as being part of a historic
circumstance. Yet the farmer has to be left with it and I find that
insulting. That is also an indication that the party opposite does not
understand the countryside at all, wishing to impress upon it things
that have nothing to do with our knowledge in the
countryside.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032066000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032066000003">In
the countryside today, good farmers are extremely difficult to get hold
of. They are significantly better paid than the minima produced by the
Agricultural Wages Board. No farmer worth his salt trying to compete in
the modern world is unwilling to pay a proper wage to somebody doing
what is an increasingly technical and difficult job. The Agricultural
Wages Board was set up at a time when there was a wholly different
farming structure. I admit that when I was Minister of Agriculture I
would have liked to have got rid of the Agricultural Wages
Board—even then—but since then the arguments for it have
become even less pertinent. Agriculture is not like it was even 20
years ago. It certainly is not like it was when the Agricultural Wages
Board was set up. I very much hope that the Minister will refuse to ask
for yet another
investigation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032066000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032066000004">To
end, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, very charmingly suggested that he was
helping the Government and very charmingly suggested that he was only
doing them a favour. I very charmingly suggest that he is
actually trying to put this off again. This is another mechanism within
the rules of the House to try to revisit this particular subject.
Frankly, when the Agricultural Wages Board has gone, nobody will
remember that it ever existed because life in farms will continue. We
will have rid ourselves of an unnecessary burden, an additional cost
and something that is a hangover from the past. Now, I am a great
believer in tradition. I love the traditions of this House and am very
keen on conventions of that sort but this is a tradition that we can do
without. It is not necessary. I hope that my noble friend will not give
this any shrift

the first few words spoken by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, but I know
where he was coming from. I cannot fully agree with my noble friend
Lord Deben: I think it is actually the other way round. I employ a
couple of agricultural workers and know the set-up as it now occurs up
north. Of course, that is miles away from the historical situation that
we used to have there, whereby agricultural workers had no security
whatever. They had what the Scots termed a seeking-on day. If the
farmer did not come and see you on your seeking-on day, you knew that
you were leaving. That happened every six
months.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032066000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032066000006">The
Agricultural Wages Board and other things came in and have satisfied
that element. It has also covered a great many other things. The
complaint on the other side should be that not enough agricultural
workers have joined the union because the agricultural workers will be

awkward position, if there is a farmer who employs only one employee,
that he could terminate his contract and immediately bring in something
entirely new.</hs_para>

contract, no

sacked the only worker you had, you would immediately destroy any
chance of an amicable way of working in future. Not only that, if you
had to renegotiate the contract, the other side could say,
“I’m going to get my union representative

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment of the noble
Lord, Lord Whitty, would require Ministers to publish and lay before
both Houses of Parliament an updated impact assessment of the abolition
of the Agricultural Wages Board prior to the commencement of the
provision to abolish the board. The House has already debated the
impact of the abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board at considerable
length both in Grand Committee and at Report, and has voted in favour
of
abolition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:42:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032066000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032066000009">The
best estimate of £250 million over 10 years, which includes the
potential impact on wages, sick pay and annual leave, is based on
empirical academic research, which looked at wage levels in the
past.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032066000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032066000010">As I
have made clear previously, the impact on wages, which is the largest
cost, would account for only 1% of the total agricultural wages bill
over the 10-year period. However, the impact assessment makes clear
that there is and will remain considerable uncertainty about the impact
and that in fact there may be no reduction in workers’ wages or
other benefits. That is because the reality of the impact will depend
on the behaviour of employers of farm workers and a range of other
factors, such as relative strength of supply and demand for
agricultural workers and the need to be competitive with other
employers in the same area—points made most eloquently by my
noble friends Lord Deben and the Duke of
Montrose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032066000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032066000011">Moreover,
there are a number of reasons why the impact is likely to be smaller
than that suggested by the external research. A majority of workers
already receive terms and conditions above the agricultural minimum
wage rates, so it is probable that their wages would not be affected if
the board were abolished. The underlying market conditions suggest that
there will be a sustained demand for agricultural workers. Research
indicates that there is a shortage of workers with relevant skills in
the agricultural sector, and that that shortage is higher than
comparable shortages in other areas of the economy. The agricultural
workforce is also ageing, with 55% of the sector workforce aged over
45, which, again, is higher than in other sectors of the
economy.</hs_para>

is a huge industry, with tremendous potential for growth to meet the
challenges of feeding the world’s growing population. As I said
in the debate at Report, £250 million over 10 years assumes that
every agricultural worker would see a relative fall in their wages
compared with what they would have been due. We think that that is a
highly unlikely 
<?notus-xml column=642?>scenario given the evidence of the demand for
workers—a point made most eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord
Curry. However, we deliberately decided to adopt a cautious approach in

problems with this is that Ministers collectively have ignored what the

relation to this quango. Whether we agree with its abolition or not,
the Government have ignored what was clearly laid down two years ago
after, as I said, bitter debate in this House and have not provided the
House with adequate information or time to discuss this issue, as they
have on all other quangos that they are abolishing, or else there has

enough. The Minister has said that he does not agree with it. The
assessment itself says that the estimate it contains was the best
estimate, not, as the noble Lord, Lord Curry, and the Minister have
said, the worst estimate. If we accept that Ministers have signed off

East Anglia and maybe they would not notice, but a lot of small farmers

it yet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:54:01"></hs_TimeCode>. I will
test the opinion of the House, for what that is worth.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by thanking noble
Lords for the constructive and positive debates we have had on this
clause. Responding to an amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord
Clement-Jones on Report, the Government are introducing two further
amendments to the clause. These amendments mean that some unpublished
films and photographs will remain in copyright until 2039 at the
earliest, as they do under the current
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032066000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032066000033">I
acknowledged on Report that films can be commercially exploited without
having been published. This is because of the legal definition of the
word “published”. The same may be true of some
unpublished photographs. Equally, there will be some film material and
photographs in commercial archives that have yet to be commercially
exploited in any sense. These archives may have built business cases on
the basis that that material would remain in copyright until 2039 at
the earliest and could be exploited until that point. Therefore, to
provide some certainty to those businesses, the Government are
exempting film and photographs from the
clause.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032066000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032066000034">However,
a smaller proportion of unpublished films and unpublished photographs
are affected by the 2039 transitional provisions than some think. Many
films put on commercial release, including newsreels, will
have been registered under film legislation, and the 2039 provisions do
not apply to those films because they are regarded as published. With
regard to photographs, only unpublished photographs taken between 1957
and 1969, whose author died during that period, are affected by the
2039 provisions. Photographs taken before 1957 were protected for 50
years from the end of the calendar year in which they were
taken.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032066000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032066000035">The

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister. If
anything, what he has just said demonstrates the complexity of
copyright legislation and the provisions of what is
now Clause 78. One of the interesting things about this Bill is that
when debating Part 6 we have continuously had to
push our horizons forward. I think that when we started it was Clause
57 onwards, then it was Clause 66 onwards and it is now Clause 76
onwards, but we are very flexible and adaptable here. The amendment
demonstrates not only the complexity 
<?notus-xml column=648?>of copyright law but the flexibility and willingness
to listen that the Minister has demonstrated throughout our debate on
Part 6. I welcome his response to the concerns, particularly of those
in the news agencies and of photographers, about the possible impact of
Clause 78, and I am delighted by the outcome.</hs_para>

Amendment 8 paints the regulation-makers into a corner. I quite see the
point of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, on the commercial stuff.
This is his word as a commercial lawyer among the large rights holders
and the people who make money out of this material. I see their point.
They have invested heavily in some of this stuff, as in other cases,
and they want a commercial return on

trouble is with all the other stuff. This is not just about photographs
sitting in commercial archives or produced for a commercial purpose.
This is not about film sitting in a commercial archive, or from which,
published or not, somebody is trying to make some money. It is
everything. The sort of stuff that has ended up with genealogical
societies around the country and in libraries’ photographic
collections will all fall under this. I realise that this does not
apply to pre-1957 photographs, so it will not affect people doing
research on the Second World War, but you will suddenly have this
strange cut-off point. It would have been wise to keep greater
flexibility in this so that the Minister,

should perhaps be withdrawn because it can be covered in the rest of
the provisions, which says that he can then go on to reduce the
duration of copyright in existing works. It is made by regulations. If
you can do different provisions for different purposes, I would have
thought there would be the flexibility to be able to meet the concerns
of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and the perfectly valid
commercial concerns, and also have done things for the libraries,
universities, researchers and other people who want to do other things

should also recognise that this has been a complicated journey through
these legislative clauses. Copyright is never an easy issue to get
into. I am sure that the noble Lord would recognise that; he has always
looked a bit punch-drunk when we have had discussions on it but has
come up smiling, which is one of his nice characteristics. However,
there are a number of difficult and complex issues underneath this.
They are not going to be resolved by what is in the Bill, although we
have caught up in a number of areas and that is good. This is really
about setting up discussions that we will have to have in this House
and another place as the various changes that are being provoked by the
Hargreaves report are brought forward as what are in generic terms
called “copyright exceptions”. They of course deal with a
large number of issues that could have been, as we have argued,
contained in this Bill but have been left deliberately to secondary
legislation. That is not to say that we will necessarily agree with
everything that we see when that comes through. There have to be a lot
of complicated discussions on some of these points. We welcome the
opportunity to have those, based on where we are now. On that basis, I
am happy to agree with these

would be good if I wrote extensively to him concerning the point of
extending the provisions beyond normal photographs, to put it crudely.
The noble Earl asked whether photographers’ concerns could be
addressed regarding Amendment 9. A relatively small number of
photographs are covered by the 2039 provisions: as he may know, it is
only those taken between 1957 and 1969. Those who want to use those
photographs could seek a licence or use orphan work for business.

much for the ears of officials as for noble Lords, that these

various parts of the cultural sector with whom I have conferred on the
whole question of orphan works over the weeks in which we have been

However, I have thought it right to prevail for a few moments on the

appropriate for us to consider policy decisions which, unintentionally

term “orphan works”, as we know, denotes material such as
books, letters, diaries, documentation from the voluntary sector,
broadcasts and newspapers held in our great public collections which
may still be in copyright but where the owners of the copyright cannot
be identified—or, if they have been identified, cannot be found.
Vast quantities of such orphan works are held in our public
collections. They would be capable of expressing and illuminating our
shared national heritage. They represent a resource of enormous
potential value educationally, academically, culturally and
economically. Without a well designed orphan works licensing system, it
will remain impossible, as it is at the moment, to digitise this

request that they should be paid—although we anticipate that
nearly all of them will not make the request. There is no question of
anybody proposing to steal other people’s intellectual property.

When we have legislated on copyright over the years we have never done

parliamentary proceedings on the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act

that legislation, conducted the parliamentary proceedings in the spirit
of a seminar. I was the government Whip on the Bill. We do not normally
conduct legislative proceedings in the spirit of a seminar, but we were
seeking to elicit from everybody who participated in those proceedings
the best contributions they could make towards achieving an appropriate
balance and a policy that would protect the legitimate rights of
individuals and corporate interests, while providing for the maximum
public benefit. We debated in the same spirit the proposals on
copyright much more recently during the passage of the Digital Economy
Act 2010. Those debates were strenuous but fair-minded. We should

people can license. They would probably not be on the same subject in
most cases; they would be for different purposes. If one of the big
national libraries or a university was trying to prepare a work of
academic interest, they would not rush around paying fortunes to these
libraries that have collections of pictures or text. They cannot do
that; they will not have the budget for it. If someone was to look at
what this stuff was currently sold for, or licensed for, we could be
talking about a huge sum of money going into the bodies collecting for
orphan works. We are not talking about a petty million, or something

point across and to see the horror on the Minister’s face, I
volunteer to be either one of the societies collecting the money so
that I can have a huge scheme, or one of the chief accredited training
agencies, because this will be a licence to print

point is well made by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth. The funding of
universities and libraries and institutions like that, which this
provision is aimed at, comes out of public or charitable funds, and it
is there for a purpose. The concept that this is a hidden tax that then
goes back to the Exchequer or to fund a nice quango or whatever is
totally unethical. I cannot put that strongly enough. If the public
woke up to the fact that that was happening, they would be absolutely
horrified, so the Minister would be incredibly well advised
to accept this amendment to protect the Government from all sorts of
accusations in future—unless, of course, they do not
expect to be in power by the time this happens and think
that another Government will take the flack. However, given
that most politicians think they will still be in power, if I were them

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord
Howarth, when introducing this amendment, mentioned that in Parliament
as a whole there was a genuine sense that issues to do with copyright
were dealt with in a non-partisan way, and he explained some of the
background to the CDP Act 1988 and to the Digital Economy Act. This
debate has shown that the spirit lives on. I stress that I do not think
that this is a partisan issue; we are all very interested in this new
and broadly welcome provision, which anticipates the EU directive and
perhaps gold-plates it a
little<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T19:39:43"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T19:39:35"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, there is no doubt that we need an orphan works scheme. It is
right that it should be introduced and we are backing it all the way.
Within that it is absolutely clear that rights holders must be
remunerated if they wish. However, as many of them will not be easy
to find, a diligent search of a high standard must be
carried out. I recognise that the way to prove all that is to create
this escrow account approach, and that that should be done for a
reasonable period. However, the more one listens to the points that are
made round here, the more one feels that this is going in
the wrong direction in this respect. As virtually all speakers have
said, surely it cannot be in the best interests of the Government to
tax the institutions that are expected to carry out this work and
mainly benefit from it. That cannot be
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T19:40:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T19:49:37"></hs_TimeCode>.
The Minister was reported in <I>Hansard</I> as saying that if the
escrow funds were building up and not being used, they could be used to
defray the costs of running the licensing body, to pay for preservation
costs and for training. However, that escrow funding is the money that
would be paid to rights holders, so it does not really belong to the
licensing body to do with it as
suggested<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T19:41:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032069000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032069000034">We
are at the fringe of moving in the wrong direction here. It would be
sensible if the Government were to pause and think about this again.
This is a good 
<?notus-xml column=656?>scheme and is the right thing to do, but perhaps
there is a way in which one can retain the funds that are going to be
held for potential rights holders within the original institutions. At
least then they would have the benefit of the money even if they could
not allocate it, and the sensibility that this somehow was a taxation
scheme would be avoided because it would not work. It would be the
worst of all possible worlds if, at the end of this process of trying
to get these proposals scheduled and incorporated in legislation, the
whole scheme was stillborn because people could not see how it could be
financed. I very much want to hear what the Minister has to say on this
matter. Some movement towards the position of the noble Lord, Lord
Howarth, would be much

Amendment 10, the Government agree that there will need to be a full
and proper evaluation of the effectiveness of the orphan works scheme,

have committed to a review of the functioning of the scheme one year
after it is fully functional. This post-implementation review would be
undertaken by the orphan works authorising body and would include, for
example, data on the number of orphan works registrations, and
permissions issued by the authorising body. The scope of any review, as
determined by discussions with stakeholders, would be incorporated into
the authorising body’s regulations. I assure the House that the

11 would require regulations to make provision that unclaimed fees paid
for the use of orphan works were returned to the licensee within a
five-year period. Under the proposals currently in the Bill, in the
event that fees remain unclaimed for the licensed use of an orphan
work, a variety of options are possible: for example, unclaimed fees
could be used to help creators; subsidise the cost of running the
orphan works scheme—I believe that that point was raised by the
noble Lord, Lord Howarth—pay for preservation costs in public
institutions; or pay for industry training. I know that there are
wide-ranging views on the appropriate use of unclaimed fees. This is
why the wording in the Bill is permissive; it requires regulations to
deal with this issue but does not rule 
<?notus-xml column=657?>any particular option in or out. It does not rule out the return of the
fee to the licensee. The current wording allows for further
consideration of all these options, with the input of all relevant
stakeholders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T19:44:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032069000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032069000039">The
noble Lord, Lord Howarth, supported by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll,
raised the issue of the money going to the Exchequer. The use of the
funds will be the subject of a full consideration. I hope that gives
some reassurance to noble Lords. In other words, all options are open
and there will be no presumption that the money will go to the Treasury
under this scheme. I hope that that also reassures the noble Baroness,
Lady Brinton. The noble Baroness raised a related matter concerning how
long the money would sit in bona vacantia. As a general principle,
money falling into bona vacantia is dealt with by the Treasury
Solicitor, and there is no time period as such. I do not know whether
that helps. I hope the House will agree that this is the right way
forward. I again assure the noble Lord that it is the
Government’s intention that the licence fee for the use of an
orphan work should be proportionate to the type of use. However,
particularly where orphan works are used commercially, the Government
believe it is vital that the conditions of use do not inadvertently
undermine the market for known works, particularly, for example, where
we are concerned with the livelihoods of creators such as
photographers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032069000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320-0002.htm#13032069000040">The

“consideration” does indeed mean consultation. However, I

Report, the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, concluded that a search would be
required for each and every rights holder. The orphan works scheme
never intended to promise mass digitisation without a prior diligent
search. If we wanted to do this, we would have to find another means of
achieving it as the scheme we are now considering could not do so. That
might be achieved using ECL, but that depends on the existence of the
relevant collecting societies. Those are all questions that we cannot

an orphan work—for example, in a television

envisaged. The licensing body will not be able to delegate its powers

noble Viscount again gave me some grounds for encouragement in his
emphasis that a variety of options is possible. He did not explain why
the Government do not simply accept that the money ought to be returned
after a reasonable interval to those who have lodged it because no
rights holders have come forward. Even if they subsequently come
forward, of course, they will be paid by the licensing bodies. He did
not explain why we do not simply and straightforwardly return the money
after a reasonable interval. However, he does not rule it out and he
promises full consideration, as well as promising to write to us to

Government envisage at this stage. I recognise that there is more work
to be done by the working group, but he will know that probably the
greatest anxiety of the cultural institutions, even greater than their
anxiety about the requirement for up-front payments, is that the
regulations may land them with an impossible task in terms of diligent
search. It seemed to me that the Minister made helpful remarks on this
subject on Report, but if he were willing to elaborate a little and

the Government have no power to control, e.g. birth and death rates,
personal inclination. The Government have extensive policies in areas
that affect population levels, such as immigration and health, while
population levels are closely affected by policy relating to housing,
employment and infrastructure to name but a few. The variation in

English and maths courses for adults who lack these basic skills. In
2011-12 this funding has supported 772,500 learners
aged 19 and over to take a maths course, and
782,500 to take an English course, and we are now funding
GCSE English and maths qualifications for adults from the
2012-13 academic year. We have brought in new freedoms and
flexibilities whereby FE colleges and providers have a single adult
skills budget which enables them to respond to learner and employer
needs
locally.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13032057000269" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320w0001.htm#13032057000269">Eritrea</hs_DebateHeading><hs_DebateType>Question</hs_DebateType></NewDebate><hs_TabledBy UID="13032057000306" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130320w0001.htm#13032057000306">Asked
