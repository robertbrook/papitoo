to tackling rates of reoffending, which remain too high. The
Transforming Rehabilitation consultation, which closed on 22 February,
sets out our proposals for revolutionising the way we rehabilitate
offenders and we are currently considering the responses. We have
proposed that providers will be obliged to report material breaches of
community orders, suspended sentence requirements and licence
conditions to the public sector, which will then advise the court or
the Secretary of State. We are absolutely clear that relationships
between the public sector and contracted providers are vital to make
the reformed system work

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for that
interesting Answer. As the Government are currently saying that the
probation service would recall, but the private sector will supervise
on a day-to-day basis, how would the service get the proper information
to decide whether a recall to custody is justified? Would not such a
system be open to legal challenge on the ground that the probation
service was not involved in the day-to-day supervision and was
therefore not in a position to
recall<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, the public sector will
continue to play a vital role in probation. This is about bringing
together the voluntary community sector, the public sector and the
private sector to ensure that rehabilitation works. While money has
been spent on probation, a total of £800 million of the
£3 billion budget, the results in terms of the effectiveness of
probation have not been what we had hoped. I believe that this
revolutionising agenda provides the right pathway for bringing together
the three different sectors. However, the public sector will retain
overall
responsibility<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> At the moment the situation is that
all recalls which are received through the probation service are
considered. I believe that the current figure is around 16,000 a year,
of which some 
<?notus-xml column=664?>5,000 sit within the prison population. The appeal processes are clear
to prisoners. However, this is not the private sector taking
responsibility away from the public sector or from the Government.
Ultimately, the private and the public sector will work together on
reoffending, as I have said. Moreover, we are seeing some great
results. Peterborough provides a practical example of the three areas
working together and showing positive
results<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

arrangements generally that we have in place in this country are
effective and appropriate, in particular given the large number of
recalls to prison from licence? This must add to the strain on prison

number of recalls in England and Wales as
astonishing.</hs_para>

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My noble friend raises a very
important point. If we look at reoffending generally, 50% of offenders
who serve a 12-month sentence still go on to reoffend. Currently, as I
have already alluded to, the recall figure is in excess of 16,000, of
whom 5,000 represent the 85,000 or so of the prison population, which
is about 5%. No, it is not good enough, but we believe that the
Transforming Rehabilitation programme that we have put forward, the
consultation on which, as I said, closed on 22 February,
will provide a practical way of addressing reoffending. It costs us, as
an economy and as a society, very
heavily<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T11:11:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Elystan-Morgan" PimsId="3108" UID="13032165000538" xid="1811" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000538">Lord

recall of a prisoner is a quasi-judicial act, at the moment vested by

who will be exercising that power of recall, by what authority will it

not be compromised in any sense. What we are putting forward in no way
jeopardises that. As far as recall is concerned, once we have completed
this particular consultation exercise, we will look at the concerns
which have been raised. I will write to the noble Lord, detailing some
of the specific proposals on that
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Corston" PimsId="4904" UID="13032165000540" xid="1493" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000540">Baroness

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> The noble Baroness raises an important
point. We need to ensure that when there are breaches of sentences,
they are looked at effectively and in a structured way if recalls are
issued. I have already alluded to two facts: circa 16,000
recalls are issued annually and, once they are assessed, the prison
population currently represent only 5,000 of that figure. I believe
that we have robust procedures in place to ensure that any recalls
issued are reviewed and that the people who then are sent back to
prison are sent back because they have reoffended. I am sure that all
noble Lords will agree about the 
<?notus-xml column=665?>reoffending rates we see across the country. I was startled, in my own
experience in local government, to see the level of youth offending,
which was in excess of 70%. If you bear in mind that close to 50% of
people go on to reoffend, we really need to take some drastic action to
address this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T11:13:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Gardner of Parkes" PimsId="3383" UID="13032165000542" xid="1170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000542">Baroness
Gardner of Parkes:</Member></B> Is the Minister aware of the very low
reoffending rate in cases such as the scheme operated by National Grid,
where young offenders are trained to become very useful people? Does he

finished<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T11:13:53"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000014"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon" PimsId="5907" UID="13032165000543" xid="2117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000543">Lord
Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> Again, my noble friend raises a very
important issue. I am aware of the scheme with National Grid, which
addresses prisons and reoffending. To put this into context, when I
visited Peterborough, I saw something very effective for prisoners
coming in. If prisoners have committed the crime they have to serve
that time, but it is not about leaving them at the prison gate. It is
about identifying what skills and needs they have and then, by the time
they leave prison, ensuring that they become productive, constructive
members of society. That is what Transforming Rehabilitation is all
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000015"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T11:14:28"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Tomlinson" PimsId="4304" UID="13032165000544" xid="1523" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000544">Lord

First, on the question of having a Lord Speaker, I know that the House
looked at it in the previous Session and concluded by a considerable
margin that it would prefer to keep things as they were. As for
regulating the House, it is the responsibility of all those on the
Front Benches not to speak too long and not to hog questions and take
them away from the Back Benches, but it is also the responsibility of
the whole House to make its views known if it thinks that Members are
going on for too long or are asking too many

somewhat to my surprise, that nearly 230 Members of your

questions in that period, which I thought was rather an encouraging
figure and higher than I expected. There is, however, a point which the

delighted to hear what the Minister has just said about UKBA and its
concentration. Is she aware that many children do not go through the
NRM but those who do go through are accommodated by local authorities,
which do not have parental responsibility for those children under the

Butler-Sloss, highlights an important point, which is that we need to
ensure that victims of trafficking are referred into what we call the
NRM, the national referral mechanism, because it is through that
mechanism that they then receive the support and care that they need.
She might like to know—I am sure she is already aware of
this—that, as part of the Government’s ongoing efforts to
improve the way in which we support the victims of this terrible crime,
we have commissioned the Refugee Council and the Children’s

absolutely right that our priority has to be about raising awareness of

sadly, this is a crime where victims sometimes do not know they are
victims. That links to a Question I answered some months ago about
child sexual exploitation 
<?notus-xml column=672?>and the victims of that crime not necessarily knowing that they are
being abused in the way that they are. We are investing money in making

Chairman of Committees (Lord Sewel):</Member></B> My Lords, the Liaison
Committee’s report this time last year reviewed existing Select
Committee activity and recommended an additional unit of committee
activity, and a reduction in the resources available to the European
Union Committee and the Science and Technology Committee to enable the
redeployment of resources to support two new ad hoc committees and the
appointment of an ad hoc post-legislative scrutiny committee. Over the
past two months, the Liaison Committee has reviewed existing Select
Committee activity in the light of these changes. Both this
year and last, we discussed the work of the Communications Committee
with its chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, and concluded that
the Communications Committee should be appointed as a sessional
committee at the start of the 2013-14 Session. I have to point out that
there is no resource impact arising from this
recommendation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000075">We
also considered a proposal to extend the orders of reference of the
Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy to enable it to
appoint a sub-committee. The Joint Committee already meets more than
the three to four times a year which was originally envisaged and is
well supported by Members of your Lordships’ House. The House of
Commons Liaison Committee considered the Joint Committee’s
proposal for a power to establish a sub-committee at its meeting on
27 February, and declined to support it. The House of Lords
Liaison Committee did not support an increase in the Joint
Committee’s resources and instead suggested that further thought
should be given to the size and composition of the Joint
Committee’s

recommended that, from the start of the 2012-13 Session, the number of
sub-committees of the European Union Committee should be reduced from
seven to six. We also recommended that the Science and Technology
Committee should be allocated the resource of a single Select
Committee. As we acknowledged in our report, this decision caused
considerable unhappiness. As the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, chairman of
the Science and Technology Committee explained, previously, the
committee had the resources to conduct two units of activity at once.
The reduction in resource to three staff members had required the
committee to undertake one unit of activity rather than two, and the
committee no longer had a sub-committee. In the past, the committee has
typically alternated a long inquiry with a short one. The committee has
been severely constrained in the present Session by having to drop the
second simultaneous
inquiry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T11:41:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

important contribution of the European Union Committee and Science and

however, that the restructuring of committee activity which took effect
at the start of the present Session needs further time to bed down. The
reduction 
<?notus-xml column=674?>in resources for the EU and Science and Technology Committee in the
present Session enabled an expansion of ad hoc committee activity. This
has been a step change for the House of Lords, and has included the
first ever House of Lords post-legislative scrutiny committee. The
noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, chairman of the Select
Committee on Adoption Legislation, the noble Lord, Lord Cope of
Berkeley, chairman of the Select Committee on Small and Medium Sized
Enterprises and Exports, and the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, chairman of
the Select Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change, were
unanimous in their enthusiasm for the work of their committees, the
commitment of the members and the support provided by the committee
staff. We consider that the three new ad hoc committees have worked
very well during this Session.</hs_para>

response. We considered the proposals received against the criteria set
out in the original Leader’s Group report on the matter. I am
delighted to report that the House Committee has agreed in principle
that funds can be made available to support the work of a further
additional unit of committee activity in 2013-14. This is at a cost of
approximately
£225,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T11:43:42"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T11:43:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

activity can be managed without affecting the House’s overall
aim not to increase our resource costs in real terms, partly as a
result of savings that have been made in other areas. As an example,
Members will be aware of savings being made through reducing the number
of days on which mail is forwarded and removing linen hand towels, and
of significant savings being made by making more documents available
online, thereby leading to the reduction in printing costs. I am fully
aware that not all of these savings initiatives met with universal
acclaim at the time, but it is true that the savings that we have made
in these areas have enabled resource to be redirected to support the
core activities of the House. That is something to recognise and
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000080">The

the extra unit of committee activity agreed to by the House Committee

to recommend two shorter, ad hoc committee inquiries to run
consecutively. This means that we have been able to recommend ad hoc
committees on five subjects, as follows: first, a committee on the use
of soft power in promoting the UK’s interests abroad; secondly,
a committee on the strategic issues for regeneration and sporting
legacy from the Olympics and Paralympic Games, to report by late 2013;
thirdly, a committee on the consequences of the use of personal service
companies for tax collection, following the completion of the work of
the committee on the Olympic and Paralympic Games legacy; fourthly, a
post-legislative scrutiny committee to examine the Mental Capacity Act

Pearson of Rannoch:</Member></B> As the Liaison Committee is a
committee of your Lordships’ House, could the noble Lord give a
little more of the reasoning behind its failure to approve an ad hoc
committee requested by my noble friend Lady Cox, who cannot be here
today? The request was for an ad hoc committee into religiously
sanctioned gender discrimination against women. I ask this question as
one of the 70 Peers who supported that request. It is therefore
surprising that the report that we are considering says that only two
Peers supported the request, whereas in the letter from my
noble friend Lady Cox to the committee of 22 November, she
named three eminent Peers who supported her committee, the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Mackay, and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T11:47:40"></hs_TimeCode> noble Lords,
Lord Carlile and Lord Dholakia, and said that 67 other Peers supported
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T11:47:48"></hs_TimeCode>. As far as I
can see, of the committees that have been selected, not one was

attention of the House to the fact that, inexplicably, the House of

is a committee down the Corridor on foreign affairs, of which I had the
honour of being a member for 10 years before I came here. We

ceased to exist. If the aim of the House in undertaking Select
Committee work is not simply to publish a piece of paper but to have an
impact on public policy and debate, that is a fundamental problem. To
illustrate it crisply, how the Government respond and how the political
parties think about such an issue is of fundamental importance.

world is changing. We have plenty of complex business to do with Europe
and we should have good committees focusing on that. 
<?notus-xml column=677?>However, the IMF tells us that the whole of Europe will contribute only
17% to the world’s GNP in four years’ time. It is, alas,
shrinking in an expanding world. There is a vast new area of interest

their remit they cannot begin to cover all the issues. The expertise,
wisdom and understanding about how we cope with this new

First, I welcome the fact that the House is discussing the report of

a lot of things happening around and about the House that individual
Members of the House know very little about. It is good that the

of resources it is not allowed to do so. The committee consists of
people with great expertise—chairmen of Select Committees in the

too much of your Lordships’ time but the procedure is entirely
different. The European Scrutiny Committee does not undertake
individual inquiries and scrutiny of individual matters in the same way
that your Lordships’ committee does. Therefore, the comparison

of committees and dividing the cost, and if the argument against having
a foreign affairs committee is one of cost, presumably the soft power
committee will cost the same as the foreign affairs committee, on the
basis of the numbers that the Chairman of Committees has

with a different composition of people who had an interest in that

rather than increasing the number of sessional committees. That is an
argument that we can have and develop during the year, but I would be

have to tackle that basic point, as it is crucial. Of course, as my
noble friend has pointed out, if one abandoned the idea of a soft power
committee, a saving would be set against the cost of the foreign

from an effective foreign affairs committee than it does from what I

noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, that unless that committee can be made
effective—it does require the ability to set up sub-committees
in order to do its work, but I shall not labour that point at the

the Joint Committee’s understanding. There are, in effect, two

noble Lord has just said about the unsatisfactory nature of both the
size of the committee and the levels of attendance, particularly by
Members of the House of Commons. It has to be said, however, that the
chairmen of the various committees—home affairs, defence,
foreign affairs and so on—themselves insisted on being members
of this committee in order partly to ensure that it did not actually
step on to their patch. That creates real difficulties for the
effective work of the committee, which is precisely why it is difficult
to find the interstices where we might be 
<?notus-xml column=685?>permitted to do something. There are some fundamentally unsatisfactory
aspects to the existence of this committee that go to its mandate. I do
not think that we will make a satisfactory committee out of conforming
to the mandate: rather, the mandate has to change in order to make a
satisfactory

Lords, yesterday’s Budget was extremely clear on the two issues
which it set out to address: first, the challenges facing the UK
economy; and, secondly, the Government’s response to these
challenges. On the first, we are all very familiar with—and
should never forget—how we got here. There was a massive
financial crisis which has turned out to have even more serious
consequences than we thought at the time; and after that bubble burst
we were left with the record and unsustainable debt levels unwisely
accumulated during the boom years. The recovery from this trauma is
slower than any of us would have liked or, in fact, have anticipated.
It has left us with both deficit and debt levels that are still far too
high<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T12:31:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000136">On
the second point, the Government have been consistent in basing their
policy response on their three key pillars: an unwavering commitment to
the fiscal responsibility which is at its heart, reinforced both by
monetary activism to support demand and keep interest rates low and by
a reforming agenda of supply-side measures aimed at ensuring that the
UK is one of the best places in the world to do business. This strategy
has been pursued with careful consideration of the cost of living
pressures on ordinary people, and the Budget therefore took measures to
mitigate some of those
pressures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000137">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T12:32:20"></hs_TimeCode>
there is an underlying mission statement or ideology to this
strategy, it is one of economic realism. If our economy is to succeed
in the global race over the medium and long term, we must have
businesses that are world beaters. That must be supported by
first-class infrastructure and a tax and regulation environment that
fosters enterprise. These businesses must be able to draw on a highly
educated workforce which is motivated to succeed because hard work is
incentivised. That is consistent with what my right honourable friend
the Chancellor described yesterday as the “aspiration
nation”. I will expand on these individual components of policy
and how they have evolved, which will, I hope, provide a framework for
the contributions that follow.</hs_para>

on fiscal policy, there should be no doubt that the Government are
committed to reducing the deficit. This commitment is key to retaining
the market’s confidence—confidence which is measured
daily through the record low interest rates that we currently enjoy. We
should not take this confidence for granted: at our current levels of
debt and borrowing we would be vulnerable to the potential fickleness
of the markets if our commitment to fiscal consolidation wavered. It is
like stretching a piece of fabric: you never know when or where it will
split but the risk is always there. We hear arguments—as I am
sure we will later this afternoon—for borrowing more, and
opposite arguments for harsher spending reductions. I think that we
have the balance about right and that we have adapted to the worse than
anticipated economic environment in which we find
ourselves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000139" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000139">The
Office for Budget Responsibility—another of the
Government’s important and brave innovations in the
interests of transparency, so that we can all agree on what
the numbers really are—is extremely clear on the reasons why our
recovery is slower than it originally forecast. Unfortunately, none of
these factors is within the control of any Government. Those reasons
are, first, that the financial crisis was deeper and its
consequences more pernicious than was originally understood; secondly,
the depth and continuation of the well advertised eurozone crisis; and,
thirdly, the impact of commodity price inflation, particularly in
2011.</hs_para>

if you like, is the bad news. However, there is also some extremely
good news about how our economy is responding to these challenges, and
I do not want to pass over that. In particular, our private sector has
created 1.25 million new jobs. These are real jobs for real people,
making a real difference to their lives and prospects. To put that into
context, for every job lost last year in the unavoidable shrinkage of a

Budget was fiscally neutral despite the many stimulative measures it
included. This was due to the rigorous financial management by my right
honourable friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who resisted the
traditional final-quarter Whitehall spending splurge. That is precisely
the sort of discipline that you see every day in the private sector and
I am delighted that it is now being applied in the public sector too.
We are focusing government departments on meeting targets that are
consistent with our consolidation plan. We are keeping the lid on
public sector pay, which is important. We are also continuing to
extract further reform efficiencies in how we run government. However,
we are still making space for a very valuable additional £3
billion per annum of capital spend from 2015 onwards.</hs_para>

policy. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T12:37:12"></hs_TimeCode> in
this House have engaged in a very active and expert discussion about
the role and efficacy of monetary policy—which was another big

worth clarifying the policy.</hs_para>

think that the Government’s thorough review of our monetary
policy is most welcome. It was exactly the right thing to do in view of
all the surrounding discussion and was very thorough. The updated remit
has also been agreed by both the present and the next Governor of the
Bank of England. The important points are as follows. First, we are
retaining the existing model of flexible inflation targeting. Secondly,
we have reaffirmed the primacy of the 2% inflation target. Thirdly, the
updated remit provides for a much more explicit discussion of the
trade-offs involved, particularly when monetary policy is responding to
the kind of severe economic shock that our economy has suffered.
Fourthly, the Government have requested that, by August, the Monetary
Policy Committee assess the potential of so-called intermediate
thresholds, the technique which has been utilised by the Federal
Reserve in the US. The Government want to build on good practice in
monetary policy both here and around the world in order to develop a
best-in-class framework. We should therefore welcome it. It is
transparent and includes the appropriate
governance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000145" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000145">On
a slightly more practical and specific level, there is also a clear
determination to drive ahead with the implementation successes that we
have had in monetary policy, particularly, for example, with the
Funding for Lending scheme, which is transmitting the concept and goal

funding costs.</hs_para>

right point for me to discuss the home-buying initiatives, which were
an important part of the announcement yesterday. One of the obvious
challenges for any Budget is how to create a meaningful stimulus to the
economy and make a meaningful difference to people’s lives and
aspirations, within the confines of extraordinarily tight fiscal
management. I believe that the two help to buy schemes, as they are
branded, are an extremely effective and creative way of responding to
this challenge. The equity loan scheme will provide £3.5 billion
to invest in approximately 74,000 new homes, while the mortgage
guarantees will support a potential total of £130 billion of
mortgages. These are bold and innovative policies but they will also
require careful risk
management.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000147" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000147">Our
focus on the deficit should not and does not mean that we cannot have a
strong and reforming growth strategy. In fact, much of
yesterday’s Budget was devoted to just that: how we can help
business. In my own relatively short time at the Treasury, I have been
extremely impressed by the attentiveness with which this Government
listen to what business is asking for and the urgency with which we try
to press forward with the corresponding
reforms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000148" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000148">In my
own area of focus—delivering our economic infrastructure
quickly, well and cost-effectively—I have enjoyed the total
support of my right honourable 
<?notus-xml column=689?>friends the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. That is why we have
pushed through this plan to increase capital spending by £3
billion a year; why we are working on a significant upgrade of the
capability within the key Whitehall departments responsible for the
economic delivery of infrastructure; why we are focused on the delivery
of the biggest 40 projects under our control; and why we have made
available a very significant guarantee facility, which takes advantage
of the strength of our credit, to be able to guarantee projects that
need that one extra shove to move from conception into execution. Very
importantly, we are also translating our policy of electricity market
reform into a set of financeable contracts so that we can set about
building the new electricity-generating capacity we
require.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000149" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000149">Overall,
our supply-side reforms—I am not going to list them—have
significantly improved our ranking in international competitiveness
league tables. This is particularly true in tax, where we are now right
at the top. Let us give credit: bringing corporation tax down to 20%
from 28% in 2010 makes us the most competitive in the G20. When we look
in the Treasury at the different ways to stimulate the economy, there
is nothing that is more immediately impactful than reducing the rate of
corporation tax, which is why my right honourable friend the Chancellor
has focused on it. The introduction of the £2,000 employment
allowance benefits smaller businesses and reinforces the positive
employment momentum that has been established successfully in the past
few years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000150" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000150">I
believe that this Government have got the tax mood music just right.
Lower tax rates for companies and individuals are essential for a
successful enterprise economy, one that concentrates on growing the
size of the cake so that we can have much easier discussions about how
we share it. In return, however, we expect taxes to be paid, and we are
right to push through strong tax avoidance and evasion measures
domestically and I praise my colleagues in the Government for taking a
lead in co-operation to address this subject
internationally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000151" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000151">Ensuring
that taxes are paid is one element of how this Government ensure that
their policies are deployed fairly. Once again, this Government have
led in transparency in setting out the distributional implications at
each fiscal event—another innovation—demonstrating that
those who can afford the most have also contributed the most to our
deficit reduction. I also point to pensions and welfare as examples of
good administrative reform that simplify and improve overly complex
systems. Similarly, the simplicity and power of moving to a
£10,000 personal allowance takes 2.7 million people out of the
tax system
altogether.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000152" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000152">In
conclusion, I fully accept that this country is facing a highly
challenging economic situation. The slowness of recovery has left both
debt and deficit at levels which still expose our economy to
substantial risk. This has much to do with the precarious levels of
public and personal debt that were the legacy of the financial crisis,
and the continuing recession in the EU, our principal trading market.
This Government are focused on fixing our debt problem and are
utilising our relatively limited room for manoeuvre to support 
<?notus-xml column=690?>businesses and individuals who want to get on and succeed. It will take
time. In a global economy, we are not entirely masters of our own
destiny. But I believe, as does my right honourable friend the

reality is that the economy is stuck in recession—or as near
recession as makes no difference. Just three months ago the OBR, an

forecasting growth of more than 1% this year. Now it has had to face up
to reality and halve its growth
forecast.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13032165000156" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000156">The
Budget Statement also revealed that austerity does not cut deficits.
Despite all the Government’s efforts, the deficit is not
falling. Taking out special measures, in 2012 it was £121
billion; in 2013, £120.9 billion—a lot of work
must have gone into shaving off that £100 million—and in
2014, £199.8 billion, all within the slightest margin
of error. The reason deficits are not falling is obvious to all: no
growth in output means no growth in tax revenues and significant
pressure on social spending.</hs_para>

major revelation. This Budget of no growth, stagnant deficit and
falling living standards revealed that the Treasury has run out of
ideas. It does not have a clue what to do next so it is handing

think of something, even though all the evidence at home and abroad

growth problem will not be solved by policies, postponed to 2014,
designed to pump money into the housing market. The shared equity
scheme will only partially offset the deep cuts in capital grants for
social housing in the previous spending review, and the new mortgage

likely to give a further twist to the house price spiral than provide
the major new-build stimulus that the construction industry needs.
Perhaps when the noble Lord sums up, he will tell us the
Treasury’s estimate of the impact of the guarantee 
<?notus-xml column=691?>scheme on house prices, how much of the expenditure will be a dead
weight loss—funding purchases that would have taken place

Government just do not seem to understand that the key stimulus to
investment is the prospect of demand for the goods and services that
the investment will produce. It does not matter how low taxes or
interest rates are if investment does not result in a marketable
product for which there is growing demand. Yet, as the Chancellor
himself admitted, this Budget does nothing to stimulate overall demand
in the economy. The OBR forecasts that real wages will fall in 2013 and
not recover for two years thereafter. The continuing squeeze on
households severely curtails the prospect of any growth in demand, a

output languishes 3% below the peak? Has he not noticed the superior

embracing this progress, Labour wishes to substitute a 10p tax band.
Under Labour, poorer people would today be paying more income tax than

is an area where I once worked on Liberal Democrat policy. We made a
very difficult decision not to include plans much like those announced
this week in our manifesto, because when we looked at the economy that
Labour had left us we saw that it was clearly unaffordable in the face
of the economic collapse and uncontrolled borrowing environment. But
childcare is one of the most challenging issues for working families. I
took evidence from many mothers, and sometimes fathers, trying to weigh
the long-term financial benefit of growing a career by returning to
work against the immediate burden of the most expensive childcare in
Europe. The coalition has already made 16 hours a week of free care
available to two year-olds in the least well-off families and taken a
more intelligent approach to the staff/child ratio in childcare, but we

lose $160 billion a year as a result of tax-dodging by
multinationals—far more than they receive in aid from all rich

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, I believe that this will go down as a
successful Budget politically, particularly within the narrow scope for
manoeuvre that the Chancellor had. It is perhaps correct that it should
have been broadly an unexciting Budget. The one key initiative is the
help to buy scheme, which seems to be somewhat the Neville Chamberlain
strategy. As the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, has pointed out, in
the 1930s the economy was very much got going by the
increase in housebuilding; indeed, few people realise that the most
successful period of growth in the 20th century was 1935-40,
when the British economy grew at 4% per annum compound. I point out
that Chamberlain also addressed the other key problems of the time in
that he cut public sector pay, which had got out of line with private
sector pay, and he cut taxes substantially as well, generating demand
without overborrowing. Perhaps there is a little more to learn from
that period<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T13:09:29"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, these initiatives will have to be managed extremely carefully.
They smack slightly of the Clinton measures that caused the housing
bubble and all the trouble thereafter to the banking
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000190" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000190">My
preference would be, if it were possible, to accelerate the
infrastructure projects which the noble Lord, Lord Deighton, is
appointed to manage, and I am sure that he will do extremely
efficiently. Within the plan, there is about £200 million of
investment in roads and other infrastructure and £200 million
needed for power generation. That is massive scope to have
infrastructure investment that will get the economy moving, but we have
to get rid of the planning and environmental red tape, which is
delaying that. I am convinced that there is the money for them. We have
seen developments such as the recent Qatar involvement, but I am amused

Britain’s investment in R&amp;D is lower than the OECD and EU

corporation tax, but the steps forward are too small, and they do not
cover enough ground. For example, the Budget talks about £1.6
billion for an industrial strategy, including the aerospace institute,

you must build on your strengths. In Britain, we have outstanding
academic research, so we should use that as our super-magnet to attract
industrial 
<?notus-xml column=699?>R&amp;D spending. We need to shake up the whole system of research
funding so that it attracts new business funding from companies large
and small. Today, the weight of government R&amp;D funding is
completely insufficient to support business innovation. The Technology
Strategy Board is an excellent organisation, but its budget is far too
small compared with the research councils, while the Higher Education
Innovation Fund is nowhere near enough to shape academic research
priorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000205" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000205">Next,
we need a procurement strategy that helps smaller companies invest in
innovation and hence start-ups. In the United States, that is the
biggest spur. How do we get small companies a market in order to grow?
It is so very difficult for small companies to grow because the market
is not there. The only market you can get is export, so government
procurement should be a huge help for start-ups. That means the Small
Business Research Innovation Fund must be made to work. The
Chancellor’s aim to increase the SBRI budget from £40
million to £200 million by 2015 is welcome, but represents only
a tiny shift in overall
funding.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000206" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000206">Finally,
we should establish a “one-stop shop” approach for
industrial innovation budgets, with a sectoral or challenge theme. I
have long been an advocate for government demonstrators and grand
challenges as a catalyst for innovation. The Government have
identified eight priority technology areas and have allocated them
£600 million of capital funding. However, there is
always a temptation for such programmes to minimise
industrial partnerships. Businesses are awkward customers
for bureaucrats, refusing to fit neatly into boxes. We should make
attracting industrial innovation funding central to our grand
challenges. I believe all these government funds should require
matching financial investment from companies, with a proportion devoted
to SMEs, to ensure commercial research partnerships are at the heart of
all our innovation
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000207" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000207">Despite
all the publicity, in truth the Budget yesterday changed very little.
There was little to spend and no new plan. We saw a few tired rabbits
come out of the Chancellor’s hat, but little more. If we are to
grow, it is essential that we invest in our long-term future. That is
the real agenda for transforming our economy. Yesterday, the talk was
of mortgages, petrol and beer. The danger is that we neglect our future
for the sake of these headlines. When Governments focus on the short
term, Budgets become just another missed opportunity. I fear that after
three years of bad headlines, this Budget fits that pattern. Everything
worth while has been pushed back to after 2015. Perhaps the Chancellor
had a premonition of the future. Despite the fine words, actually
delivering sustainable growth has been postponed to the next Labour
Government. We are hungry for that

Chancellor does not appear to have learnt the lesson from that. It is
vital that we reassert the convention in Parliament that budgetary
matters are first announced to the House of Commons. There are good
reasons for that. Obviously it is the right of the House of Commons to
receive the news first, but it also prevents the risk of
market-sensitive information getting into the public domain and someone
making a fortune out of it. I was therefore very concerned by the
<I>Evening Standard</I> story last night. I have to say that, obviously
in a post-Leveson mood, it made an abject apology in later editions for
what was on the front page of the first edition, and that is to be
welcomed. It emerged very clearly that it was in receipt of an
embargoed copy of the speech. I believe that is totally wrong, not
least because it discriminates between some journalists and others, and
because it endangers the basic principle. I hope the Minister will give
me an assurance that he will speak to his right honourable friend the
Chancellor and ensure that that practice is abandoned forthwith and
that the traditional view—which was exemplified by Hugh Dalton
when he resigned as Chancellor when all he did was to have a quick word

proposals, both of them, which will ensure that there is a higher
degree of growth than there would otherwise be. The Minister, in a
speech that gave the impression that he wrote it himself, rightly said
that there are risks here. It is not clear, if one is going to give
guarantees to homebuyers—if one is going to subsidise in this
way—that they are really able to meet the responsibilities of
taking out a mortgage. We do not want to go back to the disasters of
Northern Rock and so on, of which many of us in this House bear the

very much welcome the proposal about helping small businesses by

turn to the main point with which we are all concerned: the deficit.
The Minister referred to it. What was clear from the business about the
AAA rating and so on is that we have to press ahead. It is very good
news that the slogan that had been emerging, “We have cut the
deficit by a quarter”, can now be changed to “We have cut
the deficit to a third”, but it still means that we are
continuing to borrow more at two-thirds of the rate that the previous,
disastrous, Labour Government were maintaining. Therefore, we need to
look very carefully at what is being
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000215" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0001.htm#13032165000215">If I may
make a rather semantic point, in his speech the Chancellor referred to
“cutting borrowing”. He should, of course, have said,
“We have been successful 
<?notus-xml column=701?>in cutting extra borrowing”. Total borrowing continues to go up,
and that is of serious concern, not least in relation to monetary
policy. It is very important that we look at the new relationship that
appears to be developing with the Bank of England. I was always very
sceptical of what was always hailed as Gordon Brown’s great
achievement of giving independence to the Bank of England because it
means that we are handing over more and more power to a small group of
people who are totally unaccountable with regard to one of the two main
levers of economic management. I hope that we can make progress on
this.</hs_para>

Chancellor is making, we certainly need to look at the inflation target
and at whether other considerations can be taken into account. Having
said that, it would be helpful to move now from what was just an
interest rate policy for many years after the Gordon Brown change to a
policy that is concerned with controlling the money supply, which is
what one really means by “a monetary policy”. I remain a
strong supporter of quantitative easing despite the unfortunate
side-effects, particularly on private sector pension schemes and so on.
If one is not able to do anything because of the deficit problem on the
fiscal side, we really must have an active monetary policy. In that
context, greater co-ordination between the Treasury and new Bank
governor will be of crucial
importance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T13:30:45"></hs_TimeCode>. As I
have said time and again, and I commend this to my noble friend on the
Front Bench, it is absurd that the Treasury is working to one set of
economic forecasts and the Bank of England to another. We should have a
more unified policy on the link between the monetary and fiscal sides

however, the Chancellor has done everything that could possibly have
been done to be helpful, to stimulate growth and to ensure that we
continue to do so. However, we must continue to do all that we can to
cut the deficit. Immediately after the election and the formation of
the coalition, I stressed how incredibly difficult this was going to be
on both the tax and expenditure sides. I have been proved absolutely

Kestenbaum:</Member></B> My Lords, today’s debate in your
Lordships’ House increasingly reflects a wider and urgent
economic debate in chambers around the world. At one end of the
argument, there is a fundamental belief, as we have just heard, that
debt reduction for its own sake will eventually clear the path for
strong growth. The alternative view is that debt reduction for its own
purpose is not only an all too narrow goal but is destined to fail
unless economic growth is pursued with equal and relentless

said that our focus on the deficit does not mean that we cannot attend
to growth as well, that focus does not feel equally spread. With
yesterday’s slashing of growth forecasts, we are beginning to
confront the painful reality that the latter argument 
<?notus-xml column=702?>prevails. The evidence is sadly clear that the multiplier effect of
austerity, its economic misery, let alone the human cost, is more
severe than even the Office for Budget Responsibility had warned. In
short, austerity as a fixed policy in the sand, and in the absence of a
well constructed, ambitious, aggressive tapestry of active government,
will never produce growth. However much pain is administered, however
deep the incision of cuts, ultimately the failure genuinely and
aggressively to grow the economy will lead to the failure to balance
the books. The evidence was announced yesterday. At a time of
unparalleled spending cuts, paradoxically, the UK’s national
debt will rise to 85% of

imperative is growth—we are all united in
that—and we know that it does not travel through austerity for
its own sake, what might we expect from active government? The first
thing is to dispense finally with the tired false choice of
either a constant flurry of well intentioned interventions or staying,
as we have heard in recent years, firmly out of the way. We
must lay to rest the myth which says that you have a pro-growth
environment only if government leave the stage. We urgently need
intelligent and active economic policy which nurtures—indeed,
drives—growth. Look at the most imaginative global economies,
our real competitors: the United States, Finland, Korea and Israel.
They all have large measures of supportive public policy and effective
financing mechanisms—in short, active, aggressive,

exactly what the engine of growth will be. We know now how clearly the
path travels from innovation to economic growth. We know the facts.
Innovative businesses create more jobs and grow faster.
Hence, innovation as a national strategy is the most
important driver of long-term productivity and prosperity. Yet, despite
this, NESTA’s innovation index showed that innovation and
investment in innovation declined by as much as £24
billion last year. This was at a time when we also know from
the same index that fast-growing, innovative businesses make a
disproportionate contribution to our national fortune. Just 7% of
businesses in the UK, classified as high-growth and
innovative, have been responsible for half of the new jobs in the past
decade. The evidence conclusively shows that innovative,
high-growth firms will produce the jobs of the future. They

road to growth travels through innovation, what might we expect from
those with their hands on the policy levers, which the Minister dubbed

financial crisis offers the chance to put in place on a serious scale
often talked of plans to channel large parts of the £220 billion
government procurement budget to innovative businesses. As my noble
friend Lord Bhattacharyya said, the announcement yesterday about the
SBRI—the programme which drives government businesses to
innovation—is certainly welcome and using the TSB as the
catalyst is wise. However, the quantum is a pinprick in comparison to
the opportunity and the need. The target yesterday was merely
£100 million of redirected existing budgets in an annual spend

bring this part of our national effort to real scale, such that active
government purchasing will have great and lasting impact on the
innovation economy in society more broadly? We know—we have seen

Last year we had the Government making U-turn after U-turn, and the
criticism that the Treasury had not thought things through or listened.
This time, the Budget has so much in it that shows that the Government
are genuinely trying to listen. For a long time, many of us have been
saying that employers’ national insurance is a tax on jobs and
that it should be removed and reduced for new businesses and SMEs, and
the Government have listened and shown that in their NI
initiatives in the Budget. Of course, they should go further, but this
is a great start. Our fuel

previous Government, increasing the price of beer above inflation for
years. There has been a tireless campaign by the British
Beer and Pub Association and the Campaign for Real Ale, and the work of
Andrew Griffiths, the MP for Burton, where I was yesterday with my

but the reality is that we are two years away from an election, and
this was the Chancellor’s last chance. The political reality
sadly overshadows everything. We all know that the situation is so bad
that we need drastic measures. Getting down to a 20% corporation tax is
fantastic news, but we know, for example, that Ireland has gone down to

reality is that although the Government have reduced the deficit, they
promised to eliminate it by the end of Parliament in 2015. We all know
that they will be nowhere near achieving that, and the noble Lord, Lord
Eatwell, who is not in his place, spelled that out clearly. Public
sector net debt is predicted to double from £800 billion at the
start of this Parliament to more than £1.6 trillion by 2017-18.
Just this year alone, in spite of seeing the lowest ever interest
rates, the Government’s debts will cost the taxpayer nearly
£50 billion. That is far more than the entire defence budget.
The reality is that the Government’s austerity plans for the
past three years have not worked, because they were based on
projections that showed that the 
<?notus-xml column=705?>economy would be growing at 3% a year by now. We know not just that
growth has been slow but that the economy has been flatlining or been
in recession. The reality is that the OBR has halved its growth

probably have done the same: ring-fencing certain areas of the Budget

ring-fencings together, it makes up well over 50% of the Budget, which
means that what you can cut is under 50% of the Budget. In defence, for
example, although the Government are helping the Armed Forces by giving
the fines raised from the banks’ LIBOR scandal to the Armed
Forces charities, which is terrific, and increasing the pay of those in
the services by 1.5%, the reality is that in real terms all our
workforce is being squeezed. Inflation has been well over 2% for three
years, and real wages for all the people in this country will have
seriously shrunk over the course of this Parliament. People are worse

We still regard growth as something that will happen automatically, or
as something that we deserve. In retrospect, it is clear that some of
the growth that occurred between 1992 and 2007 was unsustainable. A lot
of it was engendered by easy credit and occurred mainly at the
consumption end. Therefore, it was not sustainable. If we are to have
growth again, as we will one of these days, let us make sure that it
follows structural improvement in the economy and is not credit-driven

is not much to say about the Budget because it does not do very much.
In the OBR and elsewhere, much emphasis is laid on public sector
borrowing and public sector debt. However, we also have the problem of
household debt. We have not done enough about the deleveraging of
household debt. A chart on page 56 of the OBR report lays down the debt
equity ratio of households and the ratio of debt servicing charges to
household income. In my view, both those figures show that we are
deleveraging far too slowly. Indeed, as the projection shows, the debt
equity ratio will go 
<?notus-xml column=707?>up in the near future. The debt servicing charge income—the
income leverage ratio—shows somewhat good results but that is
because of QE, which has depressed interest rates, so the cost of
servicing household debt is that much
lower<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T13:52:07"></hs_TimeCode>. That
phenomenon should have danger signs attached to it because a lot of

postpones deleveraging. However, we have chosen to concentrate on
public sector debt reduction and not to worry about household debt
reduction. I hope that the Minister will comment on the fact that the
household debt deleveraging problem is not being tackled by the
Government to the extent that it should be. In that regard, I am
alarmed by the house purchasing initiative. One of the great problems
that we have experienced in the British economy, not just recently but
for many decades, is that of overinvestment in housing. We have
incentivised people to buy houses as opposed to other assets. Like many
other economies, we got caught in a housing bubble and have regretted

had hoped that the Government would encourage renting to a much greater

that devolving power from Whitehall in such key areas as transport,

it is important that devolution is real. An example of my concern about
the impact of centralised power is the Highways Agency. Sometimes it is
claimed that planning gets delayed because councils are slow. Actually,
the problem often lies with government agencies. As an example, the
Highways Agency is not regionally accountable and is charged
exclusively with keeping traffic flowing, regardless of wider economic
or social issues. It has a power to stop planning permissions. The
immediate solution, requiring no legislation, is for the Highways
Agency to have to obtain the Minister’s approval before it uses
its power to stop a planning application. The real solution is to give
the power to localities to decide for themselves on such matters, as
part of a general devolution of
power.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000252" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000252">On
getting Britain building again, the help to buy scheme should boost
confidence; something needs to. There were only 98,000 starts in
England last year and yet 230,000 households are formed each year. The
numbers on housing waiting lists, the rise in demand for temporary
accommodation and high rents in the private sector also point to the
social and economic benefit of building more homes at below market
rates. Councils, and their arm’s-length management
organisations where they exist, have the capacity to build more homes,
given that council housing is now self-financing. They could raise
£7 billion and build up to 60,000 more homes over five years,
contributing 0.6% to GDP in the process. That could be done very simply
if the Government removed the borrowing cap on housing revenue
accounts, relying instead on a prudential borrowing code to guarantee
that only sustainable investment got the

There is scope for additional borrowing against the asset represented

to be careful about public borrowing levels, relaxing the housing
borrowing cap need not be counted as public sector borrowing any
longer. The UK uses a much wider measure of public debt than other
countries. Council housing is now a trading activity, and international
regulations already permit this to be discounted from government
borrowing levels. Unfortunately, the UK does not currently adopt such
an approach, and I remain puzzled as to why
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000254" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000254">This

We need to manufacture more, export more and build more on our

the troika—the European Central Bank, the IMF and the
Commission—should have agreed a package of measures that
involved a levy on deposits in Cyprus’s banks: 6.5% on deposits
under €100,000 and 9.9% on those above €100,000. That
flew in the face of the EU-wide recognition that deposits in banks up

case noble Lords feel that I am being alarmist, or that Cyprus is a
mere minnow and we should not worry about it, I would remind them of a
little history. On 11 May 1931, the small Austrian Creditanstalt bank
failed. That triggered the financial collapse of central Europe. By 13
July, the German Danat-Bank collapsed and all German banks closed until
4 August. Between 19 and 24 August, we had a major economic crisis in
Britain. Five days of Cabinet meetings failed to agree the spending
cuts demanded by American bankers at the time, and that led to the
collapse of the Labour Government. We cannot play these games with the
eurozone trying to have it both ways. Only a few months ago, eurozone
Ministers declared that they must absolutely make sure that in future
there was no confusion between sovereign debt and bank debt. For Cyprus
they have again produced a formula that has done precisely that. It is
not surprising that the banks in Cyprus are
closed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000257" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000257">What
is the answer to that? The Chancellor pointed out that 40% of our
exports are to Europe. I suggest that the Government do everything they
can—Parliament as well—to focus the eyes of exporters
beyond Europe. Let us make much more effort about Asia and probably
also Latin America. They should become a real priority. I am not saying
that the Government can do that: the Government cannot make exports but
they can at least propose that as a strategic aim. We must take
advantage of the Asian market. We have the inestimable advantage of
having special links with Hong Kong, which is the financial centre of
Asia. It is the third most important financial centre in the world
after London and New York. That is something we really must look at and
quickly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000258" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000258">I
will quickly mention one or two other points. The shift in the
responsibilities of the MPC is very interesting. It will become much
more like the Fed. That is a very  
<?notus-xml column=711?>big responsibility and I hope it can measure up to that. It was right to
stimulate the economy with some extra expenditure, but only £3
billion was given. Why so little an amount?</hs_para>

mistake that the Chancellor made: the fuel tax. That was tempting
politics but damned bad economics. Cancelling the fuel tax
increases has already cost, by the Chancellor’s own
figure, £6 billion. It looks as though, if it
continues at this rate, it could cost up to £20 billion by the
end of this Parliament. That is not a sensible way of spending
money—the opportunity cost is extremely high—first,
because it is being done in little slices of 3p and, as everyone knows,
3p is less than the variation in petrol or diesel prices between pumps.
Secondly, all vehicles are becoming much more efficient. A vehicle that
previously did 30 miles to the gallon now regularly does 40
miles to the gallon. There is therefore a natural and desirable trend
for less fuel consumption as fuel costs rise. The United States would
not be having its huge financial problems if it taxed road fuel at a
sensible level.</hs_para>

fragile. The noble Lord, Lord Desai, referred to domestic debt; there
is still £55 billion of credit card debt held by
British banks. That is not the money that you and I spend each month
and pay off; it is overrun debt on which the rates of interest are
anything between 17% and 25%. The chance of it being paid back is
remote, and the question that one must ask is: at what price do the
banks have that debt on their balance sheets? If they have it at
anything like par, that represents a serious danger. The banks sold off
some of that debt about three years ago at rates of between 8p and 12p

are in a difficult economic situation. Some noble Lords have explained
that this is because the Government’s plans to stimulate,
rebalance and grow the economy are clearly not working. Yet we are told
that there is no alternative and that one day the policy will
work—but at what cost? The highly respected Trussell Trust
expects the number of people in the 
<?notus-xml column=712?>north-west using food banks to rise to more than 230,000. That is the

noble Lords, Lord Flight and Lord Bilimoria, spoke of exports. The
Government have tried to help them through devaluation. However, that
does not really work any more. A lot of our exports are made up partly
of imports and that does little for productivity. According to the Bank
of England’s analysis, the major economies in the eurozone have
seen their exports grow faster since 2009 than has Britain. Why? It is
partly because of the drop in exports of financial services but also
because those economies have not been able to devalue because they are
tied to the euro. Their only alternative is to produce more goods and
services that others want to buy. Here, devaluation allows some firms
to stay in business and become “zombies”. Is this why
employment is increasing but productivity is plunging?</hs_para>

firms are retaining skilled labour in the hope of better times to come.
Meanwhile, those people are not as productive as they might be. Also,
firms may be investing in things other than plant and
buildings—investments that are not being measured. They are
so-called intangibles such as investing in business processes and
systems, writing new and better software, enhancing their brand and
investing in new concepts such as big data. Has the Minister seen the
research that shows that this kind of investment is growing but not
counted?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000267" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000267">The
Government also have to be realistic about the fact that the financial
sector is changing, not only because of the loss of trust through
mis-selling, excessive pay and market manipulation but because much of
its business has become trading value. Trading in value is a zero-sum
game—some get richer and some get poorer—whereas trading
in goods and services that people want and need benefits everyone.
Trading value as our major economic activity cannot be the right
course, and people have now realised this. As my noble friend Lord
Eatwell put it, that is why the Government have to put far more
emphasis on trading in goods and services that people want and need.
That is where our efforts should be going in this

has consistently maintained and supported the fundamental planks of a
modern industrial strategy, the strategy that my noble friend Lord
Kestenbaum described, involving skills, technology, innovation,
procurement, infrastructure, finance and supply chains—a policy
that can be roughly described as the Heseltine view. That view was
expressed in his report and debated in your Lordships’ House on
6 December last year. In that debate, nearly all speakers welcomed his
recommendations, and the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, did so today. They
welcomed the active role of the state in promoting economic growth

we would now be in a healthier economic position. We have admirably cut
our deficit by a third and seen more than 1 million new private sector
jobs created. However, the wider global situation, particularly in the
eurozone, remains such that full recovery is still some way off and the
continued growth downgrades have been inevitable. Above all else, what

was an announcement relating to a Treasury electricity tax that could
significantly undermine money saved by those measures. The carbon floor
price was announced in 2011 and will start to be added to electricity

cost of carbon pollution to provide a benefit for lower-carbon sources
of electricity. It is claimed to be necessary because the market price
for carbon, set by the balance of supply and demand for carbon
emissions at a European level, has crashed to very low levels, failing
to incentivise investment. To address this, the Treasury has invented a
top-up tax, which is intended steadily to increase the cost of carbon
pollution over this

reasons why the Government’s carbon floor price is such a bad
idea are numerous and have been pointed out repeatedly since it was
first mooted. Opponents include business groups, consumer groups and
green groups. Everyone appears not to like this policy. The first
obvious problem is that the tax fails to do anything for the
environment. It does not deliver any additional environmental outcomes.
The emissions it targets are already capped at an EU level and simply
doing something here means that our emissions saved will be traded away
across Europe.</hs_para>

second, blindingly obvious, problem is that being unilateral it damages
UK competitiveness at a time when we need to be boosting our
competitiveness. Electricity prices are an essential input to virtually
all economic activity. Steep rises in prices increase everyone’s
costs and are inflationary. It is no wonder that the Budget yesterday
appeared to be indicating to the Bank of England to go soft on meeting
the inflation target. But the effect of this policy is likely to make
it harder than ever to bring it under
control.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000292" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000292">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:31:42"></hs_TimeCode>
third problem is that rather than paying electricity companies when
they invest in new low-carbon projects that come on stream, as the
renewables obligation does and as the contracts for difference will,
the carbon tax simply pushes up wholesale prices of electricity for
everyone, rewarding those who have already invested for doing nothing
new. It is a huge windfall for projects that have already received
generous subsidies, be they existing wind farms or old nuclear power
stations. This is of course good news for some generators but bad news
for industry and consumers, who are paying twice for no good reason.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:32:15"></hs_TimeCode> floor price
is intended in a not-very-clear way to give investors confidence.

sledgehammer to crack a nut and even then it may not be successful.
Coal is experiencing something of a reversal of fortunes thanks to
lower global prices as unused coal from the US enters the market. This,
combined with high European prices for gas, is causing us to burn more
coal. The disparity between the two fuels is so great in cost that even
the hefty carbon floor price may not be enough to switch us out of it.
It requires something in the region of a £30 a tonne carbon
price for us to do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000295" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000295">What
would Labour have done differently? First, we know that investors in
low-carbon electricity infrastructure are absolutely necessary for
getting this country back to growth. They need policy certainty, which
is why we are committed to introducing a decarbonisation target for the
electricity sector. The Government have failed to acknowledge this and
are proposing to wait until 2016 before doing so. We would also use
simpler policies, such as the energy performance standard to secure the
steady phasing out of unabated coal and usher in carbon capture and

Conservative MEPs in Brussels are mustering to rebel in a vote in April

recent years have kept on saying that public sector is bad and wicked,
and private sector is good, and that we should rely on the private
sector to respond to the inaction of the Government, but that never
works. We all know that, and the evidence is there. Huge global
corporations will make their decisions irrespective of what national
Governments do. Facebook would not be particularly responsive to
particular individual national Governments in the world, for obvious
reasons, and neither would Microsoft, although the national
subsidiaries in different countries respond to some national government
decisions, as we know. Equally, sometimes very high-tech innovative
companies in different countries themselves make their own decisions
and have particularly good fortune such as very strong bank support and
other access to capital, which enables them to be free-floating and not
respond to government. However, in the vast majority of businesses,
whatever their size, and in particular small companies, the reality is
that you wait until the Government are expanding the economy. That is

Government were not being that generous. Here we are, over a century
later, and yet the liability to the public purse on pensions has
resulted in an estimated £5 trillion of pension promises. I am
not for one minute suggesting that we ban the state pension. However, I
am worried about the implementation of Dilnot in putting a cap on the
cost of care for elderly people. I know that that is not a popular
thing to say. We would all like to do it and I am sure that most noble
Lords have been through that situation on a domestic front with elderly
relatives. It is very difficult. However, I must say to my noble friend
that, rather like the state pension when it was first introduced, I am
not convinced that we have the money, and particularly that we do not
have the money at this moment, to underwrite that type of benefit in
order to preserve the properties of the property-owning democracy. That
is a strange thing for a Conservative to say. However, that I have to
think twice about this shows the serious position that I believe the

the banks is poor at the moment, and that that is affecting

add a few words to this debate in the gap. I spoke for two minutes in a
Question for Short Debate on 11 December last year on the impact of
multinational companies’ financial practices and UK tax
policies. I shall not speak for longer now on the same subject, not

support the plea of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Bristol
earlier on this same subject. In replying to a debate on 11 December,
my noble friend Lord Marland, at col. 1050 of <I>Hansard</I>, said that
DfID had averaged expenditure of £20 million per annum over a
five years to support tax regimes throughout the world. He went on to
identify specifically DfID spending £11 million in Sierra Leone,
£8 million in Tanzania, £8 million in Rwanda, where the
tax take rose six-fold, and £21 million in Afghanistan, where
the tax take used to be 4% and has now gone up to 11%. DfID is, with

reverend Prelate the Bishop of Bristol, who emphasised the progress
towards the aid target of 0.7% of GDP, which this Government have
fulfilled. It was driven towards strongly by the preceding

note of agreement—I am certainly happy with it and I get the
impression from the debate that this might be so across the
House—is that, as my noble friend Lord Desai said, this Budget
does not do anything very much. That is certainly the case because the
Chancellor has placed himself within a straitjacket and there is not
much he can do when he is so constrained by his singular commitment to
one objective Of course, no one underestimates the challenges facing
the Chancellor. We all know the difficulties over the debt and that
external forces, particularly the difficulties in the eurozone, our
largest overseas customer, do not help exports and the potential for an
emergence from this crisis through export-led growth.</hs_para>

ever since suggesting that there were difficulties other than those
attributed to the Labour Administration struggling with the problems of

manifestations of crisis were in the United States, and subsequently in
Europe, before Northern Rock reached a pitch at which we had to act.

emphasised their support for these measures. The noble Baroness, Lady
Kramer, quoted the Business Secretary as having expressed these views

the <I>New Statesman</I>? It is because he thought it was read by a
thoughtful, constructive audience who had already been campaigning for
an emphasis on housebuilding to inject some demand into the
economy and some earnings into the construction industry. We all know

the Minister will respond to the questions addressed to him by my noble

Government’s view, will the guarantee scheme mean for house
prices? What is the cost of the scheme over the three-year period that
it is meant to obtain? How much dead weight is involved in the scheme?
Will there be support for purchases that have already been made? I hope
the Minister will address these points, if only because anxieties about

have questions as to whether the Chancellor has matched up to the

point of marginality. The Chancellor has failed to hit every target
that he identified when he first took office. Of course, I recognise
that one or two elements in this Budget have found favour. The noble
Lord, Lord Bilimoria, declaring his interest, mentioned that a penny
off the pint of beer was most welcome. I cannot think how many pubs
will be saved by a reduction in the price of beer by 0.3%. However, I

the noble Lord identified them very clearly. That aspect may gain the
Chancellor a little short-term credibility but it raises considerable
problems. The Chancellor will be aware that these little gimmicks to

desperate sections of our community, among the poor, who have of course
been subject to the Government’s unremitting ideological
onslaught on welfare, but it also reaches right across the community

problem with the Budget is that it is all jam tomorrow—or not
tomorrow, in fact, but some 700 days after tomorrow. It is two years

perhaps I may also emphasise the anxieties expressed by my noble friend
Lady Worthington on the question of electricity prices. There are
within this Budget and in the Government’s policies hidden costs
that will manifest themselves in the most appalling way; that is,
directly on those who are least well able to cope with them. Unless one
is in a position to invest significantly, the consumption of

this situation without paying attention to growth. My noble friends
pointed out that at last the penny is beginning to drop in government
to a marginal extent, but for the past three years there has been an
unremitting commitment to one objective to the exclusion of any
considered investment related to growth. That is why we consider that

about development in the regions and the problem of the domination of
London, it is worth recalling that one of the first acts of this
Government was to destroy the regional development agencies. I

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords for their
excellent contributions. I am still new enough in my job to find myself
taking copious notes with lots of ideas to follow up on, so I welcome
the debate. 
<?notus-xml column=725?>I may have a bias in my listening, but I have to say that the
broad sense of the contributions suggests that this is a well crafted
Budget that has delivered very well what can be delivered, given what I
think everyone accepts is limited room for manoeuvre. The noble Lord,
Lord Desai, said that once you have established a strategy you should
stick to it so that people should not expect enormous deviation from
one annual Budget to the
next<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:05:48"></hs_TimeCode>. I shall
try to address the questions and issues that have arisen, and I shall
do that in terms of subject matter so that there is some coherence
rather than moving from one contributor to the next. I hope that that
is acceptable to noble

not hear a compelling case for an alternative strategy to that which
the Government have in place. We have pointed to the many exposures
that would occur should we embark on another spending spree without
getting the budget under control. I should point out that the OBR
borrowing forecast shows a fall in every year of the forecast both in
cash terms and as a percentage of GDP, and that is both with and
without some of the special one-off changes such as the APF transfers.
I concede that borrowing is falling more slowly than we would like, but
that is because of the economic challenges and because we are allowing
what the <I>Economist</I> has described as the “automatic
stabilisers” to operate. Over the past three years, the UK has
cut the structural deficit more than any other G7
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:07:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

such as the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, for example, talked about
bringing down the level of public expenditure as a proportion of
national income. I can confirm that the OBR forecast takes total
managed expenditure down to, I think, 40.5% of GDP by 2017-18, which is
the same level as it was in 2004-05. Several speakers, including my
noble friend Lady Browning and the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, asked
about the cost of borrowing. I can confirm that a 1% rise in government
borrowing costs would add just over £8 billion to the annual
debt interest by 2017-18. That provides some perspective on the risks
we are trying to
manage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:08:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

discussion about the impact of our weak export markets, the opportunity
to switch into faster growing ones, and how important conditions have
been weighing against us. The OBR expects the euro area to contract by
0.5% in 2013, which follows a decline of 0.5% in 2012. Let me give
noble Lords an example. In the year to the fourth quarter of 2012,
goods export volumes to the EU fell by 2.5%, while our exports to
non-EU areas grew by 1.2%. That gives a sense of the

of international comparisons, particularly by the noble Lord, Lord
Eatwell. With respect to Germany, I would just point out that the IMF
has forecast that the UK will grow faster than Germany in both 2013 and
2014. With respect to the United States, our employment at just over
70% is now higher than in the US, where it is just over 67%. Those are
some measures on which we are actually performing more
strongly.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032165000341" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000341">On
monetary policy, I think the general mood of the debate was that noble
Lords welcome a good and thorough review of this important area. I
absolutely 
<?notus-xml column=726?>take on board the observations of my noble friend Lady Kramer, who

review. I also take on board the observations of my noble friend Lord

well as a number of other noble Lords. The Government are extremely
interested in trying to get this right. The general sense that I got
from the contributions was that while the ideas and policies are right,
their scale, urgency and effective implementation need to be addressed
with what I would describe as a private sector zeal. That is what I am
in government trying to impart. The more we can accomplish that the
better it will be. I would point to the money that has been applied to
our world-leading sectors, in particular the aerospace industry. A
number of noble Lords also referred to the importance of our science
and research infrastructure. I absolutely accept those comments. In my
own area of trying to define and improve our infrastructure, I am
working with my right honourable friend the Minister for Business and
Enterprise on incorporating the science base in the same way as we
think about our digital or transport infrastructure. The utilisation of
the Government’s own purchasing power as a way of incubating
promising businesses is also an extremely valuable idea which the

noble friend Lord Flight reminded us of the structural change in the UK

very large and, certainly in recent years, mainly declining—you
can identify in the rump of the economy some extremely promising

strong emerging markets. Between 2009 and 2012 the UK’s exports
to Brazil increased by 49%, to Russia by 133%, to India by 59% and to
China by 96%. Those are very large numbers but, of course, come off

the interests of time, I will move on to infrastructure. First, I
confirm to the House that the Government are taking a long-term
approach to capital spending as part of the 2015-16 round. That is why
we have set in place the extra £3 billion a year, and we will
also plan for a longer period than is customarily the case at the
Treasury. In my view, one of the problems with the
historical approach to capital spending has been the relatively short
periods forward for which it is committed, which does not suit the
longer gestation periods of some of the projects that it is intended to
support. The plan of this Government is to fix that. Of course, that is
on top of additional investments in capital spending in the Autumn

we had a number of interesting contributions around the initiatives

highly stimulative to the economy. It is an area where you can get
things moving quite quickly so in that respect it is a powerful
initiative in the Budget. On the other hand, there was much wise
counsel, and I certainly share the caution about how this is
implemented to ensure that we both understand and manage the risks
involved. In answer to the question from the noble Lord, Lord Desai,

for the Government when they confront us with a Bill that is wholly
retrospective in nature and which they are intent on fast-tracking

in a terrible mess because their ESE regulations purporting to
introduce certain employment and training schemes have been struck down
by the Court of Appeal as ultra vires and because the court judged that
notices given to individuals under those regulations were inadequate.
The Government ignored the advice of the Social Security Advisory
Committee and, as we have heard, have not taken on board the comments
of the Merits Committee and the history of defective drafting that the
Minister acknowledged. I say as an aside that a longer-term issue
arises from this about how we scrutinise secondary legislation,

regulations promulgated in the same manner. As we have heard, the
Government have sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, which may

those sanctions which are and were at the time unlawful to become

confirming penalties on individuals who, according to
judicial decision, have not transgressed any lawful rule is
constitutionally appropriate in terms of the rule
of law. Perhaps the Minister can help us on this point. On what basis
do the Government consider that the rule of law should be set aside in
these circumstances? Is it the belief that individuals would have
somehow got off on a technicality, that the cost

also strongly hold to the view that benefit claimants have rights but
also responsibilities and that it is entirely reasonable for
conditionality—the obligation to engage—to apply, and
that a sanctions regime should underpin this. However, that sanctions
regime should be reasonable, proportionate and transparent. In this
regard, the amendment to the Bill in the other place which
provides for an independent review of the sanctions regime, secured
only by the interventions of my right honourable friends Liam Byrne and
Stephen Timms, is vital. We plan to build on this in Committee to
secure a wider review. We do this in particular because of a growing
unease about the extended use of sanctions, beyond their
role of underpinning conditionality, as a means of controlling benefit
expenditure. As Stephen Timms pointed out in another place, there is
growing evidence that it is the proliferation of sanctions which is
driving the explosion of food banks across our country and, like him,
will wish to secure that any review covers a range of matters,
especially how sanctions are being applied to individuals who have a
mental health or other fluctuating

we have to live with retrospection then we need to ensure that there is
a robust appeals procedure. Again we should be grateful for the

commitment in the Bill. We will use our time in Committee to explore
the extent of this commitment. The principle in this regard ought to be
that individuals are in no worse position than they would have been in
respect of appeals, hardship, good cause, mitigation than they would
have been had the sanctions been properly made originally. For
“stockpile” cases, where a sanction has not yet been
applied, we need certainty on which regime is to be applied, as of

apply in relation to good cause or good reason when a sanction is
activated some time after the failure to comply? What would
have been contemporary evidence at the earlier time may be
more difficult to adduce subsequently. Similarly, in relation to
mitigation, what might have been possible earlier may be

before I do that I want to make a few comments on the amendment before
us today. When I first read the amendment’s text last evening,
when it was produced, I had a bit of a flashback to earlier student
days when you had composite Motions and amendments and the call for
separate votes to be able to unpick the various parts. While I
acknowledge that there are issues fundamental to this Bill that need to
be raised, they are appropriately the issues that would and should be
raised in Committee on Monday. I expect that we will deal with those
issues, so the amendment as a composite presents a very difficult
picture for people to decide upon. However, there is one crucial factor
running throughout the amendment: the issues raised by the Constitution
Committee of this House on retrospection and fast-tracking. Before I
ask my noble friend to comment on that, I refer to two paragraphs in
the Constitution Committee’s report—the last in respect
of retrospection, and paragraph 12, which
says:</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13032165000483" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000483">“it

it will probably be Parliament that has to decide how it does those
things in the light of any subsequent changes brought about by the

said already. There are important lessons to learn from these problems

way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000402" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000402">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:53:45"></hs_TimeCode>
court determined on narrow issues and on insufficient detail and
content of the schemes and regulations, and that the notices given to
claimants did not specify the range of sanctions that could be used,
but it upheld the policy intentions of the Government’s work
schemes and backed the right to require people to take part in
programmes that would help to set them into work. Up to 1 September
last year, 200,000 people found work through the Government’s
Work Programme. Appropriate work experience is a good thing, and it
helps to build the confidence of jobseekers. Increasing employment
levels in our country since May 2010 have meant that since that time
nearly 250,000 fewer people now claim out-of-work benefits, in a period
of huge economic
difficulty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:54:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:54:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:54:13"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, I 
<?notus-xml column=737?>wish to discuss the operation of these schemes. We know that there are
no targets and no league tables for Jobcentre Plus on sanctions.
Therefore, the key question I want to probe is how we can better
undertake these tasks, which is fundamental to ensuring that we get the
best out of existing
programmes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:54:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000403" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000403">We
know from the evidence provided by the DWP that the overwhelming
majority of those who have been on the Work Programme are satisfied
with it, but, of course, there is always room for improvement.
Three-quarters of those who attended the programme said that they
believed they were more attractive to potential employers and that
their personal confidence had increased as a result. That is a powerful
outcome for a group of people who are some distance from the labour
market. Clearly, the majority think that they have got closer to it.
However, the programmes could offer better outcomes in many cases. The
first of these areas concerns engagement with the third sector.
When the main contractors were appointed to run
the Work Programme, there was much discussion about subcontracting to
the third sector. I would be grateful if, when he sums up, my noble
friend could tell us to what extent that engagement has occurred given
the unusual skills of people in the third sector in dealing with
individuals who find themselves in

second area that we ought to probe is the change of culture within
Jobcentre Plus. There is a balance to be struck between codifying
everything passed on to the JCP and giving advisers the discretion to
interpret issues in the light of claimants’ circumstances. There
is a question to be asked about the level of top-down instruction,
which in the past has been very much the way of working. I looked up
the instruction manual to ascertain what constitutes good reason or
good cause for people not undertaking to do things they have been asked
to do. You can read through 16 pages of guidance, plus another chapter.
However, if you ask people in general what they would do in such
circumstances, they reveal an all-embracing understanding of the
issues. It is a very complex area and a vigorous interpretation of the
guidance has led to the problems being experienced in some offices,
particularly in relation to targets for sanctions, which have been
mentioned
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:59:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000405" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000405">Ministers
have had to come down hard on clear misinterpretation, but have

a critical cultural change. There must be a role in all this for
flexibility, discretion and
sensitivity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:57:36"></hs_TimeCode>. The
legal case behind today’s Bill has thrown up other cases. As
regards the cultural shift that Ministers have outlined, a basic
structure needs to be provided vis-à-vis the way Work Programme
claimants are handled. That structure should have three components.
First, there should be a meeting with the provider or JCP contractor.
Often there is no face to face meeting between the provider and the

about their future needs. Those needs should be clearly communicated
and agreed. The outcome also needs to be agreed between both parties,

important to try to fit the placement to the person. It is important to

needed that suits the requirements of both

Thirdly, the Government should not get in the way of serious job
opportunities. They need to give people space to find their own
placements. Just yesterday, I heard a case of someone with a
qualification in photography who was offered a job in a do-it-yourself
shop but found a more appropriate placement in a photography shop,
which was accepted as an appropriate placement. I welcome the
independent review process. We now need to see new detailed terms of
reference. I always make the plea to my noble friend the Minister that
any evaluation, rather than being considered a milestone, should be
rolling so that you can learn lessons as information comes before you.
I hope that we will hear more about that later. I look
forward to hearing the Minister meet the concerns of the Constitution
Committee, but otherwise I am happy to support the

Pannick:</Member></B> My Lords, this Bill contravenes two fundamental
constitutional principles. First, it is being fast-tracked through
Parliament when there is no justification whatever for doing so.
Secondly, the Bill breaches the fundamental constitutional principle
that penalties should not be imposed on persons by reason of conduct
that was lawful at the time of their action. Of course, Parliament may
do whatever it likes—Parliament is sovereign—but the Bill
is, I regret to say, an abuse of power that brings no credit whatever
on this
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000415" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000415">As
we have heard, this morning your Lordships’ Constitution
Committee, of which I am a member, issued a report on the Bill. We
looked at this matter yesterday, necessarily as a question of
considerable urgency. I pay particular tribute to our legal advisers,
Professor Adam Tomkins and Professor Richard Rawlings, for their
indispensable assistance. I am astonished that the Minister in his
opening remarks made no mention whatever of our report. He mentioned
other reports by other committees but he said nothing about the report
of the Constitution Committee. Are the Government not interested in the
report of the Constitution Committee on this important issue? Do they
not wish to engage with the reasoning of the Constitution Committee on
this important matter? Do they have, as the noble Lord, Lord German,
asked a few moments ago, any answer to the reasoning and conclusions of
the Constitution Committee? Surely, the House is entitled to know from
the Minister, when he opens a debate at Second Reading on these
matters, what the Government say about a report of this nature on
constitutional
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:04:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

two issues in turn—first, on the fast-tracking element of the
Bill. Your Lordships’ Constitution Committee published an
earlier report, the 15th Report of Session 2008-09, specifically on
fast-track legislation. We pointed out, as is obvious, that there are
real detriments when Parliament is asked to fast-track legislation. It
means that there is no adequate time for committees of this House and
the other place to consider and report on the implications of the
proposed legislation. It means that persons and bodies outside
Parliament have no proper opportunity to make representations to
provide information to Members of each House. It also means that
Members of the two Houses, as the Bill goes through its parliamentary
stages, have no proper opportunity to consider its implications,
propose amendments, reflect on matters and debate with Ministers
outside the Chamber as to the proper way
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:06:18"></hs_TimeCode>. For all
those reasons, it must be obvious that fast-track legislation needs a
compelling justification. It should be reserved for the most obvious
cases of emergencies that of course occur from time to time. However, a
compelling justification is needed.</hs_para>

is the position here? It is clear; on 12 February in the Court of
Appeal, the Government lost a case about jobseeker’s allowance.
That is when the judgment was handed down. What did the Government do?
They acted with commendable speed in one respect; on the very same day,
they introduced fresh regulations that cured the legal defect
prospectively from 12 February. 
<?notus-xml column=740?>The Government were able to act speedily because they knew what the
judgment was going to say; they and the other parties are told by the
Court of Appeal two or three days in advance the contents of the draft
judgment in order for them to comment. The Government were therefore
able, very properly, to act
speedily<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:07:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

issue relates to the payment of benefits to those persons who refused
to comply with the unlawful regulations prior to 12 February—the
retrospective effect. What did the Government do? They took four weeks
to address the matter. They laid the Bill before Parliament last
Thursday, 14 March. Despite the fact that they took four weeks
internally to decide what to do, they then tell Parliament—I
suppose, more accurately, they asked Parliament—to consider the
Bill within just over one week, with one day in the Commons and two
days for all stages in this House.</hs_para>

that is in the context of there being no urgency whatever for this
unseemly haste in parliamentary procedure. Why is there no urgency? It
is for this reason: the problem has been cured prospectively by the
fresh regulations. There is no urgency in relation to those denied
benefits for the period up until 12 February, the retrospective effect,
because the Secretary of State is appealing to the Supreme Court, as he
is perfectly entitled to do. The law states that while an appeal is
pending in the Supreme Court—while the Secretary of State is
seeking permission from the Supreme Court to go there—there is
no obligation on the Secretary of State to pay a penny back to the
individuals who have been denied their benefits. If your Lordships are
interested, it is Regulation 16 of the Social Security and Child
Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999, Statutory Instrument
991. Therefore, there is no immediate
urgency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:10:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Secretary of State has sought permission from the Supreme Court to
appeal there. Again, in stark contrast to the urgency with which he
requires Parliament to address this Bill, the Secretary of
State’s appeal to the Supreme Court is being conducted in the
most leisurely of fashions. I shall tell your Lordships the facts. The
Court of Appeal refused the Secretary of State’s application for
permission to appeal on 12 February—the date of the
substantive judgment. The Secretary of State has 28 days to apply to
the Supreme Court for permission to appeal. When did he make his
application? He made it 28 days later on 12 March, last
Tuesday—the day of the deadline. The form that a party fills in
when applying for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court asks
whether the proposed appellant is seeking an expedited hearing and it
contains a box for the answer. The Secretary of State ticked the box
stating

know, courts regularly order speedy hearings in urgent cases. I have
contacted the chief executive of the Supreme Court, Ms Jenny Rowe, and
she has confirmed to me what your Lordships would expect: that if an
application for expedition had been made by the Secretary of State in
this case, the Supreme Court would of course, as in any other case,
have given it careful consideration. If appropriate, the court would
have heard the matter speedily and it would, if necessary, have taken
another case out of the list to accommodate this
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:12:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

remarkable situation that the Minister is asking Parliament to
fast-track this legislation, with all the detriments that that

to pay up £130 million, or whatever the figure is, while an
appeal is pending, and even though he has taken four weeks to prepare
the legislation, and while he is conducting the appeal proceedings in
the most leisurely manner possible. Therefore, there has been a
distinct lack of urgency by Ministers in bringing the legislative
proposals before Parliament and no urgency whatever in the
Government’s approach to the appeal in the Supreme Court. The
only expedition or emergency is here in Parliament, denying us a proper
opportunity to reflect on and debate the legislative proposals in a
properly informed manner. Reference has already been made to the report
of your Lordships’ Constitution Committee. When we considered
the Bill, we set out the circumstances and concluded at paragraph
11:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13032165000468" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000468">“For

ask the Minister to answer three questions on this topic. First, what
is the urgency, given that the prospective regulations are in place and
that while an application for appeal is pending there is no duty to pay
out a single penny for the period prior to 12 February? Secondly, if
this matter is so urgent, why did it take four weeks to bring the Bill
before Parliament, and how can it possibly be justified to give
Parliament only one week to consider the issues? Thirdly, if the matter
is so urgent, why wait four weeks before seeking permission from the
Supreme Court to appeal and why not seek an urgent hearing in the
Supreme
Court<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:14:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000424" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000424">My
second objection to this Bill—I shall be more speedy on this
subject—is its substance. If the Secretary of State’s
appeal were to succeed, the problem would go away. Those denied
benefits for the period up to 12 February were correctly
denied benefit and they have no claim. But if the Supreme Court upholds
the judgment of the Court of Appeal or if, as I suspect will happen if
this Bill is enacted, the Government do not pursue an appeal, this Bill
will impose a penalty on persons who acted lawfully under the law as it
existed prior to 12 February. They are being penalised for refusing
prior to 12 February to act in a manner in which they had no legal duty
to act.</hs_para>

like my noble friend Lord McKenzie, I have been in the
Minister’s shoes. Let us be clear, therefore, that I, like him I
am sure, support work programmes that skill claimants. I remember when
one lone parent told me, “I have a future now”. I support
them as long as DWP accepts good cause or good reason when the
programmes are not appropriate. I therefore also support sanctions for
people who can and should seek work but who knowingly refuse to do so
without good cause, because without such sanctions the programmes
become merely voluntary. I support these sanctions becoming
increasingly tough so that the person knowingly refusing to comply
becomes aware of the increasingly severe consequences of their actions.
However, because I want to change behaviour and encourage good
behaviour, I support the lifting of sanctions when the individual
complies and comes 
<?notus-xml column=743?>into the Work Programme. While those sanctions last, I support a level
of hardship payments so that vulnerable people—for example,
children—have some degree of
protection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:21:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000432" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000432">Such
a simple, clear approach requires simple, clear communication with all
claimants. I would hope that that is common ground around this House
today. However, I say to the Minister that with this Bill the
Government are not simply remedying some minor technical slip-up by the
department, as Ministers would want us to believe. This Bill trespasses
quite improperly on to new ground in four ways. Two of these have been
well argued, by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, in particular. It uses
emergency legislation, normally reserved for national security issues.
Why? It does so because the Government are not willing to trust the
British justice system, presumably because they feel that they would
lose in the Supreme Court. That is profoundly disrespectful to
claimants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:22:55"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, we cannot scrutinise the Bill as we should, we cannot take
it through the proper stages as we should, and, as the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, said, it is an abuse of Parliament. Worse, the Government make
the Bill retrospective. Unlike the noble Lord, Lord German, I do not
recall any retrospective social security Bill. It means, as the noble
Lord, Lord Pannick, has said, that we are punishing people for actions
which the courts have ruled were legal at the time they were

third objection is that the Government knew of the problem. The Social
Security Advisory Committee, whose job it is to scrutinise regulations,
warned that they were flaky, and the Government, as is their wont,
ignored it. The Government, therefore, knowingly disregarded the very
body set up to amber or red-light their
regulations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:23:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032165000434" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032165000434">My
final objection is that these so-called technical mistakes were far
from technical. I ask your Lordships to remember that sanctions are not
there to cut the benefit bill. They are there to change behaviour and
bring people into the Work Programme. To change behaviour, you need to
understand your client base and communicate effectively. That client
base, at risk of sanction, is not for the most part made up of
schemers, skivers or fraudsters, because that requires ingenuity,
alertness and a certain competence. No; the sanctions pool includes the
chaotic, the incompetent—unlike, of course, the DWP—the
confused, often those with poor mental health, learning difficulties,
weak organisational skills, and the functionally illiterate. It
includes lone parents, the depressed, the poorly educated, and those
with needy ADHD children. It includes young men, thrown out of their

handle this client group before the court intervened? First, they told
clients that their sanctions from the Work Programme could last up to
26 weeks, but the department failed to mention that the first offence
would require a sanction of only two weeks, the second of only of only
four weeks, and only subsequent offences of six
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:25:28"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, and more importantly—and this is certainly not
technical—they failed to tell claimants that they could end
their sanctions by doing what the Government 
<?notus-xml column=744?>and all of us want them to do, which is to comply with the Work
Programme. Thirdly, the Government in their letters failed to draw
attention to the underpinning of a hardship regime which protects

two-thirds of those sanctioned did not know that this could happen and
that, when it did, they did not know why. In some cases, because they
were already having their benefits stopped to repay crisis loans, they

constitutional basis on which the whole Bill rests in direct and

retrospection or, tellingly, a combination of the two, the report is
unambiguous. I am not going to waste the time of the House by repeating
the findings of the committee, rather, I shall mention comments made by
two other organisations outside of this House. I certainly would not
agree with the philosophy of one of those organisations because it is a

something essential to a person’s right to appeal is about to
disappear. It is not, of course, mentioned in the Bill, nor
is it talked about by the Government and nor is it really
talked about by the media outside. It is a sort of guilty secret. It is
the right to legal advice, paid for, if the person is eligible, by
legal aid. Today, as we speak, a person who wished to appeal a
mandatory recommendation would be entitled to legal aid to get some
basic, fairly cheap, quality advice. A person seeking to
appeal to the First-tier Tribunal would be entitled to legal aid for
such advice. Whether it was the mandatory reconsideration or the next
stage, the First-tier Tribunal, they would be entitled, if they were
eligible, to legal aid. If we move forward 10 days to 1 April, that
entitlement that they have now will no longer be there and they will
not be entitled to legal aid. It is obvious that many of those involved
in the Work Programme would be eligible for legal aid today. They are
on JSA, many of them are young and many more of them will be without
means in any event. Part of the value of advice is that it weeds out
the hopeless case, so that the system is not clogged up with them.
Another advantage is that it encourages the good case, ensuring that
people are not, as in this case, being wrongly sanctioned when they
otherwise might face no
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:37:52"></hs_TimeCode>. However,

question to the Minister therefore is this: if the Bill is passed, will
the Government ensure that all those who are sanctioned will be able to
access advice, either on reconsideration or on appeal, if they want to?

met there has always been some form of sanction. However, over recent
years, those requirements have been extended to groups not previously

shambles were not entirely of the Government’s own making. This

extent of the Government’s failings. It seems as though crucial
regulations underpinning the conditionality regime of the

noble friend Lord McKenzie made the point that the Constitution

Minister, not me, who has to respond to it. The point that the noble
Lord made, which I think is very interesting, is that the Government,
having decided that the matter could take four weeks to consider from
the time when they got the new regulations laid and enforced in this

judgment, yes or no, so it would have been possible for them to spend
time in advance of the ruling considering what they might do if they
lost the case. Why did they have to wait for four weeks to consider the

deal directly with the various points raised. The first is the point
about government competence. The ESE regulations were drafted to be
flexible enough to encompass a wide range of programmes designed to
support jobseekers into work. Introducing new regulations for each
individual scheme would have been more bureaucratic and expensive. We
do not agree that the regulations were ultra vires, and have applied to
the Supreme Court for permission to appeal. We believe that the primary
legislation does not require that the regulations set out the fine
details of each different programme, and, indeed, that was the position
taken by the High Court. In fact, we believe that it is undesirable to
do so and that this was not Parliament’s intention since a wide
variety of possible arrangements could be made depending on the nature
of the labour market conditions in particular parts of the country. It
is important that we have the flexibility to amend these schemes to
reflect the changing labour market conditions on the ground without
going through a laborious legislative process which would delay change
beneficial to the claimants.</hs_para>

understand it, he is telling us that the claimants fell foul of the

means<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T17:06:16"></hs_TimeCode>. I think
that the Minister is telling us that the claimants fell foul of the

the retrospective legislation is necessary. The Government respect the
general principle that Parliament should not legislate to reverse the

exceptional. However, it is entirely proper to enact such legislation

three reasons which make this an exceptional
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T17:08:20"></hs_TimeCode>. First,
there is significant money involved—£130
million—in very difficult, austere times. Secondly, the money
would go to a group of people who neither expect nor deserve to obtain
a windfall payment. These claimants knew exactly what was required of
them. They failed to participate without good cause and were rightly

third reason why this is exceptional is to do with the nature of social
security legislation. In almost all cases regarding social security
decisions, the decisions of a court or tribunal are only prospective in
nature. That is because the most common way in which to challenge a
social security decision, including the underlying regulations, is to
bring an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. If that happens, the normal
route is followed and the decision of the tribunal will not have a
retrospective effect because of Section 27 of the Social Security Act
1998. It is only because there is an anomaly in the text of Section 27
that it does not apply to judicial review cases. That is something that
I suspect that this Government will come back to, to clear
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T17:10:47"></hs_TimeCode>. It is clear
from Section 27 that Parliament recognised that wholesale retrospective
disruption of the social security system was not desirable. That is
even more true in a case like this, when the beneficiaries of that
disruption are not deserving of the windfall that they would otherwise
receive. That is why this is
exceptional<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T17:11:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0002.htm#13032179000050">I
turn to the reason why we need to fast-track the Bill. I want to
respond to the rather witty way in which the noble Lord, Lord Pannick,
put his view that there was no urgency by explaining to him and other
noble Lords that we have applied for permission to appeal to the
Supreme Court. If we are not given that permission to go
ahead—and that could come out any day—we immediately
become liable to pay back the sanction money of £130 million.

have one more question for him. He says that it is necessary to have
certainty, but why not wait until the Supreme Court rules? If the

problem. If they lose, they can bring emergency legislation before
Parliament to clear up the matter in a few days before anyone could

we began by attempting to define what was meant by a STEM graduate and
we then considered the balance between supply and demand. Both proved
to be very challenging tasks. The most common definition for STEM
arises from the Joint Academic Coding System, or JACS. This is owned by
UCAS and HESA and is a subject coding system across the whole of the
higher education sector. However, the problem with the JACS system is
that several subjects with little hard science, such as nursing,
psychology, sports science, architecture and archaeological science,
fall within the highest STEM bands and are given equal weighting to

reason so few students pursue the STEM subjects in universities is that
they are unpopular. Given that students have the freedom to choose and
the lack of incentives that might direct their choice, this amounts to
a mere tautology. A vicious cycle which has diminished the popularity

knowledge or experience of the STEM subjects among adults limits the
perspective of students. A lack of teachers who are properly trained in

<?notus-xml column=765?>aversion to such matters. Even in the early post-war years, after
Britain’s prowess in science and technology had done much to
contribute towards the Allied victories, managers and
workers were endeavouring to place restraints on
technological innovation. Such innovation threatened the power of
trades unions in entrenched positions. On the managerial side, the
logic of cost accountancy demanded that in order to spread the
overheads of investment in fixed capital, production should proceed
without the seemingly gratuitous interruptions that tinkering
technologists are liable to cause. The deleterious consequences of this
managerial attitude were becoming all too apparent in the 1960s when
one after another of our industries that ought to have been at the
forefront of technological innovations were overtaken by foreign
competitors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000091">The
problems associated with a lack of industrial investment continued
throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, which was the era of mass
destruction of British industry as well as a time of severe economic
recession. The lack of opportunities for technically trained graduates
was exacerbated by the growing tendency of firms to resort to
contracting out when in need of technological or scientific services.
The inevitable consequence of the lack of technically trained employees
within business organisations was a failure to perceive the
opportunities for technological innovation. The closure or curtailment,
during this period, of many government scientific research
establishments also had a negative impact on the pursuit of
technological innovation in industry.</hs_para>

marked increase in the number of students graduating from British
universities as a consequence of the so-called Robbins expansion
of higher education. However, the expansion was spearheaded
by the liberal arts and social studies. This emphasis accorded well
with the ethos of the time, which was decidedly libertarian. It was to
a gentlemanly education that many of the recruits to universities
aspired rather than to a technical education. This was doubtless a
reflection of the way in which education has served, in this country,
to signal and buttress social status. The continued relative decline of
British industry also diminished the attractiveness of a technical
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000093" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000093">The
University of Sussex, which was the first of the new Robbins
universities, embodied the ethos of the times, and it adopted a novel
multidisciplinary approach to the social sciences. It placed each of
them in a wider context that was provided by one of several schools of
studies: African studies, American studies, European studies and so on.
However, it is perhaps ironical, given the emphasis the university has
placed on social sciences, that it developed a greater reputation in
the mathematical, physical and material sciences. The mathematics
department in the University of Sussex was under the guidance of Walter
Ledermann and led the way in a programme of applicable mathematics.
Ledermann had developed a liking for concrete mathematics and a
distaste for abstraction for its own sake. His attitudes were a
reaction to what had gone amiss in the teaching of mathematics at the
undergraduate level. Abstraction for its own sake had been the hallmark

compiled a mass of literature working under the collective pseudonym of
Bourbaki. The Bourbakistes were aiming at a completely self-contained,
axiomatic treatment of the core areas of modern mathematics, based on
set theory. In the main, they despised applied mathematics. Their
rigorous approach, which is greatly impressive to professional
mathematicians, permeated the discipline in a way that rendered many of
the undergraduate courses virtually inaccessible to their students. It
is this legacy that has been responsible, in part, for the demise of
undergraduate mathematics in
Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T17:56:02"></hs_TimeCode>. Noble
Lords can imagine my dismay when, on visiting the University of Sussex
a few years ago to give a lecture in the maths department, I discovered
that the department had been virtually reduced to two men and a boy,
who were housed in a broom cupboard. That this department should have
suffered in the general demise of university mathematics in Britain
seems to be singularly unfair, given the manner in which it had
championed accessible
mathematics<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T17:56:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000095">Nowadays,
departments of mathematics in universities treat their students in a
very emollient way that differs greatly from their practice in the
past. They need to do so on account of how ill prepared the students
are on arrival at university, which is largely the fault of their
education at A-level. I am not sure who has been teaching them but, in
the main, they have learnt their mathematics in a way that is seriously
lacking in conceptualisation. At school, the students are taught
mathematics in an operational manner as opposed to a conceptual manner.
That is to say, mathematics is taught as a series of recipes and,
instead of learning a language, which is what mathematics is, they are
learning the content of a phrasebook. Their memories are overburdened
and, for most of them, the distinction between learning and
understanding is lost. Examples of recipe-book mathematics are provided
by the courses in statistics that are nowadays taught to many A-level
students. This part of the syllabus has replaced the traditional diet
of kinematics and dynamics, with the effect that many students are
ignorant of Newton’s laws of motion, which renders them
scientifically illiterate, in my
opinion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000096">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T17:57:54"></hs_TimeCode>
welcome the proposal to make the study of maths compulsory for all
post-16 students but am wary of a proposal that higher education
institutions should introduce more demanding requirements for students
intending to study STEM subjects. The fulfilment of that particular
nostrum would require an enhancement of the maths education in schools,
which is of course a primary objective. An enhanced provision of
in-service training for maths teachers via colloquia and seminars would
be helpful in this respect. It has been asserted, in particular by our
colleague, Professor Winston—the noble Lord, Lord
Winston—that children should be exposed to good mathematics
teaching in their early years. That claim warrants some serious
investigation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000097">Mathematics<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T17:58:33"></hs_TimeCode>
taught as an adjunct to a scientific subject tends to be unpopular with
undergraduate students. It is seen as difficult and demanding and it
gives rise, invariably, to what is nowadays described as a “bad
student experience”. It should be clear that, when great
emphasis is placed on the quality of the 
<?notus-xml column=767?>student experience, and when the testimony of the students themselves is
how such experiences are assessed, the teaching of mathematics is under
severe threat. It is in this connection that I find some of the things
being proposed in the report which fall under the heading
“Quality, standards and benchmarks” to be misguided and
unhelpful. The report has repeated many of the nostrums of the
Government’s higher education White Paper, <I>Students at the
Heart of the System</I>. In order to mollify students who will be
paying for the costs of their education, the Government have proposed
to put them in the driving seat. The degree of their satisfaction will
be measured in respect of all their taught courses. If this
satisfaction is insufficient, sanctions will be applied to teachers and
their departments. An inevitable consequence of this will be the
curtailment of the unpopular technical modules that form an essential
part of many undergraduate courses. Given that the discretion in such
matters now resides with the administrators of universities as opposed
to the academics, little attention will be paid to the circumstances
that explain this
unpopularity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000098">The
report is most effective, in my opinion, when it is describing the
hazards that have arisen from recent government policies. The effect of
their policies on student visas will be to knock away the props that
support many postgraduate courses in technical subjects. The lack of

address the effects of the heightened university fees threatens to
diminish their numbers even further. It would be difficult to

require raising the status of education and employment in science,

First, substantial bursaries should be granted to university students
to pursue STEM courses, at both the undergraduate and postgraduate
levels. Employers could also sponsor their technical employees to
attend university courses, as many did in the past. It should be
acceptable to them to indenture the persons whom they have sponsored in
this way for a significant period so that they could derive a benefit
commensurate with their outlay. They might thereby acquire the in-house

and industry have traditionally developed an understanding of their
mutual interests by being members of the same international research
communities. It was at conferences or through publications that
industrial researchers met academics whose work was relevant to their
products. This frequently led to companies retaining these academics as
consultants and, as a consequence, their research students became aware
of the interests of industry. Industrialists got to know who the most
talented students were and could approach them to join their company or
to support them through CASE studentships et
cetera.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000106">A
striking statistic is that 76% of doctoral students are studying STEM
subjects, of which I would expect at least 40% to be working in applied
science or engineering. In today’s difficult financial times,
the most relevant way to measure the success of their applied research
is to find out how many of these postgraduate students have ended up
working in industry in the field of their postgraduate studies. The
best time to assess this is probably five years after they graduated.
Many just leave and never come back to research, let alone research for
industry. Technology transfer is most easily achieved through the
transfer of people, and this is also an accurate measure of whether the
technology has actually been transferred. I doubt that such data are
available, but they should be. We have to know how much of our research
is having an impact on real products in the real market. We keep
boasting about our science base, but it is increasingly clear that it
is placing only a few of our industries in a competitive international
position. Let us find out what is actually the situation. If we are
doing really well, 20% of our 
<?notus-xml column=769?>applied science and engineering research should be influencing products.
I recall that in the US research laboratories I worked in for 20 years
we regarded a laboratory as very successful if 20% of its research
influenced new product development. Mind you, I am talking about
research and not development; we always conflate these two, just
showing how ignorant we are of that world. Research and development are
different. Ten per cent was the cut-even point; let us find out how we
are
doing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000107">Regrettably,
ever fewer companies today carry out research, as opposed to
development, with the consequence that fewer UK industrial researchers
are reporting state-of-the-art research and that the traditional
meeting place for industry and academia is disappearing. Several of our
successful companies have developed alternative ways of bridging to
universities. They have the knowledge and skills to understand how to
operate in the new environment, where academic research must play a
much more important role than in the

specialist group, headed by successful entrepreneurs and senior
industrialists, needs to be formed and asked to determine whether we
are internationally competitive in having our government-funded
research taken up by industry and, if so, why we appear so low on the
table of R&amp;D spend as a fraction of GDP. As I have said, it is
widely acknowledged that the best way to succeed in technology transfer
is through the transfer of people. We need to know how many of our
postgraduate students are working in industry and whether they have
carried with them the research expertise and results that they gained
while pursuing government-funded research at universities. We then need
to reinforce the methods that the most successful companies have used

is timely for us to have this report now given that we have just
considered the Budget and the need for growth has become very apparent.
Yet one of the key elements that we see in growth these
days—this was spelt out at some length in the
Government’s growth strategy, which was produced by BIS in the
past year—is the need to depend upon science and technology
industries. However, we need to rebalance the economy away 
<?notus-xml column=770?>from consumption and towards investment, away from services and towards
manufacturing, and away from low-tech areas and towards high-tech
areas. In their strategy for growth, for example, the Government have
given considerable emphasis to sectors such as aerospace, advanced
manufacturing and life sciences.</hs_para>

also going to mean more for less. It will mean that we have to increase
productivity substantially, and if we are going to increase
productivity then we will have to increase the number of skilled and
highly qualified members of the workforce; it is well known that the
higher the skill level, the higher the levels of productivity. Yet the
CBI skills survey estimates that around 42% of employers are reporting
shortages in STEM skills. The survey by the Royal Academy of
Engineering and the Big Innovation Centre, mentioned by my noble
friend, estimated that by 2020 the UK would need around 104,000 new
graduates in STEM areas every year. This compares to around 80,000
being produced at the moment, so there will be a shortfall of something
in the region of 40,000 graduates every year with regard to
needs.</hs_para>

study from MORI shows that we need around 87,000 graduates each year
with at least level 4 skills, the HND level, in engineering. This
compares with the figures that we have for 2009-10—incidentally,
this is interesting with regard to what my noble friend Lord Willis
said about HESA—because the most up to date figures that we have
for the number of graduates that we are producing in the area of
engineering are around 21,000. It became clear from the report that one
can argue about the precise figures, but the general message is that we
need more young people to take up science and technology subjects in
our universities. That in turn means that many more young people have
to think about science and technology when they are in
school<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:12:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000114" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000114">One
of the most appalling statistics that I came across in the documents
that I looked at in preparation for this debate was that only 20% of
those who get good grades at GCSE in science pursue science through to
A-level. If we are going to increase the number of those moving on to
university, we have to increase the numbers at A-level, and there is a
large number of people who could potentially do that. Why do so few of
those taking science as part of their GCSEs go on to take those
subjects at A-level? One reason has already been touched upon by my
noble friend: mathematics. Many students in our schools, for some
reason or another, find mathematics difficult. In particular, our
teaching of mathematics at secondary school seems to be deficient. At
the age of 10, our best young people are as good as their international
comparators, but by the time they get to 16 they have fallen behind by
something like two
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:14:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000115" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000115">My
own feeling is that the Government’s response to this by
introducing the EBacc, and therefore putting a lot of emphasis not only
on maths at GCSE but also on having a reasonably broad range of
subjects, including science, is helpful, and perhaps will help to get
more young people taking science at GCSE level. However, I have great
reservations about the reforms at the advanced level. While I welcome
the rigour of mathematics at that level, I have great reservations
about the dismissal of the AS-level. Quite a few students at the moment

<?notus-xml column=771?>take AS-level maths as an intermediate qualification but do not go on to
pursue it to A2-level. By getting rid of the A2-level in maths, we may
find that those students do not try to take any maths at all at a
further
level.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000116" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000116">I know
that the Secretary of State is anxious to have an intermediate level
maths examination, and I would certainly welcome that.
However—this echoes something that I have heard the noble Lord,
Lord Broers, say from time to time—I would welcome it if,
instead of narrowing down specialisation at the age of 16 to just a few
subjects, making it difficult to pursue both mathematics, science and
an arts subject, we went down the route of the international
baccalaureate, or something equivalent, whereby students keep a much
broader range of subjects right through to 18. With our raising of the
age of participation from 16 to 18, there was an opportunity to do
that. It is an opportunity that we have
missed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000117">The
table on page 17 shows how out of line we are in not requiring
continuing study of mathematics post-16. The table on page 23
illustrates how few students in the science and social science field
take mathematics through to that level. It is not just about maths
education. Another point touched on by the committee is careers advice.
At the moment, if young people at the age of 13 or 14 do not make the
right choices, they often cut off options later. Schools need
independent careers advice from people who have knowledge of the world
outside. Recent changes have changed the position of information,
advice and guidance on careers, and schools are supposed to have
independent advice, but, too frequently, they are now relying merely on
a website and a telephone hotline, not providing that advice in
person<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:17:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000118" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000118">Many
young people aged 13 or 14 have no idea what they want to do. It is
very important that they can keep their options open. That is why I
favour the wider route. They are unaware of the flexibility that there
is later. It is important for them to have proper careers advice and
information about universities where they can study different subjects
in flexible ways at that

other point about schools concerns girls. One reason why those who get
good science results do not continue is because they are girls. We know
that relatively few young women go on to pursue science. There again,
how important careers advice is. I would like more professional advice
to go to those young women so that they know the careers that they
could go into. At the moment, their own views are much too stereotyped.

pick up two other important issues. It is not mentioned in the report,
but it is significant that about 60,000 of the 300,000 young people
entering higher education come not by the A-level route but by the BTEC
route, the more vocational route. We need to put that alongside the
academic A-level
route.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000121" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000121">It is
important that as well as the more vocational route there is also
progression to higher-level apprenticeships and the higher levels of
BTEC, that that progression is recognised and that we develop not a
two-tier system but a dual-track system so that it is 
<?notus-xml column=772?>possible at any moment to move across and upwards rather than feeling
that there is a single-track ladder that takes you upwards. We need a
dual-track system to higher qualifications. In the past, and even
today, many of those who lead our leading engineering firms came up
through the apprenticeship route rather than the academic
route.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000122">Finally,
I shall say a word about postgraduate provision. Here I should declare
an interest in that I was a member of the all-party Higher Education
Commission that last year produced a report on postgraduate provision.
I shall pick up two aspects of financial provision for postgraduate
training. The first is that those who pursue taught master’s
courses largely in order to develop the professional skills that are
now needed in many of the more professional careers need a proper form
of career development loan. The current system is not working, and it
is vital that some new guarantee, perhaps, is given. It is reasonable
that we could look to the private sector to provide the loans, but we
need to get a much better mechanism for making them work. When the
Government are prepared to put £5 billion behind mortgage
guarantees, surely they could put some money behind this sort of
guarantee. I would like to see
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000123">It is
vital that we see proper funding of masters and PhD research
studentships, which is up to the research councils. Like my noble
friend Lord Willis, I think that the development of the doctoral
research centres has its point, but it is also important that basic
financial support for young people in studentships is there to
encourage people from this country to go into postgraduate careers. As
the noble Lord, Lord Broers, emphasised, postgraduate training here is
a vital means of technology
transfer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000124" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000124">This
report raises a lot of important subjects for this country if we are to
pursue the wishes that many Ministers have expressed to become a
high-tech country dependent on science-based technologies and to
develop our knowledge-based industries. The response from the
Government has been disappointing in many respects, not least in
relation to visas. In the past, because we have not been producing
enough STEM graduates, we have been filling vacancies with migrants
from overseas. Now we are shutting the door on those coming in from
overseas. As far as we are concerned, however, it will be too late if
we cannot grow our own graduates to fill those places. This message has
been before successive Governments over the past 30 years but it has
not had an impact. This time, I hope the Government might be rather

Rees of Ludlow:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as a
member of Cambridge University and as this year’s president of
the Association for Science Education. I add my tribute to the noble
Lord, Lord Willis, for introducing this debate and for his superb
chairmanship. His earlier incarnation as a headmaster not only gave him
familiarity with the topic but skills in keeping order.</hs_para>

distinct reasons why STEM subjects are so important. The first, and the
prime motivation and focus of our report, is that an ever-growing
fraction of jobs needs specific skills at levels ranging 
<?notus-xml column=773?>from basic technical confidence through to researchers, medics and
engineers with the highest professionalism. Surveys show, as we have
heard, a continuing undersupply of such people which will be hard to
remedy without welcoming immigrant talent. We have heard about
the own goals which this Government have scored on that
front<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:25:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the surging numbers of scientifically qualified young people in the Far
East. That is, in itself, a welcome development for that region and for
the world. What should genuinely worry us is whether we are matching
their quality and level of achievement. The noble Lord, Lord Willis,
reminded us of a recent study of competence in mathematics, which
showed that our best 10 year-olds were level-pegging with those in the
Far East, but that by the age of 16 they were two years behind. At
university level, we should worry about whether students in other
countries are working more intensively and achieving higher attainment
levels. Sustaining the international standing of our degrees is a
serious matter for colleges and universities. Our committee therefore
addressed issues of accreditation, kite-marking and so
forth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:26:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

secondary education, as opposed to higher education, was not the focus
of our inquiry. However, it is of course crucial in preparing and
motivating those who will embark on higher education in STEM subjects.
However, science education is not just for future scientists, engineers
and technicians. There is a second reason why it is important.
Today’s young people, all of them, will live in a world ever
more dependent on technology and ever more vulnerable to its failures
or misdirection. To be at ease in this fast-changing world, and to be
effective citizens participating in democratic debate, they will all
need at least a feel for science, enough to prevent them being
bamboozled by propaganda or over-deferential to experts. Of course,
they need a feeling for numbers to be comfortable in assessing
probabilities, risk and
uncertainty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:27:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

education should not be geared solely towards the training of
specialists. Our committee, as we have heard, deplored the fact that so
few young people study any maths beyond the age of 16. Some press
comment berated us by asking whether it would really be appropriate for
everyone to do A-level maths in its present form. Of course, it would
not. We were not suggesting that. However, an appropriate curriculum,
focusing on mathematical fluency and relevance, could be devised. We
should therefore welcome the proposals from ACME, the Nuffield
Foundation and, indeed, from my eminent Cambridge colleague Professor
Tim
Gowers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:28:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

downplaying of maths is just an instance of a chronic problem to which
the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has already alluded: the UK’s
unduly narrow post-16 curriculum. We should surely keep pushing for
more breadth. Back in the 1980s, the widely supported Higginson
proposals were killed off by Margaret Thatcher with a mantra about not
jeopardising the gold standard of A-levels. Tomlinson was likewise
stymied, this time by the previous Labour Government, because it was
perceived that his proposals would play badly
electorally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:28:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

overspecialisation is bad for the would-be scientists and engineers,
too. They would benefit from language skills just as much as their
humanities counterparts need more numeracy. However, in any broadening
of the curriculum in the schools, the universities need to be
supportive and not obstructive. At the moment, they are justly blamed
by the schools for discouraging breadth by favouring applicants who
have had a narrow focus. Indeed, our universities should follow the
example of American universities in broadening their own degree courses
and in introducing a more flexible system of credits to facilitate
transfer between institutions and offer a second chance to those
unlucky in their pre-18 education. A large fraction of young people
have options foreclosed simply because they are unlucky with the
teaching that they secure at the sixth-form
level<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:29:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000132">Even
with the current narrow undergraduate curriculum, it is clear that a
bachelor’s degree is not in itself a sufficient qualification
and must be topped up for many purposes by a masters-level course. That
is why it matters so much that masters courses are under special
threat, in particular through a lack of funding sources for home
students. Given that money is tight, what is the best solution to this
problem? Distance learning and online courses have a huge role across
all higher and further education, at least as a supplement to
traditional methods, but it is surely at the masters level that MOOCs
and the rest offer the most unambiguous benefits in terms of
cost-saving and rationalisation. At that level, the students are more
mature and motivated. Many would prefer to work part time to enhance
their vocational credentials. There is surely huge scope for expanding
the options and enhancing efficiency through use of IT by consortia of
universities and

the noble Lord, Lord Broers, pointed out, it is at the postgraduate
level that we need to identify strategic areas. Having identified them,
we need to offer incentives, from government or the private sector, to
boost expertise in them. But let us not forget that it is no good
educating more students in strategic areas if the relevant industries
cannot attract and retain them and they are eventually seduced into the
financial
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:31:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000134">Finally,
we should not overlook a third reason why STEM education is important
right through the system. Science is part of our culture. More than
that, it is the one culture that is truly global; protons, proteins and
Pythagoras’s theorem transcend all boundaries of nation and
faith. It is a real intellectual deprivation not to understand our
natural world, and the insights stemming from Darwin, Watson, Crick,
and so on. The BBC audiences for David Attenborough, Brian Cox and many
other excellent expositors demonstrate the genuine hunger for such
knowledge, even if it is as seemingly irrelevant as dinosaurs and the
cosmos<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:32:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000135">The
modern world will feel bewildering, even frightening, unless people
have some grasp of the basic principles underlying it—the
biosphere and climate, and the artefacts that everyday life depends on.
Achieving this understanding of the everyday things that we depend on
is genuinely harder today. Fifty years ago, inquisitive children could
take apart a clock, a radio set or a motorbike, figure out how it
worked, and even 
<?notus-xml column=775?>put it together again. But it is different today. The gadgets that now
pervade young people’s lives, smart-phones and suchlike, are
baffling black boxes, pure magic to most people. Even if you take them
apart, you will find few clues to their arcane miniaturised mechanisms,
and you certainly cannot put them together again. So the extreme
sophistication of modern technology, wonderful though its benefits are,
is, ironically, an impediment to engaging young people with the basics,
with learning how things work. Likewise, town-dwellers are more
distanced from the natural world than earlier generations were. That is
why an earlier report from our committee expressed concern about a
decline in practical work, field trips and the like. So the issues
addressed by our committee are crucial not only to the UK’s
economy and environment, but also to education and well-being in the
widest
sense<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:34:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13032179000248" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000248">6.34

Krebs:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord
Willis, for his chairmanship of this inquiry. When we started out, it
seemed such a broad topic that we did not know how we would focus on
key issues. However, the skill, discipline and good humour of the noble
Lord, Lord Willis, enabled us to focus on some important issues that
affect the future of STEM in higher
education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:34:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000137">Other
noble Lords have set out the importance of STEM graduates, both at
first and second degree level, to the future of the UK economy.
Therefore, I will not dwell on that but remind noble Lords en passant
of the Social Market Foundation report, to which the noble Lord, Lord
Willis, and the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, referred, which estimates
an annual shortfall of 40,000 STEM graduates. Filling that gap implies
a 50% increase in UK STEM graduates, if we are to rely on home-grown
talent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:35:19"></hs_TimeCode>. It seems
to me highly unlikely that the gap, whatever its size, will easily be
met by UK students. Why do I say that? It is because we simply cannot
turn on a tap to produce more STEM graduates because the supply chain
is a long one that starts at school. For example, with an estimated
shortage of 4,000 physics teachers, according to the Institute of
Physics, and with no fewer than 500 state secondary schools having no
qualified physics teacher at all, how can we hope to produce more
graduates in the core hard STEM subjects? Going back further in the
supply chain, it is estimated that less than 5% of primary school
teachers have STEM qualifications. In this context, can the Minister
tell us how many applicants per post there were last year for teaching
jobs in physics, chemistry and maths in state secondary schools? We
will rely on importing talent from overseas, as we have done in the
past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000138" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000138">I
recently took part in a Radio 4 programme called “Premiership
Science”, which drew the analogy between the premiership in the
Football League and the UK’s position in science. The
premiership is deemed by many to be the best football league in the
world because it draws on the best talent from all over the world. The
programme argued that we should aim to do the same in science, taking
account of our natural advantage of language and the reputation of our
leading universities. Will we be able to continue to do this after the
Government shot themselves in the foot 
<?notus-xml column=776?>a couple of years ago by making it appear to be much more difficult for
overseas students to come here to study STEM subjects as undergraduates
or postgraduates and then to stay on to
work?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000139" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000139">The
inquiry heard of the dramatic impact of the changes in the Immigration
Rules: for example, a 39% decline in applicants from India
to the University of Aston, a leading university in engineering and
technology. Together with a number of other Select Committee chairs, I
recently wrote to the Prime Minister, ahead of his visit to India, to
express concerns about both the reality and, as the noble Lord, Lord
Willis, emphasised, the perception that the UK no longer welcomes
overseas talent. In his reply, the Prime Minister was upbeat about
recent changes to immigration policy that he believes will encourage
students to come here, and reverse the damage—although he did
not acknowledge that there was damage—done by earlier
announcements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000140" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000140">However,
the evidence from my own university—the University of
Oxford—where there are nearly 4,000 students on tier
4 visas, indicates that there are still significant problems. I will
enumerate some of them: first, the administrative burden and cost
associated with attendance monitoring by the university; and, secondly,
the bureaucratic complexity of the post-study work options. For
instance, the proposal to allow PhD students to stay on and work for 12
months after completion by issuing a confirmation of acceptance for
studies extension requires specifying the exact date of completion of
the PhD ahead of time, and for the university to maintain contact with
the student for 12 months after completing the course. As
anybody in higher education will confirm, the inherent nature of
completing a PhD means that it is often very difficult to specify in
advance the exact date of the end of the course. Thirdly, as regards
visa processing times, student visa extensions take three months or
more to process. The UKBA held the passport of a senior overseas
academic in my Oxford college for 27 weeks, and it was only after
intervention by a Minister that action was elicited from it. This
really does not encourage people to think of the UK as a welcoming
place to work after they have studied
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000141" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000141">Fourthly,
the UKBA’s tendency to change the rules frequently makes it
difficult for overseas students to navigate the processes. Does the
Minister agree that whatever the rhetoric, the reality is that the
Government are still not doing enough to make it easy to draw in top
talent from around the world to study and work here? Does she also
agree that this country, for the foreseeable future, will be dependent
on overseas talent to fill the STEM deficit?</hs_para>

subject of postgraduate provision, to which other noble Lords have
already referred. Our inquiry highlighted the fact that too little
attention has been paid to the funding and quality of postgraduate STEM
education and training. The funding of master’s was not
addressed by the Browne inquiry yet, as we have already heard,
increasingly employers demand master’s or PhD level
qualifications for entrants to the job
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000143">Sir
Adrian Smith’s 2010 report, <I>One Step Beyond</I>, highlighted
the funding shortfall for postgraduate provision at that time, with 60%
of those on taught 
<?notus-xml column=777?>master’s and 30% of those taking postgraduate research degrees
having no public or charitable funding. In my own university, survey
results show that across all disciplines 45% of those turning down a
place for graduate studies at Oxford cite lack of funding as the
reason. This is exacerbated by the fact that our major competitors, in
the United States and elsewhere, typically offer 100% funding for
postgraduate studies. The withdrawal of funding for taught
master’s by the research councils, which has already been
referred to, is making the situation worse. I note that the research
councils’ funding for STEM postgraduate research posts in
2010-11 is at its lowest level since 2004-05. Does the Minister agree
that lack of funding for graduate studies in STEM subjects in
particular will be a threat to the nation’s ability to generate
sufficient numbers of educated and trained people to meet the demands

qualification based on mathematical fluency, modelling and statistics,
which should be built into the requirements for higher education, would
be suitable for those who do not wish to go on with specialist subjects

for this debate to come forward today? These are important and crucial
issues. As was mentioned, they are also rather timeous in the sense

points in the report that could have been picked up earlier by

for a social science degree. Her case is exemplary in terms of what has
been said in this debate. She had strong GCSEs, including triple

output is flatlining, with GDP still below 2007-08 levels. In addition,
projections of future growth look anaemic, raising questions about
where future growth is to come from. In the wake of the financial
crisis and subsequent recession, the coalition Government set out to
“rebalance” the economy away from financial services and
the south-east towards other sectors and regions, including
manufacturing, life sciences and green energy. However, as the
committee’s report makes clear, this path to growth is heavily
reliant on building and sustaining the health of the STEM industries in
this country. It is common ground that the success of this strategy
will depend crucially on the available STEM skills base, and it is on
this issue that I wish to centre my remarks. How will we ensure that
there will be sufficient home-grown talent to satisfy the employment
requirements in this
sector?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000150" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000150">According
to the report by the Social Market Foundation, which has been referred

which means that the supply of STEM-qualified individuals actually has
to be higher than the number of STEM jobs to ensure that demand from
the STEM sector is met. The UK has a long-running home-grown STEM
skills deficit and in recent years has tended to rely on migration to
make up the shortfall in domestic supply. This has effectively been
stopped by the current Government’s immigration
policy.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032179000151" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000151">So,
how many new workers do we need out of the system? The key message on
the numbers seems to be that if we are to fulfil the estimated
employment requirements and make progress in rebalancing the economy,
the UK will need to increase substantially the number of individuals
taking STEM subjects at school. It was therefore worrying to read in
the report, and to see in the Social Market Foundation report, that
there are several points at which potential future STEM employees are
lost to other subjects and sectors. Of those who have achieved good
science GCSEs two years earlier, only around one-fifth go on to take
science A-levels. Just under 60% of those who take 
<?notus-xml column=779?>science A-levels actually graduate in STEM subjects. Even of those who
graduate in STEM, between 18% and 29% go on to work outside STEM
occupations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000152" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000152">One
way of addressing the shortfall is for policymakers to focus on
reducing the proportion of students lost to non-STEM subjects at each
educational transition point. It would be interesting to hear the
Minister’s views on that point.</hs_para>

we have heard, there may be some scope to increase A-level STEM take-up
among those who do well at GCSE and by reducing disparities in GCSE
achievement between different groups of students. Raising the
performance of all groups to the level of the best could help make some
inroads into the shortfall across STEM. Bearing in mind my personal
experience, it was interesting to read that if boys did as well as
girls at science GCSE, and girls took up A-level science at the same
rate as boys, the number of pupils doing A-level science in England and
Wales in recent years would have been higher by an average of between
11,000 and 13,000 each year, or between 14% and 16% higher per year. If
the proportions of A-level students taking science in England and Wales
had been as high as that in Northern Ireland in recent years, the
number of pupils doing A-level science in England and Wales would have
been higher by between some 13,000 and 17,000 each year, or between 16%
and 22% higher per year. To change tack slightly, but still on the same
point, if<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:49:17"></hs_TimeCode> those
on free school meals in England had done as well in GCSE science in
recent years as the rest of their cohort, the number of pupils doing
A-level science in England would have been higher by an average of
between 3,000 and 4,000 each year, or between 4% and 5% higher per
year. If you do the maths, I think you will find that the numbers will
increase substantially if all these matters come to
pass<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:49:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000154" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000154">However,
even those measures, taken together, will do only a modest amount to
close what appears to be the gap. The SMF report estimates that there
could be an increase of about 18,000 STEM graduates per year, but the
shortfall is at least 40,000 and may be as high as 100,000. This means
that the real solution to the UK’s huge STEM skills deficit lies
in starting much earlier to boost GCSE STEM attainment across the
board. At the moment, too few students achieve good GCSE grades. We
need to do more on that, we need to do better in the EBacc, and we need
to make sure that the transition across to A-levels is sustained and
made

that that raises have been addressed by the committee and there have
been a number of initiatives which we have woven into the report and
which I should like to bring together. Obviously, teaching has a major
impact on achievement. Therefore, as has been mentioned, expanding the
supply of science and maths teachers is vital if we are to avoid a
vicious cycle of self-perpetuating skills shortages. The Government
should therefore explore methods to make the teaching profession much
more financially attractive relative to the other employment options
that are open to science and maths graduates. For instance, the number
of STEM teachers on the Teach First programme could be further
expanded, perhaps building on support from the STEM industry. More 
<?notus-xml column=780?>radical measures might include relaxing the initial eligibility criteria
for teacher training and encouraging more international recruitment of
science and maths teachers in the short term. It would be interesting
to get the Minister’s views on those proposals.</hs_para>

in the report, it was right for the committee to pick up the continuing
failure to sort out the postgraduate course in STEM areas. It is
important that this is tackled. It was also right to recognise the
difficulty of projecting future employment requirements, but this is
absolutely crucial to developing policy in this area. Therefore, I
strongly commend the recommendations in the report concerning the
importance of gaining a lot more understanding of what influences
students’ course choices; the quality and consistency of the
independent careers advice that they have access to—or,
increasingly, do not have access to; the need for longitudinal studies
of careers and flows in and out of the STEM industries; and the holding
and analysing of data on postgraduate entry and take-up. I particularly
echo the call in the report for a,</hs_para>

Government’s response to recommendations is less than
satisfactory are quality assurance and standards and scrutiny, as well
as how they are going to afford Parliament a chance to take a view on
their radical reforms to the organisation of our HE system. Certainly,
the report did not go into very much detail on this but, time having
moved on, the case for it is now rather urgent. Can the Minister
confirm whether there is to be an HE Bill in the Queen’s Speech
this year? If not, we will wait even longer for what is obviously a
very important issue. It is noticeable that whenever we have a higher
education issue on the agenda, we have a very high-quality debate, and
this is obviously something where your Lordships’ House would
like to make a
contribution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T18:52:54"></hs_TimeCode>. We
cannot get information on that at the moment but, in the interim, the
committee has made a very good job of pointing out what little power
the department has to shift the focus and direction of the higher
education institutions now that HEFCE has effectively been sidelined
and students have been placed at the heart of the funding
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000158" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000158">Finally,
there is the question of funding. As the noble Lord, Lord Willis, said,
recommendation 29 invites the Government to explain their thinking in
this area. However, in their response, they do not give much detail and
they certainly do not come up with a good explanation of how they
intend to protect STEM subjects. Indeed, this whole section seems to be
unnecessarily defensive and in no way rises to the challenges presented
in the committee’s report. You know that the game is up when you
read in the response that the only thing that the Government can come
up with is to trumpet rather vacuously that the HE sector,</hs_para>

well, well. Isn’t that interesting? I suppose the Sun could rise
in the west tomorrow, but that might be considered a little unlikely.
So let me try another tack: are we really hearing here that more

Government are well aware of the importance of skills in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics. They are vital for growth and
are highly valued across all areas of the economy. Work is in hand to
address many of the areas outlined in the report. Despite the backdrop
of significant financial crisis and difficult decisions on priorities
for funding, the Government have ensured that we have supported the
teaching of STEM subjects. We have ensured that our universities have a
sustainable income stream. We have protected the £4.6 billion
science and research programme budget, and have announced almost
£1.5 billion additional capital funding for science
and innovation projects. That is in addition to the
£1.9 billion capital announced in the spending
review. In partial response to the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, I should
say that we have increased and safeguarded the money going into these
subjects.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032179000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130321-0003.htm#13032179000163">Activity
in school is the beginning of the STEM pipeline, and much activity is
taking place to stimulate interest and excitement among children, an
issue that was raised in a number of the contributions today. The noble
Viscount, Lord Hanworth, mentioned maths as being an impossible subject

The fair has grown year on year since 2009, attracting more than 60,000
people last week at ExCel and inspiring the very youngest. In 2009, my
noble friend Lady Sharp and I went tearing across the road, having

that the current A-levels do not adequately prepare students. It shows

that this has not been very well communicated to the student
population. It is disconcerting to discover how many people still think
that it will be students who are in debt or, indeed, parents. We need

fees up front and that no parent needs to pay either at that

number of other questions have arisen, which I will take not in as
logical an order as I would like as it has been a very full debate. The
noble Lord, Lord Broers, asked why recommendation 15 for an expert
group to consider the supply and demand of STEM postgraduate provision
in the UK had not been taken up. Our view is that it probably does not
need a new body. With the current stakeholder landscape the UK has a
wealth of expert employer advice from business. We have set up the
National Centre for Universities and Business—that was in the
Government’s response which was criticised by the noble
Lord—and the Government are asking it to provide strategic
advice periodically on industry’s needs and perceptions of
graduates and postgraduates. We take the point that it is invaluable to
have the views of entrepreneurs and industrialists and from all sides
on how that can best be
achieved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T19:07:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
