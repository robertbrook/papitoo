in force for just over three months. On implementation, the Home Office
published a circular providing advice on the interpretation of the new
offences. Before then, and subsequently, we have worked with the police
and the Crown Prosecution Service to update their training and
guidance. We continue to engage with partners to ensure that the
offences are being used

Kennedy of Southwark:</Member></B> My Lords, 10 months ago, legislation
was enacted which, for the first time, made stalking a specific
criminal offence. The two new stalking offences have been in force for
almost four months and yet we hear from campaigners and victims of
stalking that the Government have done next to nothing to ensure that
the criminal justice system, police and victim support services are
properly trained in the use of these new offences, that the training
varies from police force to police force and that many officers are not
even aware that the stalking offences exist. Will the Minister tell me
what mandatory training the Government have introduced for police
officers and criminal justice professionals in relation to the new
stalking offences and what input victims and stalking charities have
had in its
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T14:37:43"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13031242000304" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000304">Lord
Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I am sorry that the noble
Lord clearly was not listening to my initial Answer because, as I have
explained, the Government are in continuous engagement with both police
forces and the Crown Prosecution Service on the effectiveness of the
new offences. On 8 March, we published a new, updated action plan to
deliver our strategy to end violence against women and girls. The plan
includes specific new actions on stalking, which provide commitments to
raise awareness of stalking and to monitor the implementation of these
new stalking offences. Data on these new offences will be published in
May 2012, which will help inform further

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister agree that
there is a serious concern about those stalkers who have continually
breached restraining orders—that is, no-contact
orders—but have time and time again not received custodial
sentences? Many have breached restraining orders on many occasions, but
the police and courts have not taken this into account in the suffering
of the victims who continue to be stalked between these court
appearances. Will the Government ensure that the law changes so that
there is an assumption that when restraining orders are repeatedly
violated, the sentencing should start with
custody<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T14:39:07"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

victims of stalking are not eligible for basic protections available to
victims of domestic violence? He might wish to write to me with
answers. Apparently domestic violence protective measures such as
TecSOS phones, sanctuary schemes and installation of CCTV cameras,
which are made available automatically to victims of domestic violence

supporting sustained economic growth across the UK. Economic
development is a devolved responsibility in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. In England we are promoting growth across the regions
by creating local enterprise partnerships, giving cities the powers
they need to drive economic growth via the city deals, and directly
investing in and growing enterprises via the regional growth fund,

billion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000024"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wigley" PimsId="5918" UID="13031242000325" xid="2128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000325">Lord

disparity, as the noble Lord knows, of very long standing. The good
news in terms of Wales is that in 2010 and 2011 GVA grew faster
per head than in either England or Scotland, so there is a bit of
progress. However, changing and reversing those regional disparities is
going to be a long job and it will take a large number of measures to
achieve
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000026"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Peston" PimsId="165" UID="13031242000327" xid="1171" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000327">Lord
Peston:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend asked the Minister a
very good economics examination question, to which I am glad to see the
Minister tried gallantly to find an answer. It is a very difficult
question. Is he aware that most economists would argue in favour of the
so-called convergence theory that free markets would lead to the right
outcome and there would be convergence of the different regions? The
only trouble with that marvellous theory, like so much economic theory,
is that it is totally refuted by the facts. What the facts
show—and this is a problem for any Government—is that
once a region is ahead, it stays ahead. It is rather like the fact that
very few teams win the Premier League, even though everybody could play
marvellous football just by copying the best teams. Does that not mean
that while the Government should intervene, particularly with
infrastructure investment biased in favour of the relevant regions,
they must proceed with the utmost caution in interfering with the way
the markets are
working?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000027"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13031242000328" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000328">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Lord will be aware, we have
had active regional policies to a greater or lesser extent in the
United Kingdom since the 1960s. When I studied this at university, the
figures were very much in my mind. The reason it is such a difficult
issue to deal with is that, for example, in the 
<?notus-xml column=129?>north-east the proportion of people employed in the
basic industries—mining, steel, shipbuilding and
engineering—fell from something like 33% to well under 10% in a
couple of decades. The challenge for government in trying to reduce
regional disparities is how to put in place the kinds of long-term
policies, such as infrastructure apprenticeships, that can begin to
redress these wider economic forces. However, I do not think that
government can reverse them, certainly not in the short
term.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000028"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Bates" PimsId="5331" UID="13031242000329" xid="1992" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000329">Lord

recollection of the north-east of England and some of the history
there. Did he have an opportunity to see the recent study in the
<I>E</I><I>conomist</I> magazine about the north-south divide, which
looked at the data between 1997 and 2010, pointing out that during that
time in the north-east of England GVA grew by 41% and yet in the
south-east of England it grew by 187%? Is that not part of the origin
of the divide and is it not part of the correction to get good, well
paid jobs in the private sector? If so, will he welcome the fact that
employment in the north-east of England is at record levels, as are
exports?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000029"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13031242000330" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000330">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I very much welcome that, but I revert to
my earlier answer. The north-east has in effect had to reinvent itself
in terms of the balance of employment, which it has done reasonably
well. However, it has been comparing itself, as my noble friend did,
with the City, which has had an existing strength in financial
services—one which grew almost exponentially during the period
that he is talking about.</hs_para>

the OFT’s evidence of irresponsible lending to people who cannot
afford it, and by its findings of fundamental problems with the way the
payday lending market works. The Government have worked with the
regulators, including the OFT, to announce a strong action plan. Tough
enforcement today, combined with the move to a new regulatory regime,

from the OFT is indeed a hard-hitting document. It says that payday
lenders are guilty of widespread non-compliance with the law—not
a few of them but most of them. However, I am left with two concerns.
The first is that the Government seem to be indicating that they are
reluctant to place caps on the interest rates charged. Is this true?
Secondly, are payday lenders now sidestepping regulation by going
offshore? What are the Government doing to plug this

announcement was about the Government and regulators taking strong
action together, both to address current problems quickly and to ensure
that a more effective regime will be in place next year. A cap is not
recommended by the Bristol University report; a cap will reduce access
to credit and will mean fewer lenders. As for lenders going offshore, I
do not believe that this is the case yet, but if we bring a cap into
place there is a good chance that lenders would rather lend from abroad
than from this country to avoid the cap

way to deal with these payday loans and the excessive interest charged

payday lenders—are of many different types. A large number of
them borrow money from payday lenders as a short-term loan or in an
emergency. Some use the payday lending system rather than a credit
card; quite often a credit card is very expensive, and they have more
control over borrowing from payday lenders than they would have over
credit cards. Quite often there are customers who borrow money from
payday lenders because the banks, for reasons of liquidity, are often
not very keen to give short-term
overdrafts.</hs_para>

Whitaker:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare my interest as president of
the South Downs Society. Amendment 35A is in my name and
that of the noble Lord, Lord Renton, 
<?notus-xml column=136?>who very much regrets that he is not able to get
away from snowy Sussex today. The amendment would ensure that the
stated intention of Clause 8, to facilitate the rollout of broadband in
the national parks, does only that. Mobile phone masts would not be
allowed; nor would any different economic purpose of any future
Secretary of State be permitted. The Minister has explained, in a very
helpful meeting held with her officials, that it is difficult to put
this restriction in the Bill and that regulations will make it quite
clear that only broadband is in mind. However, I think we need to
debate this openly and see the text of the regulations before we accept
the very wide power that is on the face of the Bill to install
equipment in some of our most cherished and beautiful landscapes. Who
knows what some future Secretary of State might want to
do?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000072">In
Committee, we debated very thoroughly the danger to our national parks,
briefed then, as now, by a wide range of organisations representing
planning and the countryside, as well as by the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I>

but I remind noble Lords that those concerns were shared all round your
Lordships’ House. Nobody disputes the importance of broadband in
rural areas or wants to impede it in any way. Equally, nobody was able
to produce any evidence of difficulty which broadband operators had
with any national park, and there were several examples of successful
co-operation. Nor was any evidence of or anticipation of trouble given

Lords, as the noble Baroness has explained, the amendment has been

Committee. If that is the intention of the amendment, I fear that it

every stage of the Bill’s passage, we have made it clear that
Clause 8 was brought forward to enable us to make changes to secondary
legislation in relation to fixed broadband infrastructure, not mobile.
Further to those reassurances in both Houses of Parliament, as noble
Lords will be aware, we published a consultation on 29 January on the
proposed changes to secondary legislation that Clause 8 will enable.
That consultation also made it clear that the changes in Clause 8
relate only to fixed broadband infrastructure—cabinets and
poles. As has been made clear previously in this House and in the other
place, it is not possible to limit the scope of the clause to a
particular infrastructure or technology. Clause 8 can make no
distinction between fixed or mobile infrastructure, because Article
8(1) of the framework directive 2002/21/EC requires technology
neutrality.</hs_para>

different technologies or infrastructures all have to be treated the
same. They can be treated differently where it is
objectively justifiable and proportionate, but that is done at the

is sufficient to justify a differing treatment in planning

mentioned, the amendment does not achieve the desired

could not limit the scope of any changes to broadband infrastructure,

not want

only reiterate that the distinction between fixed and mobile will be
delivered through secondary legislation, through regulations which I
think are already out to consultation. This measure will be introduced
to provide certainty and will be an additional deployment option to
enable superfast broadband to be rolled out in the more commercially
challenging parts of the UK. As the noble Baroness said, these areas
have people’s hearts in them and they do not like to think that
they will be changed. I hope the noble Baroness will understand that
there is no intention to try to prevaricate in any way or to try to
introduce mobile by this clause. It is limited by the secondary
legislation but because of the necessity under the EU regulations we
have to do it this way. I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able

an extremely damaging precedent, removing key protections from our most
cherished landscapes. My Amendment 36 sought to address that issue,
enabling changes in secondary legislation to speed up the delivery of
broadband in rural areas but not removing key protections against
changing the long-standing duties in national parks and areas of
outstanding natural beauty.</hs_para>

Committee, I can see the argument for adding a further consideration to
the Communications Act 2003 for the Secretary of State to have regard
to promoting economic growth at the same time as other existing duties,
which is what Clause 8(1) proposes. However, the disapplication of the
duty to have regard to conserving beauty in other pieces of legislation
would be a very disproportionate approach. Clearly the Government do
not feel that my amendment gave quite the certainty that they thought
they needed, while not undermining key protections for those
landscapes. They have therefore drafted their own amendment, which in
this group, and with the leave of the House I should like to make a few

Amendment 36A equates the “have regard” duty to proposed
Section 109(2B) of the Communications Act 2003, so that the Secretary

109(2B). It means that the primary legislation in place since 1949
protecting our iconic landscapes remains unchanged. I am extremely
grateful to the Government and in particular to the Minister, who has
gone well beyond the bounds of the usual standards to listen to Members
of this House and to meet with us and hear the seriously held concerns
that we championed in Committee about the wider impacts of the clause
as drafted. Their willingness to respond to our concerns sends a

here in this whole clause, as we argued in Committee, is not only the
policy inherent in the clause now but the threat that it offers for the
future. Since the Second World War, Governments of all persuasions have

<?notus-xml column=139?>consistently adhered to the principle that there is something so special
in this asset of these unique areas of countryside in our
country—which are enjoyed by our people and have this
incalculable value as a place for physical and spiritual
regeneration—that there must be absolutely no doubt whatever
that the protection of what they are about and of their scenic
uniqueness takes precedence over everything. The trouble is that, once
the door is pushed open and left, after discussion and argument, just a
little ajar, there is this danger of still further
erosion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000087">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:21:16"></hs_TimeCode>

to the Minister. She has been outstanding in her commitment and
courtesy to the House and to the Committee. I have always thought that
she was a decent, civilised person, and the way in which she has

absolutely no doubt about that whatever. I would like her to accept
that we are trying to uphold her in those values which she so obviously

unfortunately—although I understand it—by the time that
legislation is on the Order Paper and being debated there has been an
awful lot of intellectual and policy input and people are very
committed to the position which they have put forward and on which they
have worked in a dedicated way to try to get the draft as true as
possible. Sometimes there comes a moment when the logical thing to do
is to stop trying to perfect something that is not really right and
just to say, “That one was interesting but it is not going to be
in the Bill in the future”. However, it is a very difficult
thing for all those who have been involved to accept that sort of
provision. I hardly dare say, and I do not mean this in any aggressive

as has been said, the protection and cherishing of these very special
landscapes, particularly the national parks and the areas of
outstanding natural beauty, is crucial for our very small island. The
way in which we have retained them since 1949 is amazing. It must be
remembered that we were 50 years after the Americans in inventing
national parks, but a wonderful job has been done with them. We
therefore have to make absolutely sure that we do not legislate for a
short-term apparent problem. Nobody denies that the whole broadband
thing is important, and we are united on 
<?notus-xml column=140?>the need for it, but we should not legislate on a short-term basis for
that with any risk of undermining the very long-term principle of
preserving these landscapes for generations to come. That is my first
point, and I know that my noble friend is attempting to meet that in
the amendment that she has put
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000091">The
second point is what could actually happen to the landscape as a result
of what is going to happen in the way of installation of broadband. I
had the advantage of going to a meeting with British
Telecom—which my noble friend the Minister chaired, sponsored
and arranged—and I found it, in a sense, quite helpful. There
were one or two things that particularly struck me. First, although we
questioned BT very closely, it was not able to produce a single example
from the past or the predictable future of why this clause is needed.
It is all very theoretical. The second point is that they showed us the
various bits of hardware which are involved in broadband—one, of
course, is the cabinets, which do the switching. They are quite big,
about twice the size of filing cabinet, and they have to be scattered
around; it is a little unclear how close they have to be to the service
that they are trying to provide. They take the fibre optic cable and
then transfer it to the copper cable, which is what most of the
broadband ends up reaching the final premises in, unless it is a new
premises in which case, they put the fibre optic straight in. The
cabinets are quite big and could be very intrusive. It ought, in my
view, to be quite easy to conceal them, and make sure that they are
carefully sited.</hs_para>

thing that worries me much more is the wires—the fibre optic
cables that carry the signal. Wires that are strewn across open
countryside can be very intrusive and damaging to the landscape and one
simply does not want them. In the past, much care has been taken to
ensure that that does not happen. British Telecom told us that where
there are underground wires already, it will use the ducts in which
those wires go to put the new fibre optics in. Where the
services are already over ground, it will probably put the fibre
optic cable on the poles that already exist. That is probably
acceptable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000093" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000093">However,
there is another point. BT is not the only organisation that will be
putting in broadband in these rural areas. Another big company, the
Japanese company Fujitsu, is keen to come in. We know that the
ownership of existing methods of transferring wires is largely in the
hands of BT. In theory it would be just as possible for the incoming
company to take exactly the same care and trouble for its wires and
cables as BT does. However, the fact is that this is something that
belongs to BT and so it will have a commercial right to expect some
money in exchange for using
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000094">The world
of telecommunications—and the world as a whole—is highly
competitive, and companies are trying to cut their costs to get the
orders and the business. The point that I raised, which I hope that my
noble friend may be able to comment on, is: to what extent—when
we have finished with the Bill as it now looks with the amendments from
my noble friend—will we be able to ensure that a third company,
as it were, that comes in to install broadband in these sensitive areas
is not able to cut a few cents of the cost by 
<?notus-xml column=141?>putting overhead lines where underground wires exist, or by putting up
new poles where other people’s poles

a really important consideration, which brings me to the third point

world in years to come. Therefore, I am very anxious that, in

Parminter:</Member></B> My Lords, we all support the deployment of
broadband in rural areas, and the key for us is how best we deliver
that. I still do not think that the Government have made a conclusive
case for the need to change the existing planning regime in terms of
proving that existing arrangements are a barrier to delivering
broadband. Few cases have been cited outside the national parks, and as
my noble friend Lord Marlesford and the noble Baroness,  
<?notus-xml column=146?>Lady Whitaker, said, the national parks authorities are not inflexible
regulators, bystanders or obstacles to broadband
rollout<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:46:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

disappointed that the Government have not published the responses to
the latest consultation on their planning proposals prior to Report.
Hearing stakeholder views could have helped our deliberations, thus
enabling legislation. However, I understand why the Government want to
introduce these changes to the planning regime, so we should seek to
ensure a strong code of practice that delivers the best outcomes in
deploying broadband infrastructure in our most valued
landscapes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:46:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

code of practice to ensure best practice in siting infrastructure would
be best, but I hear the argument that for such a code to be as
effective as possible, it needs to be owned by planning authorities and
broadband operators. Therefore, I hope that, in responding, the
Minister will be able to confirm four things. The first thing is that
the code of practice will be clear on mechanisms for dispute resolution
between planning authorities and broadband operators when there are
disagreements over siting. Given that the proposed changes give
operators the final say on siting, it is important to seek agreement to
ensure we do not end up with cabinets pepperpotting across our most
treasured landscapes, causing detrimental impact to the
landscape’s qualities and thus to the tourism industry that
underpins economies in rural communities in our most highly visited and
iconic landscapes.</hs_para>

code will require the sharing of infrastructure where feasible: a
critical issue that is not mentioned in the scope and guiding
principles that have been drawn up to date. In this, I include pole
sharing, where existing poles are available, and introducing processes
so that broadband operators can be made aware of the opportunities to
piggyback on to the work of energy providers who are undergrounding
lines in the
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000126">The
third is that the process for reviewing the success of the code and the
trigger mechanism for deciding to make the code statutory is made
clear. The final thing is that the anticipated date for the
finalisation of the code is stated. Once this code is finalised,
adherence to it can be incorporated as a contract requirement into
publicly funded broadband deployment projects. As such, it is a key
tool to ensuring the best siting of broadband infrastructure, and we
need it finalised as soon as possible. I beg to
move<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:48:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000127"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Judd" PimsId="1230" UID="13031242000395" xid="1143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000395">Lord
Judd:</Member></B> My Lords, I warmly endorse this amendment and thank
the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, for introducing it. Across the
whole history of legislation, I am afraid there is far too much
evidence that codes and the like, without statutory authority, become
useless in time. We have to remember—and we all pay tribute to
the present Minister—that once new legislation is there, we are
not necessarily going to be dealing with people like the current
Minister. We cannot be certain who we will be dealing with. The current
Minister is determined, and I am sure she means every word she says,
that these things will be used to ensure what we all treasure about the
parks, and so on. However, when she is gone, who will there 
<?notus-xml column=147?>be? I suggest to her that there are people with whom
she must deal at the moment in her own Government who do not see it
quite as she does. They have quite different thoughts about what this
wonderful land might be used for. It is therefore really important to
give the codes statutory
authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000128">As
a vice-president of the Campaign for National Parks and as a patron of
the Friends of the Lake District, I might say that the people who are,
with their quality and commitment, turning concern into practical
reality in all that they do to further the parks and the rest are
deeply disturbed at the dangers that are there. They are not
questioning the current Minister’s good intent but asking,
“Where are the guarantees that these things that are being said
in good will will actually be there for all to observe in
future?”. Is this going to be another of those occasions on
which we satisfy our own public profile by saying, “Well, we
have this code”, or do we really mean what the code says? If we
really mean it, let us for goodness’ sake make certain that it
has the authority of the law behind it. This amendment is
very important

Tyler:</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support my noble friend Lady
Parminter. I should say that in the past I was vice-chair of a national
park committee and therefore hold very dearly the responsibilities of
the wider public within the national parks for their effective
preservation and conservation in the national interest. I would also
emphasise that there are many SMEs in national parks that will benefit
from the extension of these very important communication facilities.
However, there is a real urgency to have real clarity in the new regime
to make sure that there is proper co-ordination between those who are
going to provide for these new facilities along with the existing
undertakings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000130">From
my previous experience of seeing how the statutory undertakings, before
they were privatised, never really got to grips with the need for
co-ordination, the point that my noble friend made just
now—about making sure that those who provide the new facilities
are also properly co-ordinated with those who have responsibility, for
example, for improving energy supplies—is absolutely critical.
Otherwise we would have the ridiculous situation of upheaval and then
renewed upheaval as the new undertakings take over. The equal need for
greater clarity, to which my noble friend just referred, is extremely
important, because otherwise we will have a very confused
situation.</hs_para>

for this that I hope my noble friend the Minister will be able to give
us an undertaking that preparatory work is well in hand to ensure that
all the issues to which my noble friend referred are already being
carefully examined. I am sure that all the communities within the
national parks, and those who have concerns about the future of the
national parks outwith them, will be met in the next few weeks and not
be left with many months of consultation and revision before we see a
final result.</hs_para>

Marlesford:</Member></B> In supporting this amendment, I underline that
we are talking not only about national parks but specifically about
areas of outstanding natural beauty. Perhaps I could remind your
Lordships that one 
<?notus-xml column=148?>is not more important than the other in the
hierarchy of beauty. The difference between national parks and AONBs is
that national parks are wilderness areas, which AONBs are
not; they are very often highly cultivated and farmed
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000133">I
remind your Lordships once again of a phrase that was used and which is
central to the whole issue in its broadest context. It is a phrase that
was used by Nicholas Ridley while ex cathedra, as one of the best
Environment Secretaries there has been since that government department
was created. He stated the importance of protecting the countryside for
its own sake. That really embraces it, whether the new broadband is
being put into a national park, an AONB, a special landscape area or
anywhere where there would be or could be gratuitous damage to a
precious
landscape<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:55:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Adonis:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I reinforce the point made by the
noble Lord, Lord Tyler, about the importance of seeing that there is a
proper communications infrastructure for the national parks, including
superfast broadband. He said there were many SMEs. I have been struck
by quite how many there are. According to the information that has been
supplied to us, there are 22,000 businesses in the national parks, of
which over 70% are SMEs. In areas of outstanding natural beauty, there
are more than 61,000 businesses, of which 74% are SMEs. There are also
153,000 homes in national parks and over 467,000 in areas of
outstanding natural beauty. We are therefore wrestling here with the
need to get the balance right. All these businesses and residents want
to see modern communications infrastructure, but they want it installed
in the most sensitive way
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:56:11"></hs_TimeCode> after
proper processes of consultation and collaboration locally. That is
what we are seeking to get
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:56:13"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:56:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000135">We
have been talking a lot about processes, and a key question is what is
going to happen in the rollout of this infrastructure, a point made by
the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. It is clear that big choices will have
to be made about how much undergrounding takes place when it comes to
overhead wires. That will be a critical issue as this infrastructure is
rolled out. There are real causes for concern. It is hard to predict
quite what will happen after this legislation is passed and plans come
forward. The impact assessment that followed DCMS’s consultation
referred to possibly 1,600 kilometres of new overhead wire lines in
protected landscapes over the five-year period for which the changes
apply. However, it is impossible to gain an accurate understanding of
the impact because the document quotes two different figures for the
expected annual increase in overhead
lines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:57:09"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:57:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000136">However,
the Campaign for National Parks points out that there is a good deal of
discretion when this work is being planned as to how much is
undergrounded. The relevant regulatory bodies make allowances
in the control periods for the amounts that can be spent on
undergrounding overhead electricity lines. This also applies to
decisions that BT will take about undergrounding other
telecommunications lines. The sums of money involved are very large.
The Campaign for National Parks also points
out:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13031242000256" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000256">“Given
the resources … now being put into undergrounding power lines,
it would be more cost-effective to plan for broadband delivery in
protected areas in a way that reduces the visual 
<?notus-xml column=149?>impacts from the outset, even if this results in
higher costs initially. Installing broadband infrastructure as quickly
and cheaply as possible would be a false economy and a waste of
consumers’ and taxpayers’ money if further funding has to
be generated at a later date to put these lines
underground<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:58:15"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13031242000137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000137">The
national parks make the very sound point there that to go headlong into
the cheapest possible means of installing infrastructure only to have
to replace it in due course because of a public outcry as a result of
the failure to underground where it is needed to protect and enhance
the landscape, would be a false economy. Let us be clear about that.
Not to plan properly for this and then to have to come back a second
time and spend a very large amount of taxpayers’ money in
undergrounding lines because it was not planned properly the first time
around would be a false economy. We are not very good in this country
at planning infrastructure in such a way that we do not have to go back
and do it a second time because we did not plan it properly the first
time around.</hs_para>

this amendment, which gives us an opportunity to talk about the code of
practice and whether it should be statutory or voluntary. At present,
we do not believe that the proposed code of best practice for the
siting and appearance of fixed broadband infrastructure needs to be
given statutory effect. It is important that the code is agreed

not be possible or necessary to bring forward a statutory code of

infrastructure providers in the area; and, in the case of new poles,
engagement with communities through the local authority—that is,
consultation between us. The noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, asked
whether there would be mechanisms for dealing with disputes. Part of
the code that is being worked up at the moment deals with precisely
that: there will be mechanisms for dispute resolution, in the event
that there is disagreement. The agreed scope also includes ensuring
consistency of definitions and how the code relates to the
various pieces of legislation that underpin it; and the
consistency of application through the supply chain,

with other infrastructure providers probably includes, most
specifically, consulting electricity companies because they work in
this area. The purpose of this is to ensure that, before deploying any
new infrastructure, providers explore opportunities for sharing
existing infrastructure, and that would include underground provision
as well. Early consultation with the electricity companies provides an
opportunity to co-ordinate deployment with any plans to underground
electricity cables in the area, so where everyone is linking up, they
ought to be able to use the same trenches and ensure that as much is
hidden from view as possible. In the meeting that we had with people
from BT, they made it clear that this is what they would want to
do—where there are opportunities for undergrounding, they will
do it. That is something else that would have to be negotiated with the
local authority regarding the contracts that those local authorities

those people, particularly in businesses, need access to fast broadband

be undertaken by him; he will include this in his regular meetings,
which I gather are taking place once a week with all the communications
providers. In the first instance, we would expect communications and
planning authorities to report back on any early lessons learnt so that
they can be reflected in changes to the code of practice. As I made

Judd:</Member></B> My Lords, one might ask why I am moving the
amendment in the light of the good exchanges we have been having in our
deliberations so far. I go back to the basic issue: why is this clause
in the Bill at all? If we have had to have this tremendous amount of
discussion, this avalanche of reassurances from the Minister, meetings
at which reassurances have been given and all the rest of
it, why have the clause in the
Bill?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000154" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000154">That
means that it is necessary to look at the motivation for the clause. I
suggest that the motivation is not what we have been talking about. It
is not about preserving the unique role and position of the parks and
areas of outstanding natural beauty. There is a feeling that this could
become an obstacle to other priorities in government administration and
that, therefore, we need to look again at this absolute commitment and
qualify it, whatever reassurances are given.</hs_para>

read with great interest the note on the meeting with the English
National Park Authorities Association. Again, it was far from clear to
me after reading that why the clause was being proposed unless it was
for the reason that I have put to the House. I therefore suggest that,
at this stage, we need to hear from the Minister why it is essential to
have it in the Bill, with all the qualifications that have now been
made. I am sure that, as a reasonable person, the Minister will agree
with me that those qualifications are all based on her word. They are
not reinforced by the legislation. They are her interpretation, her
good will, her undertakings and her reassurances, with a bevy of
officials around her to add dignity and, I am sure, a good deal of
intellectual input to the occasion.</hs_para>

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, I have not tried to get into
the discussion on Report so far. I made my view clear in Committee that
this clause was a good thing. I, too, warmly commend my noble friend on
the Front Bench for the amount of care and trouble that she has taken.
I particularly valued the meeting that she arranged with the
representatives of BT. I found it extremely informative, both as to
their attitude to all this and as to some of the technology, of which I
confess I was not wholly aware. For instance, one does not need a
continuous line to take superfast broadband across the country. If you
have the right equipment in a cabinet, you can, I think, go up to a
kilometre by wireless transmission. That may well be a way in which one
can protect a particularly sensitive area from the need for
lines.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031242000158" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000158">The
other thing that was made absolutely clear, and which we have heard all
along from my noble friend, is that for overhead lines we are not
talking about anything other than poles. This is not the kind of thing
one has for mobile telephones; they are straightforward wooden poles
with the wires on top. I recognise what has been said about the need to
site these sensitively, because one is talking about sensitive
areas.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031242000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000159">I

friend of many years standing, might just reconsider the impression he
is giving that it is a question of the practical needs of the nation
against bureaucracy. I do not believe that that is the situation at
all. Of course there are practical needs of the nation, and in this
sense I declare an interest, as I have done before in our
deliberations: I live in a national park and I want good
broadband—of course that is true. Having said that, what we have
had in the past is the paramount consideration of the unique role of
the past. Regarding what is taking up time—and I again come back
to the point which my noble friend has so convincingly made ever since
we started deliberation on this Bill—it is precious difficult to
find any evidence that there has ever been unnecessary delay or a
hold-up of the kind described. In fact, I would suggest that there is
no evidence that this is out of kilter with what happens anywhere

seems to me that we want to ensure that, notwithstanding this need to
take seriously the issue of broadband for the sake of a strong economy,
we do not push to one side this paramount concern that we have had in
the past. I do not believe that it is impossible to reconcile the two,
but I think that it has to be argued very hard, and on occasion it will
need a lot of serious deliberation. I do not think that it is just a
straightforward administrative point. From this standpoint, it is not
just a bureaucratic delay but a battle of
priorities.</hs_para>

most heartening aspects

reaches even the most remote rural areas so that they can participate

that it is a function of Parliament, and perhaps of this House in

infrastructure. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, rather suggested that what I
was saying was mere words. I hope that noble Lords will take it a step
beyond that. In fact, mere words can be made to translate intention
into real life. The scrutiny that this House has given this clause is
invaluable because it will be exactly and precisely recorded how the

Everybody wants this completed as soon as possible. If there are
problems at any stage that hold that up and that cannot be dealt with
by the code of practice, the consultations or the discussions between
all the parties, at the end of the day the operators will know that
they can proceed—although it will probably be over
everybody’s dead body. We believe that that is important.
Goodness knows, we all know of many projects that get held up because
people disagree and nobody will come to a conclusion, but this will
ensure that there is a conclusion

the lightness of touch that they want to read at night as they go to

their ambition. The scorecard currently shows that the United Kingdom
is performing well among the major European economies. We currently
benefit from low prices and a high degree of competition in the
broadband market, and so far the UK has the best deals available for

occasion to meetings with the English National Park Authority

British people. I do not want to fudge this. There will be moments when
the interests of that wider well-being—measured not just in cash

fulfilment of potential—will need to take precedence if we want
a civilised society in which to live. That is the whole point. The

the financial considerations of the economy and the rest must at all

I have to say that I see a lawyers’ paradise ahead and some very

genuinely hope—I am not being in any way sarcastic—that

said is being fulfilled in the spirit and not just the detail. I hope

it is affordable for local government. Councils have the capacity to
build more homes, given that council housing is now self-financing.
They could raise £7 billion. This could be done if the
Government removed the borrowing cap on housing revenue accounts,
relying instead on a prudential borrowing code to guarantee that only
sustainable investment gets the go ahead. Many councils have
successfully used prudential borrowing and have shown that they can
manage such borrowing without risk. The Local Government Act 2003
already empowers the Secretary of State to cap any local authority

for the Government to be careful about public borrowing levels.
However, relaxing the housing borrowing cap need not be counted as
public sector borrowing any longer. The UK uses a much wider measure of
public debt than other countries. Council housing is a trading activity
and international regulations already permit this to be discounted from
government borrowing levels, although unfortunately the UK does not
currently adopt such an approach and I remain puzzled as to why it does
not. Council housing has been self-financing since April last year, and
that is welcomed. The average debt on a home is 
<?notus-xml column=159?>just over £17,000. There is clearly scope for

by the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, to which I have added my name. I
imagine that my noble friend on the Front Bench will have seen the
letter published in the <I>Financial Times</I> this morning under the
heading, “Give councils freedom to build homes”. In
addition to the list of organisations which the noble Lord, Lord
Shipley, quoted at the beginning of his speech, this letter is signed
by 13 separate organisations, which one might say cover the whole field
of housing all the way from the Home Builders Federation to Shelter,

National Federation of ALMOs—arm’s-length management
organisations. They make this important point in the

in housing not only helps tackle the housing crisis, which requires us
to double the number of national homes and build 249,000 homes in
London alone by 2020, but also stimulates economic growth and creates

really quite overwhelming. I recognise that my noble friend on the

and I do not blame her for that—she is a loyal member of the

address my remarks to the Chancellor of 
<?notus-xml column=160?>the Exchequer. It will rest with him, in his Budget
in a few days’ time, to convince the country that he really has
a strategy for growth as well as a strategy for cutting the deficit
and, eventually, reducing the debt. I cannot think of any better way
for him to convince the country, and large numbers of people who are
currently looking for housing of various sorts—not just
affordable housing but housing they wish they could find if only it was
available—that this strategy actually does mean benefits for the
country. It would be something that would considerably lift the spirits
of all those who are deeply concerned, as I am, about the level pattern
of GDP under the present circumstances. It is a very uncomfortable
position for a developed country to be in. One can understand why we
have got here but, as well as reducing the deficit, we must attain a
proper strategy for growth. I am convinced that my right honourable

that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000191" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000191">Many

economy, but here is one which evidence shows, really conclusively,
could have a really quite dramatic effect on what is a hugely important
area of our national life, namely the provision of houses. The building
of houses has declined substantially over recent years. Although, as my
noble friend has pointed out, council housing is now self-financing,
the fact of the matter is that councils have huge resources but are not
entitled to borrow against them, even though they would of course be
subject to the general restrictions on borrowing that apply to all of

local authorities and

and growing shortage of the homes that we need—and as in all
previous recessions, to use housebuilding as a key engine for economic
recovery. If we returned to housing output levels of just a few years
ago—even then we were not building enough—we would add 1%
to GDP. That is enough to lift the country above the threshold for an
officially defined recession. That is the reason why the backing in the

housing providers, but the CBI and representatives of British business

present, there are few levers to pull to get housebuilding going again.
Another part of this Bill is based on the hope that allowing
housebuilders to cut back on their obligations to provide affordable
housing will persuade them to start work on stalled sites. I hope that
that part of the Bill, following our earlier deliberations, and the
Minister’s helpful clarification of the Government’s
intentions, will prove fit for purpose. However, it seems unlikely to
make a huge difference. It is, of course, about less not more

opportunity to get a lot of homes built for those on more modest

public subsidy. The amendment would allow local authorities, within
constraints required by the Secretary of State, to borrow prudentially
and to use the security of their housing assets. Thereby, they will
make a significant local contribution to meeting housing needs and
boosting the output of the construction

so very long ago, councils were building 200,000 homes in a single

Today, it has dropped to virtually zero. In London, for example, just
80 new homes were built by local authorities in the years 2003 to 2010.
The Government’s admirable self-financing housing revenue
account reforms should now make possible a programme of an average of
5,000 new homes, from councils, for each of the next five years. This

better.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000197" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000197">Many

often, they would achieve these results through working in partnership
with a housing association or a private sector builder. What they need

Government not wish to see this modest extension of local freedoms
taken forward at a time when there are so very few other ways of
stimulating growth and tackling the backlog of unmet housing need? The
answer is that the extra borrowing would add to the total UK public
sector debt. However, since this borrowing can be comfortably repaid,
it does not add to the structural deficit. Also, extra taxes,
benefit savings and reduced expenditure on temporary 
<?notus-xml column=162?>accommodation, et al, would immediately return much
of the extra spending. As London Councils and CIPFA have pointed out,
the borrowing caps are unnecessary given that councils are not subject
to caps on their non-housing

there is an anomaly here, which the noble Lord, Lord
Shipley, has pointed out. In the other countries of Europe, this kind
of borrowing by the municipalities is counted as trading and falls
outside the definition of public expenditure used by the EU, the IMF
and the OECD. By inventing borrowing rules that are unique to the UK,
we are tying one hand behind our backs, as Professor Steve Wilcox of

for many

understand the dilemma facing the Treasury. The problem is that raising
the cap or changing the definition used in this country to mirror that
elsewhere could send out the wrong signal. Even if it is entirely
justified and sensible, the impression could be given that the UK is
taking a more relaxed view of borrowing in the public sector. However,
the sums involved are small. Council borrowing accounts for just over
6% of the total, and the estimated extra £7 billion that
would be borrowed over five years, if this amendment was
accepted, is a small part of local government borrowing. Managing the
presentation of this change should surely be
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000202" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000202">Turning
to housing associations as the key providers of affordable homes has
worked well but has relied on them borrowing heavily as grant levels
have been cut back. Many will run out of borrowing capacity in about
two years’ time and many of these so-called registered providers

important level of development. We are going to need to bring on stream

was so ably moved by my noble friend Lord Shipley and spoken to very
eloquently and powerfully by the noble Lords, Lord Jenkin of Roding and

that letter during this debate. I think it is noteworthy to list the
organisations that have signed that letter. Reference has been made to
there being quite a number, but it would be useful to have the
signatories on record. They are: London 
<?notus-xml column=163?>Councils, which represents all 32 London boroughs and the City of
London; the British Property Federation; the Chartered Institute of
Housing; the Home Builders Federation; the Local Government

read that out, deliberately, to get it on record and to show what a
wide range of support the amendment has from local government,
planning, and the housing sector. It is hard to think immediately of an
appropriate organisation that has not signed the letter. There is now
overwhelming support for the lifting of the borrowing cap. As the noble
Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, there are overwhelming reasons for doing so
and it is hard to see why we should still be resisting it. As he and I
recognise, the Minister who has the misfortune to have to reply to this
debate is not the person who will be in a position to do anything about
this. We all recognise that we are addressing our remarks, not to the
Minister who will reply in a few minutes, but to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer who has a speech to make next week. He must urgently
recognise this need. The noble Lord, Lord Best, has referred to the
message he is concerned about sending out. The message the Government
want to send out, which is shared on all sides of this House, is that
there is an urgent need to get building. That is the important message
from this debate. The Bill must recognise the need for more housing. It
must also recognise the need for growth which is in the title of the
Bill and which many of us feel the Bill is not yet doing enough to
achieve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031242000207" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000207">We
therefore urge the Chancellor, through the Minister who will reply
shortly, seriously to consider lifting the cap or, at the very least,
sending a clear and strong message that that is the Government’s
intention. Reference has already been made to the international
consideration that the United Kingdom is the only country in the EU not
to use the internationally recognised rules. If we were to do so, it
would have very little effect in terms of the message to which the
noble Lord, Lord Best, referred. I understand that, standing on this
side of the Chamber, praying in aid of the European Union is
not always to my advantage, but on this occasion the Government should
give serious consideration to that. I hope the Minister will surprise
us all, stand up and say that the Government are now ready and able to
accept the amendment and that the cap will be raised in the way
suggested. If that does not happen today, I hope we will see a
more positive move in a few days’ time in another place. If that
cannot happen now—I would need to understand in the next week or
two why it cannot happen now—will the Government at least
reassess the borrowing ability under the current cap? Will they speed
up consideration of the consultation on the use of other means, such as
using local government pension funds?</hs_para>

what has been said. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, made the point that
this is important for its economic impact. As it concerns
housebuilding, 92p in every £1 is spent within the UK, making it
a very effective way of recycling money within the British economy. It
has a strong multiplier effect. This goes to the heart of what
the Bill is about. The provision would have a great social impact,
because, as noble Lords have commented, we have not produced enough
social housing in this country for many years now, with great shortages
across the country. We need to do more on that. This provision would

financial arguments, too, are strong, because the provision would be
almost cost free for the Government. They would not be committing any
tax revenue, but it would impact on deficit reduction. Not only would
it produce the tax revenue that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, mentioned
but it would reduce housing benefit payments, because, as people moved
into social housing rather than the private sector, housing benefit
payments would go down and fewer people would be stuck in temporary

noble Lord, Lord Shipley, mentioned the bedroom tax. He is absolutely
right that, in many parts of the country, the mix of housing is not
right to meet the problems addressed by the tax. There will be pressure
to build one and two-bedroom properties to do that. However, the
bedroom tax will have a greater impact than that. It will have a
financial impact on the HRAs of many authorities as people choose not
to pay. In my own authority, of the 4,500 households which will have
problems with the bedroom tax, more than 550 are in
properties on which we have spent a considerable amount of money
adapting to the needs of some disabilities. If those people have to
move, we reckon that it will cost us more than £1.5 million
simply to place them in a smaller property that meets the needs of
their
disability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T17:01:36"></hs_TimeCode>.

authority world or the housebuilding world, of whom you might say,
“Well, they would support this kind of amendment,

Government have—in a sense—already facilitated this by
completing the reforms to the housing revenue account system
promulgated under the previous Government. The report’s other
recommendations covered the sharing and pooling of borrowing headroom,
a changed role for ALMOs, a change in the classification of debt,
looking to the bond markets as an alternative source of funding for the
Public Works Loan Board, doing more to release land and ensuring
like-for- like replacement of houses under the right-to-buy
provision. We should—and are—looking at these issues
comprehensively rather than in the piecemeal fashion suggested in this
amendment.</hs_para>

171 of the Localism Act 2011 provides powers to the Secretary of State
to set a limit on the amount of housing debt each stock-holding local
authority can hold. This was felt necessary because the self-financing
settlement, successfully concluded in April 2012, gave local authority
landlords direct control over a very large rental income stream and
with it the potential to increase levels of borrowing beyond
what we as a country can afford—indeed, far beyond what could be
accommodated within the prudential code. I remind noble Lords that when
the Local Government Act 2003, which introduced the
prudential code, was enacted, local authorities did not have access to
this extremely large income, which is now provided by self-financing. 
<?notus-xml column=167?>Several noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Best, mentioned this

self-financing must be affordable within national fiscal policies,
which the prudential borrowing rules do not address.</hs_para>

committed to this objective. Noble Lords and others cite this amendment
as a means to increase housebuilding. Let me assure noble Lords that
the Government are committed to seeing an increase in housebuilding and
have indeed made it easier for local authorities to build. Under
self-financing we have given local authorities direct control over
their rental income, some of which they may wish to invest in new
homes. I remind noble Lords that the vast majority of council

McKenzie, alluded to Labour leading the charge, to use his words, in
housebuilding up and down the country. It is interesting to
reflect on the 26 authorities which are delivering nearly 4,000 new
homes with grant funding via the Homes and Communities Agency or the
GLA. “Leading the charge” may be a slight exaggeration.
If we look at those 26 authorities, three of them are Liberal Democrat

getting into a political point here, the fact is that housebuilding is
occurring. It is taking place within the limits which are being set by

To put it in the wider context, in addition to that which we will
deliver through the reinvigorated right to buy, 170,000 more affordable

raised and I will seek to answer at least some of them. Those which I
do not answer, we shall of course seek to respond to in writing.
Several noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord Shipley and the
noble Lord, Lord Best, asked why the Government do not use the general
government gross debt instead of the public sector net debt to account
for housing debt—a move that would bring us into line with some
of our European neighbours, as noble Lords pointed out. I remind noble
Lords that the general government gross debt excludes the net debt
provision of public corporations, which includes housing debt. The
Government use public sector net debt as the key measure of debt
because their view is that it is the best principled measure of
government indebtedness. One reason for this is because the Government
are generally likely to step in if public corporations cannot service
their liabilities, so a focus on public sector net debt provides a
fuller and more transparent picture of the Government’s total
liabilities. If there are not controls over public corporations’
accrual of liabilities, it means that the Government do 
<?notus-xml column=168?>not have control over their contingent liabilities, which if called upon
would impact on the deficit as well as on general government gross
debt.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031242000230" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0001.htm#13031242000230">Perhaps
I could pick up on a few additional points. I believe it was my noble
friend Lord Shipley who referred to the impact on financial markets.
The financial markets have a view on this; the Government’s view
remains that we are determined to ensure that the housing debt remains
affordable. The figure of £30 billion is one which is
perceived and we certainly do not wish to see any rise in that figure.
The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, mentioned various schemes and the Select
Committee. On the specific points that he made on them, I will respond
to him in writing if I can.</hs_para>

have a few general points. Some councils have looked at releasing land,
and surveys have indicated that there is a great support for that. We
welcome this and would encourage all local authorities to look to
release more land for housing development. Where authorities cannot
themselves afford to build, we would certainly encourage the release of
land to housing associations for that purpose. We have also heard that
councils are keen to invest and can do so quickly. We have heard about
how they can work in partnership. We recognise that some local
authorities have the willingness and capacity to deliver but
equally—I come back to the point I made earlier—we cannot

about the importance of reducing the national deficit, and we can agree
with that. The point is that housing revenue account borrowing, because
it has been ring-fenced since April 2012, need not count as part of the
national deficit. I find it strange that the Government can promote
sales of owner-occupied housing, where the average debt is
£111,000, but with local authority housing, which has an average
debt of only £17,000, they deem borrowing against the asset of
those houses to be a challenge to the national deficit. There does not
seem to be any logic in the Government’s position. I make no
apologies for saying so, because housing revenue accounts are now
ring-fenced and should not count as public sector debt. If the
Government have a concern about the borrowing plans of any local
authority, they have the power now, under the Local Government Act
2003, to cap that authority. However, they should not cap an authority

two-speed regional growth with city deal areas motoring ahead and other
regional cities or towns left behind. While we welcome the stated
intent that the Government wish to move away from a London-centric
approach, we do not want to see that replaced with a “some
cities”-centric approach. It is essential that we develop a
strategy that works for the whole country, rather than just part of it.
We understand that the second wave of deals will enter staggered
negotiations on devolved powers and funding, with the aim of these
being concluded by the end of 2013. Of course, not everything can be
accomplished at once, but there are recorded expressions of disquiet

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, we
discussed this issue very thoroughly in Committee, as the noble Lord,
Lord McKenzie, said. I welcome the general support for the initiative.
City deals are about bespoke solutions to unlocking local growth and
trialling different and innovative approaches. They offer a real
opportunity to drive growth across the country. The first
eight cities have estimated that their deals will create
175,000 jobs over the next 20 years and 37,000 new
apprenticeships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031265000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031265000015">Following<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T17:28:22"></hs_TimeCode>

areas, to which the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has already alluded.
They have submitted their initial proposals and we are working closely
with these areas. However, it would not be appropriate or effective or
represent value for money to roll these out to all local authorities in
the same format. I have already said that these are bespoke solutions
for each
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031265000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031265000016">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T17:28:49"></hs_TimeCode>
city deals are not the solution everywhere, the Government recognise
the importance of effective devolution. We have a strong record of
commitment to a localist agenda and are working with authorities to
provide the powers and support they need. Therefore, where it would
make sense to make local models developed in city deals more widely
available, as I have previously said, we will certainly do
so.</hs_para>

compared with 56% under the current formula grant system. From next
April, councils will retain nearly £11 billion of business
rates. This was recently initiated. I know that many noble Lords from
across the Chamber have been involved in local government and that this
is something for which, through their own experience in local
government, they have campaigned long and hard. That is now happening.
In addition, the Government intend to devolve a greater proportion of

areas on the basis of strategic plans developed by local enterprise

policy that the amendment seeks to

we hope there will be a response quite soon. Separately, there is the
request in this amendment that, within one year of the second round of
city deals being completed, a report would be produced. That could take
us through to the autumn of 2014. Then, quite separately, there was the
Deputy Prime Minister’s commitment at the end of October, which
I quoted in Committee, when he said of the second

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
reply. We agree with the Government about the progress of city deals
thus far. However, the amendment is about completing arrangements so
that councils that feel left out at the moment can be reassured that a
process is under way, a requirement on the Government to report back.
It does not require the Government to produce exactly the same solution
for every council; it recognises that there will not necessarily be
arrangements for absolutely every council in the land. We are trying to
ensure that councils that at the moment feel uneasy about the
concentration on urban areas, and are feeling left out, are reassured.
If the Deputy Prime Minister says that that is a step along the way,
that is fine, but why not accept the amendment, which imposes an extra
obligation on the Government to make sure that what has happened so far
is just a step along the
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T17:33:30"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

difficulty is that if a landlord tries to sell some land to which there

waiting two years to see whether a challenge is made before completing
the purchase. This is unnecessary in the context of today’s

year the “period of grace” within which a town or village
green 
<?notus-xml column=178?>application can be made after the requisite 20 years
of recreational use as of right has ceased. Currently Section 15(3) of
the Commons Act 2006 allows a two-year period during which a greens
application can be made after the end of a 20-year period of
recreational use as of right. After such use has been challenged, it
takes time for the local community to recognise that challenge and, if
it wishes, to put together the information necessary to make an
application. The key steps would be to seek out evidence in support of
the application, to identify witnesses, to gather testimony and to
collate and prepare evidence for submission.</hs_para>

important points about the impact of the current legislation on
landowners. Her concerns are valid, and I agree that a period of a year
is sufficient for users of land to gather the necessary information to
make a greens application. A period of a year provides a better balance
between the rights of landowners and those of recreational users of
land. Therefore, I accept the amendment and I urge all noble Lords to

it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000032">The

new provisions end the right to apply for registration if a trigger

of an application for planning permission on the land, or a similar
action such as an application for development consent; or the
publication for consultation of a draft development plan
document—that is, a document that is proposed to form part of
the local development framework or “local plan”—or
a draft neighbourhood plan. In this context we welcome government

some of our concerns in relation to those

other amendments are intended to assist the Government in their stated
wish to align the system for registering greens with the planning
system in cases where there is a published proposal for development,
either as a planning application or as a draft of part of a local plan.
Unfortunately, the proposals in the Bill do not do this. The problem is
that there are two separate and different systems. The system for
registering greens, set out in the Commons Act 2006 and rooted in the
common law, is based on the facts of the case—whether the land
has been used by persons for at least 20 years as of right for lawful
sports and pastimes. It is based on the facts of past use of
land.</hs_para>

in the planning system are a matter of policy and opinion about the
future use of land. It is difficult to reconcile the two—to
align them—but not impossible. The way this Bill deals with the
matter is not to align the two processes, but to suspend one of
them—the right to apply to register a green—when a
trigger event occurs under the planning system.</hs_para>

accept that the Government believe that there is a problem of misuse of
the system of greens registration by some people in order to try to
stop development, and that there is a weight of opinion behind this
view. In Committee we moved amendments to probe the extent of this and
its necessity. Now we are proposing ways in which both rights can be
aligned within one process—the planning process—giving
the Government what they want while retaining the effective right of
people to put forward a view that a piece of land is a green, and to
have that properly considered as part of the planning process. The
amendments we have put forward suggest ways of doing this and could be
taken individually. They are not necessarily a package.</hs_para>

simplest, and just seeks to incorporate within the system of
development management the question of whether a piece of land is a
town or village green under the criteria set out in Section 15 of the
Commons Act. It simply says that, where such a representation is made
as part of the 
<?notus-xml column=182?>development management process, this question is a material
consideration. Of course, like any other such representation it may be
accepted or rejected by the relevant decision-making authority. It
should not slow down the process of making the decision in any
significant
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000054">The first
part of Amendment 45A says that where the trigger event is the
publication of a draft development plan document, which includes a
proposal for a piece of land that has not previously been in the public
domain, the trigger event should not occur until three months following
the date of that publication. This may occur, for instance, if a
last-minute change is made to a draft development plan document
covering land allocation, as a result of representations made as part
of a previous round of consultation on that question, such as on a
housing land availability study. It would still allow a green
registration application to be made. The second part of Amendment 45A
will in most cases be covered by the Government Amendments
42 to 45, for which I have already thanked the Minister.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>, we
recognise that this may be a step too far for the Government. So
Amendment 45B states that if representations are made to a local
planning authority or a neighbourhood planning body, as part of the
normal consultations on a local plan or a neighbourhood development
plan, that a particular piece of land is a town or village green, the
authority must consider them having regard to the criteria set out in
Section 15 of the Commons Act.</hs_para>

the appropriate authority would not have the power to designate and
register the land as a green, applying the same criteria in this way
would indeed align the two processes, which is what Ministers promised
that they wanted to do, whether or not a trigger event has occurred. If
the planning authority considers that the land qualifies as a green it
could of course then be referred on to the commons registration
authority for it to consider in the normal way. We expect this would be
in a small minority of cases. However, the time taken to produce local
plans would mean there is time for this process to take place. We
emphasise that this procedure would only apply in plan making, which
inevitably takes years rather than weeks, and not in the case of
planning applications and the like which should be dealt with
speedily.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000056">These
amendments are put forward in a positive way, in an effort to
reconcile—indeed to align—the planning and green
registration systems. In the disappointing event that the Minister is
unable to accept them today, perhaps he can answer the following
questions. There are six. If the intention is to align the system, what
consideration can the planning bodies give during the plan-making
process to representations that a piece of land qualifies as a town or
village green, either as part of the local plan process or a
neighbourhood plan? Secondly, if a planning authority or neighbourhood
planning body considers a piece of land to be a green on the basis of
the criteria in Section 15 of the Commons Act, what action may it take

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, once again, I thank my noble
friend for his sterling performance as my noble friend Lord Greaves. My
noble friend Lord Tope has articulated eloquently the concerns that my
noble friend wished to raise. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, for indicating that he will not press Amendment 41A, and note

to Amendment 40C, one of four amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord
Greaves, we have debated the order-making powers previously, and why
they are required, so I will avoid going into too much detail. My noble
friend Lady Hanham explained in Committee that the Government propose
to bring other planning procedures within the scope of the reforms for
registering greens: local development orders, neighbourhood development
orders and Transport and Works Act orders. My noble friend also
explained that we would consult on our proposals. We have also, as my
noble friend said that we would, responded positively to the
recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
that new Section 15C(5) should be subject to the affirmative procedure.
Consequently, Parliament will have the opportunity to scrutinise any
draft order proposed in the light of public consultation.</hs_para>

friend Lady Hanham pointed out in Committee the need for additional
terminating events to ensure that all outcomes in plan making are
covered. We want to avoid the situation where an exclusion on
applications to register land as a green fails to lift even when there
is no longer an active development proposal. That would be contrary to
our policy and unfair. Amendment 40C, tabled by my noble friend Lord
Greaves, would stop such change from being made without requiring
further primary legislation. That cannot be
practicable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000068">I
turn to the proposed new clause in Amendment 41B. I appreciate why my
noble friend Lord Greaves wants to ensure that the potential value of
land as a green will be considered as part of the planning process, but
there is no need for the amendment to secure this intention. In
considering an application for planning permission or for development
consent, the recreational value of the land concerned is already
capable of 
<?notus-xml column=185?>being a material consideration. Material
considerations will relate to the development and use of land in the
public interest.</hs_para>

House wants to move on, and I will turn specifically to answer at least
some, if not all, of the questions raised by my noble friend Lord Tope.
One question that he asked was, if a planning authority or
neighbourhood planning authority feels that a land should be a green,
what should it do? Where that is raised with a planning authority or
the neighbourhood planning body, they should bear that in mind when
considering a planning application or taking forward their draft plan.
If they want the land to be kept open, they should not be supporting
development on the land. If there is no development proposal, residents
can also apply to register the land
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:18:55"></hs_TimeCode>as a
green.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000070">My
noble friend raised a couple of questions about trigger events. First,
what would constitute a trigger event? Only the courts can give an
authoritative interpretation of statute, but the intention in respect
of the applications for planning permission and development consent is
that a trigger point takes effect at whatever is the earliest of the
required publication steps. The power in Clause 14(1)(3) could, if
necessary, be used to make amendments to clarify when any of the
trigger or terminating events are to be treated as having occurred. He
also asked about trigger points arising in respect of draft development
plan documents. For local plans the trigger point is when a draft plan
is formally published by the local planning authority for consultation
prior to being subject to an independent examination. The local
community will then have an opportunity to make representations in
support of or in opposition to proposals in the draft plan and to
engage in the examination
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:19:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:19:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

raised on the publication of any prior reports that are not a draft
development plan and whether they could be a trigger event. The short
answer is no. The trigger event refers only to the publication
of development plan documents. The publication of anything that
is not a development plan document would not constitute a trigger
event. If there are a couple of areas that perhaps I have not answered
in the detail that my noble friend asked for in representing my noble
friend Lord Greaves I shall seek to clarify that before the next stage.

certainly not my wish to do so. I am content with the provisions as
they are. However, I think that my noble friend made clear that his
intention was to try to find a way to align two different systems here,
and he has gone into characteristic detail on how to try to do that. As
he said in what he described as his “more than usually concise

this idea of doubling permitted development in back gardens sprang
from. As I have demonstrated, it was not in any manifesto—quite
the reverse. It certainly did not come from your Lordships’ long
debates on planning. It was never mentioned. It has not come from any
great public call for action. Indeed, as the LGA has demonstrated
comprehensively, most extensions outside permitted development are
considered swiftly and most are agreed, but after the normal process of
mediation and sometimes modification between neighbours that the
planning process deliberately and sensibly allows. This idea just
tipped out all of a sudden with a ragbag of other ideas, with no prior
notice at all, and a hasty six-week consultation was timed to finish on
Christmas Eve. We have seen no formal results from or formal
response to that consultation, yet Parliament is expected to opine on
planning. I rather suspect that if there had been overwhelming popular
backing in the consultation, we would have seen the detailed response
long ago. I certainly have

not, unless 6 or 8-metre additions to the backs of houses become more
of the unapproved back-garden bedsits that many councils already have
to fight. Will there be a boon for expanding young families, as has
been suggested? Hardly, for it concerns ground-floor extensions not
bedrooms. Will there be a transformation of the economy, as some have
said, in a country where we are wrangling about whether we should
borrow £13 million or £14 million every hour? Of course
there will not be. More unlicensed development in Britain’s back

opinion that all planning is bad and that any relaxation of planning is
a public good. Some relaxations of planning—and we have had a
number of them lately, which many of us have supported—are good,
but I do not agree in this particular case. It was put to me directly
by one of the proponents of this plan that we have gone too far in
respecting the amenity and rights of home owners and need to redress
that balance. That was not an argument I expected ever to hear from a

8-metre extensions. I cannot agree with that and tabled this amendment
as a way of trying to persuade the Government to change their mind. Six
or eight metres may not seem much to those, frankly, who are more
fortunately endowed, but for most people who have got their way on to
the housing ladder, their home represents the mainspring of their
wealth, the heart of their security, their pride and what they value.
Of course they value that hard-won amenity and will have a view on a
major construction near their doorstep which will certainly add to the

the new power will be those who have had an overbearing extension

which local authorities could still opt out of this proposal. However,
that power is cumbersome, takes months to introduce and involves
writing to thousands of homes if there is not to be a risk of legal
challenge. It is costly in terms of potential compensation claims and
lost planning fees, and can be used only so long as the Government
agree. I ask my noble friend to say directly when she replies whether
Ministers will agree to all such Article 4 proposals. If so,
then why not accept the much simpler, swifter, less costly and
non-bureaucratic route offered in my amendment? If not, then please do
not let the Government any more advance the argument that such an

government plan. My proposal respects localism and does not interfere
with applications, but protects that sense of fairness and justice that
comes from home owners having the right to make representations on

councils to protect back gardens where that is seen as important, but
allows the Government to extend rights in other places where that is

rivalry and some competition between the two authorities. Certainly
within my party, Richmond seems to alternate every election between who
is going to run the council; I am pleased to say that the electors of
Sutton have remained more consistently true, at least for the past 27
years, as to who would run the council. That competition continued back

of our authorities would be the first to condemn it. I think on that

has explained very well, that allowing extensions into back gardens
will make a significant difference to the growth of the nation? Of
course it will not; it is laughable. What it will bring about a
considerable growth in is neighbour disputes. I can think of no single
measure more likely—indeed, one might say more
designed—to set neighbour against neighbour, particularly when
they find that there is actually no court of arbitration. They would
expect the local planning authority to be able to hear both sides of
the case and to make a judgment, as with the normal planning process.
When neighbours find themselves in this position and discover that that
power has been taken away from the local planning authority, and with
it therefore their right to make representations to anyone, I can think
of little better designed to cause neighbour upset and to damage
community cohesion, for no purpose whatever.

Earl of Lytton:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the thrust of this
amendment because my professional work puts me at the sharp end of the
fall-out from precisely this type of policy. As the noble Lord, Lord
True, has said, we risk in effect a flip-flop from avoiding the
regulation of the colour of front doors and replacement windows to no
control at all. If ever there was an example of parliamentary process
being a blunt instrument, I suspect this is
one.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000095">I have
problems with this area of government policy in its cumulative effects.
We seem almost to have a good cop Government wishing to deregulate,
which I can understand and sympathise with, and conferring additional
free development rights on householders. However, I am bound to say
that I do not see the noble Lord, Lord True, and the LGA in the
opposite camp 
<?notus-xml column=192?>of bad cop either. One of the great virtues of
planning policy, among all the things that I, we and clients regularly
curse about the intrusiveness of it, is that it has actually protected
the built and the semi-natural environment of the urban and rural
landscape. It has done so in such a way that our European neighbours
come over here to see how we have managed to do it all the years since
the post war era when the first planning Acts came
in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000096">The real
possibility here is the increasing urbanisation of domestic back
gardens and the materially increased density of that whole built
environment. That is not without consequences, as the noble Lord has
consistently pointed out on this and previous occasions. I recently
attended a number of meetings at the Minister’s old stamping
ground, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which has a
basements working group. Your Lordships might wonder what basements
have to do with all this, but I can tell you that a lot of
basements are constructed in back gardens, so the thing is not entirely
without its
relevance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000097">A
number of things came through there which I think were very interesting
and that have to some extent informed my views. First, there is a risk
that open space between buildings for light, air and privacy might be
compromised, and the only thing that stands between the general rights
of permitted development and getting a fair balance between neighbours
is some intervention by the local planning authority. It is a matter of
scale and proportion, but of course it has visual and amenity
consequences. Beyond that, in valuation terms, the mercantile gain for
one person who happens to construct their particular scheme might lead
to the erosion of the visual appeal and consequential value of
neighbours’ property, unless, as I say, they are carefully
regulated and kept in fair
proportion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000098">Technically—this
is where I pick up the point that the noble Lord, Lord Tope,
made—it brings additional pressures on the limits of property
ownership, particularly in relation to boundaries. We already have a
substantial amount of that in the more expensive parts of inner London
boroughs. Property values as an impetus already cause serious friction
between neighbours. I know this because a good deal of my professional
work relates to neighbour
disputes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000099">That
might not matter if we had a land registry title plan that was a
precise guide to ownership. Unfortunately, such plans do not provide
that. Even in an urban area of 1:1,250 mapping scale, there is an error
factor, as set out by the land registry own guidance, of plus or minus
1 metre on the ground either way. On a plan of that scale, that
represents 0.8 millimetres thick, plus or minus. It is no idle
suggestion, therefore, that this might increase neighbour disputes,
because the process of establishing precise ownership is sometimes
clear but sometimes very far from clear, and the registered title does
not help.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13031262000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000169">6.45

this is the generally held belief that if you do not need local

point relates to some other principles of urbanisation and the effects
on the environment. During the discussions on the basements policy with
the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, a letter came in from
Savills, the agents acting for Thames Water. Savills is a very large
international firm. It pointed out the potentially deleterious effects
of developments in domestic gardens, the consequences for compromising
infiltration of rain into the subsoil caused by impervious surfaces,
and the outcomes for public drainage
capacity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000103">Furthermore,
it flagged up what I will nickname the “Chelsea sponge”
effect: the overall cubic capacity of the subsoil available to absorb
and then gradually lose and release surface and ground water. I am
certain that there is a Richmond sponge, a Wandsworth sponge, and a
Sutton sponge. There is certainly an Exmoor sponge, about which I
tendered a paper some time ago. It applies all over the place. Thames
Water also volunteered that, in its view, some 20% of the green space
in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea had been lost over the
last 20 years. Therefore, it viewed with some concern the interruption
and the covering of these areas with if not hard surfaces then
impervious objects below the
surface.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000104">That
has some bearing on Thames Water’s Thames tideway scheme. It is
significantly affected—I will not say largely because I am no

more quickly into the Victorian sewerage system has a material effect
on its ability to

is that the relaxation of planning rules on back gardens cannot safely
be made on the basis of a global sweep of the hand. I do not think it
is reasonable to abolish controls and then expect local planning
authorities to pick up the pieces via an Article 4 direction. An
Article 4 direction requires a process that may be subject to
challenge, and it will allow all manner of expectations to be built up,
which may in turn affect the ability to achieve this, because the
potential compensation implications for householders who have proceeded
in the expectation of being able to get development are removed by any
Article 4 direction. Much better that this is not removed wholesale but
that the discretion is placed in the hands of the local
authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000106">I

poor siting and a bad choice of materials affect long-term values. For

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I have added my name to this
amendment and we are wholly supportive of it. We have heard from the
noble Lord, Lord True, a devastating critique of the
Government’s proposals, strongly supported by the noble Lord,
Lord Tope. We have heard the practical and professional considerations
from the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, about what they mean in practice.
Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Elton, 
<?notus-xml column=195?>described a typical garden, and that is exactly the
situation in large areas of Luton that were built in the early part of
the previous century and sometimes before. The noble Lord is absolutely
right that neighbours can impact dramatically on the quality of life,

is actually facilitating
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031262000113" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031262000113">In many

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I hear what the noble
Lord has said and what my noble friend has said in moving the
amendment. I appreciate very much that noble Lords wish to make sure
that local authorities are able to adapt national permitted development
rights to their own circumstances. Indeed, it is an important element,
which we recognise, that national development rights have an effect on
different areas, urban and rural. The noble Lord did not speak to
Amendment 46AA, which would be the other side of the coin: opt in or
opt out. Therefore, I will address only Amendment 46.</hs_para>

tweaking, with noble Lords saying that I will use Article 4 directions
in my response. Not surprisingly, I am going to do so. As the noble
Lords, Lord True and Lord Tope, will be well aware, an Article 4
direction can already be introduced to remove specific permitted
development rights in a defined area. Those areas can be very small:
only a few houses, a conservation area, one street or two blocks of
houses. They can be tailored in a way that puts a permitted development
into a defined
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031272000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031272000003">There
was a suggestion that if an Article 4 direction was put forward it had
to be submitted to the Secretary of State for a decision. It does not
have to go to the Secretary of State for approval. The Secretary of
State would intervene only where the power was being used unreasonably
by the local planning authority. One would hope that that would never
take place as the planning authority would have to consult local
residents before implementation. It is not sensible just to wipe out
the Article 4 directions. It is one of the lines that local authorities
can take and we would expect them to do so where necessary.</hs_para>

the building and the benefit is to the person who owns the

limited extent—to have a new kitchen or whatever they need. I

has no support from anybody present in this House. I do not hold her
responsible for that. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, asked

are taking away, if you look in the other end of the telescope, a major
right from those who are neighbours of people who want to build very
large extensions. I repeat what I said: in some of the small, terraced

of my many eccentricities is that I used to spend a lot of time when I
was young reading Livy, the Roman historian. The third decade of his
books, about the wars against Hannibal, relate that, after three
crushing defeats, the Roman generals, Fabius and Claudius Marcellus,
although the latter was a little more vigorous, did not take on the
Carthaginian field army until the Romans thought that they had the
balance of forces in their favour. Despite the overwhelming opinion in
the House being in favour of this position, I do not believe that
something analogous is likely to happen at this moment. I want to study
particularly carefully the point made by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie,
about Article 4, which is critical. I reserve the right to come back to
it at Third Reading, perhaps looking at Amendment 46AA. We need to
clarify how local authorities opt out. It is true that the Secretary of

Elton, Trefgarne and McKenzie came crashing against the citadel, I do
not have too many illusions about how my amendment, which is much more
radical and not in the least bit modest, might be faced by the Front
Bench. Nevertheless, I shall persevere because the issue is of such
importance. I have been in the House for only two-and-a-half years, but

4 and LDOs are no longer fit for purpose, as has already been mentioned
by several speakers on the previous amendment. Local authorities must
give one year’s notice before they can use Article 4 directions
to avoid high levels of compensation. They are time-consuming and
unnecessarily bureaucratic as well as being expensive. Although this is
contested by the Department for Communities and Local Government, these
devices are rarely used by local authorities. Indeed, the LGA has

46A would localise permitted development, allowing planning authorities
to tailor individual frameworks for their own local areas so that they
supported economic growth in the most appropriate and sustainable way.
This could lead to a boost in development overall and would be
a localist measure. Democratically elected representatives, accountable
at the ballot box, would be given more power. This, if nothing else,

on the earlier amendment and will perhaps do so again now and at Third

I understand it, there are three types of article for direction: one
affects only listed buildings, one affects dwelling houses in
conservation areas and the other affects other properties. That latter
category has generally been used to cover commercial property in a

helpful under the circumstances as I rely again on the fact that local

to extend permitted development rights locally. They can be used with
local development orders, and local development orders provide a quick

Amendment 46B, which is the same one as was moved in Committee. It is
another attempt to provide for the NSIP/DCO regime to be the one-stop
shop for all construction-related consents that was initially promised
in the 2007 White Paper which led to the Planning Act 2008. It was one
of the many proposals to try to speed up the process for getting
consents for major projects. I think that one could call the present
regime a bit of a bazaar. I hope that that is not insulting to those
dealing with it. However, Sir Michael Pitt, of PINS, recently referred
to the fact that some 40% of all construction-related consents were
outside the DCO
regime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T19:27:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

never has been intended by this amendment to cover operational
consents, such as nuclear site operating licences or nuclear safety and
environmental permissions. However, the point that did not come out in
Committee is one of principle. How can it ever be right that an outside
body such as the Environment Agency or Natural England has a veto on
what a Minister can include in a DCO made by him or her? Section 150 of
the 2008 Act gives these outside bodies such a veto. It may have been
appropriate in the days of the IPC but it is no longer so when the
decisions on the proposed DCOs are taken by democratically elected and
accountable Ministers. Surely it is a fundamental principle that no one
should be able to dictate what goes into a DCO? They can make
representations, as this amendment proposes, but I suggest that,
ultimately, the decision must be the Minister’s alone with
reference to PINS’
recommendations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T19:28:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

key point here is that the regime needs to be flexible. It needs to
allow the promoter in discussion with the regulators to come up with a
proposed consents regime that is right for each individual project.
That may require some consents to be wrapped up in the DCO, by the DCO
disapplying them, and other consents to be retained separately.
However, there is a precedent for this, because disapplying consents by
orders—and indeed by Acts such as the Crossrail Act 2008 and the
Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996—is not the new concept that
observers of the debate in Committee might have been led to believe. It
is commonplace in the Transport and Works Act and the Harbours Act
regimes. In many cases separate consents is disapplied in exchange for
protective provisions for the benefit of the regulator concerned being
included in the order, such as provisions requiring the regulator to
approve detailed plans of the project before construction starts. These
protective provisions often then go on to provide for subsequent
monitoring and compliance with them to be enforced by the regulator
concerned, such as protective provisions in the TWA orders for the
benefit of the Environment Agency.</hs_para>

approach could be adopted in the case of DCOs. A single consenting
regime for the construction phase of large projects can deliver real
benefits and efficiencies, which I am sure is what the Government are
looking for. For example, in 2008 the Department for Transport decided
in response to the application for the harbour empowerment
order to authorise the London Gateway port—which is now under
construction; there were great pictures last week of what I think is
one of the biggest cranes in the world being floated into
it—that it was appropriate to disapply through the order much of
the Environment Agency’s consenting regime, because it was
already the case that the Port of London Authority would have to
approve detailed plans of the project before construction could start.
It did not make any sense to duplicate this, and add to the
promoters’ burden, by requiring plans also to be approved by the
Environment Agency. In this case, the EA would be able to feed its
comments into the PLA before the plans were approved by the PLA, which
had a whole host of environmental obligations in addition to its
conservation
role<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T19:19:58"></hs_TimeCode>. It can
reasonably assume that the preconstruction approval process would have
been even more complex, taken longer and been more expensive had the EA
had full plan approval rights. I think that if one were to ask the
promoters of the London Gateway port, they would say just how
successful this regime has been. It has probably cost them a lot of
money but it has happened a lot more quickly than it would otherwise
have done.</hs_para>

regulations in the letter which the noble Baroness kindly sent to Peers
yesterday do not make any difference to the case for this amendment.
They implement what the CLG proposed in its consultation paper of 26
November 2012, and amend the schedule to the Infrastructure Planning
(Miscellaneous Prescribed Provisions) Regulations 2010. That schedule
contained lists of consents and authorisations prescribed for the
purposes of Section 150(1) of the Planning Act 2008, meaning the
consents that can be disapplied by a DCO only with the agreement of the
regulator concerned. 
<?notus-xml column=205?>There is a lot of shuffling between Part 1 of the
Schedule and Part 2 concerning what is to be done in England and Wales
and what is to be done in Wales only. I do not think that the House
would want to hear from me on that tonight. However, the 16 consents
removed from the England list are those that are either redundant or
unlikely to apply to applications for development consents, so I
suggest that this change will have little effect although it is clearly
a useful tidying-up exercise.</hs_para>

Government’s continuing commitment to major infrastructure
projects—we hear good, welcome news from different Ministers on
that on an almost weekly basis—I urge Ministers to take these

taking a little time but I shall move on to Amendment 55, which
concerns the timescale for the commencement of certification for the
special parliamentary procedures reform. Again, this is something which
we discussed in Committee but I remain concerned about when the right
time is for this clause to come into effect. The reason for this
amendment is that the Government have announced that the reform of SPP
will apply only to projects where the applications were made after the
Bill was introduced on 18 October 2012, and that the reform
of certification requirements will apply only to applications that are
made after the provision comes into force.</hs_para>

are likely to be affected by the delayed introduction of Clauses 22 and
23, while further applications may be affected by the delayed
introduction of Clause 21. This means that much needed infrastructure
could suffer at least a year’s delay as that process is
undertaken, despite Parliament having legislated for it to be removed.
The two applications are, first, the Able marine energy park on
Humberside, which I believe to be one of the proposed land ports for
the development of offshore wind farms—farms which I suggest
will be quite important within the next year or five in ensuring that
we have enough electricity to keep the lights on—and, secondly,
the proposed Fieldes Lock power station in Hertfordshire. Similar
comments might apply there.</hs_para>

applying the changes to these projects is that they would allegedly be
retrospective if they did apply, since the applications would have been
made before the provisions of the Bill reducing SPP were known. There
may be a bit of a misconception here, for three reasons. First, the
intention to reform SPP was indicated on Budget Day last
year, 21 March 2012. The infrastructure delivery update says
at paragraph 5.1 that,</hs_para>

best part of a year’s warning. Budget 2012 was delivered before
the Fieldes Lock application was made and during the representation

development consent is the order that is actually made, so this trigger
applies only once an order has been made in response to an application
rather than before that. In the case of Able marine, the decision on
whether to make the order will be made on about 24 May, which
is likely to be after this Bill receives Royal Assent. The decision on
Fieldes Lock will be made after that. The trigger will therefore apply
after that receipt of Royal Assent, so applying these reforms to these
two cases would not be retrospective
legislation.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13031272000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031272000060">Thirdly,
the Fieldes Lock examination has not occurred yet, so there will be a
full opportunity to consider the issues that would trigger SPP during
that examination without any prejudice to any party. Although the Able
marine examination has taken place, in fact it considered compulsory
purchase issues at two hearings held in October where the bodies likely
to trigger SPP made oral representations to the examining
authority.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031272000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031272000061">We

Department took into account the potential for retrospective provisions
to give rise to unfairness, and the need to mitigate this as far as
reasonably possible. This included taking into account … the

It balanced this against the need to remove barriers to growth and the
desirability of avoiding delays in respect of Nationally Significant

but is there a document setting out how this balance was achieved and
who said what to whom? Is it the result of any consultation or do we
just have to take it from the Government that they know what is best?
This is a very important matter. I conclude that that is a very
conservative interpretation and approach to retrospective legislation.
We have the experience of the Rookery South SPP, which took more than
500 days and effectively delayed the construction of that project. The
one on the Humber is of particular concern because the DCO application
was heavily opposed by Associated British Ports on competition grounds,
resulting in the largest number of hearings so far for a DCO, so ABP
can be expected to take full advantage of the current SPP route. This
could probably take an awful lot longer than 500 days —maybe two
years or even longer, if the Joint Committee decided to hear the case.
Two years plus—is that a sensible time to rerun what is
effectively a second-time-round planning application when there is a
need for a shore base for an offshore wind farm? I should be very
interested to hear what the Minister has to say in response. I beg to

were taking a number of actions to expand and improve the one-stop-shop
approach for nationally significant infrastructure consents. Overall,
the responses to our recent consultation on proposals to expand and
improve the one-stop-shop approach were positive. We are now taking
forward a programme of work to deliver rapid implementation of these
proposals. In response to the concerns of developers about the
challenges of co-ordinating and aligning multiple consent application
procedures for nationally significant infrastructure projects, we will
be establishing a new consents service unit by April this year.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T19:41:53"></hs_TimeCode>We are also
streamlining the list of prescribed consultees set out in legislation,
reducing it by up to a third and streamlining the list of non-planning
consents which sit outside the development consent process. Regulations
implementing these changes have now been laid in Parliament. These
changes are in addition to the five separate certificates and consents
which are being removed from the Planning Act 2008 through clauses in
this Bill.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031272000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031272000065">We
think that this approach provides applicants with additional support

have considered carefully the way in which the provisions covering the
removal of certain consenting and certification requirements and the

want to ensure the right balance is struck between the need to deliver
infrastructure and the need to ensure that no one

there will always be a number of applications at different stages in

Planning Act 2008. Some applications will have been submitted before
this Bill was even introduced to Parliament for consideration. Some
applications will be in the examination phase now. In some cases, the

currently set out in the 2008 Act, but then finding that significant
changes had been made as a result of this Bill. Given this situation,
we think it important that there are transitional provisions in place

My Lords, this order amends the rules on collective
redundancies. It makes three changes. First, it reduces the current
90-day minimum period for 100 or more redundancies to 45
days. Secondly, it makes an equivalent change to the requirement to
notify the Secretary of State in advance of the first dismissal taking
effect. This period will also be reduced from 90 to 45 days. Thirdly,
the order removes fixed-term contracts that have reached their agreed
termination 
<?notus-xml column=210?>point from the obligation to consult the individuals affected. These
changes will be complemented by guidance on how to consult, which is
being developed by

changes in context by explaining the current rules. The rules are set
out in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992
and implement a European directive on collective redundancies. The
directive aims to protect employees in large-scale redundancies but not
to prevent employers from taking necessary steps to restructure.
However, UK legislation builds on the provisions in the directive by
introducing minimum periods before the first dismissals can take
effect. Where the employer is proposing 20 or more redundancies at a
single establishment within a period of 90 days or less, no redundancy
can occur until at least 30 days after the start of consultation where
between 20 and 99 redundancies are proposed, and no redundancy can
occur until at least 90 days after the start of the consultation where
100 or more redundancies are
proposed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T19:52:22"></hs_TimeCode>. This
does not affect individual notice periods. These do not begin until
redundancy notices have been issued, which cannot happen until
consultation is genuinely
complete<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T19:52:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031272000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031272000079">The
90-day minimum period looks long by comparison with other countries.
There is no minimum period in the US, Japan, Australia or New Zealand.
In addition, the European directive governing collective redundancy law
does not mandate a minimum period. As a consequence, the picture across
Europe is varied. For example, there is no minimum period in France or
Germany. It is 30 days in Spain, Belgium and Ireland, one month in the
Netherlands, and 45 days in Italy and
Poland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031272000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031272000080">Collective<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T19:53:09"></hs_TimeCode>
redundancy obligations have been in place for 40 years and there have
been no changes to the 90-day minimum period in that time. However, I
doubt that anyone who retired 40 years ago would recognise
today’s working environment. Modern communications technology
has made consultation easier and faster to carry out. People have
easier access to details about employment opportunities, and CVs can be
created and sent out in a matter of hours. Although it was once common
for people to spend their career in a single firm, nowadays careers are
made up of jobs in a variety of
organisations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T19:53:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031272000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031272000081">In
2011, the Government carried out a call for evidence on the collective
redundancy regime as part of a wider review of employment law. We then
consulted from July to September 2012. The evidence from both exercises
identified a number of issues. Employers were concerned that the rules
delayed their ability to respond to challenges and opportunities. A
business may need to restructure because it is involved in a merger or
acquisition, or it may gain a new contract that requires a change of
product or process. Of course, a business may also fail. Whatever the
reason, the ability to adapt can create a stronger business from which
it might expand in future, and that may include the creation of new
jobs. Alternatively, restructuring might simply be about assuring
survival and salvaging some jobs rather than losing them

employers need to consult. Consultation improves communication and
engagement. It ensures that employees feel included in what is
happening. It allows them to get used to the idea of change. It allows
employees to identify alternative options that the employer might have
overlooked. It allows them to ask questions and consider their own
personal options. For all these reasons, good employers take employee
consultation
seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031272000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031272000089">We
are not changing the requirement that employers consult on ways of
avoiding, reducing or mitigating proposed redundancies, nor are we
changing the need to demonstrate that the consultation has been
meaningful. The consultation might have to last longer than the minimum
period if the employer is to do this, or the employer might decide that
a longer period is necessary because it makes sense for them and their
workforce. We have also retained the level of punitive penalty that can
be made to employees who have not been consulted appropriately. This
can be up to 90 days’ pay per affected

the change relating to fixed-term employees, our consultation
identified confusion over whether the ending of a fixed-term contract
at the agreed point of expiry triggered an obligation to consult. For
example, if an employer had more than 20 fixed-term contracts coming to
an end within a 90-day period, employers were not clear whether they
needed to consult. This has proved particularly difficult for the
higher education sector, where the cycles of academic funding mean the
routine use of fixed-term appointments related to the academic year.

appointments where no one is any doubt that they are

a result, we have decided to take advantage of the provision in the
directive that allows member states to exclude fixed-term contracts

difficulties arising with the collective redundancy rules. The guidance
emphasises the importance of looking after employees. What employers do
and how they treat employees in difficult circumstances is crucial to

the question on pay. The committee argues that employees are unlikely
to be predisposed to viewing the new regime favourably because the

pay across affected employees of £250 million per annum. This
does not mean that the individuals lose out on this money. This is the
amount of money that the current employer will not pay to affected
employees. In practice, employees will almost certainly move to other
employment, which is the point that I made

small increase in the number of employees seeking jobseeker’s

here, including the point at which an individual starts job hunting.
The Government can see a considerable advantage for the employee in the
new regime, because it proffers certainty sooner, which is the point
that I made earlier, not only for those who end up losing their jobs

another ill-founded government proposal to attack workers’
rights. The Government’s own figures, over which we have had a
little exchange, estimate that this change represents a net loss of
£252 million—or, on the same page, £290 million; I
am a bit baffled by the two different sets of figures on page 2 of

I do not know quite how that can be justified. That to me almost seems
an anecdotal assessment rather than anything based on evidence. When I
listen to the Minister say that in practice employees move to other
jobs, I only wish that that were the case in 2013. Of course some will,
but for many this is going to be a very challenging and difficult
situation, with no guarantee that the employee will move to another
job, given the current levels of unemployment, which are running at
very high rates in various parts of the country. So I do not believe
that that is a fair statement of the
situation.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13031272000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031272000109">The
stated purpose, as we heard the Minister say, is to bring this up to
date and create a simple, understandable process that promotes quality
consultation and will allow the parties to engage in consultation that
is best suited to their circumstances, improve business flexibility to
restructure effectively and reduce business burdens.
“Flexibility” is the term used by the Government to
justify the steady erosion of employee rights. From our perspective, it
is part of a “hire and fire at will” philosophy and goes
along with the myth that the UK’s employment laws are somehow
ossified. However, according to the OECD, which I notice was quoted in
the report of the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee, the UK
already has one of the most flexible labour markets in the
world.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031272000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0002.htm#13031272000110">The
Government’s aim, they say, is to simplify the system for
employers. The Minister told us that the EU minimum requirement is 30
days, so I am unclear how a reduction to 45 days will necessarily
simplify the situation or provide greater clarity. My question to the
Minister is simple. It is the age-old question of, “What about
the workers?”. Many of them have given their working lives to
the company. They have served and worked loyally. They surely deserve
maximum consideration and consultation. The Minister said that it was
about survival of the companies. I take his mind back to the situation
in 2008 when we had a lot of companies going on short time. There was a
huge amount of co-operation, with workers accepting in that situation
that they could move to a three-day week. They made sure that there was
training involved and so on. The logic that less consultation will
somehow be better eludes me. Workers fully understand the importance of
the survival of companies, but they want a fair deal. This change does
not give them that.</hs_para>

degree of confusion about the current rules, the call for evidence

both employers and employee representatives. I would say that, given a
fair opportunity, employee representatives will respond positively.
This implies that there is a need for greater guidance for employers

UK employers have argued that the current regime for collective
redundancy consultation is harming their competitiveness on a global
level. They state that it is much quicker to restructure in other,

discussion in focus groups with employers suggests this is not a
universal view, and that in fact many view the process as easier in the
UK than the rest of the EU. Table 2 shows that, compared to the main
competitor nations across Europe and globally, the UK has a much higher
requirement for minimum periods before large-scale redundancies can
take effect. However, the table does not tell the whole story. Some of
the competitor nations listed (including France and Germany) rely on
strict enforcement and monitoring regimes to ensure minimum standards
of consultation where the UK relies on minimum periods before
redundancies can take effect”.</hs_quote>

redundancies have a big impact on local communities, as I have said.
Halving the amount of time required before an employer can make
employees redundant halves the amount of time that those employees have
to find a new job. It also possibly reduces the amount of time in which
they can explore redeployment and retraining opportunities. It also
reduces the time and ability of a labour market in a local authority to
absorb those job losses, and it has significant implications for local
authorities, which will need to provide for a sudden increase in those
out of work in their area.</hs_para>

not make any positive contribution to employment. The Government ought
to be stimulating the economy so that we get more growth and,
hopefully, diminish redundancies. The Government ought to be seeking
ways to encourage consultation, retraining and redeployment. If they
really wanted to help the situation further, they could also go some
way towards redressing the deficiencies in management training to

this takes place where 100 employees are involved, this means that we
are talking about larger companies. This may very well be in places
where there has been substantial unemployment because of the decline of
manufacturing industry in many areas—a decline for which we
should of course thank previous Conservative Administrations, in
particular the Thatcher Administration. There are many places where
manufacturing industry provided the local population with jobs over a
long period, but this is no longer the case, and individuals who face

redundancy and to find alternative

a more flexible workforce. I do not support that view at all. It is
regrettable that the Government are moving down this path. We shall
have to look very carefully at the way it operates, and the Government

that has been moved by my noble friend Lord Young. The present rules on
the period necessary for consultation are designed, in part at least,
to provide an opportunity for employers and unions to
explore alternatives to redundancy. These alternatives could be
short-time working or transfers to growing parts of the business. They
could be used to help those workers who are to be made redundant to
find alternative work with another employer.</hs_para>

is to be cut in half, these opportunities are inevitably reduced. Staff
will be laid off more quickly. The wages bill of an employer will be
cut correspondingly. However, the cost, as has been demonstrated by my
noble friend Lord Lea, will be 
<?notus-xml column=218?>met by those who are being made redundant. The impact assessment makes
it absolutely crystal clear that this is a straight transfer from
employees to their employer and, as my noble friend Lady Turner has

more quickly than would otherwise be the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031272000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#13031272000122">This is
the latest salami slice of employment rights. I remember that in the
1980s Jim Prior used to refer to a step-by-step approach when he was
legislating against trade unions. Now, with Vincent Cable and the
coalition Government, we have a slice-by-slice approach going on. The
measure before us is justified mainly by anecdotal evidence, and by the
cries of some—but by no means all—employers that
redundancies in the UK are too expensive. I see that there are also
some allegations that the UK has gold-plated the EU directive which
underpins this law. In fact, by easing the obligations of employers,
one makes UK employees more vulnerable to being fired when
multinational companies are cutting their staff. We in the trade union
world already feel that British workers are uniquely vulnerable because
of our so-called flexible labour market, which, as my noble friend Lord

is that the consultation arrangements in other European countries as a

the authorities can extend the period of consultation to find

austerity period together. Even in a straightforward redundancy
situation this carves out the salaried or hourly-paid workforce that
generally runs the company—we are talking about over
100 employees here. Yet in that same redundancy situation
you will probably have managers who have contracts of employment that
give them a notice period of six months up to as long as 12 months,
which would give them a cushion against unemployment. Here there will
also be workers who have nothing like that, and have a far shorter
period to become accustomed to what is happening to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T20:26:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031272000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#13031272000128">The
Minister has heard that good employers will probably, if they need to,
take more than 45 days. However, as in everything else, we need to
legislate for the bad employers, because the good employers will
usually follow their conscience. The bad employers will take advantage
of this. Anyone who has witnessed over 100 workers losing their jobs in
one go will know that it takes time and consideration. Certainly this
change has nothing at all to do with helping the growth measures that
we need in this country. It is about taking away the rights of workers
at a time in their working lives when they are the most vulnerable.
Their jobs are going and they need support at that time. This measure
will do nothing but harm to the workforce and do absolutely nothing at
all to help the growth in this country that this Government should be
concentrating on at the moment. This measure will do nothing at all to
assist

suggest that this is the latest example of this Government not letting

already had a reduction in the period for claiming unfair dismissal.

sledgehammer to crack a nut.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T20:28:49"></hs_TimeCode> see that there
were a total of 160 responses to the Government’s consultation.
That hardly suggests that this is a serious problem that needs to be
legislated on. Of the 160 who responded—who could be bothered to
respond because they thought that it was worth their while to do
so—only 100 commented on the need, as they saw it, to reduce the
consultation period. The impact assessment tells us that
approximately 96,000 people a year come into the category of
large-scale redundancies. That is out of a working population of 29
million. Therefore it is not a problem that employers are clamouring
for there to be legislation on, and it is not an issue that involves a
relatively large number of people, so why do the Government
feel the need to

the UK’s economy is already one of the most flexible in the

have one or two specific questions. A term that always bugs me is this
question of “business burdens”, which basically means it
is harder for employers to sack people. Unemployment is quite a burden
and there are many people in this country today that would welcome that
burden being lifted from their shoulders. Yet the Government seem to be
concentrating on burdens perceived by at least 160 employers, or
perhaps only 100 if we believe the figures that we have been given. I
was a trade union official for 12 years and negotiated in redundancy
situations under the current legislation and every attempt was made to
try to assuage the redundancies. Sometimes they were turned back and
sometimes, as my noble friend Lord Monks said, it was possible to
introduce short-term working. In situations where employees feel
vulnerable they are not going to be more productive at work. I fail to
see how it will improve productivity if you reduce employees’
protection. If somebody feels they have an axe circling above them that
could fall at any time and that they will have less time to find
alternative employment, I cannot see any way in which that is helpful.

raised a question about the £290 million reduction in wage
costs, which was suggested in the impact assessment. I will not repeat
that. The Minister has said he will respond. If he wants to do so in
writing I will happily accept that. However, there are one or two other
points I wish to raise. It seems to me that when the Government
undertake a consultation such as this there must be some driving factor
behind it. I am not sure that the Minister has outlined that as clearly
as he ought to have done. Currently, unemployment is high and is rising
and every effort should be made to keep people in work. The Minister
was being a bit disingenuous when he said that there are many
opportunities for people facing redundancy to find other employment
within that period. We know that when new jobs are created the trend is
for many of them to be part-time. It is not like-for-like. Somebody
working in the manufacturing industry will find it extremely difficult
to find another manufacturing job if he or she is made redundant. They
may find a part-time job or a job on a casual basis, but that does not
make the same contribution to their family income compared with the job

“We want to make it easier for employers to sack you and give
you less time to respond to employers who seek to do so”. That
is a worrying trend, although it is perhaps not surprising, and one

Minister’s speech raised my blood pressure, probably noticeably
so, by hiding, sweeping under the carpet, the huge costs to workers in
this change. There is a basic fallacy in saying that we stand in good
stead in comparison with Germany and France on this front. Germany and
France, and, indeed, Scandinavia, have one thing in common. They all
have permanent machinery for consultation with workers through
information and consultation bodies, bodies called works councils. We
created the whole philosophy and structure of the modern industrial
economy in Germany in the British High Commission zone, under
Ernest Bevin, in the scheme signed by Field Marshal
Montgomery and Marshall Rokossovsky, one of the most interesting
footnotes to that period of history. That means that there is no doubt
that there is access to the top decision-makers in the
company.</hs_para>

does the Minister think that those decisions are made? I will try to
answer my own question and see whether he has any logical disagreement
with it. They are made at top level by the board, or at least by the
CEO. As the research done for ACAS by the Warwick Business School
demonstrated, the local managers generally know as little about what is
going on as do the shop floor. To say that the shop floor
representatives can talk to the local managers is a waste of space.
Indeed, our system is so second-order to those in the countries I
mentioned that redundancy is almost always a fait accompli by the time
that it gets announced, whether it is over 90 days or 45. Why is it
always a fait accompli? Because there has been no history of knowledge
about what are the company's problems.</hs_para>

have made this point once before. If you have a structure of
involvement of the workforce, it cuts out this “us versus
them”—much derided in the 1970s. Instead of having the
machinery to say, “We are all in this together”, we
simply mouth the words and drive the two sides further apart. The
workers’ representatives are put together literally overnight
with no background knowledge about these matters. Is that a sensible
way to run a railroad in the year 2013? Of course

is such a dialogue of the deaf. There is no one on the Conservative
Benches, so I could speak all night and it would not make any
difference. There are no brains there, there is nothing there. I think
that I had better conclude by saying that the development of our
alternative thinking on this has been given a big boost tonight. It has
given us absolute clarity of the target area where we need to create
machinery at board level, workers’ representatives on
remuneration committees and throughout the enterprise.</hs_para>

strongly take the point made by my noble friend Lord Monks that we
cannot be the victims of deliberate gerrymandering of constituencies in
the company, whereby company X says, “This is the
decision-maker”, when we know that the structure of the
capitalist company—obviously I am teaching everybody to suck 
<?notus-xml column=222?>eggs, but please tell me where I am wrong—means that it is at the
level of the enterprise as a whole where strategic decisions are taken.
It is at that level that we need machinery, as well as, side-by-side
with that, a substructure. You do not need to be Einstein to
understand, and we are certainly not advocating, that there should be
machinery only at the top level with nothing underneath or machinery at
local level with nothing on top. There has to be a strategic change in
the British economy so that we can look at the real problems why our
world export market share is diminishing. As my noble friend Lady
Turner pointed out, if you are talking at least about 100 employees,
you are not talking generally about SMEs, where I think the cut-off
point is 250 in the BIS rules. We are talking about companies here that
all need permanent machinery. As has already been stated, that is
supposed to be consultation with a view to reaching agreement. That is
a joke. We know that that is the way that the world is working at the

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been an interesting
debate and I thank noble Lords for their contributions. I will start on
a point of definition. The noble Lord, Lord Monks, raised the issue of
whether “an undertaking” should be exchanged for
“establishment”. The test of establishment is used in the
European directive, which this legislation stems from. The test of
undertaking is not used. Also, the case law dealing with the definition
of establishment is still being developed and it would be very
difficult and risky to try to define the term in

that the changes in this order are needed to ensure that the
legislation remains fit for purpose in today’s commercial
environment. I want to start by echoing the words of the noble Lord,
Lord Young of Norwood Green, and the noble Baroness, Lady Dean. I, too,
acknowledge that job loss is a very serious matter and that every
individual who loses their job deserves our sympathy. However, we need
to balance the important right of the individual to be consulted with
the need for employers to implement change efficiently and quickly to
meet market pressures. We need also to address the needs of those
employees who do not, in the end, lose their job but have had to live
with the possibility that they will. Ultimately, the right of the
employee to be consulted is not intended to prevent the employer from
making necessary changes. For businesses to remain competitive in the
global economy they must be able to respond swiftly to commercial
pressures. The 90-day minimum period has been in place for some 40
years and it is right that we now make some
changes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031272000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#13031272000143">A
number of specific points have been raised and I will attempt
to answer as many as I can. The noble Lord, Lord Young of Norwood
Green, asked, “What about the workers?”. He said that
they need a fair deal. I certainly agree with the latter point.
Collective redundancy consultation affects a wide pool of employees,
many of whom may remain secure in their jobs at the end of the process.
The government consultation on the collective redundancy rules showed
that concerns about those employees who ended up being made 
<?notus-xml column=223?>redundant could crowd out the interests of the remaining workforce. The
changes to the collective redundancy rules are therefore focused on
providing better flexibility so that where consultation can be
concluded within 45 days employees gain certainty sooner. I
would like to remind the noble Lord, Lord Monks, that, as I mentioned
earlier, research shows that the vast majority of decisions between the
employee and the employer have been made at between 30 and 45 days. We
are not proposing 30 days; we are actually proposing 45 days, which is
at the other end of that
scale<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T20:43:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

on improving the quality of consultation so that during consultation
both the employer and employee representatives will be free to

about losing skilled staff due to uncertainty a shorter minimum period
is likely to mean that it will be easier for employees to wait and see
if they are personally affected and if so, how. The Government do not
believe that the changes will affect how long those made redundant are
out of work, or that employers will make different decisions about how
many employees to make redundant. Employers do not take lightly the
decision to make employees redundant. It has an impact on the morale
and productivity of the workforce and means a loss of skills

question that received only 43 responses out of a total of 160 to the
consultation overall. That a significant number of those 43 thought
that guidance would need to be statutory is not, in our view, a
conclusive outcome. The EU directive which the legislation implements
leaves a number of provisions open to interpretation. These include the
definition of an “establishment” in deciding whether the
number of proposed redundancies meets thresholds for consultation,

buy-in to the decision-making process. The Secondary Legislation
Scrutiny Committee also queries whether culture change to deliver
quality consultation on collective redundancies can be effected without
a statutory code of practice. The Government do not believe that the

consultations, which is an important point I made about the
consultation process. Consultations are delayed because parties are not
sure what procedure they should follow—instead of discussing the
issues at hand they are sidetracked by ambiguous distractions, which
reduces the quality of consultation and therefore the quality of the
ultimate decision itself. The new guidance is intended to help

noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden, was concerned that these changes
would make it easier to dismiss employees. The proposed changes to the
minimum period will not alter the requirement to consult or the
emphasis on mitigating job losses. In addition, it is important to keep
in mind that the 45 days will be a minimum period before any dismissals
can take effect. This means that the process of consultation with staff
may not take less time than it does currently, just that once
consultation is concluded, employers do not face barriers, in terms of
minimum time periods above 45 days, in going forward with
their restructuring plans. The Government recognise concerns that less
responsible employers may treat the time period as a maximum instead of
a minimum. Neither the amount of compensation in a protective award nor
the limitation period for bringing a claim in any employment tribunal
for a protective award are being changed. The limitation period runs
for up to three months after the last dismissal takes effect and can be
longer if a tribunal decides that this is appropriate in the
circumstances. The ACAS guidance will stress that consultation should
continue beyond 45 days whenever necessary and would also highlight the
importance of employers having good onward relations with
employees’ representatives, such that no proposals should come
as a surprise. I am sure that many noble Lords opposite would agree

when only 160 people or organisations think it fit to respond to a

businesses. In terms of the time, I repeat myself by saying that we

like to conclude by saying that between 50% and 80% of employees

clear, this is not going to help industrial partnership or improve

noble friend Lady Dean raised a couple of important points about the
fact that the conditions, certainly for senior management, are often
vastly different from those for the workforce as a whole. They have a
significantly longer period to find alternative employment. As she
rightly pointed out, this is taking rights away from workers, and
although we heard a lot of talk from the Minister about
employers and consultation, he did not really address the point about
the bad employers who do not engage in any meaningful
consultation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031272000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#13031272000159">My

<?notus-xml column=226?>wish that were the case. I think that he
acknowledged in his reply that it would not necessarily be as easy as
that. My noble friend Lord Watson pointed out that while they may move
to alternative employment, it is often for significantly less pay and
inferior conditions. It is not a particularly good climate at the

the workers. It means that their pay for those 45 weeks will be
significantly reduced. His point about the importance of the machinery
of consultation, which is much more evident in other countries in
Europe, is an exceedingly valid one. The Minister talked about the
importance of companies acting quickly. I would say to him that it is
not about them acting quickly; it is about them having a strategic plan
for their business that ensures that it survives. As we have seen so
often in recent large-scale redundancies in the high street, they have
not actually had a survival plan; HMV is the example that springs to
mind. It is not the workers’ fault in these situations; it is
not that they have not been prepared to contribute to the company in

Minister says that those made redundant will be a minority, and that
crowds out the interests of the remaining workforce. Those who remain
in employment are one thing; our sympathies are more with those who
will have to look for alternative employment. We do not think it is a
question of people being kept in suspense; it is a question of being
able to have meaningful consultation and explore the alternatives that
my noble friend Lord Monks referred to, whether it is retraining,
redeployment or restructuring of the company. When it comes to
certainty, there is one thing you gain in these situations: the
certainty that significant numbers are going to be made redundant, and
the only uncertainty is whether you will be able to get significant
alternative employment.</hs_para>

read them all out. The daily rates run between £4,080 a
day—for the Hinkley Point reactor, where there are a
lot of applicants—to £1,230 a day for projects where
there are single applicants. Where there are three inspectors, the rate
is £2,680 a day. That runs for five days a week. It does not
include the weekends or public holidays but they can amount to very
substantial sums. The lists that I have run between £33,000 and
£34,000 for the application. It is important to get it right but
it must also be fair. I do not think the new draft regulation is fair

Adonis:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord,
Lord Jenkin, has made a very powerful argument of principle.
He has also pointed out that the sums of money involved are
considerable, and it should of course be the Government’s job,
if we are promoting growth and development, to see that the costs to
businesses are kept at the lowest level possible. That is clearly not
being done at the moment. The noble Lord quoted a daily rate, which of
course is high for professional people such as these. The National
Infrastructure Planning Association estimates that on its conservative
assumption of single inspectors examining applications four days out of
five, panels of three inspectors examining on nine days out of 10 and
panels of five examining on 19 days out of 20, the total overcharging
has been of the order of £470,000. The sums of money that we are
talking about are
considerable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T21:11:22"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T21:11:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303133000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303133000002">However,
the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, kindly wrote to me on this issue,
because we had a long debate about it in Committee. She made an
argument which I think is worthy of consideration but that leaves me
wanting to ask her a question. Her argument is that the principle at
stake should not be the number of days worked but a reasonable recovery
of costs. In her letter to me, she
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1303133000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303133000068">“We

suspended; and, thirdly, the Secretary of State may decide not to

not if somebody goes off sick who is important to the hearing. If there

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friend for that careful explanation. I should say that when I was
quoting the figures for the totals, they were of course the overcharge
on certain assumptions about how many days the inspectors had worked
and the number on which they did not. It still amounts to a very large
sum. I think the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said that it came to more
than £460,000 in the calculation that we have been shown. I
totally support the noble Lord’s view that it is necessary to
have a realistic way of charging that recovers the costs of each
application. That seems right to me. I, too, will look forward to
getting the letter that my noble friend is going to send to the noble
Lord, Lord Adonis. We may not have to return to this on Third Reading,
but we will no doubt want to debate the order when it is finally laid

today we still refer to those who work on the roads with the slang

then, is the problem? As we are all aware, water is heavy stuff, so
developments close to, alongside or over the canals carry risks.
Embankments slip, bridge foundations move and tunnels crack. To date,
the waterways’ position has been protected by the British
Waterways Board’s status as a statutory body. This gave it
access to the special parliamentary procedure of the Planning Act 1947.
In the last resort, if an arrangement could not be reached with the

the new Canal &amp; River Trust is no longer a statutory body, so it is
now more vulnerable to attacks on its network. Strangely, while the

statutory boards and public open spaces, they have continued to provide
a special position for the National Trust as laid out in

waterways national trust. Indeed, the Waterways Infrastructure Trust

points. Compared with the National Trust, a higher proportion of the
Canal &amp; River Trust assets are in urban areas. The waterways, after
all, were built to link our industrial centres. They are linear. Both
these factors combine to make them particularly vulnerable to
development. Secondly, curiously the National Trust already owns one
canal, the Wey and Godalming Navigations. This particular canal will
continue to have special protection. Why should the rest of the network
not be similarly protected? Thirdly, if my noble friend’s Bill
team is encouraging her to resist this amendment on the grounds of
creating a precedent, she should not worry. Google away as much as you

provide sufficient opportunities to make representations in cases
involving the compulsory acquisition of statutory undertaker land.
These opportunities will continue to be available to the Canal

to compulsory purchase under provisions in the Planning Act. Most
importantly, the trust will still benefit from the provisions in
Section 127 of the 2008 Act. This provides that where land was acquired
by statutory undertakers—which, of course, British Waterways
was—for the purposes of their undertaking and is used or held
for those purposes, then it may be acquired only if the Secretary of
State is satisfied that there will not be serious detriment to the
carrying on of the undertaking, or that the land can be purchased and
replaced with other land without any such detriment. This is a
significant test. Alongside the need for a compelling case in the
public interest for compulsory acquisition, it will be a key
factor for the Secretary of State when reaching a decision on whether
to authorise compulsory acquisition of statutory undertaker
land.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303133000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303133000030">I know

the point that the changes we are proposing will require strong tests

Where it is decided that special parliamentary procedure should not
apply because suitable replacement land is not available, or is

is demonstrated to be strongly in the public interest for the

to limit the definition of business and commercial projects in order to

48A, which is grouped with these amendments. This re-examines the
situation where there are commercial and business projects with
housing. I am grateful to the Minister for her letter yesterday. There
is this tension between projects which include housing and which are
therefore excluded and those that do not include housing. In her letter
the Minister does not say what consultees felt about the moving of
housing from the scope of Clause 24, only that there was comment on
whether the exclusion of housing from the regime, although widely
supported, would limit the number of mixed-use

amendment would be a useful way of dealing with projects that are
nationally significant commercial or business projects being considered

counter the Government’s line that planning for housing should
remain a core responsibility of local authorities, as set out in the
NPPF. They do have a role, but it would be useful to hear the
Minister’s comments as to when there is a small housing element

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank both noble Lords for
tabling these amendments, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, said,
we discussed and considered quite carefully in Committee. The
amendments seek to limit on the face of the Bill the types of
development and development sites which can and cannot be considered
nationally significant under Clause 24. As noble Lords are aware, the
purpose of Clause 24 is to extend the existing powers within the
Planning Act to direct 
<?notus-xml column=241?>certain forms of proposed development into the
Planning Act regime to new forms of business and commercial development
if it is of national
significance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T21:49:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303133000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303133000051">Amendments
48ZB and 48ZD would rule out proposed schemes from using the regime if
they were on sites of special environmental or historic importance or
if they involved minerals extraction or quarrying. They would also
apply to existing types of infrastructure, such as energy, transport
and water, as well as new forms of business and commercial schemes.
When we debated the amendments in Committee, I explained that one
effect would be that a potential scheme of national significance, which
might otherwise be considered via the Planning Act route, could not be
the subject of a direction if part of the site had an environmental
designation or was of historic
importance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T21:50:03"></hs_TimeCode>. We
are fortunate to live in a country that enjoys the benefits of
beautiful countryside, about which we heard so much earlier, and a rich
and varied historic environment. Although it is unclear what site of
environmental or historic importance the noble Lord has in mind, it is
worth while reflecting that the National Planning Policy Framework sets
out a clear planning framework for development, which might have an
impact on areas with a special
designation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T21:50:31"></hs_TimeCode>. If
a scheme is of national significance and is directed into the regime,
the Secretary of State will have to consider all the issues which are
both important and relevant, including any impact on the historic or
natural environment, before he reaches his
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T21:50:54"></hs_TimeCode>. We do
not believe that it is sensible to exclude from the scheme large parts
of the country without proper consideration of the planning merits.
That could also discourage developers from bringing forward new
infrastructure or other forms of development vital to the
country.</hs_para>

noble Lord has also sought to exclude surface mineral extraction or
quarrying. Perhaps I may explain our thinking on minerals a little
more, as I think that he thought that I was a bit wobbly last time. As
we explained and recognised in the National Policy Planning Framework,
minerals are essential to support sustainable economic growth and our
quality of life. For example, without minerals, our building industry
would grind to a halt. It is important that there is a sufficient
supply of material to provide the infrastructure, buildings, energy and
goods that we need. That is why we sought views on whether some mineral
schemes could be capable of using the nationally significant
infrastructure regime.</hs_para>

again what I said in Committee. We are considering consultation
responses and we need to take them into account before we reach a final
view on whether mineral schemes should form part of the proposals at
all. I remind noble Lords that the accompanying regulations, which are
required to prescribe the types of development, will be subject to the
affirmative procedure, so we will have an opportunity to discuss them
in detail
later.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303133000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303133000054">The
noble Lord has also spoken again to the amendment which would require
the Secretary of State to give reasons when making a direction. We
covered that briefly in Committee. Although I do not disagree with the
noble Lord on the point of substance, the amendment is unnecessary. The
Secretary of State is already required to give reasons for his decision
when 
<?notus-xml column=242?>making a direction under Section 35(10), and that
requirement is carried forward in Clause 24 in new Section 35ZA(10).
That is why we do not think the amendment is
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303133000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303133000055">Amendment
48AA would then require the Secretary of State to make decisions on
development consent orders for business and commercial developments
where there is no national policy statement in place to be made in
accordance with the relevant local plan. As we set out in our recent
consultation document on the new business and commercial category of
development, the Government do not think the case for one or more
national policy statements is strong for that category of development.
Again, we have been considering the responses to consultation.
Only about a third of the responses that we received said they thought
a national policy statement should be prepared.</hs_para>

unlike nationally significant forms of infrastructure, which are
brought automatically into the regime, the clause does not make it
mandatory that developers use the major infrastructure regime. They may
make a request to the Secretary of State to use the Planning Act regime
or they may continue to submit their planning application to the local
council. It is entirely a matter for them under the
circumstances.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1303133000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303133000057">The noble Lords, Lord
Jenkin and Lord Berkeley, once again raised the very important issue of
housing and how it should be considered through this planning regime.
Perhaps I may say again what importance the Government lay on housing
development and also why we think it should remain part of local
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T21:54:49"></hs_TimeCode>.
We recognise that there are many large, mixed-use schemes that will
include an element of housing. Some may have a large amount, as the
noble Lord said; some may have very few houses. However, there is also
a very pressing need for housing and that is why the Government set out
in the National Planning Policy Framework how they expect local
planning authorities to help boost the supply of housing in the local
area. Each local planning authority therefore should have a clear
understanding of the housing needs in its area. It should understand
the scale and mix of housing it is likely to need over the local plan
period and should plan for the different types of housing it will need,
such as for older people and families, and affordable housing. The
Government therefore see the delivery of housing by local councils as
their core responsibility. We have not ignored the views that have been
expressed in this House and elsewhere on whether housing should form
part of the infrastructure planning regime. We did not consult
specifically on whether housing should be a prescribed form of business
and commercial development. It was raised by some respondents, with the
majority of them supporting the Government’s position, while a
few
disagreed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303133000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303133000058">We
recognise that, from time to time, major schemes will come forward that
may indicate the need for a decision at the national level. Where there
are major residential schemes, such as new settlements with larger than
local impacts, the Secretary of State has indicated that we would
carefully consider the use of call-in. We believe that is the right
approach. We have looked further at the issue of housing but it has not
changed our view that we should retain our current position as set out
in the Bill. We do not therefore propose to 
<?notus-xml column=243?>allow development that includes housing to use the
infrastructure regime. I hope that clarifies what I think is a sensible
approach that will enable new forms of nationally significant
development to benefit from the planning regime without it necessarily
being mandatory. With those explanations, I hope that the noble Lord
will be willing to withdraw the

Adonis:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Baroness
for that explanation of the Government’s thinking. I feel bound
to make two points. I am not going to press the matter at this late
hour. I want to contrast the extremely rigid position she has adopted
in respect of developments that include any element of
housing—where the Government have given an absolutely categoric
view that looks to me to be unduly rigid—with the extreme lack
of precision which the noble Baroness has offered the House when it
comes to a whole range of other projects such as open-cast mining and
quarrying. These may or may not be subject to the nationally
significant planning routes depending on decisions that the Government
will take care of afterwards. It exemplifies the problem we have in
this House of making the law. We are very much dependent on
the assurances the Government give us as to what they may or may not
do, which we are unable to hold them to.</hs_para>

leads to me to her response on open-cast mining and quarrying where she
said that this will be subject to regulations that will come forward
under the affirmative procedure. The great problem in this House is
that we have to take statutory instruments or leave them. We do not
have the capacity to amend the regulations so the whole set of very
important criteria for qualification for the nationally significant
planning routes, which will be made hereafter, will be presented to the
House on a take it or leave it basis. If we were making the law in a
proper and satisfactory way then, after a proper process of
consultation with the results firmly laid before the House, it would be
in the Committee and the Report stages of the consideration of this
Bill that we took the decision as to what was going to be in the
definition of business and commercial projects within the Planning Act
2008 regime.</hs_para>

am grateful to my noble friend’s department, which suggested
that I group these two amendments together, which I was very glad to
do. Their common thread is of course that they have both been suggested
to me by the City of London. The first, Amendment 48ZE, revisits a
matter which I raised in Committee in relation to development in
Greater London and concerns the relationship of the thresholds as to
what would be regarded as nationally significant and what, for the
purposes of Greater London, are to be regarded as regionally
significant. It really is quite absurd that those two numbers should,
in a sense, be almost the wrong way round, with a higher figure for
London and a lower figure for the national significance. This applies
in relation to the whole of Greater London but is of considerable
practical significance to the City of London, because the higher
threshold, which is provided by the Town And Country Planning (Mayor of
London) Order 2008, for the mayor to intervene in the City is much
higher than is required for the rest of London—40,000 square
feet of floor space for London generally, but 100,000 square feet in
the case of the City. I think that everybody can understand why that
should be different and why the City should have a much higher figure,
as it is an almost exclusively commercial area with a very small
residential development. I went into some detail on that in Committee.
I think it will be fairly evident to everyone that the sheer volume of
the commercial development in London is quite exceptional and will
continue to be so in coming

amendment that I am putting forward reflects the idea that, whereas in
Greater London as a whole thresholds are already laid down to identify
those cases where commercial development might require a wider look

development. I suggest that it would make little sense—this is

my noble friend answered the debate in Committee he made the point that
the threshold is only intended as a minimum. I understand that: not
every development above the threshold would necessarily be accepted as
being nationally significant. The same of course is also true of the
threshold laid down for the Mayor of London’s power of
intervention—it is only a minimum level, above which the mayor
may or may not decide that the application has potentially significant
importance. In both cases, the purpose of 
<?notus-xml column=245?>setting a threshold appears to be the same: to make clear to the
developers and local planning authorities alike that applications for
planning permission will be dealt with in the ordinary way by the local
planning authority in all but a few exceptional cases. To invoke
parallel procedures in respect of tasks that are within the local
planning authority’s normal sphere of experience and expertise
would risk introducing unhelpful uncertainty into the system. That is
the basis on which this amendment is being moved.</hs_para>

really makes the case. That is exactly the principle that my amendment
would seek to establish. I therefore suggest that it would be a simple
and convenient way of ensuring consistency between the two regimes. Of
course, I am quite ready to listen to what my noble friend on the Front
Bench has to say. However, the important point is that it should be
quite clear that the new regime should not interfere with the ordinary
routine activities of local planning authorities, even in unusual areas
such as the City. I hope that my noble friend will be able to see the
sense of this, and if he cannot accept this amendment, perhaps he could
bring back his own amendment at a later

other amendment is on quite a different subject that was also raised
with me by the City. This is amendment 50A. It is intended to remove
what is undoubtedly an uncertainty within the City of London about the
setting up of business improvement districts. This depends upon the
regulations, and the regulations need some clarification. Business
improvement districts are usually described by the acronym BIDs and
would normally be set up by companies, industrial companies, or the
Government introduced a provision whereby they could be set up by local
authorities. The detailed procedures for setting them up are contained
in regulations made under the Local Government Act
2003.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303135000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303135000007">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T22:07:05"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lords may recollect that I introduced an earlier Bill for the
setting up of BIDs and took it all the way through this House, but it
never made any progress at the other end of the corridor. However, I
have a sort of paternal interest in BIDs. It is where bodies come
together with a view to supplementing local services by having a
ballot. If the ballot has a majority on getting business rate payers to
pay a supplement on top, it serves to be able to finance those extra
services. They have proved popular and they are widely used now all
over the country. There has to be a majority of at least half of the
total rateable value of the premises within the area. If that is met,
then a BID can come into being and all businesses are obliged to make a
contribution to the cost of the additional
facilities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303135000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303135000008">The
BIDs model is now an established mechanism for business engagement.
However, the company is not the only way; as I said earlier, they can
be introduced by a local authority. This is where the difficulty arises

<?notus-xml column=246?>in relation to the City of London. It is maybe a more convenient model.
The obvious case where a BID might be operated is in the City because
the City of London Corporation already operates under a largely
business franchise. The great problem arises over whether its
regulations actually recognise this. One could have a sort of
philosophical discussion as to whether an authority could give a
direction to itself, which would be implied by the regulation if it is
not amended in the way that I am suggesting. If there is a company set
up for the purpose then it can ask the local authority to do certain
things. However, if the local authority itself is going to do it, then
the regulations ought to provide that that is possible, in a sense by
giving directions to
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303135000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303135000009">Given
that the bid involves a payment of a levy by businesses as a result of
a majority vote, and there will always be some businesses that may have
voted against it, it is important to see that the procedure cannot be
challenged in the courts. I understand that the City of London
Corporation has already brought this difficulty to the
attention of the department, and that the department acknowledged the
difficulty. However, the Bill seems to provide an opportunity for
clarification, which perhaps the Minister will be able to offer in his
reply. Perhaps he could also indicate if there could be an amendment of
the regulations fairly
soon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303135000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303135000010">The City

plays a key role in promoting growth and, as my noble friend has said,

thresholds set out in the consultation document were not intended by
themselves to signify whether a project was, or was not, of national
significance. The thresholds were intended to be a gateway to the
Secretary of State’s direction process. On any request for a
direction, the Secretary of State would have to consider the details
and circumstances of the particular project. With this in mind, and in
light of the existing requirement in the legislation for the Mayor of

friend’s amendment on business improvement districts, it may
help if I briefly say a few words about how business improvement
districts operate. A business improvement district is a defined
geographical area within which the businesses agree to pay a levy that
is used to enhance the local trading environment. More than 100 such
schemes have been introduced in England in the past decade and the
Government consider business improvement districts to be an important
tool in the current economic climate for promoting the localism agenda
and local growth. The importance of business improvement districts was
recognised in both the Portas review itself and the Government’s
response to
it.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1303135000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303135000084">10.15

improvement districts are usually promoted by a business improvement
district company set up to act on behalf of local businesses and local
public bodies as considered appropriate by the proposer. I understand
that the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that a local authority
can act alone to propose a business improvement district. However,
there is no doubt that the secondary legislation, which gives effect to
business improvement district arrangements, allows local authorities to
promote business improvement 
<?notus-xml column=248?>districts. Regulation 3(1)(b) of the Business Improvement Districts
(England) Regulations 2004 clearly states that the relevant billing
authority may draw up business improvement district proposals. Nor is
there a requirement in the legislation for an authority to set up a
separate business improvement district company. Therefore, we are not
yet persuaded that any changes to the regulations are
needed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303135000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303135000020">However,
since the business improvement district arrangements are contained in
regulations made in secondary legislation, it would not be necessary to
introduce new primary legislation to make changes to those regulations.

be more than happy to meet my noble friend to discuss his concerns in

gives the Mayor of London specific powers in relation to planning in
the capital, including the ability to call in applications for his own
decision if they are of potential strategic importance for this city.
In Committee, my noble friend Lord Tope made the case that the mayor
should have the ability to delegate these decisions where he is unable
to take them personally. This amendment responds to that suggestion. We
agree that it is sensible for the mayor to have some ability to
delegate these decisions. There may be times, for example, when he is
out of the country or, very occasionally, a conflict of interest with
his other mayoral responsibilities could arise. In these circumstances
the ability to delegate will allow a quicker decision and minimise any
delay to investment from the planning process. Equally, we recognise
that these are important decisions for London, and so this amendment
limits the office holders to whom the delegation may apply to those
post-holders who are appointed by, and are directly accountable to, the
mayor himself. In practice, this will allow decisions on whether to
call in applications of potential strategic importance, or whether to
grant permission for such schemes, to be made by the appropriate deputy
mayor, should the Mayor of London be unable to make the decision
himself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303135000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303135000023">This

pleased to say that the Government have now considered this matter
further and we agree that there is a good case for making changes to
the Planning Act 2008 to remove any ambiguity. This amendment will
remove any doubt about whether modern methods of road-user charging,
such as those using camera and number plate recognition, can be
included as part of any development consent order. It achieves this,
quite simply, by disapplying the provisions of Section 144(2) of the
Planning Act 2008 in respect of such schemes.

based—2013—and has not been subjected to the rigour of
moderation and validation. Moreover, the categorisation “en
bloc” of the “other” category of hereditaments as
properties that would see a tax rise we consider to be flawed. This
undermines the very basis of the claim that 800,000 ratepayers may face

accept that, on the basis of the information available to the VOA, it

no excuse for making sweeping categorisations and drawing broad
conclusions therefrom. The Government espouse the benefits of

have had much greater credibility had it been supported by a prior,

insufficient data to support the policy. It is a curious policy anyway

Valuation Office Agency maintained that no more detailed breakdown of

it concludes that there are 817,000, which has been rounded down in
popular parlance to 800,000, business hereditaments out of a total of
1.7 million nationally that are said to benefit from the deferral of
the revaluation. We also learnt that 64.6% of that 817,000, or 528,000,
are classified in a very broad and non-subdivided category of
“other”: that is, “other” 
<?notus-xml column=252?>than the bulk classes of retail, office and
industrial. The 528,000 represents 31% of the 1.7 million hereditaments

gainers and losers in the far smaller bulk classes, the assertion that
the whole 528,000 in that “other” class of non-bulk
properties constitute gainers stretches credibility. In truth, and from
what I know of the market, it is most unlikely to be correct. Moreover,
if it is true that the Valuation Office Agency has no other more
detailed breakdown of “other”, it is difficult to see how
it could have reached a conclusion on the 817,000 beneficiaries. It is
an untested, apparently untestable and unverified basis of valuation

is worth, is that around 600,000 to 700,000 businesses will be losers
under this proposal, but I can no more prove that than the Valuation
Office Agency is able to convince me of the veracity of the
figures, except that I have used the same figures that it has used. I
think this House should be furnished—indeed, I believe
Parliament is entitled to be better furnished—with information
that is accurate in order to enable it to make an informed decision. We
are told that that additional information cannot be provided without
spending some £40 million on a revaluation, as I think the noble
Baroness said during the previous stage of the Bill. That is not my
understanding of the typical cost of an impact assessment on tax
changes of a type that I used to get involved with when I was in the
public sector. I do not think that consultation of the sort that the
noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has suggested could come anywhere near that
sort of figure.</hs_para>

reached an impasse with this situation. I have to accept, to a degree,
that the noble Baroness has to accept the advice that she is given and
that I have no way of finding a way around that. I do not have
access to the number-crunching facilities or the data that would enable
me to get behind those figures. However, the bottom line is not really
whether I or the Opposition, or indeed the Minister, are convinced but
whether businesses out there and the people in private practice who
have to deal with this matter are convinced. My clear impression is
that they are not and that they will see this as a classic exercise in

of a gloss one puts on this—and I made my views clear when we
had our meeting with the Minister and VOA officials—I do not
believe that it will have the slightest effect on what effect real
market forces will have. Movements in markets will occur, because of
the immutability of this fixed and historically high cost basis for the
non-domestic rate, in many of our most threatened or economically
challenged areas. I mentioned at a previous stage the Portas pilot
towns. Mary Portas herself has come out and made comments about the
effect of the rates. Those comments were not, perhaps, specifically in
the context that we are talking about, but it is a burden that you
cannot negotiate away as a business rate payer.</hs_para>

thinks that we are the awkward squad, but we were trying to express our
concern that the Government are pushing ahead with a policy on unfirm
ground. What came through from the VOA officials was that the work that
they had done to try to forecast valuations was pretty high level and
they were not able to say what the precise impact would be. That was
particularly the case with the “other” sector. They were
unable to say precisely what might happen to the wide-ranging and
different activities that are classified as “other”, so
they chose—imprecisely, I thought—to push them all into
being potential losers if revaluation takes place.</hs_para>

categories is the category of pubs. I do not know what the situation is
in areas where other noble Lords live, but if you took a drive in the
area that I live in, you would see many pubs that have closed down or

drinking habits, pubs are not doing as well as they were. Clearly, if
pubs were to be revalued at the moment, then surely they would actually
gain from a revaluation, not lose.</hs_para>

that I took away from the meeting was that the Government were really
concerned with the concept of volatility and the belief that, if we do
not change business rates valuation, as they should change in 2015,
then people will continue to pay the same amount that they were paying
and this will avoid volatility. However, if they do postpone the
valuation, then in a sense we need to think that the volatility is
bought at a particular cost. That cost, in a sense, is with the
businesses which are least successful and which would have benefited
from a revaluation; they are now subsidising those businesses which
have been more successful. In other words, the retail sector of Wigan,
which has not done very well, will be subsidising West End theatres. I
do not think we can regard that as particularly
fair.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303135000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-0003.htm#1303135000045">I think
that, as the noble Earl indicated and as I said in Committee, we need
to recognise that the market does not simply stay still. If the
Government want to change the cost of occupying premises, it is not
simply to do with business rates; the rental value is reflected as
well. Where business rates remain high, the pressure to reduce the
rental value will be extreme. If we do come round to reinstating the
revaluation in 2015, my view is that the volatility that the Government
are so concerned about will be greater then because

<?notus-xml column=254?>the pressures on the retail sector and other sectors
will have had two more years to run, and therefore the changes will be
even greater than they would have been if we had introduced the
revaluation this year. Therefore, we will be buying stability for now
but we will actually have greater volatility in the future.</hs_para>

change what has been a 20-odd-year process that all parties agreed was
the way business valuations should be changed. It is a bit of a
hobbyhorse of mine but, once we stop doing a routine revaluation, then
we need a courageous Government to bring it back. Council tax
valuations are still based on those set in 1991 because no Government
have had the courage to revalue. We keep putting it off. It is not just
this Government; the last Government kept putting it off. We are now in
a nonsensical situation. I do not want us to be in that situation with
business rates because clearly there is a great logic related to the
rental values from business premises. We must not do that, so if we do
delay it for two years, we should not delay it any
more.</hs_para>

the Committee stage of the Bill, my noble friend Lady Hanham committed
to, and we indeed arranged, a meeting with the noble Lord and the

and respond directly. That took place yesterday. I attended the
meeting. I suppose I 
<?notus-xml column=255?>should be d’Artagnan of the Three Musketeers,
but I am breaking ranks here because I am certainly from the
other side. Never mind, one for all and all for one and we are
certainly for business—and at the meeting certainly the
VOA’s explanation of its work was one that I found
helpful.</hs_para>

we have said before, we understand that ratepayers would like to know
what the postponement of the revaluation means for individual rates
bills. But that is just not possible without spending, as has been
indicated by my noble friend, in excess of £43 million on the
revaluation itself. What we do know is that the VOA’s report is
the only analysis we have seen that has been published in full and
looks across all sectors and regions. We have seen studies from some
firms which look only at specific prime retail locations and we have
seen others which have merely sought to redraft the VOA’s
analysis. None of those studies from private sector agents attempts to
capture the full picture of the revaluation as has been done by the
VOA. As such, the VOA’s report remains the only credible
analysis of the impacts of a 2015

will address a couple of the points that have been raised by noble
Lords. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, referred to the 800,000 premises
that would have seen a real term increase in their rates compared to
the 300,000 seeing a reduction. Some sectors, as has been acknowledged,
would have paid big hikes including petrol stations at an increase of
28%; the self-catering industry such as caravan parks at 29%; hotels at
6%; theatres at 25%; and pubs at

question was raised about the challenge of including the 530,000 in the
800,000. These 530,000 properties were in the “other”
category. The VOA acknowledges, as it does throughout its report, that
at this stage in the revaluation cycle it has very limited evidence on
those properties. But the VOA, as it said in the meeting yesterday, has
looked at some of the larger groups of property within this extra
“other” category. Within that category we find petrol
stations with an increase of 28% tax paid; hotels with an increase of
6% tax paid, and pubs with an increase of 11% tax paid. So the VOA
remains comfortable with its professional judgment to support the
figure of 800,000

course we recognise the importance of speaking to ratepayers about the
rating system. Both the Government and the Valuation Office have
regular fora to discuss business rates and indeed in recent weeks the
Department for Communities and Local Government has held several
meetings with those affected by the postponement of the 2015
revaluation. But, as I have said before, our priority is to give
businesses extra certainty now, before the revaluation process starts
to raise doubts about future rates bills. As the revaluation is a
statutory exercise we need to take primary legislation to stop it. That
is why we have moved forward to include these measures in the Growth
and Infrastructure Bill. By placing the date of the next evaluation on
the face of the Bill, as well as the requirement for five-yearly
revaluations thereafter, we have also shown our commitment to keeping
rateable values up to date. As the noble Lord, 
<?notus-xml column=256?>Lord Smith, said, we have shown courage to ensure
that businesses are clear and Governments are clear in setting these
revaluations. We will of course continue to speak to representatives of

process that has been undertaken to deal with this deferral. I am not
sure that it is a shared frustration, but we have a shared
understanding of how that 530,000 “other” block was dealt
with. We are each convinced that the way with which it was dealt does
not justify the conclusion that was reached on the 800,000 and the
300,000. However, we recognise that we are not going to get any more of

certainty and how important it is to its logical conclusion, we would
never change. We would never have a revaluation. The purpose of regular

burden should be shared fairly between businesses on an updated,
regular revaluation. That was the whole propose of it. My noble
friend Lord Smith made a very telling point, which he has
made previously, that the volatility that the Government are seeking to
buy off by this deferral is in a sense being paid for by businesses
that have done less well in recent times and that might have expected

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the Representation of the
People Act 1983 lists a number of exclusions from election expenses,
which this order seeks to amend. The order adds a further exclusion
whereby payments made to disabled candidates from the Access to Elected
Office for Disabled People Fund are also exempted. This means that
recipients of the new fund will not be penalised for accepting grants
that are intended to increase their electoral participation. Fund
payments will not therefore be considered for the purposes of
candidates’ spending
limits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000004">There
are more than 11 million people with a limiting long-term illness,
impairment or disability in Great Britain, and they are substantially

address this, the Access to Elected Office Strategy was launched in
July last year to provide disabled people with training, paid
parliamentary internships and grants through the Access to Elected
Office for Disabled People Fund. The fund was established because one
of the principal reasons disabled people are underrepresented in
elected bodies is the fact that they face additional costs when
standing for elected office—for instance extra transport costs
or the hire of sign language interpreters. These additional costs
create an extra barrier to elected office for disabled
people—one that other, non-disabled, candidates do not face. The
fund therefore seeks to help disabled candidates to overcome these
financial hurdles by covering the cost of their disability-related
items or services, whatever they may
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000006">The fund
provides grants to all disabled candidates, whether they are
independent or represent political parties, provided that they are
standing at UK parliamentary, English local authority, Greater London
Authority, English mayoral or police and crime commissioner elections
or by-elections. By offering 
<?notus-xml column=52?>specific disability-related financial assistance, the fund will place
disabled candidates on an equal footing with the other
candidates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000007">Unfortunately,
under current electoral rules, grant payments awarded by the fund will
count towards candidates’ election spending limits. This is not
an issue for parliamentary, Greater London Authority or police and
crime commissioner elections, where disability-related costs are likely
to be treated as personal expenses and are therefore exempt under
Section 76(5) of the Representation of the People Act 1983—a
provision that I am sure Members of the Committee know off by
heart—but for local authority and English mayoral elections, the
rules place disabled candidates who are awarded funding from the
Government in the extraordinary position of being penalised for
accepting it. Of course, in local authority elections, the overall
limit for spending is much lower and there is therefore potentially a
much higher barrier. This is because any fund spending will reduce the
amount that disabled candidates can spend on the usual election
expenses, while unfunded candidates will have the entire election
expenses limit at their disposal.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031256000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000008">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:33:53"></hs_TimeCode>
situation is further affected by the fact that there are a number of
high-cost needs for which many disabled candidates will seek funding,
such as British sign language interpreters who can cost as much as
£350 a day. In some circumstances, the fund could entirely
consume a disabled candidate’s election expenses limit, which is
on average just £1,000 for local authority elections. This order
therefore seeks to remove these unintended effects of the fund by
excluding grants provided by the Access to Elected Office for Disabled
People Fund from candidate spending limits. Using an existing
order-making power contained within Schedule 4A to the Representation
of the People Act 1983 to amend the Act itself, a new tightly drawn
exception to the definition of election expenses is thus being created.
This exception will provide that any item or service financed by the
fund would not amount to an election expense, and would not therefore
count towards a candidate’s spending
limit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000009">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:34:57"></hs_TimeCode>
three-part test must be met in order for the exemption the order
provides to apply. First, a candidate must have incurred spending
specifically in order to remove or mitigate barriers to seeking elected
office—barriers which must be associated with his or her
disability. Secondly, that spending must also have been incurred
through the means of a grant awarded under the fund’s terms and
conditions. Lastly, the spending must then be defrayed or reimbursed by
the fund. The fund is intended to cover all the additional costs that
disabled candidates face as a result of their disability. That can
therefore include extra costs that arise from campaigning activity. For
example, campaigning leaflets would not normally be considered for
funding, but where a blind candidate might require Braille leaflets for
proof reading purposes, the extra cost of producing those leaflets in
Braille will be met by the
fund<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:35:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000010">The
order is also drafted with a sunset clause so that it exactly aligns
with the short and temporary operating period of the fund. The fund has
been set up as a pilot exercise only until June 2014, so its
effectiveness can be assessed before the Government take a view on 
<?notus-xml column=53?>whether to introduce it on a permanent basis. If the resolution is
passed, the Representation of the People (Election Expenses Exclusion)
Order will be made to ensure that it comes into force by 26 March, the
start of the regulated period for the next local authority elections. I
hope noble Lords agree that the fund provides essential support to
disabled people seeking to participate in elections and democratic
processes, and that this order helps very considerably to enable that.

Low of Dalston:</Member></B> My Lords, as we have heard, the additional
costs faced by disabled people in contesting elections: for example,
the cost of sign language interpreters, can make running for elected
office prohibitively expensive for them. Therefore, the
Government’s decision to implement the recommendations of the
Speaker’s Conference on parliamentary representation through the
setting up of the access to elected office fund is very welcome and
much to be commended. This will go a long way to removing the financial
barriers and ensuring that aspiring disabled candidates who have higher
costs are not penalised, and should improve access to elected office
for disabled people. Avoiding spending limits deterring disabled people
applying for support from the fund would, as we have heard, require a
change in the law to establish an exemption as to how the
candidate’s expenses related to disability are treated.
Therefore, I support the draft order which seeks to amend current
election limit rules which pose problems for the operation of the

is important that we pass this order before the start of the regulated
period for the forthcoming local elections in May this year. Given the
breadth of the extra costs which could be faced by prospective disabled
candidates, the fund does not provide an exhaustive list of expenses

common expenses that are likely to occur and would be eligible for

Electoral Commission has, however, voiced concerns that the exemption
which the order creates to the current limits on candidates’
spending is not sufficiently clearly defined. Following further
discussion with the Government and the fund, it proposes the following
actions to make the risks associated with this order manageable for the
2013 local elections. First, it proposes that the fund should ensure
that all candidates accessing funding are referred to the Electoral
Commission for individual advice on how their funding will be treated
under the spending rules; and secondly, it proposes that the fund and
the Government should set out a clear policy to clarify the operation
and scope of the fund to reduce the uncertainty around interpretation
of the order.</hs_para>

lot of work on the accessibility of elections for disabled people,
believes that the exemption needs to be broad enough to allow for any
potential expense that occurs because of an individual’s
disability. It takes the view that the proposed drafting, which states
that in order to benefit from an exemption, the expenditure must be
designed to remove or mitigate 
<?notus-xml column=54?>barriers to seeking elected office, be sufficiently mindful of this and
achieve the desired purpose. In view of the high level of scrutiny that
takes place around election expenses, the proposed exemption would need
to be applied carefully and transparently to militate against the
prospect of a subsequent legal challenge; for example, if another
candidate made an allegation of overspending. Such allegations would be
extremely detrimental to the future of the fund and would risk
undermining the progress being made in improving access to elected
office for disabled people. Accordingly, Scope has recognised that
mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure transparency about how the
exemption is operated in order to maintain trust that the fund is not
being misused for political gain. It therefore supports the Electoral
Commission’s suggestion of providing advice to disabled people
to disclose expenses paid for by the fund on a voluntary basis on their
spending return.</hs_para>

which have been suggested by the Electoral Commission, I think that the
risks can be sufficiently managed for the local elections that are to
take place in a couple of months’ time. Work will continue after
those elections to make sure that the exemption is working

explained. With those safeguards, I support the order and urge the

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, together with some noble Lords present
in Grand Committee today, I was present at the launch of this fund last
year. Those of us who were there celebrating the work of the coalition
Government, the Speaker’s Conference and, especially, my noble
friend Lynne Featherstone MP, who led the work up to the launch of the
fund, were horrified to discover that there might be a loophole whereby
other candidates might be able to challenge any grant made by this fund
as part of election expenses. That was certainly never intended, not
least because the representation of disabled people is very low in
elected office, whether at Westminster, on councils, in devolved
Administrations or any other elected office—although I was glad
to hear my noble friend saying that it did not apply for individual
elections, such as those for police commissioners and, I presume,
elected
mayors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000017">I

are. We cannot legislate at this stage for every dot and comma of what
is necessary. The point has already been made about Braille leaflets
for checking before an ordinary leaflet is printed; about the need for
British Sign Language interpreters; about having a palantypist at a
conference where someone who may or may not be reliant on BSL but may
be reliant on lip reading cannot keep turning around to see
contributions from the back of a conference room. One young candidate
whom I talked to a couple of weeks ago said that he had had to get a
very expensive modification to his wheelchair. The first time when he
stood for Parliament, he was invisible

height and have conversations with people. Suddenly, he has become
visible. I am not suggesting that he would have made an application to
the fund, but the fund needs to be able to think as flexibly as
possible to overcome the barriers, and in this young man’s case
a very physical barrier to having a dialogue with his
electorate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:45:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13031256000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000018">The
other reason for the fund is that because candidates are not employed
there is no other recourse to public funds for any costs associated

this order—there is a problem for Members of the House of Lords

end by saying that the Liberal Democrats have taken the issue of the
under-representation of disabled candidates very seriously. We have
launched a leadership programme for candidates from a range of
under-represented groups, with 10% of places on the scheme reserved for
those with disabilities. In the first 40 recruited, five
have disabilities, some visible and some invisible. We hope that by the
time we get to the other side of the general election, we will have
some more disabled MPs in place to represent the wider country. In
particular, I am looking forward to the first BSL first language MP,
or, frankly, even Peer, to be able to work alongside us in creating
legislation. It is a real disappointment that there has not been one to

have two questions for the Minister. Given the Electoral
Commission’s concerns about challenge and that some grants have
already been awarded, will the order be retrospective? Secondly, Scope
has raised an issue about the expenses repayment; the 35-day deadline
may be very tight in some circumstances, particularly in relation to
the short campaign of a general election, where deadlines are actually
very important, and they may suddenly find that they have it. Is there

I hope that on the sunset clause of June 2014 the Government will
ensure that there is no gap if they decide to move ahead. At that

from the noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, we
hope that they are very successful in selecting their candidates. Noble
Lords will not be surprised, however, if I do not necessarily wish them
success in being elected. But it is a challenge to my party to make
sure that we can similarly find some candidates. It will also come as
no surprise to the Committee that we broadly and warmly welcome this
draft order which, as the Minister says, will enable disabled
candidates to apply for and use the fund specifically created to
encourage them to be candidates by excluding those moneys from the
schedule of election expenses. It is clearly a shame that it
was  
<?notus-xml column=56?>not thought of when the fund was established, but we are pleased, as the
noble Lord, Lord Low, said, that it will be done by 26 March, in time

Minister will have read the discussions of the House of Commons
committee on this. Perhaps it is a bit late to regret, along with it,
that the fund does not cover parish council elections. Indeed, for many
people, that is their first attempt at the ballot box, and it might
have encouraged more disabled people to make that same first attempt.
However, this is a pilot, and we hope that if it is successful it will
be rolled out in a comprehensive
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000024">My
questions, therefore, are not about what might have been but about this
specific order, which allows the fund expenditure to be excluded. Will
the Minister confirm that anything that the fund agrees to finance will
then automatically be covered by the exclusion? In other words, there
will be no additional formality to be gone through? We do not want the
fund saying that it is covered and then being told afterwards that it
is not. There needs to be just one lot of decision-takers, and I assume
that it will be the fund decision-takers. It would be useful to have
that
confirmed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:51:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000025">What
is being done to promote awareness of the fund? In preparation for
today, I did the usual thing and tried to find out about it. I found it
impossible to locate the fund through the Electoral Commission’s
less-than-helpful website. Google was rather more helpful and got me on
to the relevant site. Given that the Electoral Commission wants to be
involved in this, I would have thought that it would do more to make
knowledge of the fund better known, rather than simply being able to
find out about this specific order, which is not of interest to
disabled people once it is
done.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:51:46"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000026">Information
on the fund itself was not brilliant. I could not get hold of the
application form from the website although it has now been sent to me.
It also was not clear how quickly a decision would be made, which I
should have thought was also quite important for candidates to decide
whether to go ahead. They need to know that before they start spending
too much of their own money. Although we are keen for the Electoral
Commission to be involved in encouraging and helping disabled people to
be candidates, we hope that it will smarten up its own access via the
web in time to do
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:52:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000027">We
very much support the exclusion of fund expenditure but rather like the
noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, we wonder whether this leaves a
transparency gap. It would be useful to know what disclosure of such
funds and their use will be made. Mention was made of a voluntary
system, and I wonder whether that is sufficient or whether the fund
should itself be transparent. It would be useful to know the
Government’s thinking on that. Finally, can the Government
assure us that if this pilot proves a success, it will be rolled out
fully and with money following intent? As we know, the groups who will
benefit from this are highly underrepresented at the moment. Indeed, I
cannot  
<?notus-xml column=57?>believe that this Government would have so undermined the lives of so
many disabled people as they have done both under the Welfare Reform
Act and now the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Bill had we had more people
as MPs, or indeed Peers, but especially MPs, from those particularly
affected groups. We very much want this fund to be a success and we
hope that its administrators, the Electoral Commission and the
Government will play a very full part in helping disabled people to
find out about the fund and then stand for and be elected to public
office. I am sorry, but I hope that they will all be Labour if they get

Baroness has suggested, that all parties will want to take this up and

the disability world, the communications strategy is already a good
deal better known than in the general outside world. I had not heard of
it until a few weeks ago but I am told that the Government have a
comprehensive communications strategy in place. There have been a

question of what happens in August 2014, this is a pilot over which we
will want to consult as we go along, as well as seeing how many people
come forward. Once the SI ends, we will ensure that there is a smooth
transition to the new regime, if by then a decision is made that the
fund is seen as worthwhile and is to be extended. So far there have
been about 30 applications for the fund, and the average per
application is between £4,000 and £6,000. We are not
talking about enormous amounts. Noble Lords will recall that there is a
£20,000 maximum per application under the fund at the moment.
However, we hope that this will be shown to make a crucial difference
in making it easier for people with different disabilities to put
themselves forward for

parish councils do not have elections. At my party’s spring

me how deeply unpopular he has made himself with a number of other

be elections for the parish council. Others think that elections are an
unnecessary expense and that co-option is much to be preferred, this
being a predominantly Conservative parish council. Perhaps one of the
questions that we will investigate and discuss further, and come to a
different decision on as we move forwards from the pilot, is whether we

amend the fund’s guidance to encourage successful applicants

the Electoral Commission on all this. Every effort is being made to
take decisions as quickly as we can. We want to make sure, as far as

My Lords, the purpose of this order is, first, to
finalise the transfer of the consumer education and advice function,
including Consumer Direct, from the Office of Fair Trading to the
citizens advice service, and to transfer the relevant industry levy
arrangements; and, secondly, to ensure that consumer enforcement is
allocated appropriately between trading standards and the OFT by
amending consumer
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000039">The
Government are committed to promoting growth in the UK economy and
empowering and protecting consumers is a vital element of our approach.
The current landscape of bodies responsible for these tasks is
confusing, duplicative and therefore inefficient, leaving consumers
uncertain as to whom to turn for help and advice when things go wrong.
We recognise that there are many good things about the individual
organisations but, taken together, they form a complex landscape that
can be difficult for consumers to understand. For example, when someone
has bought a faulty second-hand car they do not know whether to seek
advice from the Office of Fair Trading, Consumer Focus, Citizens Advice
or trading standards.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031256000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000040">This
complexity and the lack of clarity about divisions of responsibilities
have led to gaps in enforcement. The National Audit Office’s
2011 report, <I>Protecting Consumers</I> <I>– the

</I><I>C</I><I>onsumer </I><I>L</I><I>aw</I><I>,</I> found that
consumer detriment occurs at national and regional level, but the
incentives for enforcement officers are weighted towards tackling
issues within their local authority boundaries. Similarly, the
University of East Anglia’s 2002 report, which sought to
benchmark the UK’s consumer empowerment regime, identified
uneven enforcement as a key weakness.</hs_para>

cost to those consumers affected and the wider economy of rogue
practices, such as intellectual property crime which occurs across
local authority boundaries, to be at least £6.6 billion
annually. Any gap in enforcement has, therefore, significant impact on
members of the public and the wider economy. In response to the
Government’s 2011 consultation <I>Empowering and Protecting
Consumers</I>, there was widespread agreement that the current
landscape of information and advice bodies is confusing and should be
simplified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000042">This
order will, first, confirm the premier position of the Citizens Advice
services as the publicly funded bodies in England, Scotland and Wales
providing information and advice to consumers. Citizens Advice will
draw from consumer intelligence gathered by local bureaux and the
telephone advice line to support the enforcement community as it
prioritises its efforts to maximise outcomes for
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000043">At
a national level, enforcement responsibility is currently split between
trading standards and the Office of Fair Trading. Historically, the
Government have provided support for national and cross-boundary
schemes. These included projects to combat illegal money lending,
enforcement against internet scams and a fighting fund for large and
expensive cases which local trading standards might not otherwise have
been able to take on. In light of the strong support for these
proposals in the consultation, a decision was taken to create
immediately the National Trading Standards Board, giving the trading
standards profession greater responsibility for the funding and
co-ordination of large national and cross-local authority cases. Our
vision is for the majority of consumer law enforcement to be undertaken
by Trading Standards with the support of the NTSB and the consumer
enforcement bodies in Scotland.</hs_para>

order makes changes to the enforcement provisions of the OFT and
Trading Standards, clarifying the responsibility of Trading Standards
to tackle cross-boundary threats and cases of national significance.
Let me be clear: this is not about adding to the powers of the
enforcement agencies, but about clarifying their relative roles within
the landscape so they can take up cases that more appropriately fall to
them. Except in relation to unfair terms, Trading Standards will retain
a duty to enforce consumer legislation while the OFT will have powers.
This means that Trading Standards will take the lead, but the OFT will
be able to step in to enforce, where appropriate. In relation to unfair
contract terms, the OFT and, in the future, the CMA will retain primary
expertise so they can take enforcement action in cases where there are
structural market failures; for example, where there is evidence of
market-wide problems on tie-in
contracts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000045">Let
me now turn to compliance with the Public Bodies Act. Section 8(1) of
the Public Bodies Act provides that Ministers may make an order only
where they consider that it serves the purpose of improving the
exercise of public functions. Such orders must have regard to
efficiency, effectiveness, economy and securing appropriate
accountability to Ministers. I would like to address these points in
some detail. The order is 
<?notus-xml column=61?>focused on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer
landscape. As I explained earlier, a variety of publicly funded bodies
are involved in consumer advice and representation. The proposed
changes will create a simplified and easily accessible and nationally
consistent advice service for
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000046">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:10:13"></hs_TimeCode>
transfer of Consumer Direct from the OFT to the Citizens Advice
services in April 2012 consolidated its position as the principle
source of government-funded consumer advice. Citizens Advice has
implemented a more efficient delivery model, increasing capacity to
provide advice within existing budgets. The industry-paid levy to fund
those consumer contacts in relation to the regulated gas, electricity
and postal services industries will continue and will pass to Citizens
Advice through this order. Empowering Trading Standards to take on more
cases of national significance will ensure that national activity is
linked to local intelligence. For example, there may be several reports
of a rogue online trader from consumers across the country. The NTSB
will be able to link these complaints and build a strong case for
enforcement, which will have a national impact. This clarification of
functions and improved co-ordination of enforcement will ensure better
use of limited resources through more effective leadership and
integration of effort at a national level.
National<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:11:23"></hs_TimeCode> funding
for enforcement activities will facilitate a more integrated approach
to national and cross local authority boundary threats. This activity
will be more effectively co-ordinated at national level by chief
Trading Standards officers. This will ensure that enforcement gaps do
not arise and that activity overall is targeted to achieve better
outcomes for
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000047">I
turn to accountability. The work of Citizens Advice and the National
Trading Standards Board will be accountable to the Consumer Minister
through grant arrangements set up by the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills. These grant arrangements will set out
challenging performance targets, which will be closely monitored by the
department. The bodies will be collectively accountable through the
Consumer Protection Partnership, which will also report to the Minister
for Consumer Affairs on a six-monthly basis to ensure there are no gaps
or duplication in enforcement within the reformed
landscape<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:12:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000048">These
reforms focus on increased efficiency and effectiveness, rather than
economic benefits. For this reason, the department took the decision
not to provide detailed analysis around the economy test in the
explanatory document. These changes are not predicated on economic
savings, but on a need to deliver increased efficiency and improved
service levels in the most economic
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000049">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:13:00"></hs_TimeCode>
your Lordships will know, members of the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny
Committee asked for a fuller articulation of the economy considerations
set out in the explanatory document which supports this order. The
Consumer Minister wrote with additional details. When making its report
on the order, the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee noted that
the Minister’s letter did not expunge the omission in the
explanatory document and decided to exercise the enhanced affirmative
process for consideration of the order as set out in the Public Bodies
Act. The Consumer 
<?notus-xml column=62?>Minister and I took full and due regard of the committee’s
decision, noting in particular that it saw no reason to dissent from
the view that the draft order meets the Act’s requirement to
improve the exercise of public functions. The Government also conclude
that the order meets the requirements of the Act and consider that it
should be
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:13:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000050">For
the benefit of the committee, I should like briefly to set out those
economic benefits in the remaining few minutes. The enforcement
proposals were estimated to have a cost of £3.2 million. The
value of the benefits proved impossible to quantify, but included
improved leadership and co-ordination of Trading Standards enforcement
through the creation of the NTSB. There will also be better
co-ordination of enforcement between Trading Standards and OFT/CMA,
managed by the Consumer Protection Partnership. The transfer of
consumer information, advice and education functions to Citizens Advice
was assessed as delivering benefits of £6.3 million. This
proposal will strengthen frontline consumer protection by forging a
stronger link between the activities of Citizens Advice and provision
of information, advice and education. Citizens Advice is highly
regarded and respected by all, and its brand is much better known to
consumers than Consumer Direct. As a result, Citizens Advice expects
the volume of calls to increase over time compared to Consumer
Direct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:14:51"></hs_TimeCode>. This
proposal will also reduce the complexity of the consumer landscape and
create opportunities for substantial synergies in data and IT
infrastructure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:14:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000051">Let
me remind the Committee of the key benefits of this order. First, it
will finalise the transfer of the consumer education and advice
functions to the Citizens Advice service, making the trusted brand of
Citizens Advice the first port of call for consumers with a problem to
solve. Secondly, it will enable a more appropriate allocation of
consumer enforcement cases, enabling Trading Standards to take on more
cases of national significance and ensuring that national activity is
linked to local intelligence. I commend the order to the

Borrie:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his very clear
explanation of what is in front of us. I did not find it quite as
straightforward as the suggestion that complexity is avoided because
quite a number of complexities will remain. There will be not only the
Trading Standards offices of local authorities but a National Trading
Standards Board as well; the Office of Fair Trading will retain some
powers; Citizens Advice will have—I agree with the Minister on
this—a helpful addition to its services which is, as he rightly
said, well appreciated; and there will be the Consumer Protection
Partnership, which I do not fully understand yet. So there are lot of
different people involved and a lot of different lines to be drawn as

the noble Viscount about one or two particular matters. My text, as it
were, for this part of what I want to say is, first, the Explanatory

on the order, the sixth paragraph—the paragraphs are not
numbered—refers to Article 9. It is concerned with enforcers,
who will no longer have to consult with the OFT; they will, instead,
merely be required to notify the OFT. That, presumably, is in
accordance with the Government’s wish to take away the
responsibilities of the OFT in overall consumer protection. The
Government are not arguing that they are not doing this and the OFT is
losing its supervisory
role<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:18:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

means—perhaps it is a matter of semantics—a number of
Trading Standards officers representing some local authorities. How
they are to be chosen and so on, I do not know but, anyway, the NTSB is

asked at some stage of the Bill, but did not get an answer, whether
that included not only Trading Standards officers—chosen I do

accountable to councillors. So I am not sure about
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000058">Paragraph

far as I can see, something has gone wrong with the semantics there as

whoever you are consulting. If you do away with consulting and have
simply notification, there is no longer any need to take any notice of
what you are advised. Is that what is intended? If it is, then, of

the OFT will simply have a power rather than a duty to enforce those
regulations. That means, again, a considerable reduction in the
OFT’s role. I am not sure whether the Government intended that
because I thought they wanted the OFT to have a particular

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for setting out
this order in some detail. It is, of course, as he said, part of a
wider strategy towards the transformation of the consumer landscape.
Attached to the explanatory document is a paper which set out nearly
two years ago the way in which the Government approached that matter.
One or two things have changed in the interim, and there are one or two
things with which I agree and one or two things with which I disagree.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:22:53"></hs_TimeCode>However, this is
only part of a bigger
jigsaw<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:22:54"></hs_TimeCode>. As the
Minister said, the order deals with the transfer of Consumer Direct to
Citizens Advice and the OFT enforcement functions to the Trading

authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:23:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000063">In
principle, I strongly support the first of these. We of course referred
to it in the process of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill, so
there is some overlap in the discussions we have already had here and
in the Chamber. Some of it—although I suspect the Minister is
not allowed to say so—may come post 8 May in a new consumer
Bill, which I know his department is considering either for the next
Session or the Session after. So we cannot expect everything to be
resolved by this
order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:23:47"></hs_TimeCode>.
Nevertheless, there are some issues which I think should have been, but
are not yet,

the last encounter between myself and the noble Viscount, I should
thank him for at least trying to follow the procedure under the Public
Bodies Bill on this order, as distinct from the Agricultural Wages
Bill. The order and the explanatory document answer a lot of questions.
However, as he has recognised, the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny
Committee has not been entirely impressed by the way he or his
colleagues have dealt with the issue of economy and have therefore
recommended the enhanced affirmative
procedure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:24:37"></hs_TimeCode>. I
shall come back to this aspect because it largely relates to the
transfer of enforcement powers and I want to deal with the transfer of
the consumer advice powers

I say, I welcome the transfer to Citizens Advice, particularly given
the general direction of the Government’s intent on the consumer
landscape. Even without that, I would have regarded it as sensible to
transfer Consumer Direct to Citizens Advice. However, I have a few
questions. First, Article 2(3) states boldly that the OFT role’s
in this respect is abolished, except to a limited degree in Northern
Ireland, which I shall come back to. Does that mean that in this area
the OFT has no oversight role? There is no quality assessment of how
well Citizens Advice performs, and it will continue to be partly a
directly publicly funded function and partly a function based on
mandatory levies on various industries. I assume those levies are
simply the levies that are currently raised for Consumer Direct
purposes rather than the wider levies that go via Consumer
Focus.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031256000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000066">It
seems somewhat odd that the oversight role in this area is abolished
completely. My noble friend Lord Borrie was complaining that the
oversight role in relation to enforcement is greatly diminished, but at
least there is a role there. In this area, it seems that there is no
potential intervention by a statutory body. This is important because
Citizens Advice, for all its great wealth of experience and expertise
and the great 
<?notus-xml column=65?>respect in which it is held in the consumer movement and more widely, is
a non-statutory body, and we are giving what was previously an
administrative body supported by legislative powers responsibility for
activity that was previously run by a statutory body. That presents a
number of problems. In real life, they are probably resolvable, but it
is odd to resolve them by abolishing the body that has ultimate,
fail-safe oversight and by abolishing the new body’s
responsibilities in that respect so that the CMA will have no
responsibility in the area of consumer advice, as I read the effects of
this order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000067">It
is also interesting that the order does not mention consumer education,
which is also being transferred to Citizens Advice. The OFT conducts
quite a significant amount of activity on consumer education, and that
does not seem to be explicitly covered here. Can the Minister assure me

of a residual oversight role is important, but it also leaves Citizens
Advice somewhat exposed. Articles 7 and 8 of the order and paragraph
4.6 of the explanatory document refer to Citizens Advice and Citizens
Advice Scotland now being subject to the Freedom of Information Act. I
can see why that has happened, but it makes Citizens Advice somewhat
vulnerable. If it is subject to the Freedom of Information Act, there
is the question of other powers in this area that were the
responsibility of Consumer Focus under the Consumers, Estate Agents and
Redress Act 2006, in particular Section 24 of that Act, based on
previous powers that existed for Energywatch, which provided that
Consumer Focus had pretty strong statutory powers to demand information
from any company providing any good or service. Previously that power
applied only to energy companies and to the Royal Mail, but it was
generalised in that Act. Those powers were very effective, and were
rarely explicitly used because the threat of doing so usually got you
the information that you
wanted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:29:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

should have declared my past chairmanship of Consumer Focus, I
therefore know about these things—although I have no current
interest in that area. It is important that if advice is to be a
primary responsibility of Citizens Advice with no back-up, it should
also have access to those Section 24 powers. I presume that in general
terms, such powers will be included in the next order—which Jo
Swinson’s letter implies is going to be laid beyond the Summer
Recess—dealing with the general transfer of Consumer
Focus’s advocacy functions to Citizens Advice. However, that
will not come into effect until well into 2014; whereas, in effect, the
advice service has already started and will be given legal basis by the
passage of this order. Citizens Advice will therefore have no ability
to use or threaten to use those powers in that interim period. I would
therefore like confirmation that it will ultimately get the Section 24
powers, and I should like to know what it can do in the interim period.
The powers have been a powerful lever that we in Consumer Focus used to
find very
useful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:31:11"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
more difficult to give those powers to a 
<?notus-xml column=66?>third-sector charity than to a statutory body. Nevertheless, in the
course of proceedings on the Public Bodies Bill, we were assured that
similar powers could be directed to third-sector bodies in this and
other
fields<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:31:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

situation leaves Citizens Advice a little vulnerable, not only to the
Freedom of Information Act as regards how it carries out its powers and
deals with its new statutory responsibilities, but potentially to
judicial review. That would, in many respects, be unfortunate for
Citizens Advice, yet that would seem to be a logical conclusion from
the transfer of statutory powers. It would be useful to know whether
Citizens Advice, in the exercise of these powers, if not more widely,
could be subject to judicial
review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:32:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

point in this area that relates to energy consumer advice. When
Energywatch was wrapped into Consumer Focus, the individual advice
service was split in two. Part of it went into Consumer Direct, which
is dealt with in this order and will go to Citizens Advice with the
rest of Consumer Direct services. However, complex and urgent problems
were dealt with by a special unit of Consumer Focus, the Extra Help
Unit, based in the offices of Consumer Focus Scotland. The unit dealt
with complex issues, for example, when it was difficult to get a
response from an energy company, and issues where there was an imminent
threat of cut-off of gas or electricity. The unit often dealt with very
vulnerable consumers. It is not clear where the unit is going to go.
Will it be transferred to Citizens Advice or, because of its location,
Citizens Advice Scotland? Or will it simply be subsumed in the powers?
If there is a transfer, will that involve simply the powers, or is
there a staff and resources transfer issue that would be covered by
TUPE? An answer would be

10% of the issues that the Extra Help Unit dealt with were those of
micro-businesses that were being threatened with their gas or
electricity being cut off. You can imagine that that would be pretty
urgent and potentially lethal for your business. I understand that
Citizens Advice will not be dealing with businesses. If that is true,
where does the responsibility for micro-businesses go to under the new

are complicated questions on which I would welcome clarification either
today or in writing. However, I am in favour of the general terms of
the transfer and in favour of the OFT retaining some supervisory
function within that
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:34:31"></hs_TimeCode>. As to
enforcement, the OFT retains some thin responsibility but most of the
powers are to be devolved to the Trading Standards departments of local
authorities. The explanatory document sets out the four main areas of
regulation to which my noble friend Lord Borrie referred. It is not
entirely clear as each has different terminology in relation to each of
the current regulations where the role, previously with the OFT and now
transferred to the CMA, will necessarily now lie. The CMA will retain
the ability to be an enforcer in these and other areas. In other words,
the noble Viscount referred to the fact that nobody knew whether to go
to the OFT, trading standards or the various other bodies. That
responsibility will still be split in relation to these and wider
regulations. What is the relationship between the individual
trading  
<?notus-xml column=67?>standards, which will have the lead responsibility now, and what will be
the CMA’s residual power as an enforcer? Is the distinction in
relation to size, geographical spread, across local authority
boundaries, or does it depend on the kind of

appreciate that some of this is not yet sorted out, and some of it may
be sorted out by discussions on the National Trading Standards Board,
the trading standards partnership or, in Scotland, the consumer
protection net. However, these are all somewhat shadowy bodies with no
statutory existence. Yet, they will have considerable responsibility
deciding where priorities lie and what the allocation of resources will
be, but they will not be responsible to Parliament in any way, except
for the reporting functions to which my noble friend Lord Borrie
referred, and they do not appear to be responsible to the CMA.
Non-statutory bodies seem to be carrying out what were previously
statutory
responsibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:37:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000075">The
National Trading Standards Board is a co-ordinating body for
encouraging leadership, and it may decide priorities, but does it have
a quality control oversight of trading standards within individual
local authorities? In proceedings on the Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform Bill, I opposed the deletion from the role of the CMA what had
been the OFT’s general responsibility for consumer protection.
Those powers will disappear entirely in the new set up unless yet
another order is to come which will compensate for the removal of those
general powers, or will that all now rest with Trading Standards and
the co-ordinating bodies we are about to set
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:38:08"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000076">I
declare an interest as an honorary vice-president of the Trading
Standards Institute; I have great respect for Trading Standards.
However, if they are to take on and improve the effectiveness of
enforcement, as described by the Minister, in all of those areas that
were previously at national level, and improve their activity and
effectiveness at local level, they need to have the resources to carry
that out. In recent years, under both Administrations, trading
standards have been squeezed. They are a discretionary activity of
local authorities to a large extent and they are certainly not
ring-fenced in budgetary terms. Yet the need for consumers to have
protection and for business to know what its responsibilities are has
not diminished. The information that I have received—I mentioned
this in the ERR Bill proceedings—is that because of the squeeze
on Trading Standards resources, England, Scotland and Wales have lost
about 13% of their funding in the past two years, but it started before
that. They have also lost some 15% of staffing and as a result they are
forced to focus on perhaps the larger and higher risk issues. It means
that in total there has been a 20% fall in programmed scheduled visits
and a 24% fall in total visits across England and Wales. The net result
of this has been a 29% fall in prosecutions. That is not because the
problem is disappearing and resources are being better deployed. It is
because the total amount of resources has diminished. Now that Trading
Standards are to get additional responsibilities handed down from
previous OFT responsibilities there is not much indication of how many
additional resources, relative to OFT spend, are going to go to trading
standards. Some of them will be funnelled via the TSI into
the  
<?notus-xml column=68?>new co-ordinating set-up but that does not amount to the total
additional resources that are going to be needed within Trading
Standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000077">Perhaps
this goes back to the criticism, to which the Delegated Legislation
Committee drew attention, over the inadequacy of the explanatory
document about the economics of this. There may be an improvement in
effectiveness. To some extent that will happen but this part of the
order is rated in the letter to which the Minister referred, from his
colleague Jo Swinson, as having a net present value of £3.2
million. There is also a rather amorphous reference to improved
leadership and so forth. I accept that some of this may occur but at
best it is difficult to see how that will amount to a net present value
of £3.2 million to the economy as a whole. Even if it gets near
that, the benefit in net present value terms is somewhat
thin.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000078">There
are uncertainties and lack of clarity about the role of the CMA as it
will be in relation to Trading Standards. Some of the OFT functions,
such as on scams and voluntary codes of practice, are not quantified or
directed in this legislative instrument, and this itself will require
resources. Most consumer organisations and the OFT wanted to give more
resources. Given this resourcing uncertainty, I query whether the
effectiveness and economic value of the transfer of these functions
down the line to Trading Standards and the shadowy bodies to which I
refer is going to deliver a better

still have serious doubts about that part of the order. I hope that the
Minister may be in correspondence when we consider this in the Chamber
and will be able to reassure me. I have no principled opposition to
this. I just think that the total picture does not add up, and does not
help consumers and businesses enough to be clear about where
responsibility lies. It is not clear about how enforcement will be
targeted and be more effective than the previous set-up. With those
comments, I would be interested the Minister’s

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their
valuable, if somewhat caveated, comments during this debate. I will do
my best to answer the lengthy questions that were raised by the noble
Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord Whitty. There is some crossover in the
questions. Generally, most of them focused on further clarification of
the responsibilities and roles of the different bodies. I will do my
best to answer the questions today rather than having to
write.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000081">This
order focuses on the better delivery of consumer advice and education
and will lead to enhanced levels of protection through better
enforcement. As I said earlier, it is not about cuts. It is about
working more efficiently and effectively for the taxpayer. The order
will finalise the transfer of the consumer education and advice
functions to Citizens Advice, making that trusted brand the first port
of call for consumers with a problem to solve. The noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, expressed concerns about the Freedom of Information Act being
applied to Citizens Advice. That extension will be limited to
provisions relating to the function that is transferred under the
order. Citizens Advice has, under the terms of the Public Bodies Act,
given its consent to the inclusion of the FOI Act.</hs_para>

raised concerns about the interim period and whether
information-gathering powers will be transferred. I can reassure him
that it is the ultimate intention to transfer the information-gathering
powers to Citizens Advice. In the interim, Citizens Advice will work
closely with Consumer Focus to ensure that consumer welfare is
preserved.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13031256000124" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000124">4.45

Lord asked if help for vulnerable consumers will be retained. I can
reassure him that we expect the work of the Extra Help Unit to transfer
to Citizens Advice. The exact mechanism of the transfer is being
developed but will feature in the second public bodies order. In
addition, it will enable more appropriate allocation of consumer
enforcement cases between Trading Standards and the OFT, empowering and
supporting Trading Standards to take on more cases of national
significance, ensuring that national activity is linked to local
intelligence. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, raised the issue of the OFT
losing its co-ordinating role, but I can reassure him that the OFT will
retain that role as it will continue to be notified where enforcement
orders are to be obtained under the Enterprise Act. This is in
accordance with EU provisions. In practice, only the OFT receives
notifications of such
enforcement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000084">I
turn to compliance with the Public Bodies Act. Section 8(1) provides
that Ministers may make an order only when they consider that it serves
the purpose of improving the exercise of public functions. I have set
out how the order has regard to efficiency, effectiveness, economy and
securing appropriate accountability to
Ministers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000085">The
noble Lord, Lord Borrie, mentioned that he is unfamiliar with the
Consumer Protection Partnership, and I want to provide some more
information for his reference and interest. We have established the
CPP, which was formerly, as he will know, the Strategic Intelligence,
Prevention and Enforcement Partnership, or SIPEP, for short, involving
the Competition and Markets Authority, the National Trading Standards
Board, the Trading Standards Institute, the Financial Conduct
Authority, the Regulated Industries Unit, Citizens Advice and consumer
bodies from Scotland and Northern Ireland, to share intelligence,
inform the activities of each of the partners and provide
accountability for the national consumer protection system. Since June
2012, the CPP has formed working groups to address how to identify
consumer detriment and mass marketing scams and offer solutions to
potential sources of detriment arising from the Green
Deal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000086">The
noble Lord, Lord Borrie, in talking about the CPP, asked about its
role. I reassure him that it is much more than a talking shop. We
believe that the CPP comprises the right partner organisations, which I
mentioned earlier, and that all partners have an important role to
play. It will ensure that important issues do not fall between any
gaps. Its primary purpose is to identify and prioritise areas where
there is the greatest detriment to consumers. Partners will then agree
and co-ordinate collective action to tackle such detriment, using all
available tools at their disposal.</hs_para>

Borrie, raised the National Trading Standards Board. It supports local
authority trading standards services to work together to enforce
consumer law against national and regional threats to fair trading.
Local authority trading standards services will continue to address
local threats and issues under local political control. The board
deploys national funding from government and will provide leadership on
cross-boundary enforcement through heads of trading standards services
acting together across England and Wales. Trading standards bodies in
Scotland have similar arrangements in place, and they work together to
advise on UK-wide enforcement issues and the co-ordination of business
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000088">The
noble Lord, Lord Borrie, would like clarification of who trading
standards officers are and who would have political oversight of the
local levels. While government has directly funded cross-regional
enforcement programmes, the NTSB’s professionals will be able to
use their expertise to harness intelligence in order to prioritise
resources. This will provide a direct link with local trading standards
services enabling greater impact for consumers and better value for
scarce public funds. The board will consist of one representative from
each of the English regional and Welsh trading standards groups. These
representatives are mandated to take decisions at the board on behalf
of their regional group. The board will be led by an independent chair
and representatives from BIS, Scotland, Northern Ireland and
professional trading standards groups will act in a non-executive
capacity. In addition, there is a political oversight group to ensure
synergy with local political
governance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000089">The

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> I hope I can answer the noble
Lord’s question. Trading standards play a critical role in
protecting consumers and business in their local authority areas, in
particular from rogue traders, but the responsibility was split between
local authority trading standards services and the OFT creating an
enforcement gap. While BIS provided some support for regional and
national enforcement schemes, the NTSB has been formed specifically to
tackle cross-boundary and national
threats.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000092">The
noble Lord, Lord Borrie, asked whether members of the local authority
are members of the NTSB, which goes a little further in answering his
original question. The answer is no. Heads of local authority trading
standards comprise the NTSB. There is a political oversight group made
up of representatives of local government and the LGA which connects
local decision-making with national enforcement.</hs_para>

Borrie, was concerned that the OFT will not oversee enforcement
supervision. In this case, the OFT, Trading Standards and other
enforcers 
<?notus-xml column=71?>will share a power to enforce. This will ensure that while the OFT will
be able to continue to use its expertise in this area, other enforcers,
including Trading Standards, will take up cases that more appropriately
fall to them. Trading Standards will act as the lead enforcers of this
legislation and will retain a duty to enforce the regulations, except
in the case of the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999.
That is complex, but I hope it explains that slightly more
clearly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000094">The
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, asked how Citizens Advice will be accountable
for Consumer Direct and consumer education. The work of the Citizens
Advice service on Consumer Direct will be accountable to the Consumer
Minister through grant arrangements set up by the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills. These grant arrangements will set out
challenging performance targets which will be closely monitored by the
department. I can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, that Citizens
Advice will take on the role of consumer
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000095">The
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, also asked whether Citizens Advice could be
subject to a judicial review. There is a low risk that Citizens Advice
may be subject to a judicial review in relation to the function
transferred. However, it is more likely that other legal claims will be
brought, such as negligence. The Citizens Advice services have taken
their own advice on this risk and have given their consent to the
transfer of the consumer advice functions on that
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000096">The
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, wanted to clarify who SMEs will receive advice
from. Most business-facing advice and education will transfer from the
OFT to the Trading Standards Institute from 1 April 2014, but
businesses seeking advice as consumers will be able to access Consumer
Direct as before.</hs_para>

Whitty, also asked for clarification on whether the NTSB will quality
control Trading Standards. The NTSB itself, and the teams that it
sponsors, are subject to tight funding terms and conditions to ensure
that they deliver against business priorities. Local trading standards
are subject to local government procedures. The noble Lord also raised
concerns about cuts to local trading standards services. The provision
of local trading standards services is a matter for individual local
authorities, and even in the current climate, they will continue to
take local and pan-local
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000098">The
intention is that there will be specific funding for enforcement
against national threats separate from the budget for local issues.
There are plenty of examples of cases where local officers have dealt
with complex cases successfully. The NTSB will ensure that resources
are allocated to large cases as and when appropriate. In addition,
local officers often have a culture of working with business to resolve
problems. I believe that trading standards services have already

will provide a little more detail on the contracting out order. It will
amend the Local Authorities (Contracting Out of Tax Billing, Collection
and Enforcement Functions) Order 1996. Currently under the 1996 order,
local authorities in Wales can contract out functions connected with
the administration and collection of council tax—for example,
the calculation of an individual’s council tax liability or the
serving of demand notices. Local authorities in Wales can also
currently 
<?notus-xml column=73?>contract out the operation of the council tax benefit system under the
Contracting Out (Functions of Local Authorities: Income-Related
Benefits Order) 2002 if they choose to do so—arrangements that
will cease once council tax benefit is
abolished.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031256000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031256000105">While
some of the new administrative functions related to the introduction of
council tax reduction schemes are already covered by the 1996
contracting out order, such as the processing of applications, some are
not. To ensure that local authorities in Wales have the freedom to
contract out all the new administrative functions, this order amends
the 1996 contracting out order for Wales to add the following new
administrative functions: first, the issuing of council tax reduction
decision letters; secondly, the payment of a reduction amount under
certain circumstances where the billing authority is of the opinion
that it would be appropriate; thirdly, the serving of a penalty notice
in connection with an offence committed with a reduction; and,
fourthly, the repayment of amount paid in connection with a penalty
under a local scheme—a penalty that has been subsequently
quashed.</hs_para>

of council tax benefit also means that local authorities in Wales will
no longer be able to rely on their current investigatory and
enforcement powers for social security benefits, Welsh Ministers are
making regulations to provide local authorities with replacement powers
to tackle fraud in relation to council tax reduction schemes. These
regulations will introduce new penalties, the collection of which has
also been included as a function that could be contracted out under the
2013 order. Local authorities that choose to contract out functions
will be expected to monitor the services delivered by their
contractors. We expect the decisions taken by the contractor to be of
the same standard as that of a local authority officer and subject to
the same levels of confidentiality and data protection.</hs_para>

choose how to deliver their local schemes, whether by using internal

Rowlands:</Member></B> I wish to ask two questions. First, how much
contracting out has been carried out since the 1996 order was
introduced? What percentage of local authorities have already
contracted out in this field? The Minister referred to my next point.
One should perhaps be concerned that we are handing over information on
the personal financial matters of individuals and families to a variety
of different organisations which might have potential conflicts of
interest as opposed to a local authority, which will not, because it is
a statutory body. The Minister talked about safeguards and data
protection but if you diversify and decentralise in the manner in which
this order hopes and expects, how will the individual be safe in the
knowledge that his or her finances cannot be abused in any way? At
least when the local authority has this information, it is a statutory
body and therefore is obviously accountable in every sense of the word.
How will that accountability be enforced across a range of other
organisations or companies that will be delivering these
services?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031266000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000002"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Gale" PimsId="3357" UID="13031266000056" xid="1232" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000056">Baroness
Gale:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for placing this
order before us today. As she has outlined, its purpose is to amend the
Local Authorities (Contracting Out of Tax Billing, Collection and
Enforcement Functions) Order 1996. From April 2013, council tax benefit
will be abolished and council tax reduction schemes will be introduced
in Wales under the Local Government Finance Act 2012. In future,
instead of receiving council tax benefit, low-income families will
receive a reduction in their council tax. Currently, local authorities
can contract out of administering the collection of council tax. The
order we are debating is required to ensure that the new administrative
functions are part of the council tax reduction scheme and can also be
contracted out if local councils wish to do so. Those functions include
such things as sending out decision letters and serving penalty
notices. The noble Lord, Lord Wigley, and my noble friend Lord Rowlands
asked some very interesting questions on those issues and I look
forward to the Minister’s reply to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031266000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000003">The
drafting of the order is relatively uncontroversial but it is
unfortunate that we have it at all. It comes about as a result of the
Government’s decision to abolish council tax benefit. They are
scrapping the national benefit and passing responsibility for it to
local authorities in England and to the Welsh and Scottish Governments,
and cutting funding by 10%. We accept that the Welsh Government have
responsibility for the details of any schemes and are fully involved in
setting up these details. The principle of getting rid of council tax
benefit dismays us very much. In England, we see people on low incomes
being asked to pay sums of money that they simply cannot afford. Most
councils have had no option but to pass on some of the cuts. As a
result, many low-income households currently exempt from council tax
will have to pay it for the first time. Typically, they will have to
pay between £96 and £225 a year. In Wales, a 10% cut
would amount to an 
<?notus-xml column=75?>annual cut of some £74 per council tax benefit claimant. I wonder
whether the Government fully understand the impact this will have on
low-income families. Government Ministers have praised the freeze on
council tax, which may, indeed, be welcomed by those on modest and high
incomes. However, the removal of council tax benefit from those on the
lowest incomes means an increase in what they will have to
pay.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031266000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000004">The
Government say that pensioners must be protected from the cuts, which
means that others face larger cuts, depending on the number of
pensioners in a local authority. If councils also try to protect other
vulnerable groups, such as disabled people or carers, the cuts enforced
on working families will be even more severe. Because of the number of
pensioners the average reduction across local authorities will work out
at some 16%. In January the Welsh Minister for Social Justice and Local
Government, Carl Sergeant, announced a £22 million support
package to continue offering the full council tax discounts in Wales
and under prudent financial management the Welsh Government have been
able to fund their proposals out of their
reserves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031266000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000005">It
has been a difficult time for the Welsh Government. They have had to
balance an enormous number of cuts and manage them while facing a
difficult budgetary situation. Towards the end of the winter they were
able to see the effects on households of other welfare benefit cuts.
They knew that they were perhaps not going to have so many payments for
such things as severe winter weather. They were in a position to use
that money for council tax discount. However, that prompts the question
as to whether it can continue to be used in the future. It will
certainly not be easy and councils are aware of the pressures on
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031266000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000006">Given
that the Government are going ahead with the change, the Welsh

soon as possible. We will not oppose these regulations

Randerson:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their
questions and remarks this afternoon. In principle this order does not
change the way that councils deal with council tax. To deal with the
first point of the noble Lord, Lord Wigley, it has always been possible
for councils to contract out billing, collection and enforcement.
Councils have been able to appoint an external provider to undertake
some administrative functions. This order simply enables this to
continue under the new arrangements from 1 April when
council tax benefit will no longer
exist.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031266000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000008">As
always I will try my best to answer the questions that noble Lords have
asked. The noble Lord, Lord Wigley, asked whether this would mean
greater privatisation. This order does not extend the powers that the
local authorities already have to contract out their administrative

apply them to the new council tax reduction schemes that are no longer
part of the social security benefit
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031266000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wigley" PimsId="5918" UID="13031266000058" xid="2128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000058">Lord

move on now to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, who
asked if there is more contracting-out now. I simply point out that
this has always happened—for example, currently only three of
the 22 local authorities in Wales have in-house bailiffs.
Contracting-out on billing and bailiff services is very common. But a
great deal of work has been done by the Welsh Government and by
individual local authorities to have codes of conduct and best practice

I can understand the situation with bailiffs, but my feeling would be
that a bailiff would not receive detailed personal information of the
individual’s financial circumstances in the same way as some of

external provider direct access to people’s personal finances,

do not believe it is an issue of concern in principle that council tax
reductions will be done by councils rather than through the benefits
system. I think it is very sensible to unite the reductions in council
tax for those of limited means with the organisation that levies the
tax in the first place. It is part of the Government’s policies
of decentralisation and trusting local authorities. In this case, the
Welsh Government have made a central scheme, and there are certain
limited exceptions that local authorities can make decisions upon, but
there is a largely standard scheme throughout Wales.</hs_para>

cautioning for adults currently operates under a code of practice
approved by Parliament in 2009. Amendments have been made to Criminal
Justice Act 2003, which requires the code to be updated by this order.
Part 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 as amended allows an authorised
person, usually a police officer, or a relevant prosecutor, usually the
Crown Prosecution Service, to offer a conditional caution to an adult
offender aged 18 or over. Before the conditional caution can be offered
to an offender, he or she must admit to committing the offence and
agree to accept the conditional caution and the conditions attached.
The police or prosecutor must be satisfied that there is sufficient
evidence to prosecute and that it is in the public interest to offer a
conditional caution. If, once the conditional caution has been
administered, the offender fails to comply with the conditions, he or
she may be prosecuted for the original offence. Conditional cautions
cannot be imposed on an offender, and the code of practice makes this
clear. In every case, the offender must agree to accept the conditional
caution and the conditions that are proposed. He or she may, for any
reason, choose to decline the offer of a conditional caution and opt
instead to be prosecuted.</hs_para>

Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 made two amendments to
the conditional caution framework as set out in the Criminal Justice
Act 2003. First, it enabled the police to offer a conditional caution
and to set and vary conditions by removing the requirement for a
prosecutor to authorise such decisions. Secondly, the 2012 Act
introduced two new conditions that can be attached to a conditional
caution and offered to relevant foreign offenders—that is, those
offenders who do not have permission to be in the UK. These new
conditions have the objectives of 
<?notus-xml column=79?>bringing about the departure of foreign offenders from the United
Kingdom and ensuring that they do not return to the UK for a period of
time.</hs_para>

amendments to the code of practice arising from the legislative
changes, we took the opportunity to look at the existing guidance
within the code and made further amendments to clarify and strengthen
it. We have, for example, strengthened what is said on selecting
appropriate conditions and on offering a conditional caution to
offenders with mental health issues and making sure that they
understand the implications of accepting it.</hs_para>

Act 2003 sets out the procedure for revising the code of practice.
First, the Justice Secretary must agree a draft for publication with
the Attorney-General. The Justice Secretary is then required to publish
that draft code of practice and consider any representations
made by respondents. A public consultation took place on the draft code
from 4 October 2012 to 1 November 2012. The consultation was
sent to criminal justice practitioners, such as police and prosecutors,
as well as to stakeholder groups, such as the Magistrates’
Association and the Law Society, and third-sector groups, such as
Mencap. In total, 37 responses were received—on the whole
positive responses which welcomed the guidance—which we
considered, and some further revisions to the draft code were then
made. The revised code has been approved by the Attorney-General and
the Justice Secretary and a copy of it and the Government’s
response to the consultation were placed in the Library of this House
as well as on the Ministry of Justice website. The draft order and the
code of practice were laid before Parliament in January this
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031266000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000028">In
addition to the code of practice, the Director of Public Prosecutions
issues operational guidance on the approach for police and prosecutors
to take when considering whether a conditional caution may be an
appropriate response to an individual offence. The DPP is revising his
guidance following the legislative changes and the changes made to this
code of practice. This order brings into force the code of practice
which will provide the framework in which police and prosecutors make
decisions on whether a conditional caution is an appropriate response
to a criminal offence. It will allow conditional cautions to be used to
provide the opportunity for offenders to make swift reparation to
victims and communities and for offenders to be directed into
rehabilitative services to tackle the causes of their offending
behaviour. Conditional cautions will also allow the removal from the UK
at the earliest opportunity of those foreign offenders with no
permission to be here who have committed a crime. We believe that this
is a useful tool and are working with the UK Border Agency to ensure
that the conditions are implemented and enforced robustly to ensure
that public protection is
maintained.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031266000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000029">If
the order implementing the revised code of practice is approved by

was expressed by the committee that he chairs, shared by those of us
who spoke in the debate, who were either members of the committee or,
as in my case and that of the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, not members of
the committee, that the period for consultation had been arbitrarily
changed by the Government last year. Quite apart from the merits of
today’s statutory instrument, today’s business confirms
the criticisms that were made about the consultation period. As the
Minister has pointed out, consultation on these changes took place in
only a four-week period, beginning towards the end of October, before
the newly elected police commissioners, for example, were even elected.
So all 43 of them have had no opportunity of commenting on these
changes in an area in which it might be thought that they have a

this case exemplified the arguments that are being made about the
Government’s defective consultation procedure, but that is a
preliminary point and does not go to the substance of the matter, and I
do not expect the Minister to accept any responsibility for what seems
a flawed process. I suspect that it is not a matter to which he would

the other hand, the Minister will be aware that there is considerable
concern about the number of cautions now being offered in lieu of
possible prosecution and a feeling that this is to some extent being
used by some police forces as a device to, shall we say, depress the
level of recorded crime. There is at least that concern. Whether it is
justified is another matter, and I would not for a moment suggest that
all police forces are succumbing to that temptation, but there is a
feeling that there is an issue, and one has to bear that in mind as we
look at extending the system in the way that these proposals do. A
cynic might indeed wonder whether this might be another way of reducing
the criminal legal aid bill, about which the Minister and his
colleagues are so exercised, but heaven forfend that I should be
susceptible to such a cynical standpoint.</hs_para>

number of points to be raised about these proposals. In terms of
conditional cautions, they shift the responsibility entirely on to
police officers, at least if they chose to exercise the power given to 
<?notus-xml column=81?>them. Will the Minister indicate what follow up there will be in terms
of consultation about the way the new system is working? Now that we
have elected police commissioners—which is not something that I
or my party have ever favoured—presumably they will be involved
in any consultations, as chief constables would be. Will the Minister
indicate whether it is intended to set up a process to monitor the way
the new powers are being used and how frequently those consultations
will be carried out?</hs_para>

question about the guidance which the Director of Public Prosecutions
is to issue. Once again, we have secondary legislation without the
accompanying guidance on how matters are to be used. That is a most
unfortunate defect in the procedure. The potential problem is that this
new system will be carried out in different ways in different areas.
Surely there ought to be a degree of consistency, which, no doubt, the
guidance would seek to promote, between what happens in different
police authority areas. Again, the question arises of what steps the
Government will take to ensure as far as possible that there is a
degree of consistency.</hs_para>

defendants—of course, they will not be defendants because there
will not be a prosecution, so let us call them foreign offenders for
the purposes of the debate—I invite the Minister to respond to
the possible doubt that this may be a convenient way of dealing with
foreign offenders without the expense of a trial, but possibly at the
expense of visible justice so far as victims are concerned. Will the
guidance indicate the level of offence that it would not be deemed
appropriate to be the subject of a conditional caution, with the
condition of deportation attached to it? Deportation may well be
desirable, but it may also be desirable for an offence to be dealt with
through the courts in the normal
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031268000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031268000007">We do not
oppose the principle of the order. It is certainly worth pursuing the
option of conditional cautions but, as the Minister recognised, we have
some reservations about how the system might work in practice. It is
new, and I hope that we can have an assurance that there will be a
proper review of progress, perhaps in a year or two, to see how the
system is working in practice and, in particular—I
repeat—whether there is consistency in practice across the
country which one would think would be desirable, if only to retain
public confidence in the new process. I reiterate the request that in
future guidance that will be crucial to the operation should be
available for consideration before the secondary legislation goes
through your Lordships’ House and the other
place.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_12_PT_1/7AC7560F01DE1AE5A7380C7D8379401022B9BC1B" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 March 2013">Tuesday,

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham. As usual, he is constructive in his questioning and I will try
to be equally constructive in my responses. I am informed by my noble
friend Lord Wallace that there was indeed a good and robust debate
about consultation in this Room yesterday. Where I cannot follow the
noble Lord, Lord Beecham, is in his description of consultation in this
case as being either defective or flawed. It was short but effective.
We were working against a pretty tight timetable to deliver the LASPO
reforms in place and on time.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=82?><hs_para UID="13031266000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000040">I take the point that
there was not perfect synergy between the coming into office of the new
police commissioners and our consultation, but it was interesting that
more than half the responses to the consultation came from police
forces or ACPO. As I indicated, the overwhelming response to the
consultation was favourable to what we are trying to do. The noble
Lord, Lord Beecham, was right to raise the question of consistency in
the application of these proposals. That is part of a broader approach
that we are undertaking at the MoJ to try to make sure that statistics
about policing and courts are more widely known so that we can see the
effectiveness of any such measures and any variety in their
implementation.</hs_para>

Association of Chief Police Officers in its work to develop local
scrutiny arrangements for out-of-court disposals. These will consist of
a retrospective look by a range of criminal justice professionals at
how an area uses these disposals, and it will look at individual cases
to see whether they raise any training needs. We are working with the
senior judiciary to establish how we harness the unique knowledge and
experience of magistrates in these arrangements.</hs_para>

Beecham, also asked whether there was a kind of inflation in the use of
out-of-court disposals. It is true that there was a significant
increase after 2007, but that was not at the expense of convictions,
the figures for which have remained broadly stable. Part of the reason
for the increase was targets imposed by the previous Government that
created an incentive for criminal justice agencies to criminalise
low-level offending by administering cautions where otherwise they may
have taken no further action. After those targets were replaced, the
number of out-of-court disposals since 2007 has declined by about
43%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031266000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000043">The noble
Lord asked for which offences conditions for foreign offenders will be
available. The foreign offender conditions will be available for the
same offences as the other types of conditions. However, it is right to
make these conditions available for more serious offenders—for
example, where the likely sentence, if prosecuted, would be a period of
imprisonment. We believe that for foreign offenders who have no right
to remain in the UK and admit to committing certain offences, the
public interest is better served by administering a caution and
promptly removing the offenders from the UK, rather than prosecuting
and potentially imprisoning them at the taxpayer’s expense, only
to remove them from the country once the sentence is completed. Where
the public interest requires it, serious offences committed by foreign
nationals will, of course, continue to be
prosecuted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031266000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000044">The
noble Lord raised the question of the DPP guidance. This will set out
the circumstances when the police can offer a conditional caution and
when they should refer the matter to the CPS. The police will be able
to offer a conditional caution for a summary-only or triable-either-way
offence but the decision in an indictable-only offence should be
authorised by a prosecutor. In a case of whatever seriousness, the
police can seek advice from the CPS on the appropriate disposal
decision. This brings conditional cautions into line with the current
situation on simple cautions.</hs_para>

the question of the timing of the DPP guidance, I agree with the noble
Lord. It is unsatisfactory. If I was in his place, I would grumble.
Parliament is right when it says that it has not been given the whole
picture on these things. I am asked to assure him that one of the
advantages of delaying is that we will be able to take this debate into
account as we put the guidance forward. I can already see how convinced
the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, is by that bit of sophistry; I sense
waves of a feeling of treachery from behind me. As a parliamentary
practitioner, I think that it is far better when Parliament gets the
whole picture when making a decision. I also appreciate the pressure
that we are putting our officials
under.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031266000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031266000046">Returning
to the matter of foreign offenders, we will, of course, also take into
account the views of victims. However, I think there is a general
feeling that a sensible way of dealing with these offenders will be to
get them out of the country and not put the taxpayer through the cost
of prosecuting and possibly incarcerating them. We will keep these
matters under review. The aim is to provide a consistent system, based
on a clear framework of guidance, while giving flexibility to the
police to make common-sense decisions. I hope that we will have an
opportunity to gather together the results of the ACPO research, to
which I referred, and perhaps at some stage publish it to promote
further discussion. As the consultations indicated, there has been a
broadly favourable approach to it. The points about ensuring
consistency and proportionality, raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham, are well taken, but I still have no hesitation in recommending
the order to the
Committee.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_12_PT_1/990E9274313A1051EA8B67F4FE64784C82AFA98E" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 March 2013">Tuesday,

one of the things that are very central to MoJ policy is the gathering
of relevant statistics. The noble Lord talked about breaches. That is a

is. We want to make use of the ACPO research and the information that

Lords, the Committee is considering the two draft orders: the
Amendments to Schedule 6 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act
Order 2013, which I will refer to as the amendments order, and the

transfer

orders before us today are part of a series that facilitate the
transfer of the functions of a range of tribunals into the First-tier
and Upper Tribunals. These orders will enable us to establish a new
chamber in the First-tier Tribunal, which will be known as the Property
Chamber and will transfer the functions of a range of tribunals into
the unified tribunal structure. The Property Chamber will deal with
land registration, residential and leasehold property, rent and housing
matters and in relation to park—that is, mobile—homes.
Subject to parliamentary approval, it will be launched on 1
July 2013.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031269000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000005">The
purpose of the draft amendments order is to add the rent assessment
committees and the agricultural land tribunals to the relevant parts of
Schedule 6 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. That
schedule lists the tribunals that can be transferred into the unified
tribunal structure; in this instance, into the First-tier Tribunal and
the Upper Tribunal. It is the addition of these tribunals into the
appropriate parts of the schedule that activates the powers of the Lord
Chancellor to transfer their functions into the
tribunals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031269000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000006">Transferring

assessment panels—in England; the agricultural land tribunal in
England; and the Adjudicator to Her Majesty’s Land Registry in

might be worth me going into some detail about why the Government are
taking this action and why it is necessary. I think it would be helpful
to give some background to tribunals in general and the Property
Chamber in particular. Over the past few decades, a number of tribunals
have been created to bring together specialist knowledge and expertise
to resolve disputes, but they were first recognised as part of the
justice system of the United Kingdom in the Franks report of 1957. From
then until the turn of this century, a network of tribunals evolved,
each with different rules of procedure, with varying powers and
different sponsoring government
departments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031269000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000008">It
was apparent that this haphazard approach to creating tribunals was
neither efficient nor economical. In 2004, the Government, through the
Lord Chancellor, invited Sir Andrew Leggatt, a former Lord Justice of
Appeal,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13031269000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000056">“to

England and Wales. The Leggatt report was the result of the review. The
report recommended extensive reforms and set out a programme for
developing a 
<?notus-xml column=85?>unified tribunals system. Following the report, the Tribunals, Courts
and Enforcement Act 2007 was passed to implement its recommendations.
This Act established a two-tier tribunal system, independent from
decision-making government bodies, with a First-tier Tribunal and an
Upper Tribunal. The Act also provided a number of powers to effect the
transfer of existing tribunals or direct new appeal rights into this
system.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="13031269000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000009">A
system of chambers was established within the two-tier structure, which
enabled specialist tribunals with related jurisdictions to be brought
together. This arrangement brings a number of benefits by providing
cohesion and consistency within the system and allows judges and panel
members to be deployed across jurisdictions as appropriate. From
November 2008, the Upper Tribunal and the First-tier Tribunal took over
the jurisdictions of a number of existing tribunals. Since then,
further tribunals have been brought into the new system.</hs_para>

where a unified tribunals system is almost completed. There are now are
six chambers in the First-tier Tribunal and four chambers in the Upper
Tribunal. In 2011-12, almost 740,000 applications or claims were
received by tribunals. In the same year, more than 730,000 cases were
disposed of. The matters dealt with by tribunals are wide-ranging, and
cases range from those that can be determined on paper to those that
are complex and involved and take a number of days to hear the
issues.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031269000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000011">When
the Property Chamber is launched in July it will be the seventh chamber
in the First–tier Tribunal and will bring together jurisdictions
concerned with property and lands. These are residential property
tribunals, leasehold valuation tribunals, rent tribunals and rent
assessment committees—all which are composed from the members of
rent assessment panels—the agricultural land tribunals and the
Adjudicator to HM Land
Registry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031269000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000012">What
will happen to these three tribunals when the Property Chamber is
launched? In short, they will cease to have any functions in England,
although they will continue as before in Wales. Their jurisdictions
will be transferred into the new tribunal. All the judicial office
holders and panel members in post at the point of the transfer will
become a transferred-in judge or member of the new tribunal. These
jurisdictions deal with a wide and diverse range of issues, some of
which are technical and complex. They include cases concerning
residential property, including rent, park homes and leasehold
disputes, issues over agricultural land and disputes about registered
land in England and Wales, most of which will be referred to it by the
Land Registry.</hs_para>

Chamber being created? Currently, the three jurisdictions that will
transfer into the chamber operate independently of each other. They
have their own sets of procedural rules, different terms and conditions
for office holders and administrative staff, various locations and
diverse practices. The benefits of creating the chamber are clear: it
will be the centre of expertise for matters relating to land, property
and housing; it will bring greater consistency in decision-making and
effective case management, with one set 
<?notus-xml column=86?>of rules for all the jurisdictions; there will be administrative
efficiency leading to a reduction in costs; it will enable good
practice to be spread across the jurisdictions, also leading to greater
efficiency; it will allow more flexible and efficient judicial
deployment; and it will deliver administrative efficiency, leading to a
reduction in costs.</hs_para>

the creation of the Property Chamber in the First-tier Tribunal and the
transfer of the jurisdictions into the chamber will mark a significant
milestone in the achievement of the long-held vision of a unified
Tribunals Service. It will signify a further step in delivering the
chamber structure within the First-tier Tribunal, as envisaged by the
Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. I therefore commend these
draft orders to the Committee, and I beg to
move.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_12_PT_1/0B690D1F6D9C636936A75B44B14110A78593EBA5" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 March 2013">Tuesday,

Gardner of Parkes:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to speak on this
because I feel that the statements that are being put forward are not
necessarily as good as they sound. My interest in property is in the
register, but I state again that I have a personal interest. However,
my interest is much wider than that; it is also about other people. I
have asked the noble Lord, Lord McNally, Questions on the Leasehold
Valuation Tribunal in particular. He replied by letter and it was very
interesting. I was concerned because at the moment the applicant cannot
be asked to pay more than £500. Under the new proposals, the
amount will vary from £65 to considerably more—over
£500—but no one quite knows where they will come in that
scale. If there is a hearing, you might be asked to pay another
£190 for it. That is the minutiae of the answer, which I think
is worth putting on record. Over the years, the amount has never
varied. Although when we established the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal
in 1996, we had hoped that the amount would never vary, we cannot
expect prices to remain static for ever. That is an incidental
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031269000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000016">I am

was always envisaged. It was always envisaged that the first stage
would be within the means of ordinary people. There is a separate
argument here which I shall bring up on the Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform Bill, on which I propose to table amendments on a number of
issues. I am sorry to say that on some issues I have been told that the
difficulty is to get the Ministry of Justice to co-operate sufficiently
to get important changes through on housing issues. That is not good
enough. I draw that to the Minister’s attention. 
<?notus-xml column=87?>Those amendments will be coming up at Third Reading on 20 March, and I
hope that the Ministry of Justice will have looked at things a bit
thoroughly by that time and got things going because it is important to
realise that this is a very dramatic change.</hs_parafo>

suggestion in the Explanatory Notes that they will all be expert people
is quite frightening because a separate matter in the housing issue
that we have been talking about is that the management, who are not
supposed to be putting up big legal people in round one, which was for
the ordinary person to bring their case, are now bringing in very
expensive legal people and, what is worse, the cost of that, win or
lose, is charged back to the people who brought the application for
£500 because it is claimed to be a legitimate management expense
to provide the most expensive lawyers. Going back to 1996, when this
Act went through, it was always acknowledged that when it came to the
upper-level tribunal major experts and huge fees would be involved and
everyone realised that at that point the large property owner or the
person or company who had multimillions of pounds would be at a huge
advantage because they could afford to employ such people, but the
lower level was always meant to help the ordinary person and give them
a fair go. I am concerned about whether that is going to continue. I am
being quite tough about this because it is not often that I get the
opportunity to have this word in the ear of the people who come from

leasehold valuations, the rent tribunals and the rent assessment

which again is a justice situation, is why do we not have one decent
housing Act? Is it not time to consolidate housing? When I tabled a
Question on this issue, I was told by the former Lord Chancellor, the
noble and learned Lord Mackay, exactly what wording to put in so that
the justice department would answer it. Instead, it was answered by the
communities department again. The Ministry of Justice did not answer it
at all. I thought that was rather a tragedy because the noble and
learned Lord had told me that with that wording it could not be replied
to by anyone other than the Ministry of Justice. There is something
wrong with the system if things are not getting through. It could be
that we are not getting any response because the justice department is

as a member of the industrial tribunal when Ted Heath first introduced
it—I think it was in about 1970. At that time, the trade unions
were unwilling to join in. When it started, it was informal; people
were just appointed. As a dentist, I was appointed: I would never have
been appointed in employment law, but they were so short of people that
they appointed a number of dentists. When, a few years later, the
unions decided that they would join in and that the system was good in
principle and was reformed, you either had to be appointed by the CBI
or a trade union. To my surprise, the CBI appointed me because it was
pretty short of women, but none of the male dentists were renewed; they
were all out. I was fortunate to carry on and I served on it until
1997. I cannot be absolutely sure of the date but I had reached an age
when I had to stop, which is why I gave up. It was extremely valuable
to sit on a tribunal and see the difference between how a tribunal
works as opposed to a

when it is said that it will be of benefit to everyone because it will
have the same procedures, and everything. It all sounds to me as if a

given noble Lords more than enough of my comments, but I mention in
passing that I have an amendment for next week, which brings up
something about housing in general. At the moment, this issue has to go
to the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal, but it need not go there at all if
my amendment is accepted. It is a very simple amendment. There has just
been a court decision in which the judge ruled that for any expenditure
over £250 per flat in a year there will have to be a
consultation with all tenants, all the time. This means that if you
were going to spend an extra £1 per flat over that amount, you
would have to go to consultation. Everyone is concerned that this will
add huge costs for the managing agents and all the tenants in all these
places. It will really not be a good thing at all. In terms of justice,
something could be done about
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031269000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000025">I have

some baddie comes along and breaks your front door lock, the whole
block is vulnerable because people could come in and attack the place.
Yet you would have to go to the tribunal, with all the time and costs
that that would take, to be able to get permission to do it. I
understand that there is an alternative system whereby you can go ahead
and do it and then apply for a dispensation subsequently. However, if
you have to do that, you still have to go through the tribunal to apply

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I am sure that the Minister would join
me in congratulating the noble Baroness on using her professional
expertise to fill the gap in the Tribunals Service for so long,
consistent with her other cavity filling over the years. She raised an
interesting topic—that of costs. Given that we now have a range
of tribunals being brought together, could the Minister indicate
whether there will be a uniform charge or whether it will be
differentiated between the different categories with which the new
property tribunal would deal? As she implies, that could potentially be
quite a significant issue. It also raises in my mind a question about
legal aid, which of course is now not available for First-tier
Tribunals. Could the Minister give an assurance that nothing in these
orders will diminish access to legal aid or advice over and above that
which, as we know, would affect other categories of case, which we have
discussed at some length and may do so again in some not so distant
future, around aspects of welfare
law?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031269000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000028">In that

have is whether valuation tribunals—that is, ordinary valuation
tribunals—as opposed to leasehold valuation tribunals are to be
brought within the scope of the property tribunal. For example, if by
some remarkable parliamentary arithmetic the Minister’s
party’s policy and my party’s policy on a mansion tax
were to be carried tonight presumably there would be some sort of
valuation system required. Even without that there may at some point be
a valuation of domestic properties in
particular.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031269000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000032">There
is a system for dealing with commercial properties and business rates
with a cumbersome appeal mechanism. Is it envisaged that the property
tribunal will take those issues into account? I hope that it might. The
current procedure, particularly on the commercial property side, is
leading to inordinate delays going back nearly a decade for
determination. If it were to be brought within the scope of this new
tribunal, I hope that it is a matter that could be dealt with, and a
better service could be offered to the potential taxpayer and those
organisations, notably local authorities, that clearly will have an
increased interest in the local business rates yield of those
properties. Perhaps the Minister could indicate, if not now then
subsequently, whether this is to be brought within the scope of the new
tribunal, either now, or possibly in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031269000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000033">With
that said we do not object in principle to the proposal. It makes sense
to bring things together. I hope that, subject to the observations made
by me and the noble Baroness, we can approve these orders and look to a
more efficient system applying, drawing as it will on a range of
expertise. It is important that that range is reflected adequately in
the appointments made to the new tribunal; and that should assist
materially in the delivery of a better service to those who seek its
decisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031269000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000034"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13031269000072" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000072">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady
Gardner, and the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, for their interventions. As
I mentioned in my opening remarks these orders almost complete the work
set out by the Leggatt report. In spite of the points raised by the
noble Baroness most people agree that the creation of a Property
Chamber is a positive step that will bring benefits to users and
consistency in this area of the law. Nevertheless, the questions raised
are pertinent. As the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, has acknowledged, I
have a wonderful team behind me, which I hope has been taking note of
her comments. She is probably right that at some stage there will be a
strong case for a consolidated housing Act. When that will find its way
into the parliamentary timetable, I do not know. However, the points
that she raised illustrate the fact that we are talking about an area
that cuts across a number of departments and pieces of legislation.
Nevertheless, I hope these measures illustrate that we have made
progress in terms of consistency and
efficiency.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_12_PT_1/062FCF7D42B98DD753E8F51CC43CF410D2CC27AB" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 March 2013">Tuesday,

Baroness referred to costs and has tabled Parliamentary Questions about
the costs which a party to proceedings may be ordered to pay. As she
rightly says, these cannot exceed £500. These fees have never 
<?notus-xml column=91?>been increased, even to reflect inflation, since 2003. When the transfer
order 2013 comes into effect, it will remove the £500 cap on
costs, which the noble Baroness mentioned. However, there are concerns
that removing the cap on costs could prevent a party bringing a case to
tribunal. It is rare for costs to be awarded in the Property Chamber.
The decision to award costs is a judicial matter, made by the tribunal.
Usually, parties will pay their own costs. Tribunal procedure
committees have replaced the current test of frivolously, vexatiously
and so forth with the wider test of behaving
“unreasonably”. Only where the tribunal considers a party
has behaved unreasonably could it make a costs order award against
them. The noble Baroness is right that the cap will be removed but the
protection is still there in that people will be responsible for their
own costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031269000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000036">On
leasehold valuation, some leases permit the recovery of the
landlord’s legal costs via the service charge but the tribunal
does have powers to prevent this. Section 20C of the Landlord and
Tenant Act 1985 enables a leaseholder to apply to the tribunal for an
order that all or any costs incurred by the landlord in coming before
the LVT are not to be included in determining the service charge
payable by the leaseholder. There may be other circumstances where
landlords may recover legal and other costs from lessees, depending on
the terms of their lease. The Leasehold Advisory Service, the
non-government public body funded by DCLG, is considering whether there
is any further clarification it can provide on costs in its guidance to
users, which is available on the Justice
website.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031269000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000037">I was
asked whether the Government would take action to amend the law in
light of the recent county court judgment whereby a leaseholder living
in Plantation Wharf was in danger of forfeiting his flat as a result of
legal costs incurred by the landlord at a leasehold valuation tribunal.
I cannot comment on a particular case but where a freeholder is able to
recover costs in connection with proceedings from a leaseholder, this
will be a contractual matter between them and will be set out in the
lease. The Government are aware, however, that leaseholders are
increasingly concerned about recovery of such costs as administration
charges. Residential leasehold law is a matter for the Department for
Communities and Local Government, but I can say that my honourable
friend the Housing Minister, Mark Prisk, is looking into this issue and
giving it detailed
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:35:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031269000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-gc0001.htm#13031269000038">The
noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, also asked me when the public will know
about the amount of fees to be charged. The fees order will be made in
the period between approval of the transfer order and the chamber
implementation date of 1 July 2013. Changes to fees will be made in
line with inflation and will not therefore require public consultation.
A fee remission scheme will continue to operate for applicants who are
in receipt of
benefits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:35:43"></hs_TimeCode>. As I
explained, when the chamber is launched and the cap on fees is removed,
there will be no statutory limit to fees charged for cases going
through the Property Chamber. However, the MoJ will not increase the
fees more than the rate of inflation without public consultation and
without agreement from the Treasury. In cases involving a hearing and
the highest fee for a leasehold case, the aggregate fee 
<?notus-xml column=92?>would be £630—£440 plus £190 hearing fee.
The current fees are £350 for an application and £150 for
a hearing fee, hence the £500. The highest application fee will

the point about Third Reading, I am sure that the MoJ is not aware of

blockages in communications we will endeavour to unblock them by 20
March. The noble Baroness has given us due warning that that should be
the case. She mentioned the expertise of the new tribunals. The
composition of the panels that hear cases becomes the responsibility of
the judiciary. The senior president of tribunals, in his policy
regarding composition, is required to have regard to the previous
arrangements on the composition of panels. The current qualifications

legal aid, we do not consider that changes to legal aid will increase
inequality in this area. One of the fundamental principles of the legal
aid reform has been to discourage unnecessary and adversarial
litigation at public expense. Tribunals are designed to be simple to
enable parties to make or respond to a claim without the need for
representation or access to legal aid advice. While we recognise that
clients find advice in preparation for a case useful, we do not

views on four issues: whether the link between parliamentary
constituencies and constituencies for elections to the National
Assembly for Wales, a link broken as a result of the Parliamentary
Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, should be reinstated;
whether the length of an Assembly term should be moved from four to
five years; whether the prohibition on a candidate at an Assembly
election standing in both a constituency and a region should end; and
whether Assembly Members should not also be able to sit in
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031233000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-wms0001.htm#13031233000013">A

a result of the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013, the
four UK Boundary Commissions will now report in 2018 on their

five-year fixed terms. The term of the current Assembly is,
exceptionally, five years, but the Assembly is set to revert to
four-year terms after the next Assembly elections in 2016. A permanent
move to five-year terms would make a coincidence between parliamentary

we will end the prohibition on candidates at Assembly elections

cost to the UK of undocumented passengers can be high as many go on to
claim asylum. There can also be a security risk as individuals wishing

to reduce the number of passengers arriving in the UK without proper
documentation, and to do this by working in partnership with
carriers.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031233000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-wms0001.htm#13031233000031">The

increase the level of the carriers’ liability charge from
£2,000 per undocumented passenger to £7,000. While this
is a significant increase, the charge level has been at £2,000
for over 20 years and no longer reflects the costs and risks involved.
The second is to introduce a new approved route incentives scheme for

wider reviews which are ongoing in relation to historic child abuse. We
need to ensure the law enforcement response to these terrible crimes is
as good as it can be, to protect victims and deliver justice. As I have
previously made clear in this House, the safeguarding of victims must
be placed at the heart of our approach. If someone has been the victim
of abuse and makes a report to the police, those in a position of
authority and responsibility must not shirk in their duty to
protect.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031233000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130312-wms0001.htm#13031233000039">I am
committed to ensuring that we also learn the lessons from this work to
ensure that these mistakes could not be repeated today. HMIC will soon
commence a further review into child sexual abuse and sexual
exploitation which will focus on the adequacy of current processes and
practices in police forces. The Director of Public Prosecutions has
outlined further measures to overhaul the way our criminal justice
system responds to victims of child sexual abuse. And I have asked my
officials to conduct a thorough review of Home Office policies to
ensure a robust and strengthened longer term approach to delivering
child protection within the department and the police. This urgent work
will ensure that the interests of victims are prioritised and the
specific vulnerabilities of children are recognised and

entirely necessary —for instance in emergency
situations—I am concerned that such services are in many cases
being provided unnecessarily because of a misinterpretation of equality

unintentional, adverse impact on integration by reducing the incentive
for some migrant communities to learn English and are wasteful where

are also very expensive and a poor use of taxpayers’ money.

course, local authorities must comply with the duties set out in the
Equalities Act 2010, including  the duty not to discriminate
and the public sector equality duty. But this is not a legal duty to
translate documents into foreign languages. Even if publishing only in
English could put some people at a particular disadvantage, such a
policy may be justified if local authorities can demonstrate that the
integration and cost concerns pursue a legitimate aim and outweigh any
disadvantage. The equality duty does not require a particular outcome,
merely that public authorities consider all the relevant

is only able to identify how many applications for deductions from

deducted from certain benefits and only if there are not already too
many other third-party deductions being taken from the benefits claim,
so not all applications for a deduction from benefits orders are
successful. Offenders who are claiming benefits often start and stop
claiming benefits a number of times, which results in the deduction
from benefits order ceasing and needing to be re-applied for when the
offender is claiming the relevant benefit again. This means that some
fine accounts will have multiple applications for deduction from
