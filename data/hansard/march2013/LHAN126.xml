Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the UK plays a leading role on tax
transparency internationally, but it is not possible to extend UK
disclosure rules to other countries. Parliament has limited powers to
legislate for territories outside the UK. The Government have other
policies to assist developing countries more directly by, for example,
building their capacity to establish and maintain effective tax systems
of their
own<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T11:06:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Collins of Highbury" PimsId="5919" UID="13031438000451" xid="2127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000451">Lord
Collins of Highbury:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for that
response. David Cameron’s pledge to tackle tax avoidance as part
of the UK presidency of the G8 needs to move from words to deeds. We
cannot use the need for international action as an excuse for going at
the pace of the slowest country. The UK should be a global leader, so
will the Minister confirm that the Government will use their position
at the G8 to make serious proposals that will make a substantial
difference to the revenues of the poorest countries in the
world<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T11:07:23"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13031438000452" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000452">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I think the Government are a global
leader in this area. We are taking a lead at the G8, and have taken the
lead in the OECD to get the international tax rules changed. However,
the other component that we are also taking a lead in is helping poorer
countries to develop their own tax collection abilities. For example,
work that HMRC has done in Ethiopia resulted in a sevenfold rise in the
amount of tax collected in that country in the nine years
from
2002<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T11:07:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Gardner of Parkes" PimsId="3383" UID="13031438000453" xid="1170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000453">Baroness

Inland Revenue tax return that one has to complete, one is asked to

tell me how a tax-avoidance scheme gets to be an approved tax-avoidance

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, there is something called
DOTAS—the disclosure of tax avoidance schemes—which was
introduced in, I think, 2004 and requires people who have come up with
a tax wheeze to consult HMRC. If HMRC believes that it is a legal
scheme, it gives it a number. That is the number you are supposed to
put on your tax
return<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T11:09:00"></hs_TimeCode> if you

agree that both transparency and, as the Minister has already said,
capacity, are absolutely vital here? Will they ensure that everywhere
the UK provides budget support to a developing country, one of the key
elements of that budget support is building the capacity for the right

Newby:</Member></B> Yes. This is an area to which DfID  is
giving increasing priority. Last year we supported 48
programmes in 20 countries and spent £20 million in this area.
Of course, the extent to which we can do it in any country depends on
an assessment of that country’s capacity to take advice and act
on
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000009"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T11:09:53"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Kramer" PimsId="5891" UID="13031438000457" xid="2104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000457">Baroness
Kramer:</Member></B> My Lords, I very much support the GAAR, the
general anti-abuse rule, which the Government are bringing in to deal
with abusive tax avoidance, but would the Minister agree that the
version that the Government are looking at is very narrow, with the
double reasonableness test? If it proves ineffective, would it not be

difficult. As the noble Baroness will know, it was resolutely opposed
by the party opposite when it was in government. We are making a
proportionate start, and hope that it will be successful in dealing
with the most egregious tax avoidance schemes. The great thing about it
is that it is a deterrent. It will definitely be kept under review, but
it is a big step forward, and we should not underestimate
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T11:11:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean" PimsId="4196" UID="13031438000459" xid="1548" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000459">Baroness

part of HMRC and the Government more generally to work with any country
that seeks to do that. As I say, we are already working with 20
countries. In recent months, DfID and HMRC have been looking together
at how to put together a business case to allocate more resources to
this area. The interesting thing about it is that this is a relatively
new area. We have realised that we have expertise that can make a big
difference to a whole raft of developing countries, and we are very
keen now to capitalise on

Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> Will my noble friend accept that when
British companies are involved in tax avoidance schemes abroad, it

schemes are plain fraudulent? Is it not therefore essential that HMRC

welcome the CQC’s positive findings on the 75% of

are a cause for deep 
<?notus-xml column=342?>concern, particularly as regards the number of late or missed calls and
their complete failure to have systems to
document, assess or monitor the quality of care they are supposed to
deliver. Where there is a live-in carer, late or missed calls can at
least be managed in some way, even if the
cared-for person cannot be got out of bed. However, if people are on
their own, the consequences are deeply distressing and can
be very serious. What information does the department have nationally
across the sector about this very worrying issue? What action is being
taken to address the problem? Should we not ensure that all providers
are required to keep records of the numbers, reasons for and remedial
actions taken for missed and late calls, including refunding charges to
self-funders or to the local

right: there is no room for complacency in this area. Care has to be
right every time, not just three-quarters of the time. I noted from the

issues undermining the majority of good home care from a significant
minority of providers, many of these were fairly minor. However, the
noble Baroness has alighted on a very important failing among several
of the agencies inspected. I do not have national information on late

important. The evidence is that if an elderly person turns up at

We are proposing to expand the current care ambassador scheme, which

really answers my Question. Perhaps I can be clearer. Government cuts
mean that 15,000 fewer police officers will be in place by
the time of the next election. It is not therefore rocket science to
understand that last year 30,000 fewer crimes were solved. The Minister
will be aware that forensic evidence is a key part of bringing
criminals to justice. Can I direct him to yesterday’s
evidence from Michael Turner QC, chairman of the Criminal Bar
Association, to the Science and Technology Committee of the other
place? He said that following the Government’s abolition of the
highly regarded Forensic Science Service, the quality of expert
witnesses being used by the crown was now, in his words,
“variable”. Is the Minister aware of the frustration of
so many investigating police officers who are experiencing serious
delays in getting the forensic evidence reports they have taken at the
scene of crime? They are not getting them in time. Given the questions
on the quality and delays in the system in getting a forensic evidence
service, does the Minister think that scrapping the Forensic Science
Service was a good idea?</hs_para>

against demonstrators unless it is absolutely unavoidable, in

enforcement officials? With regard to the widespread attacks on
temples, houses and other property of religious minorities—a

boycotting them—and one in which there is no violence. It is

are familiar sights in many city centres. There were 1.2

those businesses that sell alcohol late at night contribute towards the

There are huge economic costs, as well as the social costs, in the

the House in debate would not be that issue but the question of what is

outlined today is really a very serious problem, I ask my noble friend

originally put forward. That is the premise under which we operate, but
it is not the total answer. I think the noble Lord would admit that
there are other elements besides price, such as availability. As the
noble Lord will know, we face a much more liberal licensing regime as a
result of the previous Government’s determination to extend
licensing hours, so availability is another factor. But he is right to
point to behaviour, because there are huge differences between those of
us who live in Nordic countries, where alcohol consumption per capita
is very high, and those who live in Mediterranean countries and the
like, where there seems to be better self-ordered restraint on the
consumption of
alcohol<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T11:47:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000080"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Elystan-Morgan" PimsId="3108" UID="13031438000523" xid="1811" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000523">Lord
Elystan-Morgan:</Member></B> My Lords, while accepting that it is
utterly laudable that any Government should pay very great attention to
the possibility of curbing alcohol abuse by pricing, I urge upon the
Minister an alternative consideration as well. As the Minister will
remember, the current Licensing Act has a provision—I think in
Section 157, but I could be wrong—to punish publicans for
serving alcohol to persons who have already had too much to drink. Will
the Government concentrate very much on this aspect as well? If proper
sanctions are fully and practically applied, this could be a very
powerful weapon against
alcoholism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T11:48:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000081"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13031438000524" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000524">Lord

be shown by those who retail alcohol, whether in shops, supermarkets or
bars, is a very important part of the solution to this problem. We know
that local authorities are taking the issue of underage drinking much
more seriously than has been the case. The responsibility must lie with
the person selling the alcohol to make sure that it is not made

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, many of us have some anxiety
about what appears to be the disproportionate influence of lobbyists in
Whitehall. Some time ago the Prime Minister expressed his anxiety about
the growth of the lobbying industry and the possible susceptibility of
politicians to lobbying. Will the Minister say what the Government are
doing to ensure that as civil servants develop policies for the

important one. I can truly say that when it was presented to me some

region shares a long Islamic heritage, something that I have seen as I
have been lucky enough to travel in the region over the past few years.
When I visited Uzbekistan in April last year, I saw the Uzbeks’
Islamic heritage, visiting the great Silk Road cities of Samarkand and

vital step on the path to a strong, stable and democratic Pakistan. The
new Government, whatever their make-up, will face some real challenges

through a three-year programme focused on sustainable capacity building

Afghanistan’s mineral wealth and have pledged to make a large
investment in the extractive sector. A week ago, I met the Minister for
Mines, Wahidullah Shahrani, who was in the UK for the mining, gas and
oil investor forum hosted by the Prime Minister. At the forum, the
Prime Minister announced the UK’s continued support for the
Afghan Ministry of Mines of £10 million over the next three
years to help the ministry manage and monitor contracts to ensure that
the benefits of Afghanistan’s mineral wealth are felt by the
Afghan people. We also discussed how Afghanistan can harness this
wealth as it looks to develop a sustainable economy and move away from
dependence on aid. Investment must lead to broad-based growth and job
creation. This is a challenging task, but with the support of DfID, the
Ministry of Mines is working hard to ensure that the Afghan people
benefit from the huge mineral resource which is beneath their
feet.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031438000124" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000124">As we

military operations have been going on since 2001 and, as far as I can

on all sides; rampant corruption is startling and visible. Afghanistan
today is rated as 180 out of 183 countries; seven years ago, it had the
honour of being 140 out of 183. There is a huge waste of resources.
Money everywhere is wrongly used or used to buy people and corrupt the
cultural life of the country. Violence has become a profitable
industry. You only have to set up a little insurgent group and there

acute, and there is no stable political system. This has tended to
happen despite the enormous amount of money and the enormous amount of

basic realties of Afghan life. Some 80% of it is rural, and 87% of its
people earn their

separated by mountains and it can take days to reach them. There is an
informal power structure based on ethnic, regional, tribal, clan and

interference except for the kind of aid and advice that it might need.
We need to trust the people of Afghanistan to sort out their own
differences. After all, they have lived together all these years; they
want to live together; they share a future; they know—as the

make proper use of; and they have their own children whom they would

publicity we tend to forget that there are some powerful civil society
movements in Afghanistan. In spite of having been a student of
politics, I had not been aware of them until a few weeks ago, when I
was addressing an important “Festival of Ideas” in Goa. I
spoke on one day, and the person who addressed the meeting the next day
was Dr Siddiqui, an Afghan professor of education in the United States
who decided to return to Afghanistan and to take on the Taliban on her
own. She said that girls will be educated—they will be sent to
schools and the schools will not be touched. She relied on persuasion,
on power and on organisation, reaching out to the daughters and wives
of the Taliban leaders themselves, telling them that the future was
theirs if only they would go to school. Slowly and slowly, despite
threats to her life, she has been able to create a fairly powerful
movement. It is not surprising that she, along with many others, has
been nominated for a Nobel Peace
Prize<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T12:19:48"></hs_TimeCode>. Movements

am sorry to say that Pakistan’s role, which could have been and
should be useful, has not been terribly helpful. It has provided
backing, safe haven and even military training to insurgent groups,
including the Taliban. It is using those groups, particularly the
Haqqani network, to attack Indian interests and targets in Afghanistan;
for example, the Indian embassy in 2008 and 2009 and even the United
States embassy in
2011<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T12:20:39"></hs_TimeCode>. Not
surprisingly, the recently retired chief of staff of the United States
called the Haqqani network the “veritable arm” of
Pakistan’s ISI. Sadly, if you try to provoke violence of this
kind, or support terrorism in other countries, it has a blowback effect
on your 
<?notus-xml column=361?>own. The result is that the Pakistan Taliban uses Afghan territory as a
safe haven and a springboard to launch attacks on Pakistani troops,
which we all bitterly regret. In other words, Pakistan, by supporting
insurgent movements in Afghanistan, is paying the price in terms of its
own stability and the security of its own

happens in international politics—there is no use in being
sentimental or sanctimonious about it—but what are
Pakistan’s reasons? It argues that Afghanistan offers strategic
depth against potential conflict with India. However, you cannot think
of other countries simply in terms of conflict, and you cannot think of
India simply as a country with which you are eternally condemned to

argument that India is using Afghans, or Afghanistan, to foment trouble
in Pakistan. Again, I have seen no evidence of this—and if there

it. I do not think that it would be in India’s interests.
Talking to Indian diplomats I get the feeling that it would not be in
India’s interests to use Afghanistan to foment trouble in
Pakistan, because one Afghanistan is enough. Half a dozen Afghanistans

think that Pakistan needs to recognise that India has a legitimate
interest in Afghanistan: first, to maintain trade with central Asia and
beyond; secondly, to prevent militants from attacking Indian targets in
Afghanistan; and thirdly, because it has close historical and cultural
ties that need to be maintained. It is very striking that India has
signed an agreement that it would not use its troops or combat
personnel in Afghanistan. Its activities, as the Minister rightly said,
are largely developmental. It is the fifth-largest provider of
development aid, giving over $1.5 billion to various

sometimes wonder whether our own Government’s policy is as
even-handed and transparent as it could be. On the one hand they seem
suspicious and critical of what Pakistan is doing; but on the other
hand they organise meetings such as the trilateral summit in February
this year, where they seem to be supportive of what is going on and
give the impression, certainly to Indians, that they want to keep the
Indians out and that they think we can maintain peace in the region
simply by establishing some kind of relationship with Pakistan and
Afghanistan. That is not the way to go. I very much hope that the
British Government will make it absolutely clear that, as the noble
Baroness said, all the regional powers in the neighbourhood have a
legitimate role in maintaining a stable Afghanistan —they all
need to be involved. Bilateral or trilateral summits simply arouse
Indian suspicion and are not the

British<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T12:24:59"></hs_TimeCode> Prime
Minister declares that now is the time for everyone to participate in a
peaceful political process in Afghanistan. One might legitimately ask
whether this is the late 18th century, the 1920s, or perhaps last month
at Chequers. It could easily be any of all three. That Afghanistan has
the capacity to destabilise its neighbourhood is uncontested, but it is
also a country that finds itself in a particularly unsavoury
neighbourhood, surrounded by, in the north, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and
Turkmenistan, et al, acknowledged to be some of the most authoritarian,
poorly governed and dysfunctional states of the former Soviet Union.
Iran, its western neighbour, has continued on its post-1979 project to
be the guardian of Shia interests around the world, irrespective of the
force of international law, as we have seen demonstrated in the Middle
East but also in western Afghanistan itself. Here, apart from a short
window of co-operation in 2002, Iran has seen its role as a spoiler,
resisting US-Afghan strategic co-operation, profiting, it is alleged,
from the narcotics trade, funding armed shipments and training the
Taliban. That is hardly a recipe for neighbourly

most difficult relationship between Afghanistan and its neighbours is
that with Pakistan, and it is primarily on that relationship that I
shall focus my remarks today. There was a time of cordial relations
between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but it was a relatively brief window
and is easily forgotten: the period between the 1950s and the late
1970s, when trade was undertaken, people-to-people contact was strong,

me turn to the aims of the Chequers six-month push for peace, as it is

programme. There are three fundamental issues at stake. The first is
the Karzai Government’s ability to attain peace with their
Taliban, given that the Taliban office intended for Qatar nearly two
years ago has still not arrived, although, as the noble Baroness has
told us, the new initiative will be a Doha-based political office, and
talks are likely to go ahead shortly. However, the history of peace
initiatives with the Taliban is not likely to deliver results,
particularly when the US is not actively involved—and to my
mind, six months is not nearly long enough to see
delivery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T12:28:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000142">If
the Chequers summit had been more broadly based to include at least the
United States as financial guarantor, we might have given this a
greater push. But without wishing for a replication of the Bonn II
meeting, which was very wide indeed, it would be illuminating to assess
what discussions might have been conducted with the Saudi Government
about their support for the most radical elements in the Taliban, both
in Afghanistan and Pakistan, which have been historical and, some say,
ongoing.</hs_para>

noble friend said that Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan have a deep and
lasting friendship, but given the history of its destabilisation in
both Afghanistan and Pakistan, I wonder whether players on either side
would subscribe unanimously to that remark. Moreover, the role of the
UAE as the principal recipient of the proceeds of corruption, as the
destination of choice for Afghans depositing their ill gotten gains, is
also to be scrutinised. What attempts in this six-month period are Her
Majesty's Government likely to make with the United States in seeking

in bringing about peace is the role of Pakistan, which may not actively
seek to destabilise Afghanistan any longer but certainly does not play
as constructive a role as it might, given the shared challenges of the
terrorist factions in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and their
activities on both sides of the border. The role of Pakistan’s
Inter-Services Intelligence agency’s operations in Afghanistan
is probably the best documented record of a deep and concerted policy
of destabilisation by one state on another. This is down to
Pakistan’s long sought doctrine of strategic depth, discussed
earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, which is based on the idea that
its influence over Afghanistan—some might even say its control
of Afghanistan—represents some sort of strategic depth against
India. The perversity of this thinking in Pakistan is that if your
attempts at control do not work, you end up with enemies on both your
eastern and western flanks. I am aware that the US and the United
Kingdom are hopeful that the rapprochement between Kabul and Islamabad
will work this time, but I have to say I have my

was told by an Afghan Minister only last week that the agreement from
the Chequers summit that the Pakistan army would be involved in
training the Afghan National Security Forces is now under threat. His
explanation was that since Chequers, Islamabad has sought to exert
greater pressure on Kabul for Afghan foreign policy to be somehow
approved by Pakistan. This is clearly unacceptable to Kabul, and I
understand that talks have now recommenced with India to see if India
can fill the gap in training the ANSF. It undoubtedly can, and since it
has a strategic partnership agreement with Pakistan, which gives it a
formal role in guaranteeing Afghan security, it would be entirely in
keeping with India’s strategic goal of denying Pakistan any
strategic advantage in that country. I have to say that I cannot see
the extremely benign role that the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, ascribes to
India. It has historically always worked to manipulate
Pakistan-Afghanistan discord. If my Afghan interlocutor was correct,
this is another illustration of how very challenging the task of
maintaining regional security will
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000146" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000146">However,
the final fundamental that was not addressed at Chequers was the
ability and inclination of Pakistan to bring its own house in order. I
refer to the various Taliban and other terrorist groups operating
across the border. It has long been acknowledged that the main elements
of al-Qaeda’s leadership reside in Pakistan. Since the capture
of Osama bin Laden, it is also widely believed that Ayman al-Zawahiri
is not in the tribal areas but resides in the so-called
“settled” areas 
<?notus-xml column=364?>of Pakistan; in other words, he lives in comfort in some city. We know
that the Haqqani network continues to launch attacks and control myriad
insurgency groups. Its interests in the drugs trade, arms trade,
kidnappings, murders and terrorist bombings make it the most difficult
of the terrorist groups with a stake in this conflict. Given that its
interests are so deeply entrenched, and that it is so financially
dependent on this ongoing conflict and on keeping it going, I cannot
see how it will be demobilised. Its listing in the US as a terrorist
organisation is long overdue, but I do not see Pakistan bringing it to
any kind of negotiation. It simply does not have that in its
power<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T12:33:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

influence of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, the umbrella group of the
various Salafi, Deobandi and Wahhabi groups, which were created by ISI
initially to counter the Soviet invasion as well as the Shia threat
after the Iranian revolution of 1979. They are distinct from the
anti-Indian terrorist grouping so well established in Pakistan, too.

levels of violence in all parts of Pakistan up—by some 300% in
Karachi to some 40% in Lahore—the Pakistani public justifiably
ask what these groups now want. With the restoration of a civilian
Government for some years, it is instructive that it is itself subject
to attacks from these groups. Their aim seems to be to build a fully
theocratic state within Pakistan, subscribing to their vision of a true
Islam. One of their means of doing this is to form electoral pacts with
the mainstream political parties in order to be able to enter the
Pakistani parliament, and to wield the influence and power that that
brings. As this process of Islamisation of Pakistan continues through
the use of violence, and now political entryism, I cannot see much

elections in Pakistan. A stable Afghanistan will be a prize that will
reinvigorate the region and enhance development, trade and the overall
economies of the entire region. We know that development is a factor in
reducing conflict, and the absence of conflict is a precondition for
freedom. Achieving that across Afghanistan, Pakistan and India would be
a prize
indeed.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_14_PT_1/AEFD31C4492C9BBBE4D521AD529839A48D444B80" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 14 March 2013">Thursday,

all achieve that.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T12:36:26"></hs_TimeCode> is a pleasure
to join her in such an upbeat and constructive debate on Afghanistan
because it is a country which will always depend on the strength of its
links with its immediate neighbours. However, so much uncertainty may
mean that what we say will be largely speculation. 
<?notus-xml column=365?>Having been puzzled by the wording of the debate, I nevertheless fully
understand the Government’s motivation for tabling

we bold enough to say that Afghanistan even has the prospect of
becoming a united country? In my view, after ISAF’s withdrawal,
it will still require subtle partnerships not only with neighbours but
with provincial warlords to achieve relative unity and ensure a
reasonably stable coalition at the centre. If we have learnt one lesson
in 12 years—the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, reminded us of
this—it is surely that over every mountain is another form of
loyalty to family, tribe and the shura, normally before that of central
government. However, there will always be central government in some
form, and it is the job of this debate to identify what forms of
regional co-operation are going to achieve the most secure results. In
the absence of ISAF, Afghanistan will have to fall even further back on
the good will of its neighbours, and they are pulling it in different
directions. The Istanbul Process was a good idea but perhaps too
ambitious, and the key bilateral partnerships with India and Pakistan
will always be restrained by the endemic rift between those two
countries, although I am very glad to hear of the improvements in the
links between Pakistan and Afghanistan and the transit trade agreement
and the new strategic partnership agreement. They will always be
helpful in achieving
reconciliation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T12:38:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000152" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000152">Iran
has a common language with Afghanistan. It has many close regional ties
with Herat province and we may be underplaying its role in a future
Afghanistan. I am never clear why our relations with Iran seem to
inhibit us from making this point. It is true that our embassy and the
British Council in Tehran have been badly treated, as I saw for myself
when I visited Tehran, but so have they in Moscow. I know
from fairly recent experience that there is a great affection for the
UK among people in Tehran, and I hope the Minister would agree that
there is room for discussion about development along the Iranian
border, perhaps through DfID or EU funded NGOs, as I believe there has
been in the past over the narcotics

is not part of this debate but it is almost impossible to discuss
regional relationships without mentioning the background of insecurity
and terrorism which has frustrated so many initiatives. Most critical
of all is the inability of the Afghan Karzai Government to come to
terms with any of the Taliban, the Haqqani group, the Quetto groups,
the ISI-created groups mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner,
or the cronies of the dreaded and mercurial Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, to
name but a few. Indeed, the Afghan Government have been unable to
identify any lasting relationship either side of the Pakistan
border.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000154" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000154">We

millennium development goals. That is a tall order—trade,
transport, energy, narcotics and MDGs. 
<?notus-xml column=366?>I will consider just trade and MDGs. Trade is perhaps the most important
of all because it actively concerns and develops people’s
livelihoods. It is happening every day, bringing goods and services
across all borders, despite the insecurity. Afghanistan already has
bilateral agreements with Pakistan and India and its membership of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, SAARC, should be
helping to build its partnership with both countries. I should be
interested in the Minister’s comments. The association aims to
promote the welfare of the peoples of the region through accelerated
economic, social and cultural development. Afghanistan joined the
association in 2007. What has it to show for that?</hs_parafo>

reconstruction of destroyed small towns and villages outside Kabul,
such as Istalif. I saw how dependent the people were on imports of, for
example, roofing timber from Pakistan, and all the appalling delays in
ordering and transporting it. What Afghanistan needs is more of its own
timber so that development is more sustainable. Perhaps the noble
Baroness can forecast what our role will be in trade promotion after
2014, especially in agricultural exports, which are the potential
winners. To the north and west, there is the important international
trade route through Uzbekistan used by ISAF. What is its future? We
know that there is considerable local traffic across a long border with
Iran. We have heard about mineral exploration and co-operation on
proposed pipelines, which are
promising.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000156" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000156">The
Pakistan border is in a special category because of the refugee camps
in Peshawar, where many of today’s decision-makers grew up and
were educated in exile. This is how many of the Afghan NGOs developed,
in partnership with the aid agencies. That building up of civil society
has been very important, both before 2001 during the rule of the
Taliban, and since. After our armed intervention, when the mist of
antiterrorism had receded, development became our principal motive for
public support for our intervention in that country, as we have,
usually for bona fide reasons, intervened in many poor countries around
the world, although not as dramatically as in Afghanistan. I was
delighted to hear from the Minister that the UK intends to remain in
Afghanistan through international development for another decade. That
is saying a lot. In the knowledge that DfID is reducing its programme
in India, I ask for a reassurance that the Government will begin now to
encourage and support development and co-operation between India and
Afghanistan, given that India has much experience in that
field.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000157">I will
mention one important millennium development goal that affects
Afghanistan—water and sanitation. About 300,000 children in
south Asia die from diarrhoea every year and more than half the
population of Afghanistan lacks improved water facilities, and nearly
two-thirds lacks sanitation facilities. The WHO estimates—this
must be repeated as often as possible—that for every $1 invested
in water, sanitation or hygiene, $3 or $4 come into the
national revenue. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Bath and
Wells knows from his connection with WaterAid, the noble Lord, Lord
McColl, and I are joining a parliamentary delegation to the Kathmandu
valley this coming weekend to draw attention to the importance of water
and sanitation in 
<?notus-xml column=367?>south Asia. I am beginning to do that here and now. It will be a
regional event and will be joined by MPs from India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh and elsewhere in a street march to the South Asian

objective of the campaign is to highlight the work of the high-level
panel on the post-2015 millennium development goals, which is meeting
in Bali this month and has to come to a decision in May. Perhaps I may
send a signal to our Prime Minister that WASH—water and
sanitation and hygiene—is still only a subsection of MDG 7 on
sustainability and needs to be upgraded in the next round. While
drinking water targets are being reached generally by 2015, the world
is still well short of the targets for sanitation and hygiene. I hope
that the Minister can take back that

Afghanistan. I have noted with interest the remarks of the
Minister following her recent visit to the area and the range of her

we look at the situation in Afghanistan and the region in which it

which enables conflict to be transformed from being destructive, in
order to move to a place where reconciliation can take place. There is
little doubt that this conflict has been destructive and that there is
a need for transformative action—not least because the
commitment, sacrifice and welfare needs of serving personnel and
veterans demand it, and because there is a need to acknowledge and
address Britain’s weariness with a decade-long conflict that has
eclipsed the wider debate on our moral and political responsibilities

other noble Lords have remarked, the need for an inclusive peace
process in Afghanistan, and between Afghanistan and the wider region,
with appropriate confidence-building measures to achieve this, is
paramount. Key to any process is the moral imperative of justice after

diplomatic personnel on the lack then of preparedness and planning for

disintegration into sectarian paralysis is alarming and should serve as
a warning to the management of any post-withdrawal programme in

to any peace process is the conduct of operations in Afghanistan and in
the border region with Pakistan, and this must include the use of
drones and the treatment of prisoners, as well as the need for
dialogue with the armed opposition—notably, authorised
representatives of the Taliban. I note with gratitude both the
statement of the Foreign Secretary in January and remarks made by the
noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, on the difficulties of achieving this,
but the opening of a Taliban office is an integral and important step
forward in the Afghan peace and reconciliation

of what is currently proposed in terms of peace and reconciliation is a
top-down approach, particularly in relation to Pakistan. In and of
itself, that should not be underestimated. However, as has already been
pointed out, there are considerable regional implications that go
beyond a bilateral peace process, many of which are historical. I note
with gratitude that any peace process in which we are endeavouring to
engage at present looks to the wider communities—India, Saudi
Arabia and China among them—but, equally, that the historic
involvement of Iran, which to a lesser degree is supporting insurgency,
cannot be overlooked. Indeed, the remarks of the noble Earl, Lord
Sandwich, and the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, each presenting
slightly different aspects of the question of Iran, lead me to conclude
that, although it may be very optimistic to propose it, the inclusion
of Iran in any wider Afghan peace process could also prise open the
door a little to the much needed regional peace process in the Middle
East. This is not a conflict, or series of conflicts, that stands on
its own.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031438000166" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000166">I
welcome the Minister’s remarks concerning the considerable
mineral wealth of Afghanistan and its potential for the future
well-being and financing of that country. It would be good if that

up, leaving the country poor and benefiting only the investors.

remarked a moment or two ago that a top-down approach, while positive,
has its limitations. I have indicated that common interest in
Afghanistan’s potential for peace requires a broad coalition of

keep close to the ground and to see the potential in locally promoted
initiatives, in the work of international aid and development
organisations, and in the role and 
<?notus-xml column=369?>place of women. The noble Lord, Lord Parekh, remarked earlier on the
value of the local community at the rural level, and the noble Earl,

remarks upon her return, the Minister observed the difficulties that
women have faced because of the deeply conservative culture in parts of
their country. She also reflected that over the past 10 years there has
been a determination to protect women’s rights and to ensure, as
in any peace process, that gains made in the past 10 years are not
lost. I welcome her assurances on this. However, I also recall Amnesty
International’s campaign, launched ahead of International
Women’s Day, calling on the United Kingdom Government to

Her Majesty’s Government have expressed themselves to be a

little of their recent work in Afghanistan has focused specifically on
those rights. Of the 100 reconstruction and development projects in

women’s rights, and both were completed in 2010. Any peace

conclusion, the transformation of conflict is a priority for
Afghanistan and its regional partners. This long, frequently bitter and
costly conflict must end both positively and hopefully. Lessons to be
learnt from the Iraq theatre provide us with the potential to make, in
time, a “good peace”. To be successful, the views and
perspectives of the other actors—India, Iran, Russia and Turkey,
Saudi Arabia and China—are essential. However, above all, if war
is believed to have been “just” to any degree, then the
establishment of just peace is its corollary. Only if that is
demonstrated can the cost of all the human lives lost in any way be
mitigated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T12:55:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_14_PT_1/91DD6049BC6717399D34108FA856813DB6E6C4F0" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 14 March 2013">Thursday,

real breath of fresh air in an area which is often dominated by
impenetrable foreign policy elites who have their own private
conservations and reach their own conclusions, which sometimes bewilder
us. Some of those elites were telling us 13 years ago that
the invasion in 2001 would deal swiftly with the enemy. We then put in
place the groundwork for the presidential election in 2004 and many
people were suddenly telling us that the Taliban would be exposed, that
we would have human rights and democracy, and that effectively we would
have a country such as Denmark. However, we do not have that. That fact
that 10 years later we are still wrestling with these impossible
challenges is something that ought to humble us. That is very much the
theme of my contribution today. I want to make the argument that
essential to the success of the push for peace is truth and honesty

where we can learn from our experience in Northern Ireland and talk
about the elements that are important if there is to be a lasting
peace. I very much welcome the push for peace announced by the parties
at the Chequers summit on 4 February. The first point is that the
parties to the conflict have to be the parties to the peace. We can all
get on our high horse and say, “We’re not going to talk
to them. They’re evil and guilty of atrocities. We’re not
going to sit in the same room as them”, and so on. If we had
done that, we would not have got anywhere near having peace on the
ground in Northern Ireland, we would not have released people who had
been guilty of terrorist outrages before their sentences had been
expended, we would not have sat down and talked to Sinn Fein, and we
would not have had the negotiations that led to the Good Friday
agreement. So the parties to the conflict, however difficult it may be,
have to be the parties to the peace. That means that there needs to be
a role for the Taliban and for other organisations around the table
because there can be no peace without them. I was interested in the
suggestion from the right reverend Prelate that perhaps there is also a
role for Iran. Everything within us says, “What? Iran?
You’re kidding”. But if we want peace, we have to start
talking rather than posturing. That is our

preparations get under way for the Kabul follow-up conference next
month, consideration must be given to that. I should be grateful if the
Minister would comment on the role that the Taliban will play and
whether, as some evidence suggests, it will lead to other very
important parties, particularly from Pakistan, saying that they will
not attend because the Taliban will not be present. We need to face up
to that point. The second point, which has been very well covered by
the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, is that whatever the solution, it cannot
be imposed but must evolve and 
<?notus-xml column=371?>come from local people; it must be their solution, not ours. I made a

for us. I was disturbed to read that less than a week after the

peace, that NATO’s ISAF forces were called in to launch an air
strike in a village in eastern Afghanistan where there were believed to
be Taliban fighters. There were, but as well as the homes destroyed, 10
women and children were killed, and tens more were injured. That led to
some forthright words from President Kazai; “How could they ask
foreigners to send in planes and bomb our own houses?”. It is a
problem. If there is to be lasting peace, there must also be restraint

could they be mistaken for insurgents? They were both under seven years
old; they were gathering firewood in a field and were walking behind a
donkey. These are serious charges. When we want to give an example of
how Afghanistan can prosper in the future we must set harsh targets.
Such conduct would not be tolerated at all in our own country. When
Jean Charles de Menezes was shot, we had endless inquiries. There were
inquiries into Patrick Finucane and Bloody Sunday. There
have been endless inquiries in our own country, but we did not even

her contribution to the work that is being done in the region. I
express the same appreciation for other Members of your
Lordships’ House for the work that they have done as well.
Irrespective of agreement or nuances of disagreement that may emerge
today, the opportunity for a review at this moment is very welcome.
Sometimes detailed discussion and analysis on Afghanistan seem to
vanish from the agenda altogether. I think that, given our national
commitment to resolving some of the problems of Afghanistan, it is hard
to understand that, but it does
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:07:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000180" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000180">First
things first. We debate Afghanistan and its region against the
background of the combat engagement of our forces. Their courage and
heroism deserve both our unstinting praise and the reflection that they
are and remain the very best of our nation. They protect, as the noble

are there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:08:20"></hs_TimeCode>. But
they are not the only heroes in the story, although, of course, they
are placed at the greatest possible risk. Our embassy staff do a
remarkable job. The aid workers also do a remarkable job and fill me
with pride about the United Kingdom at its best. The same goes for the
unsung members of our intelligence services. It is no criticism of any
of them at all—none in the slightest—to try to draw up a
balance sheet and ask: what are the key issues now? How are they being

anything other than the work we are doing with our allies. We are not

issue. The word “welcome” has been used a number of

success?</hs_para>

United Kingdom and the United States are about a year away from a
substantial diminution of their military presence in Afghanistan, while
others have already left or lowered their numbers. Although we are
committed to the longer term training and mentoring programmes we will
not, as the Minister has said, be in the combat roles. Wisely, or more
likely perhaps not entirely wisely, we have given our enemies
considerable notice, allowing them to repurpose their strategic
resources and programmes in the country. It seems all but certain that,
whatever the real gains that have been made, Afghanistan will none the
less be left with a precarious security problem. As the noble Lord,
Lord Bates, said a moment ago, there is likely to be a significant
economic downturn, along with political and social institutions in
which many Afghans have very little confidence. They believe that, on
some grounds, the institutions lack legitimacy.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:12:05"></hs_TimeCode> am not clear
on the extent of the risk of civil war being led by disparate warlords,
but I suppose that any assessment must say that it is likely. Indeed,
there could be a general internal conflict. In such circumstances it is
not clear how we, the United States, the wider community or the
neighbouring community will prosecute key interests and what options
would really be open to
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:12:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lords Library brief—I congratulate the staff on
it—illustrates each of these points. It counterposes the
official narrative on security improvements, which is partly justified
but not universally accepted as being the most accurate account there
could be, with a bleak disbelief about the quality of the emerging
Afghan forces. I am bound to say that while we should not gravitate
towards any kind of complete pessimism, some recent media,
including TV coverage, suggest frightening levels of military
incompetence on the part of some of those forces. That is along with
the abuse of women and small boys by members of the forces, some of
whom appear to have serious drug problems as they prosecute the
business of military involvement and
command.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000185" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000185">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:13:19"></hs_TimeCode>
Library brief shows what any economist would regard as an economy that
is growing now but that is beyond fragility in the middle term. That is
illustrated not simply by the aid requirements. As matters stand, the
reliance on different agricultural products at the levels illustrated
by my noble friend Lord Parekh leaves little scope for externally
tradable goods, except arguably for heroin, and even the internal
distribution of agricultural products is inadequate. The noble Earl,
Lord Sandwich, also talked about the complexity of the politics that
lie in the background to all this, and I share his view. The remoteness
of political institutions that are far from the reach of many Afghans,
the persistent corruption that puts Afghanistan in the bronze medal
position in international tables for corruption, and the weakness of
the rule of law suggest fertile ground for all kinds of groups to
return, not least the Taliban, whether a negotiation moderates its
position or not. Drawdown is likely to make the role of 
<?notus-xml column=374?>institution-building a regional target, but it is hard to see how
realistically that is to be achieved. I do not want to be hopeless

said that there are things on the positive side, although I have to say
that I find it impossible to agree with the Prime Minister’s
somewhat effervescent belief that so many things are approaching the
sunny uplands. I regret that that is a worrying and somewhat shallow
view, because I can see no evidence that everything is going well. It
is clear that Afghanistan is marginally safer today. There are fewer
civilian casualties and many of them are the victims of the Taliban.
The national solidarity programmes have embedded significant aid
progress and processes, of which many are cost-efficient and popular.
However, the reality is that they have barely marginalised corrupt
local officials. Thousands of schools and major irrigation projects
have been built, and in this regard I accept the analysis of the
international community that President Karzai has performed in a
competent way. However, after the drawdown, it is not clear how the
incoming forces will occupy the space. My assessment, for what it is
worth, is that it is not likely that the Taliban will occupy it or
become the hosts of al-Qaeda again in a straightforward way, but that
does not mean that other warlords and factional regional groups will
not move in. Indeed, cross-border factions are important in this
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:16:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000187" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000187">GDP
in Afghanistan has grown but, as we have heard, it is vulnerable to any
dip in aid and to the structural features of the economy itself.
However, growth there has been—a tenfold growth in 10
years—while life expectancy has gone up by 18 years over the
same decade. A great deal has gone right, but as the noble Lord, Lord
Bates, was saying, a great many things still look like extremely big
challenges. Like my noble friend Lord Parekh, I doubt that we
understand the country or the region adequately. Given the frailties,
as we pull out it is quite possible that we will abandon all our
security interests in that part of south Asia as a whole, not just in
Afghanistan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:17:03"></hs_TimeCode>.
Progress has been made on the status of women and girls, some of it in
pursuit of UNSCR 1325 on women, peace and security, which emphasises
the healthier prospects for peace in a nation when women are enabled to
participate and play an active role. Has the Prime Minister raised this
in the trilateral discussions in order to ensure that it is a process
that is capable of being continued?</hs_para>

drawdown, there is a sharp risk that any advances could be thrown into
reverse. Gains in schools have been made, but they are not easily
sustained either in Afghanistan or in other parts of the region. When
we consider the impact of the region on Afghanistan, we necessarily
focus on Pakistan. Here, I welcome the work on Pakistan of the noble
Baroness, Lady Warsi, which has been refreshing in exactly the way many
noble Lords have described. However, it should be acknowledged that the
problems of dealing with terrorism in the region are complicated. I
recognise fully and acknowledge the sacrifices that have been made by
Pakistan in combating terrorism, but it is vital to the United Kingdom
that Pakistan should none the less change to a greater extent. Parts of
it cannot be allowed to remain like a failed state, much 
<?notus-xml column=375?>less a failed nuclear state, but can those changes be accomplished? It
is hard to see real consistency in our approach to this question. We
provide military and financial support to a country that also appears
to shelter insurgency in difficult parts of its terrain. Of course, it
bravely fights any insurgency that is directed at itself, but the
hot/cold relationship with Afghanistan leaves a feeling that there is
still complicity with some terrorism in
Afghanistan.</hs_para>

consistently advocated stepping up the political strategy, and before
each of the major conferences that we have heard mentioned
today—Tokyo, Istanbul and Chicago—has asked, as I do
today, precisely what our political contribution is and whether we are
failing to debate it often enough in our own Parliament. We have learnt
a good deal from the Minister today, but the question still has to be
asked. In addition, how, in the context of that question, can we ensure

conclude with a few quick thoughts, but first by congratulating the

overview. I shall not, noble Lords will be relieved to know, try to

the characteristics of regional neighbours, the problems of a time
limit of six months to make major steps and the questions about
Pakistan’s willingness to create strategic stability. As we
withdraw, in an orderly fashion, we must not step ahead of
Afghanistan’s real capacities or in ignorance of the current
levels of corruption and incompetence. We should accept that it would
be wilfully naive to believe that the ANSF has avoided some of the
systematic corruption that has appeared in almost all other
institutions. This was widely understood at the Chicago conference,
even if it is thought disobliging on occasions to mention
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000192" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000192">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:23:27"></hs_TimeCode>

on a par with security, encouraging political reform. We should not
accept that this should always go to the back burner because of the
latest political or military exigency. This also means being very
choosy about which of the warlords and power brokers in Afghanistan we
cosy up to when we try to judge the consequences. How will we approach
that? We should ensure that any negotiations with the Taliban are part
of a broader process—the right reverend Prelate the

sure as far as we can that we influence them to ensure that India is
not excluded, that China engages and continues to engage to a greater
extent, and that the complexity of the “-stans” is
grasped; while ensuring that Iran, rather than having more influence,
has as little influence as we can succeed in achieving, including among
the Persian-speakers in Afghanistan. In all this, we need to get our
tone right. I hope the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, will take this in
the spirit that I intend it, but I always welcome the very measured way
in which the Minister deals with these things; there is nothing gushing
or rose tinted in enthusiasm about untested capabilities among
Afghanistan’s forces or its leaders, the foot soldiers or the
operational skills. However, we cannot in other places, particularly in
the leadership of the Government, sound as though we are enthusiastic

Warsi:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords for their
contributions. It is important that we continue to consider
Afghanistan’s long-term future. I start by mentioning Jan and
Wodood, the two boys whom my noble friend Lord Bates referred to. I am
sure that everybody in this House would wish to acknowledge the
comments made by my noble friend and pass our condolences to the
families of those two boys and the families of so many; both of our
service men and women and of the innocent lives that have been lost
over the years of violence in Afghanistan. We owe it to our service men
and women and to the innocent civilians to stand and take stock. For
me, it was very personal when I sat in the helicopter during one
of the transfers down to Lashkar Gah. It was one of the troop
movement moments, when you sit there with young men and women kitted
out and ready to go into battle and the enormity of what they do on a
day-to-day basis hits you. You are there simply to visit and to speak,
but they are there to carry on on the front line. Our thoughts should
be consistently with
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:25:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000195" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000195">The
noble Lord, Lord Triesman, raised some very important points. As the
Minister who is responsible for Afghanistan, Pakistan and central Asia,
I am particularly focused on how the region can play an influencing and
shaping role as to the future stability within Afghanistan. The noble
Lord, quite rightly, raises challenges. Do we absolutely understand
what the climate would look like as we draw down our troops? Are the
security services there ready? I can tell him from my own experience of
what I have seen that, of course, it is not a perfect service, but more
and more we find the Afghan security forces taking over the security of
their communities and doing it more and more in a professional
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000196" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000196">Has<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:26:14"></hs_TimeCode>
progress been made on women? It is one of the issues that I constantly
bring to the table, whether in trilateral or bilateral discussions, or
indeed in discussions 
<?notus-xml column=377?>with civil society. Too many gains have been made for us to lose them.
As women in Afghanistan say to me regularly, there is no way that we
can go back to the way things were in 2001. Simple statistics show that
it cannot go back to that: 40% of children are in primary school, and a
quarter of teachers and a quarter of parliamentarians are now female.
As one lady put it to me, in the practical way that women do,
“We now have mobile phones, there is no way they can stop us
speaking to each other”. Technology has developed in ways that
mean, thankfully, that we can never go back to that dark period in
Afghanistan’s
history<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:27:02"></hs_TimeCode>. As I
have said, too many sacrifices have been made for us to allow these
gains to
slip<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:27:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000197" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000197">I
absolutely take the point made by my noble friend Lord Bates about
truth and honesty. My views on what we intended to achieve when we
first went into Afghanistan are on record: I had real concerns about
what we could achieve and how that matched up to the rhetoric that,
unfortunately, we heard from Governments across the world at that time.
It is important, especially because of the sacrifices that we have
made, to be honest with the British public about what a future
Afghanistan will look like. That is why I consistently ensure that our
language is honest, frank and tempered, and not gushing and
enthusiastic. It is of course right to praise the progress that has
been made in Afghanistan and it is important to do so to allow the
Afghan people to build the confidence that they need to be able to deal
with the situation as we leave. However, it is also important to be
realistic about what has been achieved. There have been real
achievements if you go back to 2001, and we can all be sure that
Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for terrorists who can be trained
and then attack us on our soil. It is also important for us to say that
we can realistically continue this relationship with Afghanistan. There
are many countries in the world in which we face challenging
circumstances but that does not prevent our having a strong bilateral
relationship, including on aid and trade, which allows us to continue
to engage in strategic bilateral dialogue as the basis of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:28:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000198">My
noble friend Lord Bates specifically spoke about the ulema conference.
The trilateral process is important. Noble Lords have raised the
question of whether other people should be part of that trilateral
process, but the reason why that process is effective is that we have
strong relations with Pakistan and with Afghanistan, many of those
based on long and strong historical ties. We have acted as what would
be seen as an annoying friend, to make sure that we allowed the right
space to be created for them to have these strong bilateral
discussions. The ulema conference, which was specifically discussed at
the Chequers trilateral earlier this year, has had some
difficulties.</hs_para>

aware that a member of the Pakistani group that was discussing the
ulema conference, Allama Tahir Ashrafi, made some comments that were
completely unacceptable and nearly threw things off course. My
discussions with Foreign Minister Rassoul last week when I was in
Afghanistan—or the week before; I have lost track of the
timeframe—and subsequent discussions between the Prime Minister
and President Zardari and President Karzai are moving things back 
<?notus-xml column=378?>in the right direction. If the ulema conference can be achieved, it will
be a hugely important moment. That is why the stakes are so high: if a
very clear message goes out that the use of violence cannot be
justified in Islam, it will take away some of the moral justification
that the Taliban sometimes use for their violence.</hs_para>

Parekh, pointed out that we must do this the Afghan way. Of course we
must do this the Afghan way, and that is why the peace and
reconciliation process has been Afghan-led. There are some good
examples of local decision-making, including the Loya Jirgah, which
allows Afghans to make decisions that are consistent with their own
cultural heritage. But we must also be prepared to challenge the Afghan
way when it leads to decision-making such as that in relation to the
age that young girls can be married off. We must also be prepared to
challenge some of the ultra-conservative views that are not consistent
with the obligations that Afghanistan has signed up to in international
agreements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000201" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000201">There
has been much discussion of the role of Pakistan. My noble friend Lady
Falkner, among others, raised this issue. Let us not forget that during
this conflict 2 million refugees have spent time—indeed, many
have been born and raised—in Pakistan. When you speak to the
Pakistani public or the Afghan public, they will regularly say,
“We are brothers. We have so much in common”. The
challenge is whether you can translate that into the mindset of the
decision-makers. It is important for us to support that
people-to-people contact but also to be quite robust about the fact
that Pakistan’s future stability and security are absolutely
dependent upon Afghanistan’s future stability and security. The
two are absolutely interlinked, and noble Lords made important points
about how Pakistan itself has suffered the consequences of many of
these groups that were initially being used and trained in
Afghanistan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000202" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000202">With
regard to the role of Saudi support, I can tell my noble friend Lady
Falkner that in October 2008 Saudi officials met with visiting Taliban
as part of a delegation to Mecca. The Foreign Minister, Prince Saud
al-Faisal, reported at the time that future Saudi involvement in peace
talks would be conditional on Afghan parties laying down their arms and
entering the political mainstream. Of course, there will always be
those on the fringe who have a slightly different view but I assure my
noble friend that the Saudi Government are playing a positive
role.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000203" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000203">The
noble Lord, Lord Parekh, and my noble friend Lady Falkner also asked
whether Pakistan would be an obstacle to reconciliation. As I said, it
is clear that stability and security in Afghanistan are in
Pakistan’s interests as well. My recent visit to Pakistan was
predominantly to discuss the Pakistani elections, which my noble friend
referred to, but I also had the opportunity to discuss with at least
seven of the main political parties in Pakistan their views on
Afghanistan. There has been a shift in Pakistan and it is interesting
that there is political consensus on the importance of good relations
with Afghanistan; there is also a power consensus. We all know that
there are many levers of power in Pakistan, and the Chequers summit was
important because we had the army, the ISI and the politicians 
<?notus-xml column=379?>around the table. When you get that unanimity of commitment, things will
be able to move forward in a much more productive
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000204" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000204">A
question was raised about the monitoring of the Pakistani elections. We
are supporting the EU in its monitoring mission. Where necessary, we
are negotiating on its behalf with the Pakistani authorities and
providing UK monitors for the team. We have also been discussing with
the Commonwealth Secretariat whether the Commonwealth will also send a
mission. Pakistan may well go into a having caretaker Government as
early as this weekend and it is essential that those elections are free
and fair.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000205" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000205">The
noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, asked about Iran and Afghanistan. The UK
would like to see Iran living in peace and co-operation with its
neighbours. An Iran that chooses co-operation rather than confrontation
could play a role in international affairs that would be in line with
the culture and history of the region. As neighbours, Afghanistan and
Iran share a similar culture, language and history but tragically they
also share similar problems, such as drug-smuggling and refugee flows,
and it is important that they play a constructive role. We recognise
the development of the Chabahar port in Iran, which could be important
for Afghanistan’s development, but we are also clear that any
investment should not contravene the sanctions on Iran.</hs_para>

raised the issue of SAARC. He will be aware that Afghanistan joined the
association in 2007. The UK is not a member of SAARC but an FCO
Minister attended the SAARC summit for the first time in October 2011
as a special invitee. SAARC is supporting several of the Heart of Asia
confidence-building measures that I mentioned earlier. The UK sees
SAARC as an important factor for stability in the region and welcomes
its co-ordinated work with other regional bodies on Afghanistan. The UK
values the role that SAARC plays in bringing member states together to
tackle issues of concern and to share ideas and
experience.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000207" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000207">I
agree with the noble Earl that regional economic integration is a key

regional trade and investment in south
Asia.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000208" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000208">The

noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, also raised the issue of a transit route
through Uzbekistan. The UK and Uzbekistan have a shared interest in the
stability of Afghanistan and the region. As Afghanistan’s key

to Mazar e-Sharif and supplying much needed electricity to
Kabul.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000210" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000210">The
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Bath and Wells talked about the
importance of this not being just a top-down approach, in both
Afghanistan and Pakistan. As I have already mentioned, in Pakistan
there is cross-party support and much people-to-people support. The
different power levers within Pakistan 
<?notus-xml column=380?>are also, I hope, all pulling in the right direction. Much work has been
done on the ground in Afghanistan in bringing ex-Taliban fighters into
the system and having a process of reform and reconciliation for them.
He will also agree that it is clear statements from the top that will
drive real progress.</hs_para>

Prelate spoke about the rights of women. I think I have already made
clear that this is something that I am deeply committed to and
passionate about. The sacrifices that we have made have to be worth
something, including the rights of some of the most vulnerable in
Afghanistan—the women. Our work with Afghanistan and Pakistan on
the trilateral process is and will continue to remain at the top of our
political agenda. Our support will remain as long as both countries
welcome it. We are committed to the Istanbul Process and stand ready to

will be a difficult road. Many of us from all sides of the House raised
these concerns right at the outset and continue to say that these will
not be easy decisions. We must ensure that we maintain the confidence
of the Afghan people and make it clear to them that as combat troops
withdraw, our relationship will enter a new phase. The way I have put
it is that a chapter in the book will close but the book has not come
to an end; many chapters in our relationship with Afghanistan are still
to come.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000213" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000213">The
mineral resource, which has been spoken about, is one of the
opportunities that will help and support Afghanistan as it enters a new

youth. I had the privilege of meeting a group called Afghanistan
1400—1400 based on the Persian calendar. Looking beyond the 2014
elections to what Afghanistan could look like, many of these young
people were educated overseas and have chosen to return to Afghanistan.
We hear much about people leaving Afghanistan but these young people
have chosen to return. I can sum it up in the words of one of the young

the first point, on financial systems, the Measure will widen the

our other dioceses in England. At present, payments can be made only in
accordance with the powers conferred on the commissioners by the
Diocese in Europe Measure 1980. That provides for the commissioners to
pay the costs of the bishops’ ministry and housing. The proposed
new power to make payments for the development of the mission of the
Diocese in Europe is sufficiently wide to enable the commissioners and
the council to respond to evolving needs. The Measure does not seek to
specify what level of national support the diocese might receive in the
future. If the Measure is passed, the level of any grants to be made to
the diocese will be determined as part of the usual wider discussions
on the distribution of money available from the Church
Commissioners’ funds. The first occasion on which that could

doubled in size since it came into existence in 2008. He meant size not
in a geographical sense, because it could not get any bigger than it
already is, but in the number of its congregations. So it can be
regarded, in many ways, as a success story. It now has, as has been

tribute is due to the province that we are discussing. I think that it

job, and I am glad that we are strengthening its position for the

ambiguity should be registered. I am not a lawyer, but I am a little
interested by the provision about clergy not advocating support of a

Lord Bishop of Newcastle:</Member></B> My Lords, disciplinary
proceedings for misconduct by Church of England clergy are governed by
the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003, which has been in force since l
January 2006. The 2003 Measure enables diocesan bishops to deal with
formal complaints against the clergy. Where appropriate, and subject to
the procedures provided in the Clergy Discipline Measure, the bishop
can impose penalties on a cleric who has committed misconduct. That can
include, in the most serious of cases, removal from office and
prohibition from ministry. For the few cases that cannot be resolved by
the bishop, the 2003 Measure has established a modern
tribunal system that is compliant with human rights
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:47:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000223" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000223">This
Clergy Discipline (Amendment) Measure amends the 2003 Measure in four
main respects. First, the amending Measure in Section 1 will provide an
exception to the principle that no proceedings for unbecoming conduct
can be taken in respect of the lawful political opinions or activities
of Church of England clergy. The new exception relates to racial
equality, because under this amending Measure it will be misconduct for
Church of England clergy to be members of or actively support a party
or other organisation that has been declared to be incompatible with
the teachings of the church in relation to racial equality. Because the
bishops are the guardians of the doctrine of the church, 
<?notus-xml column=383?>it will be the House of Bishops that will decide which organisations are
incompatible with the church’s teachings. However, any
declaration would not come into force if the General Synod disagreed
with the
declaration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:48:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000224" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000224">Although
this provision will affect the rights of clergy under the European
Convention on Human Rights, especially in relation to Articles 10 and
11—on freedom of expression and freedom of association—it
will do so only in a way that is compatible with the convention and
solely with regard to the fundamental area of racial equality. The
church itself has rights under the convention, in particular under
Article 9—on freedom of thought, conscience and
religion—and is entitled to ensure that its clergy adhere to its
teachings, and to discipline those that do
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000225" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000225">The
second main area of reform is in respect of appeals from the findings
of disciplinary tribunals. Under the 2003 Measure, there is an absolute
right of appeal to an appellate court, and pending any appeal a stay is
imposed on the implementation of the penalty. This means that a priest
who has no prospect of success can launch an appeal against a finding
of misconduct, hold on to office meanwhile, and frustrate and delay the
final resolution of the complaint, which is unjust for the complainant,
for the parish concerned and for the wider church. Clause 3 of the
amending Measure will require a prospective appellant to obtain leave
to appeal before making the appeal. That will not remove the
cleric’s right to appeal; it merely puts in place a kind of
sieve procedure so that hopeless appeals are stopped and dealt with
swiftly and fairly. The church, in introducing this amendment, is
taking account of the practice in secular courts where leave to appeal
is usually required before an appeal can be
pursued.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000226" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000226">The
third main area where the amending Measure makes change is with regard
to the powers of the bishop. At the moment, a bishop can remove from
office and prohibit from ministry without further proceedings a priest
or deacon who has been convicted of a criminal offence if a prison
sentence has been imposed by the criminal court. But there have been
cases where a serious crime has been committed and the priest has been
given a non-custodial sentence and, in those circumstances, the bishop
currently has no power to act unless and until a formal complaint is
made, and then only if the priest consents to the penalty imposed by
the bishop. The amending Measure will enable a bishop to remove from
office and prohibit from ministry a cleric who is convicted of certain
criminal offences regardless of whether a prison sentence has been
imposed. The amending Measure will also enable the bishop to remove
from office a cleric who has been adjudged by the Disclosure and
Barring Service to be a risk to children or vulnerable adults and who
has accordingly been entered on either of the barred lists under the
Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006. This is surely a desirable
improvement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000227" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000227">In
addition to these three important areas of reform, the amending Measure
makes a number of modest amendments to the 2003 Measure which are
essentially of a technical nature. For example, paragraph 5 of the
schedule makes amendments with regard to the appointment of members of
a disciplinary tribunal and of the two provincial appellate
courts.</hs_para>

necessarily brief outline of the amending Measure will show that,
beneath the rather technical complexity of it all, it will improve the
church’s disciplinary procedures, which are indeed already
regarded as working well. The Measure rightly received
overwhelming support in the General Synod—212 votes in favour,
with just two votes against and one recorded abstention—and I
commend it to the

that I wish to add to what the right reverend Prelate has said,
although there is of course more meat in this Measure than in the
other. Its purpose is to amend the existing Measure of 2003. I draw
attention in this case to the care with which these Measures have been
prepared by the legislative committee of the Synod and presented to the
Ecclesiastical Committee of Parliament. That was especially so in this
case, where the comments and explanations submitted to the
Ecclesiastical Committee extend from page 15 to page 35 of its report
on the Measure and are exceptionally thorough. I suspect that the
committee and the House generally should be very grateful to the
legislative committee for taking so much
trouble<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:54:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000230" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000230">As
the right reverend Prelate has pointed out, the Measure deals with four
areas which are set out on page 15 of the report. Of these, the one
which was potentially the most controversial was Clause 1, which has
already been touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Judd,
relating to misconduct. There were a number of
questions on that, at page 83 of the report, starting with a question
from Sir Peter Bottomley—question 10—and then a question
from the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and finally a question from the noble
Lord, Lord Laming. I hope that the noble Lord will agree that all those
questions were adequately answered by the right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of
Guildford<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:55:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000231" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0001.htm#13031438000231">The
other area of importance was the abolition of the automatic right of
appeal; now there needs to be leave to appeal which would come before a
court of two. That question was dealt with by Charles George
QC, the Dean of the Arches, who made the interesting point that the
number of appeals has been extremely small; but he also said that, if
minded to refuse leave to appeal, he would always
give reasons. Once again, the Ecclesiastical Committee had little
difficulty in finding this Measure expedient, so I support the

thing about which the church is deeply concerned is racism. The
provision to which I am referring makes particular reference to this.
It is clear that the church does not wish anyone speaking in its name
to endorse the existence of a political party which is regarded by the
church as incompatible in its manifesto and policies with its
teachings. The provision goes into the very difficult area of
distinguishing between what a party stands for, and what its policies
and manifesto are, and any particular policy that may come from that
background with which it might be quite possible in isolation, taken
away from that party’s expression of it, to be strongly in
favour. The provision tries to deal with whether a clergy man or woman
who was speaking in favour of a policy—it might be to do with
housing, for example—would be allowed to speak about their
attitude towards that particular proposal as long as they were not
endorsing the
party.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:01:06"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

it strikes me that there is a good deal of ambiguity about that. I do
not see how you can have an absolute dividing line. If a political
party was getting a great deal of publicity for a particular aspect of
its policy and a clergy person was then, understandably, to say,
“This policy is absolutely in line with Christian teaching and
something that we should take very seriously”, that will be
interpreted by an awful lot of people as an endorsement of the
political party. I do not for a moment suggest that we need to sort
that out further at this stage, but it is important to draw attention
to the fact that there will be ambiguity there which will need a great
deal of firm interpretation by the church. I see the possibility of

things they were saying about a particular policy could be interpreted
as support for the party. I just say that that is an area of ambiguity

in the more reflective atmosphere of your Lordships’ House, I
hope we can discuss the extent of those demographic challenges and what
if anything can be done about them. It has proved to be an issue that
has been hard to raise in the past, in part because it is an extremely
sensitive and personal matter, in part because past political efforts
have exploded in the face of individuals—Keith Joseph’s
political career was effectively ended by a single speech in
Birmingham—and in part because of certain false alarms, such as
that of Thomas Malthus and, more recently, Paul Ehrlich’s 1968
book, <I>The Population
Bomb</I>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000248" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000248">What
is the position now? The annual growth in the world’s population
is about 1.1% per annum. That may seem a pretty small percentage, but
in absolute terms it means that the world population is increasing by
more than 70 million a year. That is more than 200,000 every day of the
year. In the hour and a half that this debate is supposed to last, the
world’s population will have increased by 13,000 people.
“But”, I hear people ask, “is this rate not
projected to slow down?”. Yes, it is a bit. Median projections
suggest that by 2050 the world’s population will be increasing
by only 40 million per annum, or 7,000 more people during a

the increase, whether it is 70 million or 40 million, I
invite the House to consider what that will mean for the need for
housing, health, education, employment and resource use. Either way,
the world’s population is projected to increase from 7 billion
today to 9.2 billion in 2050. Thomas Malthus was worried about food
shortage. He overlooked an equally important precious resource: water.
The UN’s best estimates are that the planet can provide water
for a maximum of 9.5 billion people so, by 2050, we shall be at that
limit. That figure is based on the assumption that the people are where
the water is—probably a false
assumption<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:08:00"></hs_TimeCode>. We

that litany of despair, what can be done? First, we must avoid seeing

failed or failing states. The single most important step to help slow
the population explosion is to ensure that every woman has control over
her own fertility. For a whole host of personal reasons, most women
seek to limit the number of children they have. It would be helpful if,

brings me to a difficult issue, about which I have given my noble
friend’s office advance warning. After this debate appeared on
the Order Paper, I was made aware of a group of Catholics calling
themselves Catholics for Choice—I am not a Catholic, by the
way—who wanted to raise the position of the Vatican at the
United Nations. In short, they ask, “Is it a religion or is it a
state?” They point out that no other religion has a comparable
position in world affairs, and if it is a state, the briefing they have
sent me points out that it is an unusual one. It has only 594
residents, all of whom are citizens of other countries. Of those 594,
only 100 are women and it is estimated that there are no
more than 10 children in residence at any given time.</hs_para>

briefing that the group sent me went on to outline how the Vatican
switches between these roles. Thus, at last week’s
Women’s Conference at the UN in New York, the Catholic Church
claimed observer status because it was a religion but reserved the
right to participate in UN discussions because it was a state under the
title of the Holy See. Given the Catholic Church’s deep-seated
hostility to giving women control over their fertility, this issue is

the rest of my remarks, I want to turn to the no less challenging
position of the United Kingdom. The population of the UK is now over 63
million people. The 2011 census revealed that in the 10-year period
2001-11, the population of England and Wales increased by 3.7 million
people, an increase of 7.1%, which is the fastest rate of growth since
the first census in 1801. The ONS mid-range projections suggest that
the UK’s population will continue to increase and will reach
70 million by 2027—another 7 million people. What do
7 million people look like? The city of Manchester has 500,000 people
in it, so think of 14 Manchesters. If you want to take the larger
Manchester conurbation, including Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham,
Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan, which
together have a population of more than 2 million, then
think of three of these. Maybe we are going to have to build three
Greater Manchesters by
2027<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:12:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000254" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000254">There
is a further complication. It is not just that England is already the
sixth most densely populated country in the world—after
Bangladesh, Taiwan, South Korea, Lebanon and Rwanda—but that the
population is not spread evenly across the country. The bulk of the
population increase will surely take place in the south-east, where we
will probably have to build two out of those three Greater
Manchesters</hs_para>

is to be done? “Stop immigration” is a popular cry. That
would make some difference but perhaps not as much as one might think.
The Migration Observatory at Oxford University has pointed out that
with 100,000 migrants per annum—the Government’s
target—the population would reach 70 million in 2035, but with
zero migration it would be 66 million—a difference of 4 million.
On the other hand, those who say, “Unless 
<?notus-xml column=389?>we have more young people we cannot afford to look after our existing
old people”, have forgotten the implications of compound
interest. We would be engaging in, to quote Sir David Attenborough, a
gigantic population Ponzi scheme. We have to recognise that at some
point we have to achieve a stable, balanced population of this country.
There will be considerable strains during the transition phase, but at
some point someone somewhere must be brave enough to state this fact
and to withstand the misinterpretation, misconstruction, misreporting
and misquotation that will surely follow. To inform the general public
in a balanced, unsensational way, we need an authoritative body to
undertake the necessary research and writing. Population affects
every government department—think of the impact of
building three Greater Manchesters on every aspect of
government—yet population is the responsibility of none. A
useful first step in analysing this exceptionally complex problem could
be to create a new Minister, or add to the duties of an existing
interdepartmental one, to take responsibility for this

are talking about the impact of demographic trends. Within the UK, the
population as of 2010 is 62.3 million, expected to rise to 67.2 million
in 2020 and 73.2 by 2035. These predictions cannot always be relied
upon, but by and large there is reason to believe that the margin of
error will not be very large. It is also expected that the median age
will rise from 39.7 today to 39.9 in 2020 and 42.2 in 2035. Today
people over 75 constitute 4.9% of the population; by 2035
that is likely to rise to 8.9%, almost double. Those who are
85 or over constitute 1.4% of the population, and that is
likely to rise to 3.5% by 2035. The working age of 30 to 60
years is also likely to rise, but rather slowly, from 24.8 currently to
26.7 in 2035.</hs_para>

In Italy, again, there is a likely increase between now and 2035 of 8%.
The only major country—other than Poland, Lithuania and
others—that 
<?notus-xml column=390?>is a striking exception is Germany, where the population is likely to

rises, that has an impact in terms of who is falling and who is rising.
The number of Christians, for example, has declined between 2001 and
2011 by 13%. The number of those with no religious affiliations has
increased by 10% during the same 10-year period and there is reason to

dramatically and those with no affiliation will have risen.</hs_para>

be an increase in qualifications at level 4 and above, so more and more
of our people are going to acquire higher qualifications. Rather
surprisingly, the report says that childlessness is on the increase,
and the number of children per family is falling. However, it is
falling unevenly: in white communities, the size of the family is much
smaller—1.5 or 1.6 children, sometimes even less—while
among the ethnic minorities the families are larger, and their

Recently, when I was privileged to chair one of the Ditchely Park

Japanese man or woman will live in Japan. This is because Japan has not
encouraged immigration and the population is static. The Japanese have
very few children, and its population is ageing more rapidly than that

political parties in this country and in other advanced economies could
not survive without the older volunteers who maintain them,
particularly before elections. We know that in Africa without the older
population many more children would grow up without any adult care,
supervision or help because of the ravages of AIDS. We know that in
many countries, you still do not talk about a retirement age but go on

come to terms with the fact that the travelling public will rapidly
become much older than they are now. On education, with adequate IT or

We must realise that older people can learn, retrain and adapt as our
retirement ages increase, and can continue to work much later in life.
We must design our buildings and places of work accordingly. There must
be much more flexible working and cleverly designed buildings and

have government support to bring things together so that we are not
separating healthcare, social care and housing in the way that has
happened up until now. It is only with a co-ordinated approach,

specific point about the UK is that there is a serious problem with the
demographic balance of our population. As the noble Baroness, Lady
Greengross, has said, we should welcome longevity. However, it will
impose a huge cost on our society. Some estimates are that the cost is
as great in terms of its fiscal weight as the cost of the fiscal
consolidation that we are currently undergoing, if you take into

cost will, if we are not careful, eat into our nation’s capacity

change; and inequality, in order to raise the life chances of children
being brought up in disadvantaged circumstances. If we do not tackle

the report begins by drawing a route map. I will not try to better its

points<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:41:24"></hs_TimeCode>. First,
of course, this issue requires not simply cross-party consensus but a
cross-generational consensus. That means listening to the young and
listening to the old, and involving them all in the development of new
policies and provision. We should not be doing things for or on behalf
of the ageing, but with and alongside
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000290" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000290">The
issue of fairness between generations is key, as is the issue of
responding to disparity between classes. It is an old story that, as
one takes the Jubilee Line eastwards from Westminster station, life
expectancy drops a year as each station passes. We have to be careful,
therefore, not to rank people simply by their numerical age, given that
needs, whether for social or medical care, fall for almost everyone in
the last six months of their life, virtually regardless of their age of
death. We must not allow inequalities present during working lives to
continue into pensioner poverty. We need to consider the needs of those
who will die younger than average, just as much as the needs of those
who will head towards their
century.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000291" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000291">We
also need a range of responses, encouraging self-help via healthy
lifestyles, savings, investment and insurance, as well as delivering
socially the responses we need. As was mentioned, that includes
building more homes, social and medical care, and other support
systems. With regard to self-help, we need to encourage insurance and
investment, but this means rebuilding trust in the industry, as
mentioned in the Filkin report. The Government rejected amendments that
we tabled both to the Financial Services Bill and to the Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Bill to require those who hold and manage money on
behalf of others to have a fiduciary duty towards those investors or
beneficiaries. Until that is law, people will be reluctant to take on
complicated financial products through lack of confidence. The
Government also defeated our attempt to require the financial industry
to adopt a code of conduct. We hope they will think again about
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000292" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000292">The
situation is much the same with letting, managing and estate agents,
who might have an important role in helping older people downsize or
move. However, without robust regulation of these, we risk another era
of mis-selling or of poor service to this group. Only last week the
Government resisted my amendments on requiring an ombudsman for some of
these agents, although I am pleased to say that they were defeated.
Will the Minister indicate whether they are now willing to accept that
requirement? It would be an important safeguard if older people are to
downsize and to be able to move to more suitable
accommodation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000293" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000293">I
will turn to another aspect of self-help: keeping healthy and fit. We
know that good diet, exercise and keeping to moderate drinking is part
of this. Will the Government explain, which they did not quite do this
morning, why, when every medical body considers that minimum unit
pricing for alcohol is key to reducing 
<?notus-xml column=396?>harmful consumption, they are going to listen to the drinks industry
instead and bow to its demands to be allowed to peddle cheap
booze?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000294" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000294">When
I hear the drinks industry claim that it is concerned with the older
and the poor who have fewer pounds in their pocket, I simply rage.
Older people are very vulnerable to alcohol misuse, especially if they
are coping with loneliness, depression or bereavement. To pretend it
helps them by giving them access to cheap units of alcohol is
irresponsible in the extreme. Therefore, in the development of policies
to assist our ageing population, can the Minister assure us that the
health and well-being of the nation will be put ahead of the
industries’ interests, be that the banking industry or the
brewers?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000295" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000295">This
is not just a matter for the individuals concerned. Society and the
Government have a key role to play. Charities want to help but are
facing severe financial constraints and find already that the demands

Britons, but perhaps especially the black and ethnic minority groups,
and also that we need more devolution. He would probably suggest that
we reinvigorate community development, especially given the decline of
religious activity, the more varied family formations and the increase
in family break-up. He would probably urge us to think about better use

estimate is that global population will exceed 9 billion by 2050, and
10 billion by 2100. Most of the global population growth
will take place in sub-Saharan Africa, and we know that there are
already pressures on the availability of water in those areas. In these
hotspots, population issues can place great strains on government

world’s poorest countries. We do not want to stop there. Our
vision is of a developing world where all women have choice over the

the Holy See; we have different views from the Holy See, which has
official observer status at the UN. It makes its position on
contraception very clear, and we make ours very clear, as do other UN

women’s control over their fertility is a cornerstone
of development. We know that fertility tends to decline as
development expands, and development has often been described as the
best form of
contraception.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000308" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000308">On

the next decade or so. The south-east of the country already has the
largest population of any English region, at almost 9 million people.
Part of this rise is driven by employment, jobs and growth. This
Government have already started trying to rebalance growth across the
country. We have developed enterprise zones, local enterprise
partnerships and a regional growth fund to do just this, and we are
backing these mechanisms with money. The regional growth fund has
allocated £2.4 billion to more than 360 projects and programmes
already, and last October we announced £25 million of funding
for LEPs to bolster core capacity funding. The 24 enterprise zones have
already secured around £160 million in private investment and
created 1,700 jobs, and this Government are continuing to
work with them to fully realise their potential by 2015. This
Government are committed to allowing every area the opportunity for

of the focus of this debate is on real and perceived problems that can

unemployment, supporting older people in society, managing pressures on
resources and the environment. All Governments need to focus on these
issues and plan appropriately across the full range of policies and
services. This covers, for example, savings and pensions provision, as
well as health services and education. However, we should not lose
sight of the advantages of demographic change. Younger populations
offer the opportunity of a more productive workforce and hence can
boost economic growth. Economic growth in turn offers the opportunity
to invest in environmental protection measures. Older populations can
provide wisdom and experience, which is often unrecognised and untapped

I would like to make a Statement about the future of apprenticeships.
Apprenticeships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:58:42"></hs_TimeCode>
are back. Having existed in this country for more than six centuries,
apprenticeships have through the ages provided the vehicle for skills
and trades to be handed down the generations. At their best, they are
an engine for social mobility and for giving employers and apprentices
alike the skills they need to prosper. While apprenticeships declined
in the last century, in this century they have recovered and grown in
number, so that 500,000 started last year, compared with the 350,000
who started at university. They have grown in stature, becoming a
career choice in their own
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000315" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000315">It is
perhaps not surprising that research shows that, on average, a higher
apprenticeship can raise your lifetime earnings by £150,000,
about the same as a degree. While this growth in number is very welcome
and should be welcomed by all sides of this House, I think all agree
that we must continue to increase their quality and make them relevant
to today’s

will not delay progress where we can act now. Steps have been taken
already to require every apprenticeship to be a real job and to mandate
that in most cases an apprenticeship lasts a minimum of a year. Today
we are announcing how we will further strengthen the provision of
English and maths within apprenticeships. The Employer Ownership of
Skills pilot is putting power in the hands of employers to design
qualifications and deliver apprenticeships in line with
employers’ needs. We are extending apprenticeships to higher
level skills and into the professions like insurance, accountancy and
the law. But we need to go further.</hs_para>

in the driving seat, giving them more control over qualification
design, training delivery and funding. It called for quality and
standards to be raised across the programme and for a focus on

Richard report. The report, and the response, that I am placing in the
Library of the House, provide a programme of reform that will be
challenging for all involved in apprenticeships—providers,

absolutely right. Rigour and responsiveness will be our guiding
principles. The Richard reforms build on the best of this historic
programme, but will once again make it attuned to the needs of the
modern workplace. We agree specifically that apprenticeships should be
targeted at those in new jobs or roles to train for that role and as a
springboard for their future careers, that employers should be at the
centre of designing apprenticeship standards and qualifications, that
assessment should be largely at the end, be more independent, involve
employers, and be graded.</hs_para>

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
repeating the Statement. However, we cannot help feeling that this is
another lost opportunity on the Government’s part. On one level,
we do not challenge their commitment to apprenticeships as they have
certainly tried to drive up the number. However, there is a danger in
going for volume without ensuring that the quality is sustained, as was
mentioned in the Richard report. One of the things the
Government are doing, which we welcome, is making sure that
apprenticeships are real jobs lasting for a minimum of one year. That
has not been happening over the past few years and some young people
have been exploited and have not gained a proper qualification, so that
step is a welcome improvement. However, is it enough in the current
situation of very high youth unemployment, which must concern
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:04:27"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000322" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000322">I
welcome another matter that the Government have addressed: namely, that
the retraining of older employees will not be badged as apprenticeships
but will be proper retraining, as it should have been. However, we are
concerned that fewer than 10% of employers in this country employ
apprentices. That is not an easy problem to solve but it requires
determined, imaginative action from the Government, which we do not
believe they have shown in their response to the Richard review. Yet
again, they have ducked the Select Committee’s recommendation
that every government procurement contract should contain a commitment
to
apprenticeships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:05:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000323" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000323">This
week is National Apprenticeship Week, which we initiated when in
government. It is a worthwhile event which celebrates the importance of
apprenticeships. When I attended the Crossrail apprenticeship awards
ceremony, I could not help reflecting that its 400 apprenticeships came
about because the previous Labour Government had insisted that they had
to be an inherent part of its contract. That applied not only to
Crossrail but to the Olympics, where we managed to establish 300
apprenticeships. I have yet to receive a satisfactory response from the
coalition Government on why they will not make apprenticeships a
requirement of public procurement contracts. If they want to send a
signal 
<?notus-xml column=402?>about their commitment to employers, surely they should insist that
apprenticeships are part of any public
contract.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000324" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000324">There
are also lost opportunities in relation to the Richard report. He wants
his recommendations to be taken as a whole rather than as a
“pick and mix”, which the Government have tended to do. I
know that they say they will come back to it, but the real concern is
that time is marching on and the need is there now. For instance, on
supporting small businesses, we know what some of the successful
measures are in terms of SMEs. We know that getting them together to be
part of group training associations or hubs that encourage small
businesses to take on apprentices works. Why have we still not got
apprenticeship schemes in every school, college and university? If you
want to signal that apprentices are a necessary part of their
environments and that there are real opportunities, getting those
organisations to take on apprentices would be a first-rate
example<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:07:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

response the Minister will tell us exactly how the Government will
increase the pathetically small number of employers who take on
apprentices. The record of FTSE 100 companies is not much
better—only about one-third of them do so. This remains a lost
opportunity and the Government are not making real and determined
efforts to ensure that an apprenticeship will be available for all
those young people who want one.</hs_para>

it is to get into Oxford or Cambridge. We remain in that situation
because, first, we are not providing an example through government

apprenticeships—I have said that there are problems about their
quality—but that is not enough if one looks at the participation
rate of companies. I still go around talking to employers who seem to
have little or no idea that they could, to their benefit, take on
apprentices. The Government need to do a lot more and ensure that every
school has links to the business community. They need to ensure that

being propelled towards the academic path. There is nothing wrong with
that, except that it is not suitable for them all. The guidance that is
given in schools and colleges is still nowhere near good enough. If you
want to improve 
<?notus-xml column=403?>that situation, you have to make sure that there are links to the
business community. It would not harm primary as well as secondary
schools to do that. When young people see apprentices coming back to
the school, saying what a great experience an apprenticeship is and how
it has changed their lives—how they can earn while they
learn—it is one of the most powerful messages that they can get

nothing new—in fact, the National Apprenticeship

part of the Government is needed. They should give out a very positive
signal that if you want a government contract, you have to commit
yourself to taking on a number of apprentices. If the HS2 goes
ahead—I hope that it does—one would need only one
apprentice for every £1 million of investment to
generate some 33,000 apprenticeships. That is a sobering
thought, but it will not happen unless it is made an absolute
requirement. There could be so much benefit. If one considers what

of youth unemployment, which is mercifully coming down, although not
fast enough. Of course, we have a revitalised apprenticeship programme,
which, alongside an employability skills programme, will help young
people to take up opportunities. We also have the traineeship programme
in place, and that, too, will be of assistance to young people in
getting back into employment. National Apprenticeship Week is certainly
a great success. It is raising the profile of apprenticeships this week
and has gone from strength to strength. It was interesting to see that
the apprentice of the year was a young woman engineer at British

BAE, which might be located in north-east Wales but with a good

return to my regular song on this. What are we doing to ensure that
people who cannot pass the English and maths assessment get through? I
mean those who have dyslexia and dyscalculia, which are the two biggest
things—a rough estimate is that 13% of the population are in
those two spectrums. An English and maths qualification can cause a
problem for that group for whom working with their hands would be the
natural way forward. As night follows day, if someone does not want to
be qualified for a white-collar job, he should be doing something

wide swathes of the profession, entry is virtually graduate-only. Also,
can the Minister give us some idea of the timescale and whether any

that over the years have become graduate-only. We in no way wish to
downplay the value of degrees, but an important step in raising the
profile and breadth of apprenticeships will be taken if they can be
linked to the status and standing that these sorts of professions have.
It is definitely something that we are encouraging. We have not set any
targets yet, and again I come back to the fact that this is a
consultation period. However, we have been in discussions with the
different professional areas. At the moment we have a total of 27
projects and two trailblazers, which will provide more than 25,000
higher apprenticeship places over the next three years. Those higher
apprenticeships are going to be available in the very areas we are

of course, of the tourist industry, to which it makes a great
contribution. However, it is much more important than that, too: it

the fact that we have not exhausted the time. This is a really key
issue. I apologise if I sounded negative. I do not want to be negative
but just want to get the Government to recognise the size and scale of
the problem. Even though the Minister says that youth unemployment is
coming down, as I am sure she knows, in some parts of the country it is
not and the levels are very high, so I want to try to inject a sense of
urgency into the
situation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000358" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000358">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:31:21"></hs_TimeCode>

still being only a very small number of businesses participating in
apprenticeships. What positive steps are the Government going to take?
For instance, addressing the very worthwhile point made by the noble
Lord, Lord Cormack, about heritage craft skills, the difficulty with
those small businesses—sometimes it is just one person on their
own or a small group—is, first, that they face what they see as
an administrative burden and, secondly, that they worry about whether
they can carry an apprentice and create that job. That is why, again,
they need to be encouraged to create their own little hubs and group
training associations, where some of that administrative burden can be
shared.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031438000359" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130314-0002.htm#13031438000359">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:32:21"></hs_TimeCode>

first attempt we are driving up volume rather than quality as well,
although that is being addressed, which I welcome. Interestingly, one
my noble friend Lord Grocott’s point, I met a young apprentice
accountant as part of the Crossrail scheme. When we talk about
apprenticeships, we seem to forget that what they involve is much more
wide-ranging than manual skills: there are over 200 apprenticeship
frameworks. We have gone well beyond what used to be regarded as the
traditional route. In relation to the higher

unemployment. We all know that it is a disastrous start for many young

their compulsory education. The noble Lord mentioned getting employers
more involved. There is now, for instance, a £1,500 start-up to

extraordinarily well established apprenticeship programmes, and the
Government are in constant dialogue with them to try to ensure that
best practice can be passed on and that it is made as easy as possible
for employers to take on apprenticeships. One of our other challenges
is to reduce the bureaucracy so that there are no unnecessary
disincentives to employers taking on apprenticeships. Of course, more
work needs to be done, and we very much look forward to the results of

states acknowledged that much remained to be done to develop police and
criminal justice capabilities in the Region. The Counter Terrorism
Co-ordinator, supported by the UK, stressed the importance of work to
counter extremist narratives and the need to strengthen aviation
security. The UK argued that terrorist groups in the region had
benefited from ransom payments and restated the long-held position of
the UK Government not to pay ransoms or grant other substantive
concessions to hostage takers. The UK also noted that data sharing, in
particular passenger name records, was vital for detecting individuals
travelling to conflict zones. Finally, the UK highlighted the
importance of sending a clear signal that terrorist attacks on EU soil
would not be tolerated. If there was compelling evidence linking the
military wing of Hezbollah to the Bourgas attack, the UK said that the
EU had a responsibility to consider that evidence and take
action.</hs_para>
