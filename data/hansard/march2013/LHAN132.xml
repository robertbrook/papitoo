Britain, the United States and Germany have given generously to aid
agencies to help alleviate the plight of more than 1 million Syrian
refugees who have fled to neighbouring nations, according to the United
Nations a very large part of the more than $1 billion
pledged by 32 countries has not yet been delivered? Does she agree that
it is time for those who have promised funding to act and that, as the

Northover:</Member></B> My noble friend is right. States made very
generous pledges in Kuwait earlier this year to the UN appeals for
Syria and the region. However, not all pledges have yet been translated
into actual contributions. Given the scale of the
challenge— 4 million people are in need, of whom 2
million have been forced to leave their homes—that is extremely
worrying. We call on donors to expedite the transfer of funds without
delay and are actively encouraging
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:53:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000014"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wright of Richmond" PimsId="4681" UID="13032658000709" xid="1502" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000709">Lord
Wright of Richmond:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister accept
that providing lethal weapons, as the Government appear to want, to the

will know that there are already huge dangers of instability in the
region and that any action, or inaction, can promote further
instability. We have no current plans to send arms to any groups in
Syria, but, as again he will know well, others are arming groups in
Syria. As the noble Lord will also know, nothing is off the table, but
we are doing our very best to try to bring about a diplomatic
resolution to that, which I am sure everybody would welcome. In the
mean time, DfID’s key aim is to assist in relieving the

there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000016"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:54:04"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Collins of Highbury" PimsId="5919" UID="13032658000711" xid="2127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000711">Lord
Collins of Highbury:</Member></B> My Lords, not only is the issue one
of current spending but the situation is deteriorating speedily.
Funding so far has been allocated up to 30 June. Obviously aid agencies
need to plan for the future as well. It is important that the
Government not only deal with current need but look at future need.
Another issue is that the clear majority of refugees in Jordan are
women, children and the elderly. In representations to the European
Union and the United States, will the Minister highlight the plight of
female refugees and the support they will be given to cover basic

£1.5 billion that was pledged in Kuwait will last only until
June and only about 20% of that so far has been forthcoming. There is a
major 
<?notus-xml column=957?>challenge there. We welcome the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal
that was launched in the United Kingdom on 20 March. The United Kingdom
is third at the moment in its contribution in this regard and we are

them in particular in the countries around Syria. We are well aware

would be done to document these abuses so that the perpetrators might

President Hollande of France, can I press my noble friend to assure us

that we will concentrate on humanitarian

action and inaction. We take very seriously the points that he makes. I
would point out that the United Kingdom has already pledged almost
£140 million in humanitarian relief. It has committed £22
million in terms of non-leasable equipment and practical support for
the Syrian opposition and civil society. That is separate from our

with its obligations under national and international law, and that
applies to autonomous weapon systems. However, although technological
advances are likely to increase the level of automation in some
systems, just as in non-military equipment, such as cars, the MoD

aircraft systems are likely to form part of the future force mix, as
they may offer advantages in endurance and range. However, the dynamic
complexity of fighter-versus-fighter-type missions does not favour
remote control. Therefore, a wholly unmanned force is unlikely to be
achievable or desirable in future. Studies suggest a likely combat air
force mix of two-thirds manned and one-third remotely piloted in around
the 2030 timeframe.</hs_para>

after a weapon system is declared lawful, its use will still be subject
to stringent rules of engagement governing its employment in the

reacts to a limited number of external stimuli in the same way each
time, just as automatic transmission changes gears when a car gets to a
certain speed. Fully autonomous systems rely on a certain level of
artificial intelligence for making high-level decisions from a very
complex environmental input,

registered at an address in Scotland, either because they are resident
there or because they have a service declaration for such an address. I
understand that the Ministry of Defence do an annual advertisement of
the service declaration, but I can assure your Lordships’ House

the Francis report. The Statement is as
follows:</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000076">“With
permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on the
Government’s response to the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation
Trust Public Inquiry. I congratulate my right honourable friend 
<?notus-xml column=966?>and predecessor for setting up the public inquiry, and for the many
changes that he made foreseeing its likely recommendations. I would
also like to pay tribute to Robert Francis QC for his work in producing
a seminal report which I believe will mark a turning point in the
history of the
NHS.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000077">Many
terrible things happened at Mid Staffs in what has rightly been
described as the NHS’s darkest hour. Both the current and former
Prime Minister have apologised, but when people have suffered on this
scale, and died unnecessarily, our greatest responsibility lies not in
our words but in our actions—actions that must ensure the NHS is
what every health professional and patient wants: a service that is
true to the NHS values, that puts patients first and treats people with
dignity, respect and
compassion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000078">The
Government accept the essence of the inquiry’s recommendations
and we shall respond to them in full in due course. However, given the
urgency of the need for change, I am today announcing the key elements
of our response so that we can proceed to implementation as quickly as
possible. I have divided our response into five areas: preventing
problems arising by putting the needs of patients first; detecting
problems early; taking action promptly; ensuring robust accountability;
and leadership. Let me take each in
turn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000079">To
prevent problems arising in the first place, we need to embed a culture
of zero harm and compassionate care throughout our NHS, a culture in
which the needs of patients are central, whatever the pressures of a
busy, modern health service. As Robert Francis said, ‘The system
as a whole failed in its most essential duty: to protect patients from
unacceptable risks of harm and from unacceptable, and in some cases
inhumane, treatment that should never be tolerated in any
hospital’.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000080">At
the heart of this problem, the current definitions of success for
hospitals fail to prioritise the needs of patients. Too often, the
focus has been on compliance with regulation rather than on what those
regulations aim to achieve. Furthermore, the way that hospitals are
inspected is fundamentally flawed, with the same generalist inspectors
looking at slimming clinics, care homes and major teaching
hospitals—sometimes in the same month. So we will set up a new
regulatory model under a strong, independent chief inspector of
hospitals, working for the CQC. Inspections will move to a new
specialist model based on rigorous and challenging peer review.
Assessments will include judgments about hospitals’ overall
performance, including whether patients are listened to and treated
with dignity and respect, the safety of services, responsiveness,
clinical standards and
governance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000081">The
Nuffield Trust has reported on the feasibility of assessments and
Ofsted-style ratings, and I am very grateful for its thorough work. I
agree with its conclusion that there is a serious gap in the provision
of clear, comprehensive and trusted information on the quality of care.
So in order to expose failure, recognise excellence and incentivise
improvement, the chief inspector will produce a single aggregated
rating for every NHS trust. Because the patient experience will be
central to the inspection, it will not be possible for
hospitals to get a good inspection result without the highest standards
of patient care.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=967?><hs_para UID="13032658000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000082">However, the Nuffield
rightly says that in organisations as large and complex as hospitals, a
single rating on its own would be misleading, so the chief inspector
will also assess hospital performance at speciality or department
level. This will mean that cancer patients will be told of the quality
of cancer services, and prospective mothers the quality of maternity
services. We will also introduce a chief inspector of social care and
look into the merits of a chief inspector of primary care in order to
ensure that the same rigour is applied across the health and care
system.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032658000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000083">We
must also build a culture of zero harm throughout the NHS. This does
not mean that there will never be mistakes, just as a safety-first
culture in the airline industry does not mean that there are no plane
crashes, but it does mean an attitude to harm which treats it as
totally unacceptable and takes enormous trouble to learn from mistakes.
We await the report on how to achieve this in the NHS from Professor
Don
Berwick.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000084">Zero
harm means listening to and acting on complaints, so I will ask the

that one of the central complaints of nurses is that they are required
to do too much paperwork and thus spend less time with patients, I have
asked the NHS Confederation to review how we can reduce the
bureaucratic burden on front-line staff and NHS providers by a third. I
will also be requiring the new Health and Social Care Information
Centre to use its statutory powers to eliminate duplication and reduce
bureaucratic
burdens.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000086">Secondly,
we must have a clear picture of what is happening within the NHS and
social care system so that, where problems exist, they are detected
more quickly. As Francis recognised, the disjointed system of
regulation and inspection smothered the NHS, collecting too much
information but producing too little intelligence. We will therefore
introduce a new statutory duty of candour for providers to ensure that
honesty and transparency are the norm in every organisation, and the
new chief inspector of hospitals will be the nation’s
whistleblower in
chief.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000087">To
ensure that there is no conflict in that role, the CQC will no longer
be responsible for putting right any problems identified in hospitals.
Its enforcement powers will be delegated to Monitor and the NHS Trust
Development Authority, which it will be able to ask to act when
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000088">We
know that publishing survival results improves standards, as has been
shown in heart surgery. So, I am very pleased that we will be doing the

surgery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:29:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000089">The
third part of our response is to ensure that any concerns are followed
by swift action. The problem with Mid Staffs was not that the problems
were unknown; it was that nothing was done. The Francis report sets out
a timeline of around 50 warning signs between 2001 and 2009. Ministers
and managers in the wider system failed to act on these warnings. Some
were not aware of them; others dodged responsibility. This 
<?notus-xml column=968?>must change. No hospital will be rated as good or outstanding if
fundamental standards are breached. Trusts will be given a strictly
limited period of time to rectify any such breaches. If they fail to do
this, they will be put into a failure regime which could ultimately
lead to special administration and the automatic suspension of the
board<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:30:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000090">The
fourth part of our response concerns accountability for wrongdoers. It
is important to say that what went wrong at Mid Staffs was not typical
of our NHS and that the vast majority of doctors and nurses give
excellent care day in, day out. We must make sure that the system does
not crush the innate sense of decency and compassion that drives people
to give their lives to the NHS. Francis said that primary
responsibility for what went wrong at Mid Staffs lies with the board.
So, we will look at new legal sanctions at a corporate level for
organisations that wilfully generate misleading information or withhold
information that they are required to provide. We will also consult on
a barring scheme to prevent managers found guilty of gross misconduct
finding a job in another part of the system. In addition, we intend to
change the practices around severance payments, which have caused great
public disquiet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:31:50"></hs_TimeCode>.
In addition, the General Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery
Council and the other professional regulators have been asked to
tighten their procedures for breaches of professional standards. I will
wait to hear how they intend to do this, and for Don Berwick’s
conclusions on zero harm before deciding whether it is necessary to
take further action. The chief inspector will also ensure that
hospitals are meeting their existing legal obligations to ensure that
unsuitable healthcare support workers are
barred<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:32:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000091">The
final part of our response will be to ensure that NHS staff are
properly led and motivated. As Francis

I am announcing some important changes in training for nurses. I want
NHS-funded student nurses to spend up to a year working on the front
line as support workers or healthcare assistants, as a prerequisite for
receiving funding for their degree. This will ensure that people who
become nurses have the right values and understand their role.
Healthcare support workers and adult social care workers will now have
a code of conduct and minimum training standards, both of which
are being published today. I will also ask the chief inspector to
ensure that hospitals are properly recruiting, training and supporting
healthcare assistants, drawing on the recommendations being produced by
Camilla Cavendish. The Department of Health will learn from the
criticisms of its own role by becoming the first department where every

Staffs to be not a byword for failure but a catalyst for change: to
create an NHS where everyone can be

becomes common practice; and where the way in which a person is made to

NHS is now 65 years old and if it is to be ready for the challenges of
the future it has to learn from what happened at Mid Staffordshire. The
NHS was founded on compassion; Mid Staffordshire was a betrayal of all
it stands for and, rightly, apologies have been made. Now, however, it
is time to act and to make this a moment of change. Robert Francis
delivered 290 careful recommendations after a three-year
public inquiry. The Prime Minister promised a detailed response to each
by the end of this month. Although we welcome much of what the noble
Earl has said today, it falls short of that promised full response. I

are serious omissions from the Statement on four flagship
recommendations and I would like to press the noble Earl on those
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:35:36"></hs_TimeCode>. First, I
should like to deal with the proposed duty of candour. We from the
Opposition welcome the move to place a duty of candour responsibility
on healthcare providers and believe that it could help bring the
culture change that the NHS needs. However, the noble Earl will know
that the Francis report goes further in recommending a duty of candour
on individual members of staff. Will the Secretary of State say more
about why he has only accepted this recommendation in part and not
applied it to staff? Has the noble Earl ruled this out, or is he
prepared to give further consideration to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:36:13"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000098">On
providers, will the noble Earl assure the House that that duty will
apply equally to all providers of NHS services, including private
providers? The Statement was rather vague on that point. The logic of a
fair playing field, which I think has been the subject of a report
published today, must suggest that anyone providing services to the NHS
must come within the same regulation. I refer the noble Earl to the
experience in Cornwall where there is a private sector provider and a
weak primary care trust which the National Audit Office has commented
on. Would that provider come within the terms of what the noble Earl
has
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:36:56"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000099">I
was interested in the statement referring to new legal sanctions in
general at a corporate level for organisations that wilfully generate
misleading information or withhold information they are required to
provide. Can the noble Earl confirm that that sanction will apply to
Ministers, the Department of Health, the NHS Commissioning Board,
Monitor, the CQC and all the other public regulators and those who have
authority over the NHS? It would be grossly unfair if this was simply
to apply to parts of the National 
<?notus-xml column=970?>Health Service and not to those organisations that have so much power
over the NHS. I would be grateful for a response on

turn to the other issue in relation to private providers. Is it not the
case that we will not get full transparency unless provisions of
freedom of information apply to all holders of NHS contracts and the
information cannot be withheld under commercial confidentiality? I
remind the noble Earl of the regulations in relation to Section 75,
which are absolutely apposite to this question of a level playing

turn to the question of a patient voice. The Government have announced
new chief inspectors of hospitals and social care, which was not a
Francis recommendation. Is there not a risk of top-down regulatory
structures reinforcing the wrong culture, looking up to Whitehall and
not out to patients and the community? Surely the noble Earl will
accept that regulation alone will definitely not prevent another Mid
Staffs. What might prevent it is a powerful patient voice in every
community that is able to sound the alarm if things go wrong. In that
context, I have a question about local Healthwatch? We know that
one-third of local authorities have said that their local Healthwatch
will not be up and running by 1 April. We also know that there are wide
variations in structure and membership. I wonder whether the noble Earl
will accept Robert Francis’s recommendation of a consistent
basic structure for Healthwatch throughout the country, before it is
too late and before they go their separate ways. The importance of the
proposal is that these bodies can give a very powerful voice to patient
concerns about the quality of care in their
locality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000102">My
third area of concern is regulation and training. Mr Francis has made a
very clear case for a new system of regulation of healthcare assistants
to improve basic standards. The noble Earl does not need reminding that
many noble Lords are concerned on this point. Unfortunately, I did not
hear in his reading of the Statement any reference to the statutory
regulation of healthcare assistants, and it is disappointing
that the terms of reference for the Cavendish review do not
include consideration of that matter. Have the Government now rejected
that recommendation; are they still considering the regulation of
healthcare assistants; or have they decided after all to support the
principle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:40:21"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000103">We
support the move to rebalance nurse training to include more hands-on
experience. Does the noble Earl accept that hospitals need to be given
much more authority in the training of nurses and the balance between
what happens in hospitals and what actually happens within
universities? Does he acknowledge that student nurses already spend 50%
of their time in clinical practice and also face significant financial
barriers when completing training? In the light of the announcement,
can he assure the House that the requirement for a year on the ward
will not increase the financial barriers to young people entering
nursing? If more trainees are to be on the ward, will he ensure that
there are enough staff with the time to train the extra students? In
that light, will the Government encourage the appointment of
supervisory ward sisters to allow more time for leadership, training
and support 
<?notus-xml column=971?>of those student
nurses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:41:23"></hs_TimeCode>? I should
have declared an interest in making this response to the Statement. The
noble Earl will be interested that my own trust, Heart of England, has
announced this week a £1.4 million investment in the

listened with care to the Statement when it referred to the creation of
a culture of zero harm throughout the NHS. Such an objective must be
right. We know from previous statements that the Secretary of State is
keen to follow the example of the airline industry and note that
Professor Don Berwick will report to the Secretary of State on those
matters. However, does the noble Earl not think it rather ironic that
the Government abolished the National Patient Safety Agency, which was
set up to mirror what has happened in the airline industry and
encourage staff to raise concerns about patient experiences? Does he
not see that although the national reporting and learning system has
been retained, placing it under the control of the NHS Commissioning
Board is completely at variance with the philosophy in the airline

whatever—the power to deal with issues which the CQC has raised?
Other than the thought that they are relying on health and competition

does it mean that Monitor will now have to employ lots of clinicians on

fourth major issue concerns staffing, which is the most glaring
omission from the Statement. The culture will never be right on our
wards if they are understaffed and overstretched. The CQC has recently
reported that one in 10 hospitals does not have adequate staffing

a reduction of 843 nurses between November and December. Does this not
sound the clearest of alarm bells that some parts of the NHS are in
danger of forgetting the lessons of its recent past by cutting the
front line? Do we not need objective benchmarks so that staffing levels

not that money be better used to bring nursing staffing levels up to

colleagues are in denial about the pressures on the health service at
the moment. The system is under horrendous pressure. Primary care is
faltering. We heard earlier about the appalling standards in many
out-of-hours services at the moment. The 111 service is problematic in
some parts of the country. There have been huge cuts in local
government adult social 
<?notus-xml column=972?>care spending. Yet the system, Monitor and the NHS Commissioning Board,

attaching criminal sanctions to key areas of public service delivery
can send an important message to the public about the expected
standards of care and duty. That is why we will consider the
introduction of additional legal sanctions at a corporate level where
organisations wilfully generate misleading information, or withhold
information that they are required to provide. I cannot be more

an issue to be addressed there. I will take the noble Lord’s
points on board as to how widely that should
go.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000112">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:49:36"></hs_TimeCode>,
we are concerned that the introduction of criminal sanctions on
individual staff who provide NHS services could run counter to the
creation of an open and transparent culture. It could instead create a
culture of fear that could lead to the cover-up of mistakes, which is
the very opposite of what we seek to achieve. That of course could in
turn prevent lessons being learnt and could make services less safe.
However, we agree that where staff are obstructively dishonest action
will need to be taken to ensure that the quality of patient care is not
jeopardised. We are asking the NMC and the GMC to look at how they
might be able 
<?notus-xml column=973?>to strengthen professional standards and disciplinary measures to
address those kinds of case. Registered clinical staff are, of course,
already placed under a duty to be open through their professional

to healthcare support workers, as I have frequently said in your

sadly seen at Mid Staffs. Instead, we have decided to tackle this issue

regards nurse training and the idea that every prospective nurse should
have bedside experience before undertaking formal training, we believe
that that idea should be piloted. The charge that we have heard for so
many years that some nurses are too posh to wash must be got rid of. We
must ensure that we are training nurses who have an aptitude for the
role and who know what it is like to have hands-on experience as a
healthcare assistant before committing themselves to training.
Starting with pilots, every student seeking NHS funding for nursing
degrees should, we believe, first serve for up to a year as a
healthcare assistant to promote front-line caring experience and
values, as well as academic strength. The current first-year dropout
rate for nurses alone is 25%. For that reason also, it is important to
ensure that we have the right sort of man and woman as a nurse trainee.

Sometime the roles of Monitor and the CQC appear to overlap and
sometimes there appears to be a gap as to exactly who is responsible
for what. Having thought very carefully about this issue, our judgment
is that it is important to be crystal clear about who is responsible
for what. The CQC’s powers, in terms of warning notices and
improvement notices, will remain, but should the CQC find that there is
an intractable case of quality failure in a provider organisation, it
should not be the CQC’s job to sort that out. There should be a

this experience that you are getting before going into

important reinforcement of mutual value and of the character of an

that. I say to my noble friends on coalition Benches that no one who
votes for my amendment today, if I press it, will be preventing the
Government from making such an order, nor would they be stopping anyone
applying for an extension. It merely moderates a one-size-fits-all
approach and allows local decision: localism. It states that if a local
authority thinks that extending permitted development in gardens to
this extent is not appropriate for its area, it may opt out. What is it
about this small thing on which this great Government will not
compromise? Do they not understand how people live cheek by jowl in the

My noble friend implies in her letter that Article 4 directions are
quite easy and normal and can readily be used if councils do not want
to extend permitted development. That might be read to imply, although
crucially she does not say so and did not say so when asked
directly on Report, that all such local directions to opt out would be
supported by the Government. Then her bosses handed a file to my noble
friend marked “resist” on an amendment that allows a
faster, simpler route to the same opt-out point as Article 4 would
offer. It simply does not add up. I fear that the truth is that
someone deep in Whitehall, while singing the song of localism, wants to
keep a hold over local authorities to modify or cancel an Article 4

do not wish to detain noble Lords with detailed debate on Article 4,
because the small print is a diversion from the main principles of
localism and householder rights that are engaged here. I must point out
that my noble friend’s letter did not mention the complication
arising from rights to compensation that may come with Article 4
directions when planning approval is approved. Leeds City Council alone
has calculated that its potential exposure in relation to one aspect of
policy is between £1.5 million and £3 million. Nor did it
mention the lost planning fees—perhaps £250,000 a year in
my authority alone, according to my officers—and there will be
no less work to be done, for you can be sure that time saved on
planning control will be time increased on building control,
as neighbours who have not had opportunities to comment on proposed
extensions will ask the building inspectors to look at whether the work
is being done properly. Of course, even on my noble
friend’s best-case presentation of Article 4
directions, it is a process that takes many

the Government commend Article 4 against the faster, simpler approach

it is as though a man had stopped his car and asked for directions to a

hill—it’s about half a mile away”, a bystander
deliberately points him around 10 miles of byways, consuming quantities
of petrol on the way, with a possibly impassable ford lurking on the
route. It seems wasteful and pointless. Every argument the Government

return to the fundamental arguments. The Government have suggested a
world where in close suburban neighbourhoods people can put up a six or
eight-metre back garden extension, and people living in the house to
which they may be attached have no right to a say in this or to object.
It is not hard to imagine the shock and dismay that some people will
feel if they ever find out that it is happening to them. They will feel
powerless and angry.</hs_para>

localism and community; it denies localism and avowedly reduces
community rights—Ministers say that it does. It is not about new

<?notus-xml column=982?>housing; not a single new upstairs bedroom will be
built in Britain as a result of this proposal. It is not about making
it easier for people to improve their homes; they have every right to
do so now and still would if my amendment were passed. It is not even
about property rights, for it transfers power and rights from those who
lose most directly from any development and adds to the gain of the
richer and more assertive, who would gain anyway.</hs_para>

away a neighbour’s right to have a say on a big and potentially

it removes that vital process of moderation and conciliation that the
local planning system provides in these matters. How often do those who
have been upset by a planning proposal next door go away finally
satisfied if a small condition is added, a modification made, or just
by the simple expedient of being able to have their say before the
local planning committee? Paradoxically, at this micro-level, a
planning hearing can be an enabling process that allows arbitration and
reconciliation, without which, in those small, precious, suburban
communities, neighbour would be set against neighbour in perhaps
lasting

Good policy should surely have a sense of how things work at the human

fails. To me, there is a principle of equity here, and it is on just
such matters that your Lordships’ House has always been a voice

there were protests, it was put out to a hurried six-week consultation.
Three months after that consultation closed, we have not been allowed
to see the results. Now we are told by my noble friend that they will
eventually be published at the time of the regulations—yes, the
regulations. Well, regulations are unamendable in this place or in the
other place, which has had no chance to consider this proposal. Of
course, any Government would like to push through controversial ideas
in an unamendable form at a time of their convenience, but Parliament,
I submit, has a right to say “think again”

Tope:</Member></B> My Lords, I have added my name to this amendment
proposed by the noble Lord, Lord True, feeling as strongly as he does
and with as much sadness as he has expressed. Like him, I am a
councillor in an outer London, suburban authority. Indeed, I am a
former leader of that council. Like him, I have campaigned and been
elected many times on the commitment to preserve back gardens, which is
a crucial issue in most suburban authorities and no doubt
elsewhere<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:32:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000167">The
noble Lord, Lord True, spoke very eloquently and very fully on the
issues here. I shall try not to take so much time or to repeat too much
of what he has said. He referred to the origins of this proposal last
summer. It seemed a good idea when government circles were
scratching around trying to find anything that would stimulate growth
and this proverbial young Kensington councillor to whom he referred
came up with this jolly wheeze. Frankly, it would have been
much better had they listened at that time to the strong and unanimous
reaction right across all parties, across local government and, indeed,
across the country pointing out what a silly idea it was. Sadly, that
did not happen. People somewhere in government dug in on it. As the
noble Lord, Lord True, said, we went to a hastily contrived
consultation lasting six weeks, ending on Christmas Eve. At Report, the
Minister told us that there had been 1,000 responses. It has been 13
weeks since that six-week consultation ended. We have no idea today,
and I suspect that we will have no better idea by the end of today,
what those 1,000 replies said. Surely somebody somewhere could simply
have divided them into for, against and not quite sure. We could at
least get some indication of what that response is, unless we have no
indication. If we get no indication in the reply to this debate, we are
forced to conclude that a very substantial number of those 1,000
replies have been put in the against pile.

only rights that are being extended here are to home owners—the

proposals—and usually there are rather more neighbours than
there are home owners. So, in fact, more people are losing rights in
this alleged extension to localism than are gaining

the rights being taken away is the right to have a say. The Minister
expressed a hope, which we 
<?notus-xml column=984?>would all have, that neighbours would talk to each other. Of course that
happens, and we would all want it to happen. Quite often, those
discussions take place and can be resolved in an amicable way between
neighbours; that is what we would all desire. But we all know that,
outside that ideal world, it does not always happen that way. The
rights being taken away are the rights of the neighbours to be able to
appeal for arbitration from a local planning authority, and to ask the
house owner who wishes to extend the property properly to take into
consideration the interests, wishes and concerns of their neighbours.
If they know that they do not have to apply for planning consent, there
is no incentive to do so other than to wish to be a good neighbour. If
they think that their neighbour is reasonably or unreasonably going to
object to their plans for the extension, it is unlikely that they will
voluntarily submit to such

Local Government Association and the Minister have commented, I am sure
correctly, that 90% of such planning applications are currently

too much wrong with the present system. But why is there such a high
approval rate? It is simply because of the need to have planning
consent, and the opportunity that is given to neighbours to have their
say and for the applicant to know that the neighbours will have
their say, as well as for the role of the local planning authority not
just to be able to arbitrate but to be able to mitigate, negotiate and,
one hopes, to resolve any outstanding

for the small builders. I have the good fortune quite often to talk to

4 is then pleaded in aid by the Government, who say that it can be used
as a way to get around this. My noble friend Lord True has dealt with
that very well and very fully, and I am not going to repeat those

which I am very grateful, which dealt at some length with unanswered

As I said, the noble Lord, Lord True, has dealt with many of those, but
it also gives us the figures for the use of Article 4, which some of us
had said was little used. Well, these terms are relative. I will
interpret the figures in the letter in a different way from what was
intended. They show that barely one-third of local planning authorities
have used Article 4 directives at all in the past three years, and that
those that have done so have used them less than once in each of those
three years. I would suggest that Article 4, by common consent, is not
heavily used. Why? Because it is slow, bureaucratic, ineffective and
inefficient, and again using the illustration of the noble Lord, Lord
True, it can prove very costly in terms of compensation.</hs_para>

need to correct something in the Minister’s letter. There is no
such thing as a statutory right to light. There is a common-law right
to light by virtue of something called prescription, which is long
enjoyment as of right over an extended period—usually more than
20 years. However, the actual effect of the common-law right to light
is to maintain only a minimum standard, which most people would
consider a pretty miserable standard of lighting coming in through a
window or other prescribed opening. What really protects the situation
is the Building Research Establishment guidance on daylighting, which
tends to be implemented through local authorities’ development
control policies. However, if you remove the need for development
control, you remove the scrutiny and oversight of the BRE guidance.
That is why development control is the only effective way of assessing,

noble Lords have referred to the fallback of Article 4, which is rather
a poor safety net in this situation, although I am not an expert on
Article 4 directions. There seems to be considerable time and energy to
implement these. There is no defence for a local planning authority
where there are proposals to carry out works between the point at which
the Secretary of State deregulates and allows development in back
gardens to take place, and the subsequent implementation of an Article
4 direction. In other words, there is a gap which is a significant
danger area. Unless local planning authorities were able to prove, as
of now, that in prospect of the deregulation that the
Secretary of State may have in mind they were able to pursue an Article
4 direction, there would be a gap between the deregulation and the
implementation of the Article 4 direction. That would be a very serious
situation because of the compensation provisions referred to by the
noble Lord, Lord Tope, who adroitly suggested that 270 Article 4
directions over the past three years hardly represent a torrent of
Article 4 directions. The Minister might say, “That’s
because it’s unnecessary”, but I suspect that it is much

that, in the terms in which it has been proposed, what I believe to be
a heresy has been expounded, which is there is an equality of rights
between ownership and the right to have a say. The fundamental right is
that of ownership and the protection of property; that is essential.
That is why, when the <I>Quality of Life</I> report looked at this
issue, we came up with a way out of the problem with which your
Lordships’ House is faced. We said that this kind of issue was a
matter not of planning but of neighbourly relations. Why not take it
out of the planning system and have a situation in which people could
normally do what they wanted, but if neighbours objected the local
authority had the right to decide that such an objection was important
enough to appoint an arbitrator? It is not a matter of planning most of
the time; it is a matter of arbitration between the interests
of the owner and those of his neighbours. The arbitrator should work
within a context in which the owner would normally be judged as having
the right to do what he wanted with his own property, but that if the
neighbour’s rights were so intruded upon the arbitrator could
make the decision that in this case it could not be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:57:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000193" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000193">My
problem with this situation is that the amendment reinforces the
concept that through the blooming local authority is the only way in
which the locality can have its say. I am not sure I believe that about
local authorities; indeed it seems to me to be one of the issues.
Localism is not “local authorityism”—it is
localism. I note that 
<?notus-xml column=989?>very often those who speak about these issues talk as though the only
way in which the locality can express itself is through the local
authority. Frankly, I have seen far too much of local
authorities’ fiddling powers, as they try to tell people the
best way to do their developments. I remember having an argument with a
charming lady on the subject of what sort of window Teulon would have
put in a house that Teulon had built. The difficulty was that she was
from the authority and I knew about Teulon, which is a difficult

businesses will also be able to improve their premises and expand

local construction companies and small traders. That is not the full

Lytton took me up on my point about the right to light being statutory.
I will be pedantic, if I may. The operation or prescription of the

common law, as he suggests. Between us, we have probably come to the
right conclusion, which is always
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000214" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000214">To

have commented on the Article 4 directions, on which I have relied as
an alternative to what my noble friend suggests. Boringly, I shall make
some of those comments again. There has been difference of view about
how the Article 4 directions work. It has been suggested that the
Article 4 direction process is very difficult to pursue. The Local
Government Association briefing contends that. As has been cited and as
I said in my fairly long letter, which may have been helpful in some
ways, more than 270 Article 4 directions have been notified to the
Secretary of State from 122 local planning authorities over the past
three years. This does not suggest to me that local authorities will
not introduce Article 4 directions if they think they are appropriate.
A number of local authorities will.</hs_para>

its briefing, the Local Government Association set out three core
reasons why it believes that Article 4 directions are ineffective. Some
of those reasons have been raised by noble Lords. The first focuses on
the need for councils to give 12 months’ notice of an Article 4
direction proposal. Local authorities have powers in respect of
householder-permitted development to make immediate directions to
withdraw the permitted development rights with immediate effect.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T17:15:31"></hs_TimeCode>Article 4
directions that have been put on at once must then be 
<?notus-xml column=993?>confirmed by the local planning authority following local consultation

or the extension of a
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T17:15:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T17:15:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13032658000268" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000268">5.15

issue raised in the Local Government Association briefing is that the
council must pay compensation costs if less than 12 months’
notice is given. This point was raised by my noble friend Lord Lytton.
Compensation is payable only where a planning application is
subsequently refused, or conditions imposed, and a claim for
compensation is made relating to the householder’s abortive
expenditure. Where a local authority decides to give 12 months’
notice, they will have considered whether they wish to limit the
possibility of compensation requests. This is reasonable, but
so is the ability to seek compensation for a time-limited
period if one has been adversely affected by a
proposal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T17:16:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000219" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000219">The
third issue raised by the Local Government Association is that Article
4 directions have to be used across an entire use class. I have to say
that this is not relevant to the matters that we are discussing this
afternoon: householder permitted development rights. Importantly,
Article 4 directions have been, and can continue to be, made in respect
of individual elements within the householder permitted development
rights. This is not a blunt tool and can be fine-tuned to local
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000220" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000220"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T17:16:13"></hs_TimeCode>In
respect of the concerns about complexity, the Article 4 process was
streamlined in 2010 and, as I made clear, the Secretary of State no
longer has to approve each direction. Instead, he is notified of them

Secretary of State has intervened since

guidance to which I drew noble Lords’ attention sets out the
Secretary of State’s expectation that local planning authorities
will consider making an Article 4 direction only where there is
evidence to suggest harm to local amenity or the proper planning of the

category<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T17:17:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032658000222" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000222">The
Article 4 process is not as difficult as has been suggested. As soon as
the notice is drafted, it is served locally for 21 days and the
Secretary of State is notified at the same time. Our guidance provides
a draft direction that is less than a single page in length. I will
make sure the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, has a copy. Having considered
the local consultation responses, the local authority then considers
whether to confirm the direction. That is done by serving a notice
locally and notifying the Secretary of State.</hs_para>

True:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend on the Front Bench
for the characteristically courteous and thoughtful way in which she
has responded. My difficulty is that the response has been a response
in style and that she has, unfortunately, not been permitted to respond
on the substance of the matter. I did not create this situation. A
pronouncement came from the Government that they intended to withdraw
the rights of neighbours to object to extensions on this scale and thus
oust their right to go to a tribunal, which is the planning committee.
The planning committee process acts as a mode of reconciliation in
itself. Compromises are made and often the matter never goes to a
formal hearing. It is a way in which neighbours are reconciled in these
situations.</hs_para>

my noble friend Lord Deben said. Arbitration is used. I certainly do
not claim that a local authority is the beginning and end of all
wisdom. I spend half my time as a local authority leader trying to
involve local people and local communities in taking decisions for
themselves. I am absolutely convinced that a local authority will have
rather more knowledge of what is acceptable and appropriate in its
local area than a Minister sitting in Whitehall pronouncing an order of
this kind. That is my difficulty with what my noble friend
said.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032658000228" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032658000228">I am
extremely grateful for all the speeches that were made so

at some point Governments gain in authority when they show that they

will not detain the House further. The Minister said that it was
worrying that local authorities might wish to opt out of a
pronunciamiento about planning—to have a different view. How
recently it was that we debated at such length the principle of
localism. While I do not contend that local authorities have the whole
answer, I do not think that Whitehall having the answer is necessarily
right. The House can decide only on what it has before it. I have had
the temerity to raise this issue because it is clear that we have not
seen the results of the consultation and it has been confirmed 
<?notus-xml column=995?>that the Government intend to plough forward to regulations, which are
unamendable. I have had the temerity to put this before the House
partly because it is a matter of great importance to people who live in
small properties, cheek by jowl in the suburbs of this country, partly
because Members of Parliament, who are elected and responsible to those
people, as I myself am, might have a view on this matter and partly
because I do not think that the Government have the full answer, any
more than local authorities do.</hs_para>

Tope:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment stands also in the name of
my noble friend Lord Shipley. We have debated this clause extensively,
under its former guise of Clause 6, at every stage of consideration of
this Bill so far and it is certainly not my intention today to reopen
debates on the many issues that the clause raises. They have been fully
debated; I think that views still differ but, as I have said so often,
we are where we
are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T17:37:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032671000004">On
Report, the Government, having listened to at least some of the
concerns that were expressed, introduced a sunset clause to bring the
clause to an end on 30 April 2016. I welcomed that sunset
clause and the evidence that the Government had at least listened to
those concerns. However, the government amendment on Report also gave
the Secretary of State power to extend the provisions, if judged
necessary, for in effect an unlimited period. My amendment today
therefore seeks to limit any such extension, should it be deemed
necessary, to no more than 24
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T17:38:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Minister will say that the clause was introduced in recognition of the
current economic circumstances and in the expectation that they would
not continue for ever. Indeed, in introducing the sunset 
<?notus-xml column=999?>clause for April 2016, the Minister was at pains to express that that
date had been chosen not arbitrarily but because that was when it was
suggested and expected that—I hesitate to say the boom would
begin—circumstances would recover.</hs_para>

provisions should cease to exist on 30 April 2016, but
concern is rightly felt that there could be circumstances—after

under the <I>National Planning Policy Framework</I>, all local
authorities should have drawn up their local plan—70% have
already published one—and those up-to-date plans will ensure
that every planning requirement is viability-tested, which should in
turn render this clause

should like to think that the Government are able to accept the
amendment. If they are not, I hope that the Minister will express her
sympathy and support for its intentions and put that on record. While
that is not as good as its being in the Bill, it is at least some
reassurance for now and for the future. I hope that, in doing so, she
will also indicate that any future Government, if they are minded to
extend the provisions of this clause, will come forward with robust
evidence that proves that affordable housing obligations are routinely
stalling developments. I am not sure that we are convinced of that now,
but, if there is to be any extension, it will certainly be incumbent on
the Minister of the time to provide the evidence to convince
both Houses of Parliament that it is necessary, and both Houses
of Parliament should have the opportunity to decide on those

the moment we have a sunset clause that is in rather an unsatisfactory
situation. Effectively we have the right for developers to renegotiate
affordable housing obligations on which the sun indeed may never set.
As the noble Lord, Lord Tope, said, now is not the time to revisit our
broader concerns about these provisions. On Report the Minister
justified the three-year primary period of the sunset clause by quoting
evidence from the OBR that showed that investment in housing is
expected to stabilise in 2016, yet she argued the need for a pragmatic
power to extend this if prevailing market conditions justified
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032671000011">This is a
hard argument to maintain unless the Minister is anticipating a further
deterioration in the housing market. By 2016, developers will have been
negotiating affordable housing obligations in circumstances of
recession, or of zero or little growth, for about eight years. The
amendment allows for a possible further two years, so it would then
have been for a full decade. Perhaps the Minister can be more specific
about the 
<?notus-xml column=1000?>nature of the catastrophe that she considers might beset the
housing market that would justify retaining residual powers beyond
2018.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032671000012">The
March 2013 OBR report does not seem to help, as it comments on the
variety of housing measures that the Government have promulgated,
noting that overall, together with the Funding for Lending scheme, the
measures should support significant growth in property transactions and
residential investment at levels that we forecast for the next two
years. The Government may have got something right; is the Minister
saying that the OBR has got it
wrong?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032671000013">The
justification for a possible two-year extension of the sunset clause is
pretty thin. The opportunity to keep Clause 7 in being beyond this is
not justified, unless it is intended to be held up as some sword of
Damocles to ensure that future affordable housing obligations are
depressed. We agree with the noble Lords, Lord Shipley and Lord Tope,
that a maximum of two further years of the sunset clause is okay but
not more than that. Like the noble Lord, Lord Tope, we hope that the
Minister can reassure us on that so that we do not need to test the

pleased and always have been that the principle of a sunset clause to
repeal the clause in April 2016 is generally supported. However, these
amendments focus on the power given to the Secretary of State to extend
the provision by order beyond 2016. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has
referred to the date of April 2016 in the Office for Budget
Responsibility’s market forecasts as a sensible and justified
sunset date. We do not know whether things will have improved by then
and I am sure that the noble Lord does not either. One can only hope
that they will have. If they have not, we would want to retain an
option to extend the measure if market uncertainty remains. We have
hoped that we would dig ourselves out of the economic crisis over the
past couple of years but it has not been possible. One cannot say with
total confidence that 2016 will see us out of the doldrums but we
expect and hope that it
will.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032671000016">The
issue at stake is not the sunset clause, which has already been agreed,
but how any future extension should be constrained. I sympathise with
the wish for certainty and I hope it is reasonable to expect that there
will be economic stability by 2018, and that consequently there will be
little need for extension of the provision. However, while I agree that
2018, as proposed by my noble friend, seems a reasonable limit for this
clause, it is as arbitrary a date as any and would limit future
flexibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032671000017">To
retain flexibility is prudent. With flexibility by order the matter
could be taken forward. If it had to be, the Government would have to
come to both Houses, because it would be an affirmative order. My noble
friend asked what evidence they would have to

evidence that they could find, which would presumably at least refer to
the amount of affordable housing that still needed negotiation. Both

also wary of having a fixed date of 2018, or a fixed extension period,
because the clause introduces a new application and appeal process.
Viability alone and not policy requirements or scheme merits is the
subject of the application and appeal. The on-the-ground impact will
not be known until the clause has been in operation for a little while
and we have seen how the viability process works. It is essential,
therefore, that we maintain flexibility to understand the impact of the
measure over a little time. Along with more certainty in market
conditions, this would give better ground for assessing the
merits of any extension during 2015 when consideration would have to
begin as to whether the extension to 2016 should be
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0001.htm#13032671000019">The
clause is drafted so that the order must insert “a later

reflects our intention that this clause will operate only for as long
as it is required. Its intent is to be temporary. A permanent provision
would require new primary legislation. Finally, it could be argued that
the real future of this clause is in the hands of local authorities. If
local planning authorities take account of their local economic

there will be little scope for

emphasised the special importance broadband in rural areas, and I
agree. I have long argued that renewed growth in Britain will
come—indeed, is already coming—from small and
medium-sized businesses, many of them rural. That came home to me
forcefully last week when I was returning from your Lordships’
House. The train to Cumbria came to a frozen halt at Lancaster. The
train operator kindly provided taxis for six of us to go further up the
branch lines. To my amazement, all six of us, who live dotted around in
the villages and hamlets near me, were all on a day trip to London
selling our goods and services. This is interesting because it was
completely unheard of only a few years ago. I tell the story because
there is a strong danger that the anticipated broadband take-up will be
underestimated. In a sense, that is very good news, but there are

many outside this place remain concerned about the precedent it sets

legal advisers is that Clause 9 as amended by the Government replaces
the special protection for national parks and AONBs with the general
protection given to all countryside areas under Section 109(2)(b) of
the Communications Act 2003. If the Secretary of State has had regard
to the matters mentioned in that section, that will be sufficient for
the purposes of Section 11A(2) of the National Parks and Access to the
Countryside Act 1949. In other words, the special treatment and
priority given to national parks would be lost; they would be treated
in future like any other area of

a practical level, this means that the clause, even as amended by the
Government, continues to allow the introduction of proposed new
regulations that will make it much easier for telecommunications
companies to put up overhead wires and poles in protected areas without

Clause 9 is unnecessary and that new telegraph poles in national parks

not pose a barrier to broadband infrastructure

“have regard” duties for protected landscapes. The
expression “greater weight” is used in Section 11A of the

areas comes from the beauty of their landscapes, which we must try to
preserve at all costs. Their beauty brings income from visitors, both
national and international, and from the whole question of the branding
of the businesses, now and in the future, that exist within their

will take a moment to remind the House of the position that we reached
on the broadband provisions. It is our intention, through Clause 9, to
ensure that there is sufficient legal certainty in primary legislation
when bringing forward our proposed changes to secondary legislation.
The clause as it was when introduced to this House expressly disapplied
the duties in national parks and area of outstanding natural beauty
legislation to have regard to environmental considerations. However,
many of the concerns that this would set an unwelcome

of those discussions, we were able to propose an amendment to the

necessary legal certainty to bring forward regulations. To my noble
friend who moved these amendments, I point out that the initial
amendment was about having regard to duties. We satisfied those
associations and the House that those amendments achieved what
everybody wanted to achieve: protection for these areas, as well as
recognising the need to move forward.</hs_para>

1 of the Bill makes significant changes to the system for independent

should be the data controller for data processed by the ISC, but this
is the likely effect of Section 63A once the ISC is a committee of

disapply Section 63A of the DPA so far as the ISC is concerned so that,

addition, both the House of Commons and the House of Lords are subject

of Parliament, it is arguable that the ISC, too, would be subject to
the FOIA, as other Joint Committees are. To avoid this consequence,
Amendment 42 would add a provision to the Bill which would amend
references to the House of Commons and House of Lords in Schedule 1 of
the FOIA to make it clear that they are not subject to the Act
as regards information held by the ISC. This amendment would preserve

Amendment 39, which would provide statutory protections for evidence
given by witnesses to the ISC. First, such evidence may not be used in
any civil or disciplinary proceedings. Secondly, evidence given by a
person who is a witness before the ISC may not be used against that
person in any criminal proceedings. These provisions would replicate an
important part of the protection that witnesses before a Select
Committee have by virtue of parliamentary privilege. They would provide
encouragement to witnesses appearing before the ISC to be full and
frank in their evidence. The protection against the use of evidence in
criminal proceedings would be narrower than the equivalent protection
for civil and disciplinary proceedings. They would not impinge on an
individual’s right to defend him or herself in criminal
proceedings. Of course, evidence that is deliberately misleading is of

said at Report that one possible consequence of the “of
Parliament” change is that the ISC would have the power to take
evidence on oath. Following further analysis, we concluded that the
consequence of changing the status of the ISC to become a statutory
committee of Parliament was that the ISC may, in future, take evidence
on oath. Our view was that existing statutory powers applicable to
Commons and Lords committees would give the ISC the authority to
administer oaths. This view shaped amendments which the Government
tabled, and which were agreed to, in Committee in the Commons. However,
the House service raised a concern with the Government about this,
disagreeing with our analysis that the “of Parliament”
change gives the ISC the authority to take evidence on oath.
Its view is that the Bill should contain an express power for the ISC
to take evidence on oath. In response to that concern, the Government
tabled an amendment in the Commons to put the ISC’s power to
take evidence on oath beyond doubt. It is not necessary that the Bill
specify who has the power to administer oaths on behalf of the ISC;
that can be left for the ISC to determine, under its general power to
determine its own

oversee operational matters. The Bill extends the ISC’s
statutory remit, and makes clear its ability to oversee operational
matters. This is a crucial part of the Bill’s aim of
strengthening oversight. The amendments would both extend and clarify
the ISC remit to oversee operational matters; they respond to concerns
of the ISC that were raised by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, during
debates in this House. The noble Lord’s first concern was that
there may be exceptional circumstances in which the Government might
want the ISC to consider particular operational matters falling outside
the existing criteria. His second concern was that the requirement that
both the ISC and the Prime Minister be satisfied that the criteria for
operational oversight were met might slow down the provision of
information to the ISC on routine operational
matters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032671000068">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:25:54"></hs_TimeCode>
response to these concerns, the amendments made in the Commons would
mean that the Bill would provide for three routes by which the ISC may
consider particular operational matters. The first route is the one
that was already in the Bill—when the Prime Minister and the ISC
are agreed that the matter is of significant national interest and is
not part of any ongoing intelligence and security operation. The second
route is when the Government request the ISC to consider a matter
notwithstanding that either or both of those criteria are not met. This
meets the first concern raised by the noble Lord, Lord Butler. The
third route is where the ISC’s consideration of a matter is
limited to considering information provided to the ISC voluntarily by
the agencies or another government department. This meets the second
concern raised by the noble
Lord.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032671000069">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:27:01"></hs_TimeCode>
the first and second routes only, the ISC and the Prime

consideration of a particular operational matter 
<?notus-xml column=1011?>is consistent with the memorandum of understanding
agreed between them. The ISC’s powers to require the agencies or
other government departments to provide it with information would be
available in the first two cases, but not for the third—on the
consideration of information volunteered to the ISC. This
would be the effect of Amendment 3 and consequential
Amendments 28 to

27 addresses the future resourcing of the ISC. In Committee in the
Commons, the Minister for Security made clear that it remained the
Government’s intention that we should make the ISC more
parliamentary and move it away from Government. Officials from
government, the House service and the ISC secretariat have discussed
what we think will be an acceptable solution agreeable to all parties.
This is that the ISC secretariat should become a separate body,
grant-aided by the House. This would be similar, for example, to the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association UK. The National Security
Adviser has written to the Clerk of the Parliaments and to the Clerk of
the House of Commons setting out formally that this is the
Government’s intention. My understanding is that the House of
Commons Commission and the House of Lords House Committee are willing
in principle to take on responsibility for grant-aiding the ISC. This
solution meets the Government’s policy intention that
responsibility for the ISC secretariat should be moved away from
government. As the ISC itself becomes a committee of Parliament so,
subject to what I will say shortly, responsibility for the funding and
resourcing of the ISC secretariat would pass from Government to
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:29:27"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:29:22"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:28:20"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:27:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13032671000220" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032671000220">6.30

of the discussions with the House service and the ISC has been the
future accommodation and security of the ISC. The ISC is different from
other parliamentary committees. It is housed on secure premises and its
staff go through developed vetting. The committee routinely handles
information up to top secret strap 2. For that reason it is essential
that effective arrangements are in place for the security of its
accommodation and IT. The best solution for all parties is probably for
the ISC to continue to be accommodated on the government estate and for
the Government to provide certain services, such as secure IT.
Officials will continue to discuss the detailed implementation with the
House service and the ISC secretariat. This will include the exact
status of staff and details of the governance structure for any
grant-aided
body.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032671000072">There is
no requirement, in order for Parliament to fund the ISC, for an express
provision on the face of the Bill. The clear implication of Clause 1(1)
is that the committee will be resourced and funded by Parliament.
However, if the ISC is to be funded or resourced to any extent by
government, this needs to be provided for expressly in the Bill. That
is the reason for tabling Commons Amendment 27. This would provide a
clear statutory basis for the Government to provide additional
resourcing for the ISC. We foresee this power being used in two sets of
circumstances. First, it might be used to provide additional top-up
funding in exceptional circumstances for a limited period—for
example, when the ISC is facing an exceptional workload for one reason
or another and its resource requirements have 
<?notus-xml column=1012?>temporarily increased. Secondly, the power could be
used to provide additional funding or specific resources, such as IT
security or physical security, where the ISC’s requirements,
because of the nature of the work it does, are different and more
costly to fulfil than the requirements of ordinary Select Committees.
To be clear, this provision is only intended to allow Government to
supplement the funding and resourcing that Parliament provides to the
ISC. Parliament has the primary responsibility for funding and
resourcing the new
body.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032671000073">We now
come to consider Commons Amendments 32 to 37, which concern
the power of Ministers to withhold information from the ISC, where the
ISC has requested the information using its powers in paragraph 3 of
Schedule 1. The Bill provides that Ministers may decide that
information should be withheld from the ISC on two grounds: first, if
the Minister considers that it is “sensitive
information”, as defined in the Bill, which in the interests of
national security should not be disclosed to the ISC; and, secondly, on
the grounds that it is information that the Minister would consider it
proper to withhold from a departmental Select Committee of the House of
Commons, having regard to the relevant government
guidance—currently the so-called Osmotherly rules. Equivalent
powers to withhold information from the ISC are contained in the
Intelligence Services Act 1994.</hs_para>

agencies’ material is concerned, the Bill provides that
decisions to withhold information from the ISC must be taken by the
Secretary of State. However, where the ISC requests information from
another government department, the Bill states that a decision to
withhold is taken by “the relevant Minister of the
Crown”. At Report stage the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, proposed
an amendment that would have restricted the power to withhold to a
Secretary of State or a Minister of equivalent level. The noble Lord,
Lord Butler, on behalf of the ISC—if I may say that he was
speaking in that capacity—supported that amendment. Since then,
the Government have given the debate on this matter further
consideration. As a consequence, during consideration of the Bill in
the Commons, we moved Commons Amendments 32 to 37, which together would
have the effect of restricting the power to withhold, on behalf of
government departments, to the Secretary of State, rather
than any Minister of the Crown.</hs_para>

and indeed it was initially the Government’s view, that this
would be problematic for a department such as the Cabinet Office, which
has no Secretary of State. However, most information that the ISC might
request of the Cabinet Office, and which the Government may wish to
withhold, will be sensitive primarily because of the interests of
another department. Accordingly, the Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary
or Defence Secretary, as appropriate, would be perfectly well placed to
take a decision on withholding. A minority of information that the ISC
might request from the Cabinet Office may be sensitive on other
grounds, but on further consideration we do not think that this should
prevent us reserving the power to withhold to the Secretary of
State.</hs_para>

places restrictions on the ISC’s ability to publish material
that it receives privately in connection with the exercise of its
functions. 
<?notus-xml column=1013?>This amendment would address a consequence of the
ISC being a statutory committee of Parliament. As a committee of
Parliament, the ISC will have a general power to publish information,
sitting alongside its express power to publish reports to Parliament.
Absent a restriction on this general power, the new ISC would be able
to publish evidence it has received other than through its reports to
Parliament. While the Official Secrets Act 1989 gives protection
against disclosure of most information supplied to the ISC by the
agencies, other information coming to the ISC would not be sufficiently
protected and this would undermine other safeguards for the protection
of sensitive information in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032671000077">The
provision would take the form of a general prohibition on the
publication of information received by the ISC in private in connection

permit publication, first, through the ISC’s reports to
Parliament; secondly, of material that has already lawfully been placed
in the public domain; thirdly, where publication is necessary to meet a
legal requirement; and lastly, where the Prime Minister and the ISC
agree that publication will not cause prejudice to the functions of the
agencies or other HMG security and intelligence bodies. The ISC would
also be prohibited, except where a gateway applies, from disclosing any
personal information received by it in connection with the exercise of
its functions if the ISC considers that there is a risk that the
intended recipient would publish the information.</hs_para>

after consultation with the ISC, to require that the ISC should exclude
a matter from any report to Parliament. The consequence of including
this gateway would, therefore, be that the ISC would be able to publish
informally any information that it will ultimately be permitted to
include in its reports to Parliament. As I have said, the criteria are
exactly the
same.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032671000079">In
summary, following the detailed and well informed debates on the Bill
in this House—I am sorry to have taken so long to report on
their consequences, but I feel that the detail is important—we
were able to move amendments in the Commons that address a number of

parliamentary character of the ISC, while placing limitations on its
power to publish the evidence it receives; they clarify the Data
Protection Act and Freedom of Information Act status of the ISC; they
provide statutory protections for evidence given by witnesses before
the ISC; they give the ISC an express power to take evidence on oath;
they clarify and extend the ISC’s powers to oversee operational
matters; and they restrict the power to withhold information from the

Butler of Brockwell:</Member></B> My Lords, in general, the amendments
which the Minister has described are very welcome to the Intelligence
and Security Committee. 
<?notus-xml column=1014?>On behalf of the committee and my noble friend who
is also a member of it, I thank the Government for the consideration
they have
given<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:40:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that I should like briefly to put to the Minister. First, he said that
in respect of access to operational information the committee will be
given oversight of operational activity in three circumstances. In
relation to the first, it is given retrospectively and if the matter is
significant, and that is the usual type of operation that the committee
currently considers. Secondly, as the Minister said, the ISC may also
be given information about an operation if the Prime Minister wishes
the committee to examine it. Therefore, current operations are not
ruled out in those rather special circumstances. Thirdly, as the
Minister said, the ISC may be given information about any operations if
the agencies volunteer that
information<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:41:44"></hs_TimeCode>.
There is a respect in which the word “voluntarily”, which
appears in the Bill, can seem a little misleading and might even appear
restrictive. At present, the agencies do indeed, of their own free
will, confide frequently in the committee about operations, but
“voluntarily” may suggest that this category is going to
be restricted somewhat. I should be grateful if the Minister could give
an assurance to the House, as he did when the Bill was before us
previously, that there is no intention to restrict the current degree
of information which the intelligence agencies give the committee about
their
operations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:42:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

question of resources. As the Minister said, it has been agreed that
the ISC will become a grant-aided body. The assurances that I should
like to ask the Minister, on behalf of the committee, to give are no
doubt the assurances that he would expect me to ask him to give. The
Government have repeatedly stated that they want to strengthen
oversight. Does the Minister acknowledge on behalf of the Government
that if oversight is to be strengthened the tools to carry it out will
have to be provided? Can he give a commitment that the ISC will be
given a substantial increase in resources that recognises this
remit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:43:29"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

reached agreement with the Government on what the grant is going to be.
Those discussions are going on but it will have to be substantially
higher than the present level of grant. Can the Minister confirm that
the Government recognise
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:43:59"></hs_TimeCode>? Can he
give some comfort to the committee that, although those negotiations
have not been completed, the Government recognise that a substantial

third point relates to the publication of classified information, to
which the Minister also referred. Can he confirm that Schedule 1,
which, quite rightly, puts safeguards on the committee’s power
to publish classified or sensitive information, is not intended to
prevent the ISC publishing other, non-classified material—for
example, the issuing of press releases, open letters or newspaper

issue in relation to the other amendments on which I should like the
Minister to give me an assurance. In Committee and on Report, our
position was that it was desirable for the committee to have full
parliamentary privilege. At that time, we supported the view taken by
my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours that the only way to achieve that
would be by establishing the ISC as a full Select Committee of
Parliament, obviously with the additional safeguards necessary for a
committee of that kind. That did not find favour with your
Lordships’ House or with the Government. The view taken was that
that was not the way to proceed as it was thought to be too difficult.
Therefore, we welcome the steps that the Government have taken since
that debate to provide greater protections in statute for the ISC along
the lines of parliamentary
privilege<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:47:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

helpful in explaining Amendment 39, which grants witnesses, in relation
to any evidence they give to the committee, statutory immunity from
civil disciplinary proceedings and from criminal proceedings under
certain circumstances where the disclosure has been made in good faith.
That is hugely significant and we are grateful for that move forward. I
am sure that the noble Lord remembers, as I do, the lengthy discussions
that we had on this issue when the Bill was last before the House.
However, is he able to provide greater clarity on the extent to which
protection exists for other individuals involved in the
proceedings of the ISC? If he does not have the answers today, I shall
be happy for him to write to me. My understanding is that Members of
Parliament are currently not protected by parliamentary privilege in
relation to their work on the committee, and nor are 
<?notus-xml column=1016?>the staff working on it in relation to the evidence held by the
committee. Clearly, that is very important, as most of the evidence
that the committee receives is likely to be covered by the Official
Secrets Act as well as the Civil Service Code.</hs_para>

the Minister provide clarity on three further points? First, do the
protections provided by Amendment 39 apply to witnesses who
provide written evidence—for example, whistleblowers who provide
evidence anonymously or in writing? Secondly, what protections are
provided for the staff of the committee and the Members of Parliament
serving on the committee? For example, if the ISC were passed anonymous
information covered by the Official Secrets Act, would the ISC then be
able to act on that information to investigate it or would the handling
of the information cause its members and staff to be in breach of the
Act? Finally, does the fact that these are statutory protections and
not privilege mean that it would be possible for the Government or an
employer to obtain an injunction preventing a witness appearing before

issues in any way as criticism. I repeat that we welcome the steps that

clear that information can be provided at the ISC’s request as
well as by agencies or departments on their own initiative. I hope that
reassures the noble Lord. He also referred to resources and asked for
comfort. I am not sure that any Minister can give comfort on resources
at the present time but perhaps I can say that the Government
acknowledge that the ISC will require an increase in resources to
reflect its expanded oversight role. However, as he rightly pointed
out, negotiations are current. I would not want to comment further on
those but I hope the noble Lord finds that that is of some comfort. It
is certainly a recognition by the Government of the new role for the

House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment 4 and in
doing so, I shall also speak to the other amendments 
<?notus-xml column=1018?>in this group. It is fair to say that the provisions
dealing with closed material procedures have undergone significant
changes since the Bill was first introduced into your Lordships’
House 10 months ago. This House made significant amendments to the Bill
on important issues of principle. A number of noble Lords made their
support for these provisions contingent on those changes being made.
The Government have brought forward amendments that address the views
of this House, and I believe that the measures in the Bill are
proportionate and sensible.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032677000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032677000002">In seeking to persuade
your Lordships’ House that these amendments should allay the
concerns expressed, we should remind ourselves briefly why the
Government have brought the closed material
procedure—CMP—provisions forward. Fundamentally, they
will increase scrutiny of the intelligence and security agencies. CMPs
will ensure that intelligence material which would risk the lives of
agents and sources, or betray secret techniques is not revealed in open
court. At present, the only method to protect very sensitive material
such as the identity of informants from disclosure in open court is
through public interest immunity. The problem is that a successful PII
claim results in the exclusion of that material from the proceedings.
Any judgment reached at the end of the case is not informed by that
material, no matter how central or relevant it is to the issues in the
case. This system works in some contexts, but when a case is so
saturated in sensitive material the PII procedure can remove the
evidence which one side needs to put their case. Settling is not always
an option, and in serious cases involving accusations such as
mistreatment, settling does not allow the court to get to the whole
truth of what may or may not have
happened<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:56:12"></hs_TimeCode>. The
other possibility in cases, such as the Carnduff-type strikeout also
results in a case not being heard at all. We believe that CMPs offer a
way through the dilemma. They enable the courts to ensure that
allegations made against the Government are fully investigated and
scrutinised, while addressing the potentially severe implications for
national security.</hs_para>

number of changes were made as the Bill proceeded through Committee
and, principally on Report in your Lordships’ House. There were
six key amendments on Report, which it is fair to say were taken
forward on the basis of a report from the Joint Committee on Human
Rights. These increased the discretion available to the judge and
allowed any party to apply for the CMP, and indeed for the court to
order one, on its own
motion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:57:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032677000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032677000004">Turning to the
amendments, the Government have sought to take on board the concerns of
the Joint Committee on Human Rights and amendments passed in your
Lordships’ House. We have brought forward a completely
restructured Clause 6—Amendments 4 to 15. There is also a
proposed new clause, which is Amendment 16. It addresses the last
resort concern by allowing the court to revoke a CMP declaration at any
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:57:40"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government’s proposals reflect the intention underlying the
amendments made in this House, but also seek to avoid some unintended
consequences that would cause problems in practice. Under these
amendments the judge now has total discretion over whether to make a
CMP declaration following an application by any party to the
proceedings, or a 
<?notus-xml column=1019?>Secretary of State, should the Secretary of State not be a party to the
proceedings. The court also has the power to order a CMP
declaration of its own motion. In making the case for CMPs, the
Government argued that they can sometimes be fairer for
claimants, too. The courts have confirmed that in
some circumstances claimants’ cases will automatically
fail without a
CMP.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032677000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032677000005">The Joint
Committee on Human Rights, and this House observed and argued, rightly,
that if CMPs are sometimes in the interests of claimants, they should
be able to apply for them and the court should be able to order CMPs as
well. These amendments make some technical changes to the amendments
originally passed by your Lordships’ House, but they put all
parties to proceedings on the same footing when it comes to making an
application for a CMP declaration, and will allow the court to order
one of its own motion. Where a non-government party is applying for a
CMP declaration in relation to sensitive material they do not hold
themselves, their interests will be represented by a special advocate
in the closed part of the hearings determining that application. The
Government have also fully accepted the amendment passed by this House
that gave the judge discretion on whether there should be a CMP
declaration. As I reflected in some conversations with my noble
friends, many of us in our parliamentary lives have tabled
amendments to change “must” to
“may” or “may” to “must”.
This House passed that this should be a change from
“must” to “may”, which is possibly the most
profound amendment that it made. It has some far-reaching consequences
with regard to asserting judicial discretion. Previously, if the court
was satisfied that there was relevant evidence that would damage the
interests of national security were it to be disclosed, the court had
no option but to make a declaration. Now the judge does have
discretion.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13032677000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032677000034">7

also brought forward a revised test for a CMP declaration that we

considering an application from the Secretary of State for a CMP

has first considered whether to make, or advise another person to make,
a claim for public interest immunity for the material on which the
application is based. Rather than requiring the Secretary of State to
make a PII claim first, the court should check that the Secretary of
State had good reasons to apply for a CMP declaration rather than claim
PII. The court rules, which will require affirmative procedure in both
Houses, will make it clear that where the Secretary of State is the
applicant, the Secretary of State must provide to the court written
submissions 
<?notus-xml column=1020?>detailing the reasons for not making or advising another person to make

that the <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T19:01:19"></hs_TimeCode>court
cannot order a CMP unless there is relevant material that would damage
the interests of national security if it were disclosed. The Bill makes
no provision to order a CMP to protect material that would not damage
the interests of national security if it were to be disclosed, that
includes material that would merely be embarrassing to the Government.
It has been asserted in a number of commentaries that this is simply a
matter of trying to hide embarrassment. Let me make it clear that the
relevant material must damage the interests of national security were
it to be disclosed. Crucially, the court can only a CMP declaration in
the first place only if one would be in the interests of the fair and
effective administration of justice in the proceedings. In examining
what is in the interests of the fair and effective administration of
justice in the proceedings, the court will want to focus on the
relevance of the sensitive material to the issues in the case in order
to assess how necessary it is to take it into account to resolve the
issues in the case, and whether there are alternative measures that
would enable the case to be tried without a CMP.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T19:02:22"></hs_TimeCode> court will
also want to take into account other factors, too. These may include
whether both parties would consent to a CMP, the importance of the
sensitive material to the issues in the case and the existence of
material—such as intercept material—that could only be
dealt with in closed
proceedings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032677000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032677000009">A
recurring theme in our debates has been a genuine concern about the
potential overuse of CMPs; it has been said that they might become the
default position. We have sought to ensure that this should be a matter
of procedure used only in very exceptional circumstances. It is this
concern that has fuelled the desire to ensure that CMPs are used only
as a last resort. The Government are sympathetic to this aim, but for
reasons I will come on to explain when I address amendments in the name
of the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, we believe that writing this into the
legislation will be problematic. Instead, the Government have addressed
this concern in a different, and I believe more powerful way. The
provisions in Amendment 16 have brought forward a new clause, putting
the court under a duty to review the CMP declaration at the end of the
pre-trial disclosure phase. I respectfully suggest that in the debate
that has gone on since this amendment was introduced in another place
that perhaps insufficient attention has been given to this particular
new clause. The court must revoke the declaration if it concludes a CMP
is no longer in the interests of the fair and effective administration
of justice in the proceedings. The court has also been given the power
to revoke a CMP declaration at any point in the proceedings.</hs_para>

reviewing the CMP declaration at the end of the detailed document
disclosure phase, it will be in a much better position to make a final
decision about whether or not to proceed with a CMP. At this point the
court will have had the benefit of scrutinising in detail all of the
relevant sensitive material, as well as all the relevant open material,
and—with the assistance of special advocates—deciding
what should be disclosed, whether a summary of any closed material 
<?notus-xml column=1021?>not damaging to national security should be provided, and what is
necessary for the proceedings to comply with Article 6 of the European
Convention on Human Rights, even if that requires a summary that is
damaging to national security. The judge would be required to revoke
the CMP declaration if he or she considers that it would no longer be
in the interests of the fair and effective administration of justice in
the proceedings. If the court decided to revoke, the parties would then
have to consider other options for handling the proceedings. We believe
this is an extremely powerful tool in the hands of the judiciary to
ensure that CMPs are not overused.</hs_para>

amendments advance our continued efforts to ensure that CMPs are and
will be used appropriately, and that the courts, not the Executive,

by your Lordships’ House to rethink our approach. We listened

nothing in the objectives between the Government and the Joint
Committee on these issues, and the amendments reflect a fresh approach
that take account of the Committee’s views and the views of this
House. Judges will be empowered to ensure that CMPs are available in
those cases where they are needed, but that they will not be

motion. There are similar provisions in relation to revocation
proceedings which are principally intended to cover circumstances in

that CMPs could only be ordered where a fair determination of the

is a desire to make these amendments, but I would wish to explain why
we believe these are not sensible safeguards, but would instead damage
what we are trying to achieve. Taken together, the amendments could be
taken to mean that there could be a CMP only when the court had gone 
<?notus-xml column=1022?>through and exhausted every other possible option. There would be
uncertainty over what this might include and considerable scope for
satellite litigation. If this amendment were made, the court may well
consider it would have to conduct a full PII exercise on all the
material in the case before it could even consider in principle whether
or not there should be a CMP. Even if it was painfully obvious to
everyone concerned that a CMP was the only way the issues in the case

this stage, the court is considering the application for a CMP having
not yet seen all the material in the case. When we were having earlier
debates we referred to it as a “gateway”. Against this
background, “not possible by any other means”—the
wording of the amendment—establishes a very high bar to meet as
it could be argued that the court could not establish definitively at
this point whether a fair determination was possible or not by any
other means, without demanding a PII exercise first. In order to
satisfy this condition, the court would likely feel under a very heavy
obligation to fulfil this test. Quite properly, it might be urged to do
so by those who are representing the interests of the claimant. Even if
the court was restricted to making this judgment only on the basis of
the material supporting the CMP application, it is hard to see how such
a judgment could be made based on only a sample of the relevant
material. The court might then conclude that, despite what the statute
says, it can fulfil the duty only by requiring a complete PII
exercise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032677000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032677000017">In
some cases, it may be clear to both the Government and the court that
because the case is saturated with sensitive material a CMP is the best
option. However, even when clear to the court that it would want a CMP,
it may feel the clause directs it towards completing a process it
believes is unnecessary. In such cases, the court should not be
catapulted into such a situation. Instead, the judge should have the
freedom to make the appropriate decision on whether a CMP should go
ahead, without fear of having that decision appealed for having failed
to adhere to restrictive process requirements set out in statute. If
the court decides against a CMP, other options such as a PII
application could still be considered and the court would be free to
suggest this in refusing the CMP application or, indeed, revoking the
CMP declaration at any point in the

is the Government’s clear intention that the procedure should be

Parliament must be clear and not be open for uncertainty, which could

considered in closed or open procedures and what is required for the
process to comply with Article 6. The disclosure process is a
pre-requisite for relevant material to be considered in the
court’s determination of the case. The revocation provisions
enable the judge to have made these considerations about the handling
of material and at the end to decide whether or not still to go ahead
with the trial of the issues using a CMP for the closed elements. This
provides the reassurance that a CMP would be used only where the judge

Macdonald has also suggested that we introduce a version of the Wiley

seek to import into the decision of whether or not there should be a

test is not right in this context for a number of reasons.
First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T19:12:37"></hs_TimeCode>, PII
simply is not working to enable these cases to be tried effectively. If
it were, we would not be bringing forward this Bill.
Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T19:12:37"></hs_TimeCode>, the
Wiley balancing test is used in a very different context. In
PII, the judge is considering whether or not to exclude the
material. It is appropriate for him to balance the damage that
would be caused by disclosure against the public interest and
disclosure in terms of the administration of justice.</hs_para>

when considering whether or not to grant an application for a CMP
declaration, the court is faced with a very different scenario. It must
decide the best way to try the case given that there is relevant
material which would damage the interests of national security were it
to be disclosed. That is a much more nuanced decision. As I have made
clear, the availability of alternatives to a CMP, such as PII, will be
a key consideration for the judge, as well as other factors such as the
degree of relevance of the evidence to the issues in the case, whether
there is relevant material, such as intercept, that can only be dealt
with in a CMP and whether other parties consent.</hs_para>

at all times and in all circumstances be paramount. On that basis, they
urged that Part 2 of the Bill dealing with closed material procedures
should be struck out. That was not the view of your Lordships’
House which, following the advice of the Joint Committee on Human

these to be consequential upon this first amendment. I trust the House

allow the use of material not disclosed to the other party, who is

security-vetted special advocate appointed to assist him. The amendment

determination of the proceedings is not possible by other means, such

relation to PII, it is interesting to note that the Government appear
to be taking a somewhat inconsistent approach. Inquest proceedings,
after all, will not be covered by the provisions of the Bill. The
Government have constantly represented PII as a lengthy process which
leaves them in a position where they might feel compelled to choose to
settle a case rather than disclose information. Sweeping, if
unsubstantiated, claims have been made about millions of pounds having
been paid, or potentially having to be paid, to unidentified numbers of
unidentified terrorists, to be used for unidentified purposes. Perhaps
the noble and learned Lord could enlighten us as to the number of
claimants who have received compensation, and who have been charged
with any offence, been made subject to a control order or
similar constraint, or had their compensation frozen—as it could
be—on the grounds that it might be used for terrorist purposes.

6B in my name. Everyone accepts that CMPs represent a significant
departure from normal rule of law principles. Many people accept that
they also contain a strong strand of unfairness, and that this
unfairness consists in the exclusion of one of the parties from a
critical part of the proceedings, perhaps even that very part of the
case in which the defining issue is decided. Therefore, the claimant
can never know the evidence that has damned his cause—it is
never revealed to
him.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032671000144">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
us be blunt about this. The party withholding the material, and gifting
it to the judge in secret, will almost always be the Government. The
illiberalism inherent in the Bill seems to me to lie in this. CMPs as
presently constituted are not fair, because they do not and cannot
deliver balanced justice between the citizen and the state. This is the
finding of the JCHR; it is the finding of those eminent lawyers
appointed by the Government to conduct closed proceedings, the special
advocates; and it was the overwhelming conclusion of this House when
last we debated these measures. It is no doubt in recognition of this
central unfairness that the Government insist, and the Secretary of

CMPs should only ever be used as a last resort.</hs_para>

choose secrecy over openness, and why would a Home Secretary not do the

to the decision. I find that I was, together with my noble and learned
friend Lord Woolf. The difference between us was that my noble and

not find anything that supports wording quite as wide as that proposed

remember it, and as the noble Lord has explained, in applications for
public interest immunity, where the judge had to weigh the harm done to
the public interest by admitting a particular document or
documents against the harm done to a particular defendant or party in
the case by excluding those

support this Bill I confess to a particular interest in the
legislation. Many years ago—although not quite as long ago as
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf—as Treasury Counsel I was
required to advise and act for the Government in national security,
public interest immunity cases. For six years after the passage of the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, I was the Intelligence
Services Commissioner responsible for retrospective judicial oversight
over the various intelligence agencies. For considerably more years
than that, I have been involved, as a member of the court, in most of
the national security cases that came before us, including the control
order cases and the expulsion cases like that which sought to return
Abu Qatada to Jordan, on which the litigation still continues. The Al
Rawi case relating to Guantanamo Bay, although it was settled before it
came to us, came on the issue of principle which was whether, as a 
<?notus-xml column=1032?>matter of common law, the courts could order a closed material
procedure. The majority of us held not. We held that only Parliament
could sanction so fundamental a departure from the principle of open
justice. Hence Clause 6 is now before

principle of open justice is, as we all acknowledge, of the highest
constitutional importance. It is rightly regarded as lying at the very
heart of the object of fair trials. Ordinarily, closed
procedures—or, as colloquially known, secret
hearings—are simply not to be countenanced. There are those who
argue that nothing—no countervailing interest
whatever—can ever justify any encroachment upon that prized,
sacrosanct principle. The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of the Shaws,
said this on Report. Dinah Rose and Philippe Sands, both distinguished
Silks, said it recently when they resigned from the Liberal Democrats
at their spring conference. Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty,
said it three weeks ago at Lincoln’s Inn in a debate with Ken
Clarke, which I attended. I have the greatest respect for all of these,
but I am convinced that in the tiny minority of cases which have been
identified by David Anderson, the independent reviewer of terrorism
legislation, as cases to which this legislation will apply such an
absolutist approach is wrong. The apparent purity of this approach must
yield to the imperative needs of national security. The absolutists
contend that, where national security precludes the Crown from
disclosing the documents that are needed for the defence, the Crown
must simply pay up. In a judgment in a case called Tariq, which we
heard together with the Al Rawi Guantanamo cases, I described that
contention as “wholly preposterous”. I stand by that and

is just when this proposed new statutory power to hold closed hearings
should be permitted and, more particularly, what safeguards
should be included in the legislation to ensure that it is used
only in this tiny handful of cases where a closed hearing is
absolutely essential for justice to be done. I agree that this Bill
has, happily, been hugely improved from when it was last before
the House. It has clearly been conceded that the decision in these
cases is for the judge and not the Minister. Consistent with this, the
legislation now gives the judge a clear discretion: the original word
“must” is now “may”. In these
circumstances, the Government now suggest that no more is needed. I
readily recognise and acknowledge that that view could be taken but in
my judgment it should not be and I join with those who urge the
contrary.</hs_para>

minimise the number of occasions when the power is used should be

interests of national security cannot be adduced in open court. I am
not referring here, principally, to public interest immunity claims. I
am no great enthusiast for public interest immunity. Generally, a
successful PII claim precludes the material being used at all, which
surely is an even worse option than a closed material procedure. In any
event, as has been pointed out, the PII exercise can itself on
occasions be quite ridiculously laborious.</hs_para>

Rawi we recorded, as the Minister observed, that the claims there were
said to involve up to 250,000 potentially relevant documents, of which
up to 140,000 might give rise to national security considerations, so
that a conventional PII process could take 60 lawyers dedicated to
working on the documents upwards of three years to complete. I am
certainly not advocating that judges should ordinarily or routinely
require the Secretary of State to go down that route—plainly
not. Sometimes, no doubt, public interest immunity might be appropriate
but I am mainly considering here the judge’s powers to order as
necessary other, lesser solutions to the problem: the redaction of
parts of documents; the gisting of material; the summarising of
evidence; or, with regard to oral evidence, the witnesses appearing
from behind screens or perhaps anonymously—things of that
sort.</hs_para>

ensure that the judge strikes a balance. There may be occasions when,
although national security is judged to be at risk, it is nevertheless
better to take that risk than to allow a secret hearing. National
security, everybody agrees, cannot be defined but by its nature the
risks to national security can vary, and considerably. Sometimes they
may be truly grave and simply insupportable; at other times,
realistically not. Sometimes the danger may threaten the lives of
thousands, perhaps with a real likelihood of the risk developing were
the material to be allowed to go into the public domain. At other
times, the risk may in fact be comparatively small; perhaps the
revelation of a minor detail of some little used capability of an
intelligence agency. Quite possibly, it will be something of which
terrorist organisations already know. Remember, there is a real public
interest in the fair and open administration of justice, and a real
downside to going into closed session.</hs_para>

the dismissal of a claim after a closed hearing may prove something of
a Pyrrhic victory for the Crown. It may at the same time fail to
vindicate the Crown’s reputation yet damage significantly the
reputation of the court itself. The judge may therefore decide,
although I recognise only very rarely, that a small risk to national
security is a less bad option than a departure from open
justice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032671000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#13032671000167">To
conclude, closed hearings are of course a price worth paying in a tiny
handful of cases that cannot otherwise be fairly tried at
all—cases where either the Crown or the taxpayer simply pays
up—or where, in an equally unpalatable option, the claim must be
struck out as not fairly triable at all, but those cases must be kept
to an absolute minimum. It may be doubted whether any particular case
will in fact be decided differently, whether or not these amendments
pass. However, on this highly sensitive issue—one 
<?notus-xml column=1034?>which rightly exercises innumerable people up and down the
land—these amendments would send out important salutary
messages. They would demonstrate to the wider world that the House is
truly alive to the critical importance of open justice as a guiding
principle of our law. We ought not too readily to give our approval to
secret hearings and if, as I hope, the House divides, I for one shall

Goldsmith:</Member></B> My Lords, it is too late in
this process to take the view that closed material procedures can never
take place. I have grave doubts about this. It was something
that we considered when I was in government, when we had to deal with
special procedures in relation to control orders and where
people’s liberty was at stake. This is a different order, which
is to do ultimately with money. Be that as it may, we are past that
point. The question we must ask is: under what circumstances should
they exist? Both these amendments, which I support, although not quite
in the terms in which Amendment 6B was put forward by the noble Lord,
Lord Macdonald of River Glaven, are important, as the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, has just explained. I want to
focus particularly on Amendment 6A.</hs_para>

that the court should be satisfied that a fair determination of the
proceedings is not possible by any other means. I thought that was
something which this House had now accepted as an absolutely
fundamental condition. It may be that CMP had to happen
sometimes—many of us do not like the idea that it happens at
all—but if it does, it is because that is the only fair way of
determining it. Why is that resisted? As I understood it from the
Minister, it is thought that somehow that condition is met by new
subsection (1F) in Amendment 6. That says:</hs_para>
<hs_quote UID="1303271000149" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#1303271000149">“The
court must not consider an application by the Secretary of State under

has, before making the application, considered whether to make, or

does not begin to approach the question of a determination by the
court—the judge—as to whether this is the only fair way
of determining the issue. All he has to do is to decide that the
Secretary of State has considered whether a PII application should be
made. That determination will take 30 seconds. Counsel appearing for
the Secretary of State will say, “The Secretary of State has
considered it”. There is no going behind that and, indeed, it
will be true. The Secretary of State will have considered it. He may
have rejected it on the grounds that he has very carefully considered
it and decided that it was all too difficult, or simply because he
thinks it would be expensive, which was part of the point made by the
Minister, or just that he does not like the idea of doing it because he
really wants a CMP to be made. That is no safeguard at all. If any
noble Lord thinks it amounts to some equivalent of a determination by
the court and that the court’s view is that no other way can be
found of fairly determining the case, he would be quite
wrong.</hs_para>

possible reasons for rejecting the amendment. One is that we would
actually like to see CMPs even if there is another way of determining
the proceedings and so the fair determination of proceedings would not
only be by CMP. It would be a very retrograde step to accept that. It
would absolutely be the message that the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Brown, has indicated that we must not send. The other reason would be
that we do not trust judges to make that determination. I very much
hope that this House will not for one moment countenance the
proposition that when it comes to deciding whether a case can be fairly
determined we would not trust the decision of our courts. I will warmly
support my noble friend if he divides the House. I will support
Amendment 6B but it is Amendment 6A that I have particularly spoken
to.</hs_parafo>

sits down, perhaps I may ask a layman’s question. It may be an
oversimplified one. The essential condition the court has to be
satisfied with is not, principally, whether the Secretary of State has
considered PII—that is certainly one of the
conditions—but that it is in the interests of the fair and
effective administration of justice in the proceedings to make such a

that, although I share the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay,
about the reputation of those who serve in our security services, this
Bill will affect the reputation of the judiciary and, as my noble and

saturated in this type of sensitive material. It is a matter of logic
that a judgment in a

unfortunate death is currently under investigation but often if a

that Her Majesty’s Government have not won the support of the
special advocates as to the merit of these closed material proceedings.
I speak as a former lawyer. They will gain work if there are more
closed material procedures but we have not won their support. In fact,
it is their complaint, long-standing according to the recent evidence
of Mr David Anderson QC to the Joint Committee, that in SIAC and other
jurisdictions there is “occasional overuse of
CMP”. In addition, SIAC exceptionalism has not been maintained
and CMPs have crept into other jurisdictions. I believe that this
amendment guards against that kind of creep in civil forums. The
amendment is also worded in a fashion that does not require a full PII
process to be gone through before our extremely experienced High Court
judges can determine “any other means”.</hs_para>

arguably, any other means is better than a CMP. I note here what my
noble and learned friend Lord Wallace outlined about obtaining the
whole truth. It is common that there are serious doubts here as to
whether the whole truth will always be obtained when one party to the
proceedings is not in the courtroom. I say “arguably” as
we have never received figures, although we have requested them, for
PII on the grounds of national security that leads to the total
exclusion of the evidence produced by the Government. I have
never been convinced of the Government’s position that expelling
one party to the proceedings and running the risk of evidence not being
challenged is better justice than excluding some evidence, not a party,
from the hearing, however relevant the evidence is. It is better for
the Government but not for justice.</hs_parafo>

However, I find it odd that since your Lordships’ House last
considered this Bill Her Majesty’s Government settled a claim by
Mr al-Saadi for £2.2 million after he said that the UK
was involved in his unlawful rendition to Libya. Why did the Government
not wait for the legislation so that they could have a CMP? It leads me
to wonder that it is not every case that the Government cannot defend
because they do 
<?notus-xml column=1037?>not have access to a CMP and so pay out taxpayers’ money with the

the need to take into account the public interest in the fair and open
administration of justice. Right from the beginning of this process
with the Green Paper, there has been scant, if any,
recognition by the Government of the principle of open justice. Perhaps
it is because, unlike in the time of Charles Dickens where open justice
meant that trials were public entertainment, open justice today is
ordinarily journalists being the eyes and ears of the public. The
attitude of many to journalists due to phone hacking should not taint
the public view of journalists such as Joshua Rozenberg and Gordon
Corera who report inquests and matters in this area of law. That is a

that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, said about that and I do
not need to repeat his arguments. I think that some would regard the
amendment as a blocking mechanism, although I am sure that it was not
proposed in that way; I am sure that it was proposed as a double
safeguard. However, it would not deal with the issue that, above all,
has concerned me: how you protect source material, particularly if it
comes through the intelligence of another country. We cannot imagine
that a totally rational debate will always take place in a law court.
This is an issue of whether you are supplied with that information. If
there are profound doubts about the procedures—right or
wrong—and if they are held by countries which have been our
intelligence partners over many decades and whose information has
sometimes saved a considerable number of lives in this country, we have
to take account of how they see that procedure. Were the amendment of
the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, to be passed, we might find that other
countries would not see the procedure as safe. I would therefore stick
to the Government’s amendment and their wording and not go along
with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord
Macdonald<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:11:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303271000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#1303271000023"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws" PimsId="1267" UID="1303271000894" xid="1612" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#1303271000894">Baroness

about the process that happens in a court. All this sometimes seems
arcane or obscure to those who are not lawyers and it is easier to pin
it down by having examples. Those of us who practise in the courts and
often deal with security matters know that the process described by the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown—where a judge will consider
whether you can redact documents and take out references or anything
else that might in any way disclose the identity of an
informant—takes place in these cases and has done over the
years. There is the business of someone giving evidence with their
identity never being disclosed, or giving it from behind a screen, and
there other ways of doing it using new technology. There are many
mechanisms, quite different from the PII process, which can protect the
things that the security services are sensitive to, and it can be done
with agreement while retaining the sense of as much openness as

sense of what the House wants here is for the closed material procedure
of barring the defendant and their lawyers from the court and from
hearing the evidence—which is fundamentally unfair and flies in
the face of the idea of a fair trial—to happen in the most
exceptional circumstances. It therefore seems extraordinary that there
should be resistance to the notion that the Bill should state that such
a process should be used only as a last resort. The argument made for
not doing so is that it would be time-consuming for the Secretary of
State—because the Secretary of State, even in this minute number
of cases, would have to look through the papers and acquaint him or
herself with the detail—as well as for the court. As your
Lordships have heard from others who, like me, have participated in
proceedings of this kind, one would expect a Secretary of State or a
judge in a case of this kind to consider with care the nature of the
evidence and whether it was possible to keep it as open as possible.
That is what we would expect, and it is certainly what I would expect
of a Minister who was exercising authority. Otherwise we would ask,
“If the Minister does not want to examine the evidence that is
being kept secret, who is exercising the authority? Is it the Minister
or is it the security
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:15:12"></hs_TimeCode>?”.
We really have to be very careful here. I remind the House of what
happened in Matrix Churchill, where we understood that there was just a
signing-off of requests by the security services, which was of great
discredit to government at the time. I would warn against what this
procedure will do to confidence in government, confidence in the
security services and confidence in our judicial

scary terrorists. It is very easy for us to start thinking,
“Well, of course we want scary terrorists dealt with in this
way”. However, just imagine that there is a terrible disaster at
somewhere like Sellafield and the families want to sue in that matter.
There could be good reason why government would not want the security
arrangements to be picked over in open court. One therefore has to work
out just how far these secret proceedings might spill. If they are

that we assisted. Evidence—papers from the Libyan Government

hitherto been adopted in relation to national security is a secret
procedure in which the judge sees the documents and the other side does
not. This secret procedure has been established and used many times, as

first condition for the closed procedure is that one of the parties

That must be considered before you can say that sensitive material has
to be produced. The idea of that is to remove the sensitivity of the

procedure with excluded material. Of course, excluding the material can
sometimes be extremely damaging to the interests of the other party to
the litigation. The noble Baroness referred to Matrix Churchill. That
was exactly the sort of case that Matrix Churchill would have been if
the judge had excluded it because the material that was sought to be
excluded as sensitive material was, on further examination, of great
use to the claimant, as we all know. The idea that a public interest
immunity certificate is so superior to this procedure strikes me as
being without great
foundation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303271000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#1303271000036">I
assume that the only material in question is material that has been
subject to all the processes that the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Brown, has suggested for removing its sensitivity, because if you can
do that the party is not required to produce sensitive material because
it has been neutralised and the difficulty has been removed. Therefore,
when you have that in mind, it is very hard to see how you can find out
whether there is any other way in which the case can be dealt with. One
of the problems about that is that at the beginning of a case things
may look different from how they look as the case proceeds.</hs_para>

of justice in that case. It is not a question of excluding material,
which is an appropriate test for the amendment proposed by the noble
Lord, Lord Macdonald; it is nothing to do with that. It is to see that
the material that is being used is used in a way that does not damage
the security of this nation. The Government have as one of their
primary responsibilities securing the national security, as evidenced

submarine in Liverpool Bay while undergoing trials on its maiden voyage

Merseyside, sued the shipbuilders. The Admiralty, in the middle of the
Second World War, declined to allow the production of the designs of
the submarine on grounds of national security. Contemporary evidence,

restrict the power of citizens to sue government departments,

good.</hs_para>

be entitled to credit for that. As I understand it, what we really are

matter of degree. The only question to consider now is whether two
further precautions should be inserted into the Bill in respect of what

course I accept the importance of open justice. You do not need to have
that set out in a Bill for judges or ex-judges to say it. We have heard
clear evidence of that in a recent decision of our Supreme Court, where
the president of the Supreme Court was dealing with a procedure that is
akin to the procedure now being proposed. The president of the Supreme
Court, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Neuberger, made the 
<?notus-xml column=1044?>clarion call—and I am delighted that he made the
statement—that all should recognise that we are dealing with a
situation that involves an intrusion into the principle of open
justice. If there was any doubt about the ability of judges to protect
that principle, I suggest that the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Neuberger, made it clear that judges will protect it. After all, a
judge makes a judgment, but his judgment is then subject to appeal. I
urge the House to conclude that what we want is a situation where the
judiciary, which has the fundamental responsibility of doing justice,
has a discretion that is wide enough to do justice in the particular
case that comes before it. I suggest that this Bill, without the
proposed amendments, has to be judged on whether it enables the judge
to do
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:38:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303271000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#1303271000052">The
noble Baroness, Lady Berridge, suggested that this Bill might enable
judges to do things that would reflect adversely on them. I accept that
that is the inevitable consequence of judges exercising their
responsibility to protect national security. If giving a judgment that
is right and in the interests of effective and fair justice will
reflect adversely on a judge, he or she must do their duty, give that
judgment and not be concerned by the reputational consequence for them
of giving that judgment. It is my belief that that is just what our
judges do. They would put that out of their minds. Those are political
considerations, which they should not be concerned
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303271000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#1303271000053">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:39:57"></hs_TimeCode>
is being done here is something that the Government say will contribute
to justice, not the other way round. It is being done because, as must
be recognised, it is the only real alternative that the judges do not
already have. With great respect to the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Goldsmith, I found his submissions difficult to follow, because
redaction does not need this Bill; it is something that judges use
regularly. The judge’s ability to take sensible precautions to
protect national security is used with a degree of frequency, but this
Bill does not affect those cases. It affects only those cases when the
judge is satisfied that better justice will be done because of
the Bill than would be done without the Bill.

second question concerns a matter that has been referred to once very

Clause 10, which is to be amended by Amendment 17, is about the rules
of court, and I would like to ask my noble and learned friend about
those. There is nothing returned from the Commons on which we can hang
an amendment specifically about gisting, so I hope the Minister can
reassure us from the Dispatch Box that the rules will provide what I
hope they will in this connection. Under Clause 10(2)(g),
rules may enable the court to give a party to the proceedings a summary
of evidence taken in that party’s absence. Responding to the
first report from the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Government
say:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1303271000154" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#1303271000154">“Wherever

add that the question of gisting should be decided on a case-by-case
basis. I do not want to take up the time of the House by arguing for
the importance of the special advocate being able to take instructions
from his client—that, I am sure, will be self-evident to
everyone—but I ask the Minister to give an assurance that the
rules will require gisting and I ask this particularly as Clause 10, to
which I have referred, said the rules “may” make the
provision, while Clause 7 provides that rules of court
“must” secure certain things. I hope I do not read too

Manningham-Buller:</Member></B> My Lords, I hesitate to stand after the
really important contributions by so many Members of this House,
including a number of very noble and learned Lords. I do not want to
make a long speech, but there are some points that have possibly not
been touched upon. The central problem here is about litigants, not
defendants. It is about people making claims that currently cannot be
heard. This is an attempt by the Government to find a way, imperfect as
it is—“a second-best solution”, in the words of
David Anderson QC—to get these cases 
<?notus-xml column=1046?>heard and to put into court, albeit in a restricted way, material that
is not currently put into court, so that there is a better chance of
the full picture being seen by the court. David Anderson said—if
I may, I quote him slightly to correct
him:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1303271000155" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#1303271000155">“We

it does not seem to me that the level of injustice inherent in the use
of a CMP in a case of this nature necessarily exceeds either the
injustice to the claimant of a case being struck out, or the moral
hazard and reputational damage to the intelligence agencies that is

does not seem to me to be primarily about the reputation of the
security and intelligence agencies. The service of which I was once a
member welcomes scrutiny. If we disobey or break the law, we should be
prosecuted. The first part of this Bill is about greater scrutiny. I
expect that scrutiny to evolve and over the years to become more
detailed. However, the reputational damage is significant in a way that
has nothing to do with personal feelings; it is to do with whether
these organisations, which are funded by the taxpayer and scrutinised
by Parliament and other bodies, are going to be less effective as a
result of this reputational damage. This needs resolution, but it is
not primarily about that. It is primarily about making sure that some
of these extraordinarily serious allegations are actually heard. At the
moment, we do not have an inquiry. I believe that some criminal
investigations are happening, but there are still a whole lot of
allegations out there that are not resolved, and this would be a way of
resolving
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303271000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0002.htm#1303271000062">There is
one other point I want to make, which I think speaks to the amendment
made by the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald. On the face of it, the
amendment looks unexceptional, but I think it is a question of the
confidence of our human sources, which is very important. I do not need
protection; they do. A point made by the noble Lord, Lord Owen, was
that human sources are either approached by the intelligence and
security agencies inviting them to provide information in confidence or
they approach us or they are the sources of an ally. Not all of them
but many of them do so with the highest motives, and in many cases
their lives are at risk—although, again, not always. I look to
my noble and learned friend Lord Brown. Obviously I entirely agree with
him that national security is undefined and that there is a spectrum.
There are some things, which he mentioned, at one end of the spectrum
that might be labelled “national security” but are not
damaging to reveal. However, at the other end of the
spectrum—this has not really been discussed today—there
is some highly sensitive and secret material in relation to which the

If we expose it in a careless way or in a way that is not protected by

the national security side of things—I know that the amendment
of the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, is not as crude as that but there is
a suggestion that the two things can be held in balance, and I look
again to the point made by 
<?notus-xml column=1047?>my noble and learned friend Lord Lloyd—that will potentially have
a very chilling effect on the willingness of people to offer us

task is. That does not come out of a clear blue sky; it is the product
of social and political contexts within which they live and of which
they have experience. Although it is difficult to get one’s

sensible length to minimise trespassing on the principle of open

can tell from the various speeches this evening, this has become a very
sensitive and somewhat emotive issue. However, there are other

would see reports from the guardian and from the adoption
agency, usually the social worker, that the birth parents and very
often the adopters were not allowed to see. Like other adoption judges
in the past—and I assume that the law has not changed on
this—I ended up making decisions on evidence that was not shown
to part of the court; that is, the most important people, the adopters
and the birth parents. It is not unknown for evidence to be provided to

Gilbert:</Member></B> My Lords, I had not intended to take part in this
debate but I have been moved to do so. We have heard this evening that
this debate is about the reputation of the security services. We have
heard it is about 2,000 to 2,500 years of British justice and that we
must of course be on our guard to make sure that we do no damage to
either of those principles. However, for me the Bill is not about those
things at all. I was a constituency MP for 27 years and I can tell your
Lordships that what concerned my constituents was that we should not
produce a set of circumstances in which several hundred of them could
be blown to smithereens on the District line while going about their
ordinary day’s business. That is what concerns them, not what we
have been hearing this evening. I have not heard that said once

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, the House will agree that
this has been a very good and well informed debate and rightly so
because the issues we are dealing with are of fundamental importance to
our justice system. I do not think anyone who has taken part or who
will vote feels at all comfortable about the idea that there should be
closed material proceedings. Nevertheless, as has been explained

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T21:03:37"></hs_TimeCode> noble and

to make provision for closed material proceedings but, as we

recently reached with Mr al-Saadi, on a no-liability basis, to the tune
of £2.2 million. I am unable to comment on whether actions have
been taken against recipients of other settlements. If such actions
have been taken, it would be impossible to comment without breaching

legislation. It is unhelpful to suggest that that should be the case.
It was and is right that the case of Mr al-Saadi and others should be
dealt with quickly and fairly on the basis of existing legislation. The
alternative of delaying, pending possible future legislative changes,
would be unfair to all parties concerned. I certainly would not like to

reputation of, and the trust and confidence in, our security

importance of the safeguards and how we keep these cases to a
minimum—they should be the exception—has been reflected
in the debate tonight. My noble friend Lord Macdonald has
tabled an amendment that would require the courts to have a balancing
test akin to the Wiley balancing test that was developed in the context
of public interest immunity. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of
Berwick, explained why he thought that was inappropriate; he said that
it was too wide and imprecise. The noble Lord, Lord Owen, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller, indicated that we are also dealing
with situations where there might be foreign sources of intelligence
and, crucially, human sources who work on our behalf for our security
services. They expressed concern that the imprecision of the test would

noble friend said that he thought the effect of the Bill as it
currently stands, without his amendment, would be that the security
services and the Government would opt for CMP rather than PII, public
interest immunity, and that somehow that would be convenient for them.
The noble Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller, made the important point
that Part 1 of the Bill is about scrutiny of the security services, but
Part 2 allows for greater scrutiny. If you wish to push something under
the carpet, PII, or settling a case without any evidence being led, is
one way of ensuring that information does not come out. Albeit closed
material proceedings are closed—for all the reasons that people
have articulated in this debate they are not as good as open
proceedings—they nevertheless allow the court to examine the
material that is there and to apply scrutiny to allegations made
against our security services, which otherwise would not be the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303271000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0003.htm#1303271000086">Regarding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T21:14:27"></hs_TimeCode>

indicated earlier, at this initial gateway of closed material
proceedings the court is considering an application having not yet seen
all the material for the case. Against this background, we are keen

it is something to which the Secretary of State should apply his or her
mind. If one reads the judgment of Lord Brown in Al Rawi, he indicates
at one point that it would take 60 lawyers the best part of two or
three years to go through all the material. That is the scale. If that

backstop and a rare exception was the provision in proposed new
subsection (1F) about the court having to be satisfied that the

stage, because the court must not even consider the application unless
it is satisfied that the Secretary of State has considered PII. The
question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell, was very

that requirement on the Secretary of State but,
rather, the courts being satisfied that the

Minister that I, too, am a member of the Joint Committee on Human
Rights. We looked at whether it would take many months for the
Secretary of State to review the material. We were firmly of the view
that that is not what is required of the Secretary of State at all. It
is only about looking at material that would move it into in the
special category which would mean that it would require

Joint Committee on Human Rights and your Lordships’ Constitution
Committee have said that it would be undesirable to go down the path of
an exhaustive PII. The point that I am trying to make to your
Lordships’ House is that when we make law, the Joint Committee
on Human Rights will not be deciding how it is interpreted, it will be
the courts. The courts will no doubt be at the receiving end of very
eloquent and persuasive arguments from special advocates as to why they
should exhaust different routes. That is our concern: if we include
such words in the Bill which allow such arguments to be made, the
courts may well feel that they must take those exhaustive steps before
entertaining an application for closed material proceedings. We believe
that that would take away much of the purpose of the

conclusion, it is not as if we are just leaving it there. As I said in
my opening remarks, we believe that the tests that we have in place,
giving considerable discretion to the judges, the revocation
possibilities during the review and the disclosure phase, and the
requirement on the court to consider at the end of all the disclosure
whether closed material proceedings should still continue constitute a
very powerful weapon in the hands of the court and at judges’

friend Lady Hamwee asked about the change from “must” to
“may”. She is absolutely right: it is only if all those
conditions are fulfilled that the court may grant an application for
and make a declaration of closed material proceedings. Even at that
stage, the court has discretion whether or not to do so. The noble and
learned Lord, Lord Woolf, asked whether it gives the judges
discretion to do the right thing in the circumstances of the particular
case. I very much believe that what we have put in place in the other
place does that. I fear that to accept the amendments could in some
ways undermine that, although I fully understand why they have been
moved. I believe that we have the right discretion for our judges in
place. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, said, trust the
judges. On that basis, I beg to

way in which facts relating to cases involving CMPs will be made public
during the reporting period. The Government made an amendment
when the Bill was last considered by this House to ensure that where an
application is made under Clause 6(2), that fact must be reported to
the other parties in proceedings; and there are already existing
mechanisms by which the courts publish their open judgments and the

the applications are made; the number of declarations and revocations
made by the court; and the number of judgments published, both open and
closed, with respect to the determination of Section 6
proceedings—this would include judgments made on the substantive
trial and judgments made regarding the outcome of the application for a

addition to an annual reporting requirement, the Government
have introduced provisions for a comprehensive review of the operation

independent figure and with a report made to Parliament. We expect such
a review to take into account the views of special advocates, among
others; to consider efficiency, trends and types of case; and to
analyse the numbers provided in the annual reports to reflect on how
CMPs are being used. The reviewer will have to take care not to comment

with most other legislation, this clause provides for the appointment
of the reviewer by the Secretary of State. Amendment 19A in the name of
my noble friend Lord Marks would require consultation first with the
Lord Chief Justices and the Lord President of the Court of Session. We
do not believe that such consultation is necessary for a reviewer or
commissioner to be independent or to be perceived as being independent,
as has been repeatedly shown by the independence displayed by Mr David
Anderson QC and other independent reviewers and commissioners. David
Anderson has been clear about his views on this Bill, for example, and
has been influential in persuading the Government to change their
position on a number of issues. Such appointments are now subject to a
statutory code for public appointments to ensure that they are
undertaken transparently and on merit. This should provide reassurance
that the person with the right skills and background will be
appointed.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1303271000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0003.htm#1303271000109">It

four years, which I note seeks to ensure that the sunsetting provision

given how long litigation can take and the small number of cases
expected, five years is the right period for there to be enough

require a further review every five years. In its report, the

there is proper justification for them, and they should be
proportionate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303271000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0003.htm#1303271000111">We

Lords that the effect of this amendment would also be to disrupt the
Norwich Pharmacal clauses in the Bill that are intended to bring
clarity to the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction when sensitive
information is involved and to provide reassurance to
intelligence-sharing partners, a point that was made in the previous
debate by the noble Lord, Lord Owen. Although such a clause would apply
to the new CMP Clauses 6 to 10 of the Bill, it would also affect
proceedings connected to Norwich Pharmacal, both those where the
Secretary of State would need to apply for a CMP and the reviews of
certificates issued by the Secretary of State under the Norwich
Pharmacal clauses. These proceedings are deemed to be Section 6
proceedings because the case needs to be heard in a closed material
procedure to ensure that the outcome of the proceedings is not

CMP is preferable, that claimants’ cases must sometimes
automatically fail without a CMP and that the judge should have a CMP

the United Kingdom in cases where claimants are making allegations
against the state and its defence rests on national security material.

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to speak to
Amendments 19A to 19D in my name as amendments to Amendment 19,
concerning review and renewal of the operation of CMPs in the
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303271000119" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0003.htm#1303271000119">In
the other place, as my noble and learned friend has explained, the
Government conceded that the operation of Clauses 6 to 10 of the Bill
should be the subject of a review after five years of the Bill’s
operation. That is the effect of Amendment 19. As far as they go, the
provisions of the amendment are welcome. They were introduced against
the background of the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Human
Rights in each of its two reports in November last year and
February this year that the operation of Part 2 of the Bill
should be subject to annual renewal. This amendment not only fails to
meet that recommendation but, as it stands, has a number of significant
weaknesses that make it frankly unfit for its
purpose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303271000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0003.htm#1303271000120">First,
proposed new subsection (1) requires the Secretary of State on his or
her own to appoint the reviewer. Yet one of the central complaints
about the Bill, as my noble friend Lord Macdonald pointed out
earlier, is that in practice it gives too much power to the state and
to the Secretary of State in particular. The concerns focus not only on
the degree to which the Bill sacrifices common-law principles of
fairness and open justice but also on the relationship between the
Secretary of State and the courts. That remains true notwithstanding
the concessions, important though they are, that there have been on
judicial discretion and equality of
arms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303271000121" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0003.htm#1303271000121">The Bill
undoubtedly accords to the Secretary of State significant new power to
influence how trials of some civil cases may be conducted. How the
Secretary of State exercises that power and whether it is found in the
light of experience to be either excessive or unnecessary will be
fundamental questions for the reviewer to
address.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1303271000331" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0003.htm#1303271000331">9.45

therefore entirely wrong that the person appointing the reviewer to
report on the operation of those provisions is that very Secretary of
State whose powers are to be reviewed. The arrangement proposed is akin
to allowing one of the parties to choose the judge. My first amendment,
Amendment 19A, addresses this issue by requiring the Secretary of State
to consult the senior judges of the three jurisdictions before
appointing the reviewer. That is consistent with the principle that for
these provisions to command public confidence there must be judicial
involvement in their implementation at every stage. There are those who
would argue for a strong fetter, for a veto on the appointment. I say
to them, first, that it would take a very brave Secretary of State to
ignore the advice of the two Chief Justices and the Lord President and,
secondly, that were my other amendments to be successful, it would be
for Parliament to assess the suitability of the reviewer when
considering whether to approve a renewal order, if he sought one. I
hope that the Government will decide to accept this modest and
obviously fair 
<?notus-xml column=1064?>amendment in spite of what my noble and learned friend has said, because
it will enhance the confidence of the public in the review process that
they have wisely introduced.</hs_para>

Commons Amendment 19 is that the Government propose only a single,
one-off review after five years with the report to be laid before
Parliament but without any power for Parliament to act upon it. These
provisions, whether justified or not, represent, as we have heard, a
serious departure from fundamental common-law principles of open
justice and fairness. There is concern and uncertainty about the degree
to which they are in fact required and about how they will work in
practice, so it is essential that their continued existence and their
operation in practice should be kept under regular and careful scrutiny
and that that scrutiny should be scrutiny by Parliament. The Commons
proposal comes nowhere near fulfilling that objective. The review is
all very well, but what is its point if there is no requirement for
anyone to act on it and no power for Parliament to respond? If a review
concludes that CMPs in civil cases are now unnecessary, or that they
are working injustice to the extent that they should be abolished,
Parliament should be able to respond directly to that review. As it
stands, this is a review without teeth or consequence.</hs_para>

are in line with the assurance sought by the Joint Committee on Human
Rights in its letter to the right honourable Ken Clarke dated 18 March
this year. In its drafting, it owes much to the Terrorism Prevention
and Investigation Measures Act 2011. They need to be considered
together. They would provide for a regular review of the operation of
CMPs once every five years, with the Secretary of State given a power
to make a renewal order following each review, but subject to the
affirmative resolution procedure, so both Houses would have to approve
a renewal order before it took effect. If no renewal order were made
within 90 days of the reviewer’s report being laid before
Parliament, the CMP provisions would cease to have effect, except for
cases where a Section 6 declaration had already been made, so it would
not affect existing cases. The first review would need to be after four
years rather than five to ensure that a review and a vote on renewal,
if renewal were sought by the Secretary of State, could take place in
the next Parliament. In opening this debate, the Minister suggested
that it was not appropriate for Sections 6 to 10 to lapse because CMPs
are to be used for review of sensitive information certificates in
relation to excluded Norwich Pharmacal material and those reviews under

was considering whether to pass those confidences to this country and
was uncertain whether in four or five years’ time there would be
closed procedures under which that certificate could then be
considered, it would be a matter of uncertainty whether those

first point I wish to make with regard to the first amendment in the

appointment of Sir David Anderson, have been made by the

suggesting in his amendment. I know that it is 
<?notus-xml column=1066?>furthest from my noble friend’s mind to suggest this, but I am
sure we would not want a situation where perhaps the appointment of
some independent reviewers was questioned because they had not had the

think anyone can deny that the role that Mr David Anderson plays is a
very sensitive one. The independent reviewer of terrorism legislation
reviews quite significantly the actions of the Executive. It
is in the interests, too, of the Secretary of State

think that the recent appointment by the Home Secretary of the
Biometrics Commissioner—or indeed of Mr Anderson—has
given rise to any concerns. I would caution against fixing a problem
that does not exist, because you might inadvertently create another
problem by perhaps casting some doubt on the independence of those who
have been appointed under the present
regime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T21:55:53"></hs_TimeCode>. The

Butler, pointed out, he indicated that he was perhaps
shifting—that is not a criticism at all—on the position
of the renewal, given the deemed Section 6 proceedings as far as
Norwich Pharmacal is concerned. The noble Lord, Lord Butler, makes an
important point with regard to the confidence in which other countries
share information with us. The fact that there would be regular
potential for renewals puts it in a different category from that raised
by the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, and it could raise a problem. In one
of our earliest debates, the noble Lord, Lord Butler, indicated from a
visit to America that when we discussed information perhaps being

friend and to the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, who ask what is the point
of a review if nothing could happen, that the answer lies in what the
noble Lord, Lord Beecham, himself said. No one is suggesting that this
Parliament is binding its successors by this. I remind the House that
it is not just the actions of the Executive and the Secretary of State;
it is the whole system that we are setting up, which involves the
courts. If a review proved that closed material proceedings were not
working, manifest injustice was following on from them and they were
not actually doing what they were set up to do, of course it would be
possible for a future Parliament, through primary legislation, to
repeal the legislation if that system is not working. Indeed, it may
not go as far as repeal. It may be that a review would point out
particular things that perhaps needed amendment, falling far short of a
repeal. So a review could have a proper purpose that does not
necessarily require a renewal order to follow on from it. In these
circumstances, I invite the House to support and approve the amendments
that have been brought from another place and I invite my noble friend

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> I have not moved Amendment 19A,
but Amendments 19B to 19D, as a suite, on the principle of renewal, are
extremely important. In those circumstances, I do not accept the
argument put by the noble Lord, Lord Butler. I cannot believe that it
is beyond the wit of man to produce, in this legislation, a very clear
signal that review of certificates on Norwich Pharmacal proceedings can
proceed without impairing the renewal amendment. In those
circumstances, I wish to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="1303271000332" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-0003.htm#1303271000332">10

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord
Nash):</Member></B> My Lords, thank you for the opportunity to debate
the Government’s proposals for the reform of the national
curriculum in England. As noble Lords know, on 7 February, my right
honourable friend the Secretary of State for Education announced a
number of proposals to improve the content and design of the national
curriculum. These proposals are the product of a painstaking and
thorough review which the Department for Education has undertaken over
the past two years—a review that was launched with the
expressed aims of restoring rigour and high standards, ensuring that
all children are taught essential knowledge, skills and understanding
in the key subject disciplines, and granting teachers greater freedom
to design lessons that meet the needs of all pupils.</hs_para>

we are now consulting are the culmination of extensive analysis of
curricula used in the world’s most successful education
jurisdictions, particularly in the core subjects of English,
mathematics and science, and consideration of nearly 6,000 submissions
to our call for evidence. We have also engaged with teachers and head
teachers from across the country to learn more about the most
effective practice in England, and have worked with subject experts and
key organisations across all national curriculum subjects to inform our
thinking.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032665000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000005">The
launch of the consultation on our proposals last month was preceded by
a number of other publications of interest. In December 2011, the
review’s expert panel, chaired by the respected curriculum and
assessment expert Tim Oates, published its report. This set out a
series of recommendations for the new national curriculum framework. It
formed part of a wider suite of documents setting out the results of
the call for evidence and research conducted by the review. This
included a summary of evidence gathered about curricula for English,
maths and science in high-performing jurisdictions and a research
report on subject breadth in the curricula used in other education
jurisdictions.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:32:34"></hs_TimeCode> findings
uncovered consistent themes that have challenged some of the tenets of
our current system, showing, for example, that high-performing 
<?notus-xml column=234?>jurisdictions set higher expectations in terms of what they believe
children can and should master at different ages.</hs_para>

June 2012, we published draft programmes of study for primary English,
maths and science for wider discussion. Since then, we have discussed
the drafts with key subject organisations, teachers and subject
experts, and have reviewed the content in the light of the feedback we
received. These discussions have informed the draft national curriculum
that was published last
month.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000007">The new
curriculum upon which we are now consulting is both challenging and
ambitious. It benchmarks our expectations in the core subjects of
English, mathematics and science against those displayed by the highest
performing education jurisdictions.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032665000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000008">It is right to place
this debate in an international context and to learn from those who are
performing best. These jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong, Massachusetts
and Singapore, which are shown by international surveys of
pupils’ performance to consistently outperform England despite
the best efforts of our many excellent teachers, deliberately set out
to compare themselves against others, learning from other nations and
asking constantly what is required to help all children do
better.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032665000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000009">Let
me set out the scale of the challenge and how we are falling behind.
Our performance in maths in the TIMSS study of pupil performance at the
age of 10 has not improved since 2007, or at the age of 14. TIMSS
science results show a drop in performance—at age 10, our mean
score dropped markedly from 542 in 2007 to 529 in 2011, and at age 14
from 542 to 533. Our results in the PISA survey show that we are behind
high-performing jurisdictions in reading, with an above average spread
of attainment between pupils who do well and those who do
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000010">In the
most recent PIRLS 2011 study, England ranked 11th out of 45 countries
in the reading performance of pupils in the equivalent of year 5. Five
countries performed significantly better than England: Hong Kong, the
Russian Federation, Singapore, Finland and Northern Ireland. In the
most recent PISA 2009 study, England ranked 25th out of 65 countries in
the reading performance of pupils aged 15, falling from seventh in
2000; 28th out of 65 countries in the mathematics performance of pupils
aged 15, falling from eighth in 2000; and 16th out of 65 countries in
the science performance of pupils aged 15, falling from fourth in
2000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000011">Every
performance measure reinforces the scale of the challenge that we face.
In 2011, 18% of pupils in England left primary school without meeting
the current expected standard in English, and 20% in mathematics.
Employers and universities have also repeatedly highlighted school
leavers’ lack of proficiency in these subjects. In mathematics
specifically, England is among the countries with the lowest levels of
participation for 16 to 18 year-olds, with fewer than 20% of young
people studying mathematics to the age of 18. In most high-performing
jurisdictions, the study of maths in this age group is almost
universal. The Government have already set out their ambition for the
vast majority of young people to study mathematics to the age 
<?notus-xml column=235?>of 18. It is therefore vital that we act now to create a new
national curriculum that gives every child, regardless of their
background, a broad and balanced education so that, by the time their
compulsory education is complete, they are well equipped for further
study, future employment and adult
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:36:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000012">Beyond
ensuring that children are taught the essential knowledge in the key
subject disciplines, we want to give teachers greater freedom to use
their professionalism and expertise to help all children realise their
potential. As part of this, it is important that schools and the wider
public understand the difference between the statutory national
curriculum and the whole school curriculum. All schools must provide a
curriculum that is broadly based and balanced, of which the national
curriculum is just one part. The school curriculum could be described
as the way that schools bring the national curriculum to life and meet
the needs of all their pupils. To do so, teachers must have freedom:
freedom from top-down prescription and freedom to innovate. That is why
there will be no statutory document to accompany this new curriculum
telling teachers how to teach the subject content that it
defines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:37:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000013">This
is a huge cultural shift, but also a massive opportunity for teachers.
In providing greater flexibility for professionals, we have considered
changes to both curriculum breadth and depth. International evidence
shows that high-performing jurisdictions tend to promote a wide range
of subjects in compulsory education. We will therefore retain the
current subject composition of the national curriculum, with the
addition of foreign languages at key stage 2. Subject to the outcome of
this consultation, we will change the name of the subject currently
known as ICT to “computing” to better reflect its new
content<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:38:20"></hs_TimeCode>. We do
not believe that further prescription of subjects to be taught at key
stage 4 is necessary or appropriate; we are using other measures such
as the English baccalaureate to encourage more schools to offer a broad
academic education to all pupils—particularly the most
disadvantaged—to the age of 16, in line with our international
competitors.</hs_para>

Lords will be interested in some of the detail of the new curriculum.
As I have already mentioned, programmes of study in all
subjects—except primary English, mathematics and
science—have been significantly slimmed down, removing
unnecessary prescription about how to teach and setting out the
essential knowledge and skills which every child should master. In
primary English, maths and science, we have taken a conscious decision
to provide a higher degree of exemplification in order to ensure that
we achieve the step change in standards that is
essential<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:39:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

greater emphasis on reading for pleasure, and greater clarity on
spelling, punctuation and grammar. In mathematics, the new curriculum
will place a stronger emphasis on arithmetic and will include more
demanding content on fractions, decimals and percentages. In the
sciences, the programmes of study we have published include greater
detail on key scientific concepts and processes. The mathematical
aspects of science have been strengthened, and for the first time
primary schools will be expected to teach their pupils about evolution
and inheritance.</hs_para>

in line with practice in other countries and evidence about
children’s cognitive development, there will be an expectation
that foreign languages will be taught in primary schools. As well as
enhancing the status of languages in the school curriculum, this will
provide a better foundation for the teaching of languages in secondary
schools, where there will be new content on translation, grammar and
vocabulary at key stage
3.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000017">In
citizenship, our proposals make financial education statutory for the
first time, and similarly propose that practical cooking is compulsory
at key stage 3 in design and technology. In music we have balanced
performance and appreciation, and in art and design there is a stronger
emphasis on drawing skills and on the historical development of art. In
history, rather than a disconnected set of themes and topics, we have
set out a clear chronological narrative of British and world history.
In geography there is a greater emphasis on locational knowledge so
that pupils can use maps and locate key geographical features such as
oceans, cities and
continents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000018">In
PE, there is greater emphasis on competitive sport to build character
and self-esteem and to improve teamwork. As well as being valuable in
and of itself, this will help ensure that we build on the wonderful
legacy of the London Olympics. Finally, as I mentioned, we propose to
replace the old ICT curriculum with a new computing curriculum with a
focus on the principles of computer science and practical programming
skills to ensure that England retains a competitive edge in the growing
digital economy that will be key to our nation’s future economic
prosperity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000019">The
new curriculum will provide parents everywhere with a clear guide to
what their children should know and be able to do in every subject as
they make their way through school. It will also provide those schools
that are choosing to take advantage of the freedoms and opportunities
afforded by academy and free-school status with a reference point for
designing their own school curriculum. The consultation exercise on our
proposals will run until 16 April and we are keen to hear from everyone
with an interest before the new national curriculum is finalised and
published later this year. The timing of the debate is therefore
pertinent, and I welcome further discussion of these proposals.

Whitaker:</Member></B> My Lords, after that very helpful broad sweep I
will focus only on design, because its importance has not
been sufficiently realised. I congratulate the Secretary of
State on his decision to broaden the measures for judging a school
beyond English, maths and science to the pupil’s eight best
subjects. This enlightened and far-seeing decision leaves room for
design to become a subject of choice and for the fostering of centres
of excellence, which will be much to our national
advantage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000021">However,
the curriculum that is proposed needs some rethinking. Many others
think so, not least the 100 professors who wrote to the <I>Daily
Telegraph</I> last Wednesday. They pointed out that the skills of
problem-solving, critical understanding and creativity are losing 
<?notus-xml column=237?>out in the battle to raise standards. A proper design curriculum would
go far to fill that gap. I should say at the outset that no one wants
to lower standards, and that the Secretary of State’s attempt to
entrench rigour is well understood. However, the whole of the design
community, from practitioners to academics, is united behind wanting a
more relevant—in fact, a more rigorous—syllabus. The
Design Council has spoken of a “lost design generation”
if this element of the curriculum is not brought up to a modern
standard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000022">For
a start, there are two syllabi that feature design: art and design, and
design and technology. This is confusing. The idea of design in both
syllabi falls far short of what design means now. In the art and design
syllabus it seems to mean only the use of material and techniques for
executing works of craft and art. The design and technology syllabus,
too, concentrates on materials and includes cookery, mechanics,
maintenance and horticulture. There is nothing about digital
technology, one of our most promising design developments, and there is
a perfunctory nod to our great national tradition of invention and
design. It says that pupils
should,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13032665000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000110">“investigate

does this matter? Excellence in design is—at the
moment—one of our great national strengths. We export more than
£45 billion-worth of design-related goods and services to the EU
alone and about £18 billion- worth to Asia and
beyond, providing more than 900,000 jobs. Design-related goods
and services make for about 4.5% of total UK exports. We have a truly
world-class capability in design and it is highly export-facing. None
of that will last if we impoverish the design curriculum in schools. It
would also betray our historic prowess in innovation to forget, and
allow our children to forget, that it was our great tradition of
industrial and architectural design which created the economic basis
for our place among developed nations and, I would argue, quite a lot
of the social and cultural basis
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000024">How
should design be taught? Good model syllabi have been presented to the
Secretary of State by the Design Council and professional design
organisations. To summarise: design is a problem-solving,
multidisciplinary and collaborative process, which places the
user’s needs at its centre. Of course it uses materials and
techniques, but that is subordinate to developing the capacity to make
an idea for solving a problem into a reality. It is a sound
intellectual basis for many other capabilities and it fits its pupils
to become active citizens and agents of change. Its relation to art is
not the technical mastery that artists require to realise their vision,
but rather it is the bridge between arts, science and technology, which
enables the making of innovatory products and services. The hundred

opportunity to discuss this important matter. I want to speak as a
primary teacher on the primary school curriculum. The clue is in the
title: “draft”. It is a draft, and this is the
opportunity for us to give our own views. All of us, probably, have
been bombarded by different organisations claiming all sorts of
concerns. We only have to look back to the 1980s when the only subject
that was legally required to be taught at primary level was religious
education. Then there was the scandal of the William Tyndale school,
and of course Mr Baker—now the noble Lord, Lord
Baker—with his national curriculum of core and foundation
subjects. It is to his credit that a lot of that is still in place and
that many of the subject parts are

the most important thing of course about a curriculum is that it has to
give teachers the opportunity to teach. You can have the best national

about, “Why are we insisting that children at age 11 should know
their multiplication tables up to 12?”. It is part of
mathematics to know your tables. I do not subscribe to this nonsense
that perhaps there is too much reliance on spelling and punctuation. My

languages. I have sat on a Select Committee looking at how SMEs can be
encouraged to export more, and one of the key parts of that report said
that we should be teaching languages in our schools. The best way to
teach languages is with young children. There was a pilot in my home

year-olds, and the results were spectacular. Once this curriculum has
bedded in, perhaps we could visit that at some later

I have no argument with the Government’s policy of basic skills
such as reading and writing being improved, nor with maths, science,
English and foreign languages being emphasised and standards being
raised. However, I am concerned about what the Government have left
out. There is a real danger, given that schools’ resources are
finite, that if they are told to do subjects A, B and C but
no mention is made in the curriculum of D, E, F and G, they are going
to concentrate their resources on A, B and C. Of course they are; that
is how they will get rewards and a good Ofsted report, and it is what
the Government will give them more money for.</hs_para>

only one issue, which is of particular importance to me, but first I
should like to make this point. The Government’s position paper
speaks eloquently about the importance of clear aims in education
policy and the curriculum, but it fails to spell out clearly what those
aims are. They refer to the wider definition set out in the 2002 Act of
spiritual, moral and cultural development, but even that does 
<?notus-xml column=240?>not include social values, which I shall talk about in a moment. I can
find nothing in the Government’s proposals to suggest that they
recognise the importance of the so-called soft skills. Surely the
overriding aim of education must be to prepare young people for the
challenges, opportunities and responsibilities of adult life. Soft
skills play a key role in adult life. They are important for employment
and are crucial in establishing and sustaining a family and raising
children. Further, they can make a considerable contribution to
increasing social mobility in our society. I will not detail what the
soft skills are because I might take too long, but I expect that most

literacy and so

neurological research shows that a child’s experiences in the
first two years of life are a critical factor in that child’s
success in school and later in adult life. It is during the first two
years that a child learns the crucial emotional skills. It learns that
it is safe and valued, and it begins to learn to love and be loved.
That is why secure attachments in the very early years to one or two
dedicated carers, which Bowlby told us about 50 years ago when no one
believed him but have now been proved by biological science, is
fundamentally important to a child’s development. The Government
have responded to this research by introducing the early years
initiatives, excellently presented by Graham Allen MP. I strongly
support the programme, but standing alone, in my view, it is not
enough. We must do more to prepare all the nation’s young people
for adult life by helping them to acquire while at secondary school the
soft skills they will need for employment and to form stable

relegated to a very low priority in most secondary schools. In those
schools where it is covered at all, it is often taught by teachers with
no specialist training in the subject. To achieve this kind of

developed and then delivered by specialist teachers with experience.

modest things that the Minister might do to help this along. The first
would be to make mention in the current revised curriculum of the
importance of developing soft skills. Reference should be made to the
importance of these skills outside the narrow curriculum, but certainly
in the wider one, or how will schools know what their priorities should
be? They have a limited amount of money and a limited number of
teachers. The second would be to bring together an expert advisory
group to prepare a report on the best ways to give secondary school
pupils the opportunity to prepare for adult life, while the third would
be to sponsor a pilot project at a major teacher training institution
to undertake an experimental course training specialist teachers to
deliver such a course interactively, led by young people’s own
needs and
interests.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_26_PT_1/513A656016636AF9CB3EEB156AC20CE18B5BB6BC" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 March 2013">Tuesday,

Black of Brentwood:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my noble
friend on the admirable way in his excellent opening speech in which he
summed up the issues facing us. This debate offers us all the
opportunities 
<?notus-xml column=241?>that a bran tub presents to a small child—so many possibilities.
Part of me wanted to talk, like the noble Lord, Lord Storey, about
history. Part of me wanted to talk about music, but I hope that the
noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, may do so later. I want to talk about
animal welfare and its place in the national curriculum, in particular
relating to domestic animals and pets. It is proper for me to declare a
feline interest as an owner of a venerable Russian Blue cat, Victoria,
who is 17 next month. I had her and her welfare very much in mind while
I have been putting together these
remarks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000042">Despite
the wonderful work of many animal welfare charities—I think in
particular of Cats Protection, which is the UK’s leading feline
welfare charity and has helped more than 1 million cats in the past
five years—there is still an endemic problem within our society
relating to animal welfare. In 2011, the last year for which a full set
of statistics was available, more than 126,000 dogs were allowed to
stray by their owners, which represents an increase of 30% in three
years. In the same year, Cats Protection rehomed and reunited 48,000
cats and kittens. Blue Cross experienced an increase of 57% in the
number of unwanted rabbits that they were asked to rehome. Most
worryingly, PDSA research shows that of the estimated 22 million pets
in the UK, more than 10 million may not be having their welfare needs
met.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032665000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000043">The
reasons behind such shocking and alarming figures are no doubt complex.
In some ways they reflect the state of the economy, among other things.
However, it is inevitable that education, or indeed lack of it, about
animal welfare is one of those reasons. Problems of neglect, cruelty
and abandonment often happen because people do not understand what a
pet needs and how to care for it. One of the best ways, over time, to
tackle this issue is therefore to ensure that children are taught
properly about how to care for pets. Children, after all, are the pet
owners of the future. Yet, currently only 16% of children are taught
about caring for a domestic animal, despite the fact that more than 60%
of children will be from homes keeping a pet. This is not a marginal
issue but one that clearly relates to the majority of
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000044">Our
animal welfare charities, which so often are unsung heroes, do what
they can to train young people in animal welfare issues. Battersea Dogs
and Cats Home, Blue Cross, Cats Protection, Dogs Trust and PDSA
delivered education talks to more than 175,000 children in 2011. There
is a big appetite in schools for information and training in this area.
A survey for the Pet Food Manufacturers Association in 2012 found that
78% of primary school teachers and 70% of secondary school teachers
agreed that it was important to teach younger children responsibility
through learning to care for pets. The RSPCA ran courses for nearly
4,000 teachers in
2011.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000045">However,
there will always be a limit to what voluntary bodies with tight
resources, limited manpower and uneven geographical spread can
achieve—and here the national curriculum is therefore vital. It
is very good that the draft curriculum makes reference to the basic
needs of animals within the year 2 primary science curriculum, but this
relates only to survival and the need for water, food and air. However,
an 
<?notus-xml column=242?>animal’s needs are not limited to those. There are, in fact, as
the Animal Welfare Act 2006 sets out, five basic welfare
needs—environment, diet, behaviour, companionship, and
prevention of pain, suffering and disease—which contribute to a
healthy and happy life for our pets. All need to be
learnt.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000046">A new
subject does not need to be added to the curriculum to deal with this
issue, nor does it cross the vital line that my noble friend mentioned
of becoming involved in how a teacher teaches. All that is necessary is
for the current reference to basic needs to be amended slightly to
allow teachers the flexibility and scope to teach about all five
welfare needs, linking them to scientific knowledge and concepts within
their lessons. In short, the concept of development needs to be placed
alongside survival in the year 2 curriculum. Such a tiny change could
bring benefit of real significance, not just to many defenceless
animals in the future but to the way in which children grow and
develop. Teaching children from an early age about the importance of
caring for pets will help them to integrate effectively with others and
understand the importance of responsibility, something that has
profound benefits for society as a
whole.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000047">It is,
as they say, a win-win scenario that I urge my noble friend to accept,
and one which will not make any greater burden on teachers or require
surgery to the draft curriculum. I hope that my noble friend the
Minister will undertake to look further at this
matter.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13032665000119" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000119"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:04:24"></hs_TimeCode>4.04

Coussins:</Member></B> My Lords, I will focus on modern foreign
languages and declare an interest as chair of the all-party group on
modern languages. The reasons why learning a language is important are
clearly not controversial, judging by the Education Secretary’s
recent comments. It improves oracy and literacy in English and has
all-round cognitive benefits. As Mr Gove put it:</hs_para>

will, however, be unintended consequences of the new language
curriculum for the system of adequate secondary school accountability
unless certain issues are resolved upfront. The Government are quite
right to commit to statutory languages at key stage 2. The Language
Trends survey, published only last week, shows that 97% of primary
schools are doing this already, but this figure masks some critical
problems and disparities which could make the policy backfire. Nearly a
quarter of primary schools have no staff with foreign language
competence beyond GCSE and some are even worse off. Will the Minister
tell us what investment the Government will make in the support,
training, guidance and recruitment of suitable teachers so that all
18,000 primary schools are properly equipped by September
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:05:58"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

secondary also requires attention. Teachers in year 7 commonly start
all over again with languages, because children arrive with such
different 
<?notus-xml column=243?>levels of achievement. This demoralises and demotivates them. Will the
Government encourage schools to use either the languages ladder or the
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages to help?</hs_para>

Government propose a list of seven languages to choose from, but I fear
that this may exacerbate the transition problem. Perhaps key stage 2
should be confined to French, except where an LEA-wide agreement exists
between all primary and secondary schools to teach another language.
This is the case in Hackney with Spanish and guarantees continuity and
progression. In general, however, French is the only language for which
there is a realistic hope of finding enough teachers and for which
progression to secondary school could be planned and
achieved.</hs_para>

should not stop additional languages being offered at key stage
3—and not just Spanish and German. Other languages identified by
the recent British Academy report as important for British
international and commercial interests include Cantonese, Arabic and
Turkish. Will the Minister look at reinstating the Asset Languages
qualifications, withdrawn by the OCR? It is short-sighted to praise the
language skills of children who speak what we call community languages,
but to deny them the opportunity to turn their casual or domestic level
of competence into something more academic and professionally
useful.</hs_para>

rather shocking piece of information was reported to the all-party
group the other week by the head teacher of one of the specialist
language-teaching schools. She told us that she had met primary heads
who were saying openly that they planned to apply for their schools to
become academies to avoid the national curriculum requirement to teach
foreign languages. I would like to hear the Minister confirm that this
is not only undesirable, but wholly unacceptable, and tell us what the
Government will do to prevent any school becoming an academy in order
to avoid offering modern
languages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:08:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

3 and 4, the Language Trends survey shows very positive teacher
feedback in favour of terminal exams as proposed by the Government.
However, the Government should think again about their new secondary
school accountability system based on the first eight GCSEs. This would
allow schools to get their points whether the pupils take languages or
not. The LTS shows that the boost to take-up from the EBacc last year
has been sustained, which is good, but it has not increased, despite
the Government’s forecast that the EBacc would transform
languages’ take-up. Will the Minister accept that, unless
languages are compulsory at key stage 4, take-up will never get back to
its 2004
level<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:08:53"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

be compulsory at key stage 3, but the survey revealed that
one in five state schools disapplies lower-ability pupils. On top of
that, a quarter of state schools have shrunk key stage 3 to two years,
leaving us with large numbers of children with hardly any language
learning at all. What will the Government do to reinforce compulsory
languages at key stage 3? They should be spearheading a national
languages recovery programme to create a coherent, statutory languages
pathway from key stage 2 right 
<?notus-xml column=244?>through to the end of compulsory education, just as there is for maths.
There are some welcome aspects of the proposed new languages

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, welcome several aspects of the
proposals of the new national curriculum. I welcome the idea of
languages from age seven. There is evidence that if a child learns a
second language early, he will find it easier to learn other languages
later and it is generally advantageous to his cognitive development. Is
seven too young? No. Many children in my neck of the woods learn Welsh
and English at the same time from day one, and my grandchildren learnt
English and Chinese from day one. However, how about including language
experience courses in primary schools, rather than just forcing schools
to choose from a restricted list of languages? That would avoid many of
the problems outlined by the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins.</hs_para>

same time we also address the lack of careers advice about
opportunities in the industry, young people will still not choose the
subject. Where will the teachers come from? The main problem is a lack
of enough teachers with the right knowledge and experience. Here there
is good news. Last week I went to a presentation, hosted by the noble
Lord, Lord Empey, at which a presentation was made by major players in
the industry, and it became clear to me that there is enormous
enthusiasm and desire to help schools and universities produce
appropriately qualified young IT specialists. The Government must
harness this enthusiasm. Indeed, there is no other way of staffing
schools and universities to do the job, so there must be a true
partnership between the Department for Education, BIS and the

rest of the science curriculum must also be relevant to the major
global issues of our time. Why cut out debate about climate change from
geography and put a mere mention of it into chemistry? This aspect of
the proposals was criticised by Sir David King, the former Government
Chief Scientific Adviser. That is not all, though; food security is
mentioned only in passing. Why not include issues about the
catastrophic effects of the loss of biodiversity? This serious global
problem, usually caused by habitat destruction, is responsible for
poverty; the loss of food 
<?notus-xml column=245?>security, water security and many valuable medicinal plants; the loss of
sustainable livelihoods for some of the world’s poorest people;
the reduction in the ability of the natural world to adapt to the
inevitable climate change; and much else. In other words, it is an
absolute disaster, the scale of which we have yet to see but will come
to regret, and there is no mention of it in the science curriculum.
Neither is there any mention of engineering, which we are told will
solve the energy crisis. I hope that creative science teachers will use
their newfound freedoms to introduce these enormously important
subjects into their teaching. The science curriculum is one that I
would have recognised when I was at school more than five decades

also regret the absence of PSHE. How can a school offer a broad and
balanced curriculum and prepare a child for the challenges and
opportunities of life without the elements of PSHE? However, at least
science is statutory, so it is important that science includes the most
important elements of PSHE, including relationship and sex
education—and note that it should be that way around. The
science curriculum should teach pupils about growing up and cover sex
with honesty and confidence. It should adopt clear, open language and a
positive tone relating to human reproduction and health, and should
include young people from the gay and lesbian community without
embarrassment.</hs_para>

should be engaged with this part of the curriculum and it should be
age-appropriate, but it should certainly be timely. Children should
know about puberty before it happens to them—that is, at key
stage 2. At key stage 3, the current content on sexual health and
disease, contraception and adolescence should be retained and
information about hormones and abortion should be added. However, it is
difficult to include in science those parts of a good PSHE curriculum
that foster self-respect, confidence and the respect for others that
cuts down bullying in schools and makes children their own best
protectors. Now is not the time to squander the opportunity of ensuring
that all children are given the sort of education that will enable them

Government have indeed solicited advice from the best educational

are faced with a proposed system in which some subjects are more equal
than others. If we are to help young people to contribute to the life
of the nation, why has citizenship been demoted and why are ethics,
religion and philosophy not in the academic core, as in the French
bacc? If personal development is a cornerstone of good learning, why

Lucas:</Member></B> My Lords, I am a great fan of the national
curriculum review. It is set out with the right principles underlying
it of increasing emphasis on knowledge and on ambition and is well
executed. The current consultation is a real consultation. I have had
several conversations with departmental officials and found them more
than willing to listen. I am hoping that today we shall have an example
of a Minister who is more than willing to listen. We shall see.
Therefore, I encourage my noble friend Lord Storey to write in and say
what he wants to say about sex education. I suspect that
some members of the ministerial team live quite sheltered lives down in
Sussex and Norfolk. I can tell them—as I am sure the noble Lord,
Lord Nash, can—that life in central London is a bit different
and that the worst bits of the internet are well into primary schools
in year 5, and we want our children to be helped to resist them and
overcome them. Leaving things until secondary school is not good
enough. However, as I say, I encourage my noble friend and others to
write in and say

very much hope that my right honourable friend will resist those of the

we have got history away from the academics who think that history is
about studying history, and to understand that it is about
people—us—our roots and why we are and who we are. I
encourage him to get through the whole of British history in the
primary curriculum. Simon Jenkins compresses it into 250 very readable
pages, which I hope my daughter will get through in six months, or
perhaps rather less, at a rate of a chapter a day. History is not a

noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, focused on the design and technology
curriculum. It has, indeed, been filleted. All that is left is
horticulture, cooking and DIY. Therefore, I very much hope that my
noble friend the Minister will say to his colleague Michael Gove,
“Look at what has been done here. This is the most marvellous
opportunity. Here we have a subject which has imploded on itself,
where, in most schools in the country, the teaching is disconnected
from anything else. There is far too much low-quality teaching in craft
and design and where we have swept it out of the curriculum let
us put something in its place. Why don’t you, Michael, do what
you have done so triumphantly in computing and challenge the
engineering, design and materials industry to come up with something
worth while in this space because technology has now made this
possible? You can get, at no great price, decent computers. You can get
very good programmes to put on them. You can get lovely machines to
stick on the end of both of that—things like 3D printers and
computer-controlled routers and laser cutters. You can create quite
sophisticated things. Put an end to these useless wooden bookshelves
that fall apart on the second day of use and start to create in this
space something which should be the foundation for pupils to enjoy
engineering and take a real delight in what they can do and create, and
a foundation for people  
<?notus-xml column=248?>who will go on enthusiastically to careers in engineering, design and
other such areas”. If we do this, we will find that what emerges
in the design and technology space supports what we want to see being
done in the main subjects. Mathematics can be brought back at an
advanced level. You can take the sort of approach that Conrad Wolfram
wants and bring really sophisticated mathematical analysis into how to
make something of a particular shape. There is an awful lot of physics
in studying how to build something and then control it
properly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:25:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

will arise to deal with the presently separate art and design
curriculums because they will be using computers. Schools are being
given the opportunity to create real interfaces with business because
when they are equipped with this kit, which as I say is not a great
price, they will have something that every small and medium-sized
enterprise involved in manufacturing will envy and want to come and use
out of hours. They will want to co-operate with the school, which means
that the school will have access to people in industry. The kit is up
to date and what people in industry as well as schools want, and there
will be real opportunities for creating the kind of collaboration that
we would like to see. Beyond everything else, it would make sense of
the opportunities being provided by the new computing curriculum. I
hope very much that this is a cause which my noble friend will
espouse.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13032665000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000123"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:26:07"></hs_TimeCode></I>4.26

Sutherland of Houndwood:</Member></B> My Lords, in view of the points I
am about to make, I have to declare two interests. I shall be speaking
briefly about Ofsted, so I should declare that I was formerly a Chief
Inspector of Schools. I also declare an interest in computing and
computer science, so I warmly support the points that have been made,
not least about the presence of IT in design. I am the non-executive
chairman of a company called Frog Trade which operates in Halifax and
employs 90 software engineers, many of whom are recruited locally. The
absence of appropriate training in schools will be a difficulty. Frog
Trade supplies more than 20% of English secondary state schools with
their IT and software, and will be supplying every mainland Malaysian
school with IT and software products. That is a sign of the importance
of having this discipline embedded in young people’s
development. It is there anyway, so we might as well support it in the
curriculum<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:27:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

offer some statistics. I repeat without apology two that were given to
us by the noble Lord in introducing the debate. In 2011, some 18% of
pupils in England left primary school without meeting the current
expected standards in English, while 20% did not meet the expected
standard in maths. I shall add two further statistics to those. Some
30% of 16 year-olds do not achieve the expected standards of literacy,
and the real shocker is that over half of those who are serving
sentences in Her Majesty’s prisons are functionally illiterate
and innumerate. We are failing many young people in our society, and
that alone is justification enough for looking once again at the
priorities that must deliver an education to deal with these
problems.</hs_para>

I can give some bold and rational advice. Following on from Micawber,
if there are 36 teaching hours in a week and we provide material for 37
actual hours of teaching, the result will be frustration and bad
education. If there are 36 teaching hours and we provide 35 hours of
content, perhaps professionalism and balance in education will be part
of our legacy. It means that we have to be careful not to say that
everything should go into the curriculum. One of the great heresies is
this: if something must be learnt, it must be in the school curriculum.
That is a mistake. My grandchildren pick up huge amounts of learning
from what are sometimes rather dubious forms of education. Indeed, if I
were pushing my special area, I would be arguing that Socratic dialogue
should be compulsory for all students at key stages 2, 3 and 4, but I

is one of the three great pillars of our education system. One pillar
deals with content, which is the curriculum, one deals with standards
in the form of national testing, and the last deals with
accountability, which is national inspection. All three play an
important part. The danger in this consultation—this is where I
differ from the force of the papers that we received—is that we
select this one topic, the national curriculum, without looking at the
impact on the other two areas, which are
significant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:30:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

some of the other heresies to demonstrate what I mean. Heresy one is
that it is too readily assumed that only the examined in education are
likely to be taken seriously or to be of any value at all. We assume
that examination is the criterion of importance. This is the head
teachers’ heresy. Head teachers who bow to this principle in
what they do should be
condemned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:30:40"></hs_TimeCode>.
Heresy two closely follows this—the twin educational sins of
teaching to the test and focusing on those students who might be coaxed
from grade D to grade C. This is the bad teachers’ heresy. The
third heresy, which has been mentioned, is that the national curriculum
is to be equated with the school curriculum. This is the lobby
groups’ heresy. It is not true that one overlaps completely with
the others. The principle behind what we are talking about is that
there should be a core—for the statistical reasons that I have
given, if no others—but there should be a balanced
education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:31:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

place significantly through examinations, but it is limited
accountability. Ofsted is the other source of accountability and I
suggest to the Minister that he takes back to his colleagues the idea
that Ofsted be tasked with looking at those areas of the curriculum
that are perhaps not in the core but encourage soft skills that deal
with PSHE, and with making explicit judgments on schools and their
success in providing whole-pupil education in a balanced form. Perhaps
that is the stick that is needed, and Ofsted could provide it. I hope
that that idea can be taken forward, and I am pleased that there is
consultation on accountability as well as on the
curriculum<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:32:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_26_PT_1/61B69C7EADEAAF1E324E043C3D238A7D20012559" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 March 2013">Tuesday,

decline in numbers of computer science graduates. The UK Council of

an undersupply of skilled developers and technicians within the UK, and
technology firms blame ill designed university syllabuses and a lack of
understanding at all levels of the education system. The number of
young people studying IT has fallen correspondingly with the standard
of ICT teaching from school to university over the past 15 years.

least your schools have the freedom to teach what they want. In France,
if it is the second Tuesday in March, you know that a 10 year-old will
be on chapter 2 of the green textbook”. I fear that in the
succeeding decade England has moved too much in the French
direction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:39:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000091">The
French also liked our philosophy of developing children as thinkers and
independent learners. Now, a decade on, too many children are taught to
the test, whether or not they have learnt the foundations beneath it. A
university lecturer friend told me last week that she despairs of
students who come to her and ask what they need to learn to pass.
“I just want you to learn to think,” she
replies.</hs_para>

should be a guide on the side, not a sage on the stage dictating every
detail of what our children must learn. We should focus on pupil and
student attainment and give the thousands of excellent teachers the
flexibility to deliver it in the professional way that they know best.
A minimum curriculum must ensure that our pupils can read and write,
are numerate and have the appropriate ICT skills. Without these, they

an employer recruiting graduates in the financial services sector. They
had whittled down more than 160 applications to 14 that they could even
contemplate shortlisting, on the basis of literacy and presentation in
CVs. One candidate, a graduate with a very good degree, had written the
paragraph on why they were suitable entirely in capital letters and
with no punctuation. Others did not even get that far, leaving this
vital personalising paragraph empty. It is no wonder that employers say
that our education system is not equipping enough students with the

curriculum to ensure that young people get those skills, and we need to
broaden the offer at 16 to 19 to make it the norm for all students to
achieve a level 3 in both English and maths. This might be applied
English or applied maths, as are relevant for their future studies. My
son, for example, did statistics in the lower sixth form to go
alongside psychology, which he then read at university; that was
extremely helpful to him. There could be written English for engineers

learn to write later on.</hs_para>

many strengths of the A-level system in depth unfortunately mean that
too many students give up maths of English at 16—far too early.
We are one of the few OECD countries to allow this. Even Scotland, with
its excellent Highers, keeps that breadth of English and maths at 16.
For some schools, the international baccalaureate does the same but I
am not convinced that the EBacc at 16 to 18 will do it, because of the
lack of
compulsion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:42:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032665000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032665000096">The
proposed key stage 4 curriculums in English and maths are challenging;
taught well, they will give students an excellent foundation for later
learning, whether in vocational or academic environments. They look
surprisingly similar to the American systems, but the difference
between our countries is that American students are expected to
continue with both. Our system does not, and this explains the low
take-up of maths to which the Minister referred in his opening speech.
Will the Minister tell us whether the Government intend to broaden the
curriculum to ensure that  16 year-olds continue with both
maths and English until they leave formal education and training at 18
and/or attain a level 3 qualification in maths and

national curriculum can be so much the product of those—some
might say of a single individual—who, in their day-to-day work,
have such an overtly political agenda. Surely our country’s
national curriculum should be in the hands of an expert independent
commission, at arm’s length from Ministers. If the national
curriculum still has significance when the voting age is reduced to
16—as I think will happen—there will be an even greater
need for the content of national school education to be as free as
possible from political interference. Will the Minister tell us whether
the coalition would consider taking the planning of the national
curriculum out of ministerial hands, and make it wholly independent of

school education should give students basic information and frameworks
in which to work. Beyond that, it should provide them with the
wherewithal to think for themselves. At least by their teens, young

politics, among
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032674000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032674000003"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:44:31"></hs_TimeCode>Following

that the failures which the Government claim are occurring at primary

not asking to be treated as better than sciences, but
to  
<?notus-xml column=254?>have parity. Art, design and music are given some space, but there is a
fine balance between inordinate prescription and neglect. Apart from
fleeting references on page 7, there is no mention of dance, film and
animation, digital media or photography, while drama is mentioned in
the English guidance notes. These are holes in the national curriculum.
Along with many others, Alistair Spalding, the artistic director of

curriculum has an old-fashioned and absolutist feel. It ignores the
idea of critical looking and debate. In their teens, pupils can be
engaged with contemporary art, which represents a significant area of
modern-day visual literacy. Also, as others have pointed out, the term
“great artist” should be replaced by “significant
artist”. Who is and is not “great” is a part of
the debate, while greatness is itself a debatable term. Will the

Quirk:</Member></B> My Lords, there is a great deal that I like in the
new curriculum. Of course, not all that I like is new, and not all that
is new is to my liking. Let me begin on the cheery side. I like the
goals and the direction of travel. I like the way that vocabulary and
language development are explicitly spread out across the whole range
of core and foundation subjects. I also like the way that two of the
core subjects, maths and English, are accorded special status; rightly
so, because of their uniquely dual role in education, a point that was
noted by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, and the noble Baroness, Lady
Brinton. It is my understanding that English and maths will be taught 
<?notus-xml column=255?>up to the age of 18 in the event that pupils have not achieved a
satisfactory level at GCSE. It is vital that we get these two subjects
right.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032674000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032674000010">Well,
those who designed the maths curriculum seem to have risen to the
challenge. We find a well thought out pedagogical progression, step by
step, year by year, together with the gradual introduction of the
requisite vocabulary. It is just dismaying to compare this with
English, where the people responsible seem to have lost their way or
never found it. They do not seem, for example, to have taken on board
the clear injunction laid down when the review process began in January
2011: namely, that they should study and emulate the corresponding
curricula in the world’s most “high-performing
jurisdictions”, a phrase that the Minister himself used earlier
this afternoon.</hs_para>

have learnt a great deal from programmes for teaching the mother tongue
in countries not as far as Hong Kong or even Massachusetts but
neighbouring countries such as France, the Netherlands, and Germany.
There is little sign that they even tried. There are many other and
more overt defects. The most obvious is the gross unevenness: for
example, dozens of pages are devoted to KS 1 and 2 while key stage 3 is
dismissed with barely a wave, yet this, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Walmsley, reminded us, is when puberty-fired youngsters are at their
most restlessly keen to explore, and when teachers—God help
them—need all the supportive guidance they can

there is the unnerving difference in expertise as we pass from one
content area of the English curriculum to the next. By far the most
professional is the treatment of spelling, with its
formidable and convincing step-by-step progression, laid out
in extraordinary detail and at extraordinary length. The treatment of
grammar is far less professional, both linguistically and
pedagogically. There are, I grant, glimpses of attempts at something
more sophisticated than the old preoccupation with a few shibboleths,
but such efforts are lost in muddle and inconsistency and dumbed down
in a curious diffidence. I am told on the grapevine that the note of
nervous apology is because many teachers, and teacher trainers, still
hanker after the grammarless “anything goes” days of
yore, when standard English was the butt of smear and sneer. Others at
the DfE whisper, “No, no, it’s not
that—it’s because teachers are frightened of grammar and
the arcane terminology”. Well, I just do not buy that.
Teachers—in many cases, the same teachers—take in their
stride the no less arcane terminology of maths and science with their
square roots and quadratic equations, their molecules and precipitates.
They happily and confidently explain the difference between sulphate
and sulphite and sulphide, so why not the difference between semantic
inverses such as imply and infer? If grammar is prescribed diffidently
and inconsistently, lexicology, semantics, and the vital matter of
vocabulary networks seem beyond the DfE

is no sign of linguistic professionalism to help teachers build on
children’s hungry interest in naming things and finding better
ways of describing them, and no sign of any step-by-step progression
in  
<?notus-xml column=256?>enriching pupils’ word-stock. Yet this is the very soul and
centre of language. Like others, I have provided the DfE with detailed
criticism and, serious as the defects are, they can be speedily put

implemented.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032674000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032674000014"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:44:59"></hs_TimeCode>But
I am left with worries that cannot be so readily dispelled. Getting a
good curriculum agreed is one thing; getting it taught across the
country is quite another, as the noble Lord, Lord Storey, said. Are the
many thousands of teachers in post willing to teach it and are they
equipped to do so? There is much in the curriculum that will be
unfamiliar to them.

by how much we and the next generation take them into our working

what books you read at school. They instantly give you away. The
national curriculum creates a national presence and culture in society.
There is never a perfect solution, and whatever we come up with, we
will always be criticised. There will always be competing views on
either side, but it does not alter the fact that we should always have

Some children undoubtedly flourish in such an environment but, for
others, learning becomes a miserable and frustrating treadmill that can
put them off the whole educational experience. This is why we have
major concerns about the move to revert back to exams as the sole
measure of success. I was surprised to hear what the noble Lord, Lord
Sutherland, had to say on this because, contrary to him, I believe that
that takes a lot of teacher creativity out of the system and inevitably
leads to teachers being put under pressure to teach to the test. The
noble Lord seemed to imply that that was a heresy, but there is
probably a lot of anecdotal evidence to support my
position.</hs_para>

politicians and instead set up an independent body, an office for

grateful for the comments on soft skills made by the noble Lord, Lord
Northbourne. As he knows, I share his views about their vital
importance. As noble Lords are aware, the outcome of the PSHE review
was announced last week. PSHE remains an important and necessary part
of all pupils’ education, but teachers need flexibility to
deliver high-quality PSHE and are best placed to understand the needs
of their pupils. This will not come from additional central
prescription. Therefore, PSHE will remain a non-statutory subject,
without new standardised frameworks or programmes of study. My
honourable friend Elizabeth Truss wrote to Sir Michael Wilshaw last
week, asking Ofsted to draw up a guide to effective PSHE
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032674000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032674000035">Aspects
of PSHE will continue to be taught throughout the statutory curriculum.
In science, pupils will learn about the structure and function of the
male and female reproductive systems, and the menstrual cycle. In both
science and PE, children will learn about the benefits of a healthy
lifestyle, including the impact on the body of diet, exercise and
drugs. In maths and citizenship, children will receive financial
education, including learning about wages, taxes, credit and debt. 
<?notus-xml column=260?>In designing appropriate PSHE content for school curricula, teachers

schools today have to focus more on PSHE. With the collapse in many
areas of family life as a result of the high incidence of absent
fathers, the absence of religion in many children’s lives and
the prevalence of gang culture, the only constant in many
children’s lives—the only brick—is their school.
All children in the modern world face a variety of issues and schools
have to do much more on what was called the pastoral front than they
used to. This is meat and drink to good schools and we expect all
schools to emulate what the good ones do. We trust teachers and head
teachers to adapt what they do to their own particular circumstances.
We are not arguing about the necessity for PSHE, and no one feels more
strongly about the need for it than I do, having seen the effect at
first hand of what really good pastoral, inclusion, behaviour and
raising aspirations programmes, which of course include PSHE as a part,
can have on disaffected children. However, we do not feel that it is
appropriate to legislate for it. We should leave teachers free to teach
what is appropriate to their circumstances. However, we have asked a
specific question in the consultation about our proposed aims for the
national curriculum and we will take all views into account before
finalising them.</hs_para>

Black of Brentwood commented on animal welfare. It is not the role of
the national curriculum to prescribe everything that might valuably be
taught to children. We are slimming down the national curriculum to
focus on essential knowledge in core subjects. The draft primary
science curriculum requires pupils to be taught about the needs of
animals, including food, water and so on, and the care of animals is
something that we would expect all good schools to cover in their wider
curriculum as part of the soft skills. However, we will look further
into this matter.</hs_para>

Lady Coussins, talked about languages. The evidence shows that we have
a strong basis on which to build the new expectation that foreign
languages will be taught in primary schools. A recent survey conducted

the Independent Schools’ Modern Languages Association found that
97% of primary schools are already teaching a language, and that more
than 80% are reasonably confident about meeting the statutory
requirement for 2014. Evidence, including some from other countries,
shows that children benefit from being taught languages at an early
stage. They can inspire children with a love of language that will stay
with them throughout their secondary education and beyond. For this
reason, we are opening up the choice of languages beyond the European
and modern languages by including Mandarin, Latin and Ancient Greek. It
is right that we give our pupils this opportunity and provide a better
foundation for the teaching of languages in secondary

the new key stage 3 second language education, the Teaching Agency is
facilitating an expert group chaired by a leading primary head teacher

moment to develop the signposting of resources, the identification of
high-quality teaching materials that are freely available, and looking
at ways in which initial teacher training in schools can best prepare
for the introduction in 2014. On schools becoming academies to avoid
language teaching, we welcome schools becoming academies, but we are
not encouraging them to do so for this reason. The national curriculum

outlined in my opening speech, the draft national curriculum on which

national curriculum will change this and will also give schools more
freedom over the curriculum and teaching, not less. The new national
curriculum acknowledges the vital role of knowledge in education and is
based on up-to-date, cutting-edge

pupils need to know within clear subject taxonomies. To quote the

challengeable: thinking well requires knowing facts, and that’s
true not simply because you need something to think about. The very

undertaken by the Sub-Committee on Economic and Financial Affairs,
which I have the honour to chair. The report 
<?notus-xml column=265?>was published in July 2012, and was based on evidence received from a
number of practitioners and experts in the operation of financial
markets. The committee was also assisted in its work by Professor lain
MacNeil, Alexander Stone Chair of Commercial Law at the University of
Glasgow, who acted as specialist adviser for the inquiry. I thank him

proposal for a directive and regulation on markets in financial
instruments is a complex legislative package, as our seven-page
glossary indicates, but it is also extremely important. The original
MiFID package, which came into effect in November 2007, is the
foundation of the EU regulatory framework for investment firms. These
firms encompass a wide range of activity such as global investment
banks trading complex securities, fund managers investing pension
funds, stock-broking firms and small high street financial advisers
providing financial advice to the general public. The
Commission’s objectives were to open up trading in securities to
competition, to apply equivalent regulatory rules to different market
models which perform similar functions and to enhance, standardise and
harmonise investor protection across the European
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T17:39:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000003">The
new proposal, known as MiFID II, seeks to respond to deficiencies in
the MiFID I regime exposed by the recent financial crisis. It focuses
in particular on addressing problems that have arisen from the
expansion in over-the-counter (OTC) trading, including the transparency
of such trading. It seeks to shift trading from the more opaque OTC
market to more transparent organised markets, in line with the
September 2009 G20 commitment to tackle the less regulated and more
opaque parts of the financial system by the end of
2012.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000004">The
committee’s starting point was to ask whether a review of MiFID
I was even necessary. We found that it was, particularly given the
technological advances that had taken place since it came into force.
Some witnesses told us that the Commission’s proposals were a
“good starting point” for negotiations. However, we
warned of the damage that would be created by hastily or poorly drafted
legislation. These concerns were heightened by the evidence we heard
that, while some of the proposals were based on sound principles, there
were significant flaws in the Commission’s draft. We identified
six such central
flaws.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000005">First,
we warned that the proposal for a new category of organised trading
facility risked creating an overly complex regulatory framework which
did not distinguish clearly between organised venues and OTC. We feared
that the implications of the proposal had not been fully assessed. We
were particularly concerned about the proposal for a ban on “own
capital”—that is, the ability of the trader to use his or
her own resources to trade on other people’s behalf—and
the amount of detail left to delegated
acts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000006">Secondly,
while the post-trade transparency provisions held much merit, the
pre-trade transparency proposals did not take into account the markedly
different characteristics of each sector of the market, particularly in
terms of liquidity. The requirement for disclosure could compromise the
ability for competition to flourish. We warned against a
one-size-fits-all approach to 
<?notus-xml column=266?>transparency that could have a negative impact on bond markets. We
called for a more flexible approach that, while recognising the
benefits of transparency, would allow the market to operate
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000007">Thirdly,
the Commission also proposed to regulate algorithmic and high-frequency
trading. HFT remains a deeply controversial activity and there is a
wide spectrum of views about its utility. We recognised the case for
circuit breakers, but were concerned that the scope of the proposals
was too broad and did not adequately differentiate between algorithmic
trading and high-frequency trading. In particular, we warned that the
proposal to require algorithmic trading strategies to be in place
throughout the trading day was likely to have a detrimental effect on
financial
markets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000008">Fourthly,
the Commission’s proposals on third country access were deeply
flawed. They created a risk that third country firms could find
themselves locked out of EU markets, creating the spectre of regulatory
retaliation. Such effects could have a particularly damaging effect on
the City of London. At the very least, lengthy transitional regimes for
existing third country firms were
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000009">Fifthly,
the Commission proposed a number of steps to strengthen investor
protection and corporate governance, yet the proposal to restrict the
ban on inducements to independent advisers was in our view unworkable,
since advisers would simply take steps to avoid being classified as
independent. Likewise, the Commission’s proposals on corporate
governance were overly prescriptive and did not take account of the
diverse size, capacity and business models of the range of market
participants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000010">Finally,
we found that, while the European Securities and Markets Authority had
a vital role to play in co-ordinating regulation of financial markets
across the European Union, there was less consensus about the degree to
which it should engage in direct regulation of the financial markets,
as suggested in the Commission’s proposals for ESMA to take on
product intervention powers. In the light of these flaws, we urged the
UK Government, the Commission, the Council and indeed the European
Parliament to take all the steps necessary to ensure that the
legislation was fit for purpose before it came into
force.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000011">What
has happened in the nine months since our report was published? The
Government’s response, received in October, expressed sympathy
with many of the points raised in our report, and we are grateful to
the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, the right honourable Greg
Clark MP, for keeping us updated on negotiations in the months since.
We are aware that negotiations have moved forward, and that significant
amendments have been advanced. For instance, progress has been made in
Council on improving the provisions on third country access, although
we understand that the European Parliament continues to take a contrary
view. Perhaps the Minister might tell us a bit more about that. We are
grateful to City UK for sending us extra material that will be valuable

Minister give us on the progress of negotiations in relation to the six
areas of concern that I have identified? What is his understanding of 
<?notus-xml column=267?>the European Parliament’s position on these issues? To what
degree does he believe that the concerns that we raised, and which the
Government have said that they share, will be addressed in the
redrafted legislation? In relation to HFT, what is his assessment of
the findings of the Foresight project, published in October 2012? On a
personal note, I am still considerably worried about HFT, although the
Foresight group took a much more relaxed view. What is the
Minister’s view?</hs_para>

has also become clear from the Minister’s correspondence that
the timetable for agreement had been pushed back, with the scheduled
agreement in Council repeatedly postponed. We understand that the Irish

II’s impact on European financial markets, not least the City of
London, will be considerable. The Government and their European
partners must do all that they can to ensure that the financial

viewed in isolation. There are other pressing issues whose impact on

year my sub-committee also conducted an inquiry into the Commission
proposals for a financial transaction tax. Contrary to the opinion of
many so-called experts, the idea has not died but remains very much
alive, in the form of a proposal by 11 European Union member
states to introduce a tax under the enhanced co-operation procedure.
Only last week, witnesses to my sub-committee told us that the
political will in the EU behind this proposal had been underestimated.
Indeed, I recall that the CBI spokesman Richard Woolhouse told us that
there were now stirrings of recognition in the City that the FTT in its
enhanced form could indeed come about.</hs_para>

the complacency we identified? What steps are they taking to ensure
that a full and effective analysis of the effects of such a tax on the

afternoon, I talked about this with Mr Lidington, our Minister for
Europe, and I tried to sound the alarm bells. As an expert on the City,
he will know of some of the new elements introduced in the issuance
principle which mean that those trading in, for example, Volkswagen
shares in two non-participating countries could be subject to the tax.

the tax, perhaps for participating

effects that overspill on to us. On MiFID II, as on all of these
issues, the Government must remain at the negotiating table, ensuring
the best possible outcome not only for the City and the UK, but for the

Students of the Bible will remember that the Pharisee used to get up in

the financial institutions within it. It will reduce liquidity in

otherwise would. It will make it attractive for a number of them to
relocate to markets elsewhere in the world where they do not have to

agreement, they would set an example to others that would then follow.
If you believe that, you will believe anything. The fact is that the
United States would never follow down the road of having a financial
transfer tax, and I very much doubt that Hong Kong or Tokyo would
either. There is therefore never going to be a global financial tax;
all that you might ever have is one or two more countries within the
EU joining in with it.</hs_para>

of the issues that came up during our discussions on this today was the
big question of whether companies in the City of London would be forced
to collect the tax on behalf of the European countries that were
involved in the shares that were being traded. We were left completely
confused because Mr Bergmann told us categorically that there would be
no question of City firms collecting this tax, but on the other hand it
seems that there is serious evidence that the plan is that it should be
collected on behalf of other Governments. I know that the Minister
cannot reply on that now, but it would be nice if he could search that
out for us and try to get a definitive reply on where we stand on it;
it is a fundamental question for the City of
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T17:57:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000025">Another
reason why I am glad I am not a Europhile is the whole management of
the economic crisis, which has been absolutely abysmal. It is now more
than 12 months ago that my right honourable friend the Prime
Minister said that what Europe should do was get a big bazooka to solve
the problems facing the eurozone. Chancellor Merkel was adamant: she
was not going to expose the German taxpayer to picking up all the
liabilities of the Club Med countries and the others that the Germans
consider have not got their act together at all. A year to 18 months
later, that is precisely what happened: the ECB got authorisation from
the Germans to buy bonds in the secondary market across the whole of
the eurozone. The result was that the crisis that there had been in
funding government debt across the eurozone was completely stabilised
overnight. It is quite interesting that to date the ECB has not had to
buy any bonds in the secondary market of the eurozone, yet that
stability has been brought
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T17:58:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000026">So
what has happened in the mean time in the intervening 12 to 18 months?
Chronic insecurity has spread across the whole of the eurozone, and
people who might have made investment decisions have sat on their hands
and done nothing. The result is that we have seen a much severer
recession in the eurozone than we would have seen if that decision had
been taken earlier. No doubt there were a whole mass of political
reasons in Germany as to why Chancellor Merkel could not move quicker,
but the fact remains that if that nettle had been grasped earlier, the
eurozone would not have had as severe a recession as it has seen just
recently. That recession has even spread as far as Germany as well. It
is quite possible that Germany  
<?notus-xml column=270?>may pull out of it quite quickly but the fact is that the inactivity by
Germany actually put that country into recession, which it has not seen
for quite some
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000027">Now of
course we see the Cyprus crisis being dealt with on the basis that the
Cypriots themselves should pay a very serious price for the trouble
that their country has got itself into. An amazing scheme was
originally produced that said that all deposit-holders in banks in
Cyprus should pay a tax. It had to be described as a tax because, as
everybody knows, the EU has been working for some time on a deposit
insurance scheme that means that people holding up to £100,000
in a bank will have that money secured. Somehow, when the whole country
goes bust, your deposits are at risk, but if your bank goes bust your
savings are secure. Come on—people are not going to sit there
and say, “This raid on my savings is quite legitimate because it
is a tax”. That decision has now been reversed and we are going
to see deposit-holders above €100,000 maybe being taxed at 40%
on their
holdings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000028">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:04:23"></hs_TimeCode>
effect is this going to have on many of the other very unstable Club
Med countries in the eurozone? Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is the
president of the Eurogroup, although I gather he has not been there for
very long, came out with an incredible statement only yesterday, I
think, saying that what had been done in Cyprus was a template for all
the other countries in the eurozone. Can you imagine a more crass and
stupid remark than to say that this was a template to be applied
elsewhere? What it immediately does is put the frighteners on
absolutely anybody—any company or any individual—who
holds a bank account with money in it in any country such as Spain,
Portugal, even Italy and certainly Greece. Greece is completely
unstable. It is completely recognised that it is unsustainable as it is
and that it cannot go on. The reason why nothing has been done about
Greece is because German elections are coming up on 22 September. After
that, they will want to restructure the whole debt of Greece. They will
have to do it yet again and the Greeks will have to take another
massive haircut. Any Greek who is standing around at that point with
money in a Greek bank needs to have his head looked at. You are
actually better off taking the money out and stuffing it under the
mattress than you are leaving it in a bank account, where they can
impose a tax on
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000029">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:04:23"></hs_TimeCode>
is absolute lunacy. Once again, I hate to say it, but this is why I am
so glad that I am not a Europhile, because it strikes me that these
people cannot run anything competently whatever. The choice for the
future of the eurozone is quite simple. It can go mutual so that the
rich countries have to guarantee all the poor ones, but the Germans are
flatly refusing to do that and, if they do not, it is going to break
up. As night follows day, the weak countries are going to go, and then
eventually it will get to the centre and some of the stronger ones will
go as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000030">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T17:58:34"></hs_TimeCode>
the Germans did decide to underwrite all this, with some eurobond or
something of that sort, then of course you have a future made up of
fiscal transfers from the rich countries to the poor. We have seen a
bit of that already with the so-called bailouts and so forth. They are
bitterly resented by the Germans, who 
<?notus-xml column=271?>have to pay them; and because of the conditions with which they arrive
in Greece, say, they are bitterly resented by the Greeks, who get the

fiscal transfers, you will only have that continuing but writ large.
This then of course encourages extremism in places such as Greece and
very nasty parties start to crop up. If we go on like this, the whole
of this system will just not work. The best thing that could possibly
happen would be if the Germans pulled out of the eurozone and created,
with other sensibly run countries within the eurozone, a strong
currency which can actually survive. If we go on the way we are now,
chaos

years, I have served on several EU sub-committees, including those on
agriculture, environment, industry and transport. Controversial and
tricky subjects they may be, but they are nothing like as complicated
as those that we are dealing with in Sub-Committee A, economic and
financial affairs. As our chairman pointed out, although it may not
have been in his draft, you have only to look at the glossary at the

unspeakable letters and
descriptions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:05:22"></hs_TimeCode>. I
joined the committee only last year and, after attending my first
meeting, I left feeling numb and as if my brain had been scrambled. The
subject was incomprehensible and it took me a while to get my head

about two things, regulation and transparency. The latter includes
greater understanding of the markets by everyone; but, most
importantly, it relates to those who invest, insure and trust others
with their funds. There are perhaps two groups. First, there are the
very large pension funds, corporate businesses and plcs, among others.
Then there are individuals—Joe
public<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:06:14"></hs_TimeCode>. During
the past 40 years, millions of people have become small
shareholders, encouraged by government privatisations, including those
of the rail industry and BT. In addition, availability of private
health insurance and private pension plans have become the norm. Some
of these people can afford brokers and have access and the ability to
understand the working of the financial markets. However, the majority
numerically are small investors—private individuals ranging from
those in lower income groups to the
wealthy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:06:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

consider them for a moment, especially those who use independent
advisers rather than City brokers. It is most important that this is a
reliable and easy-to-understand service for those who cannot afford
anything else. For one moment, I will assume that Christian Krohn of
the Association for Financial Markets in Europe was correct when he
said that MiFID I provides adequate small-investor
protection.</hs_para>

I should like to discuss the proposed ban on inducements and
commissions to independent advisers
alone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:07:22"></hs_TimeCode>. Guy Sears
of the Investment Management Association questions the effect of the
proposal, and I am inclined to agree and, indeed, report that we do not
think that it is
workable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:07:33"></hs_TimeCode>. In
addition, I am not quite sure that the inducement/commission is
important, providing that the product is genuine and the client knows
that he or she may go elsewhere to compare prices and, most
importantly, compare potential outcomes. Surely the commission is no
more important to a client whether he or she is buying a financial
product or a car. It is the results of the deal as a whole as they
appear to him or her that count. When you buy a car, you decide on a
product, shop around and get the best deal, which may include free
servicing or whatever. You do not ask the salesman what his bonus is or
what margin the garage is making. It may be that it remains a cheaper
or better option to buy from him, even though his bonus and margin are
higher than that of the garage next door. Banning inducements or
declaring them in every case may upset the market—the only
market available to the group of people of whom I am talking. It is a
people’s
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:08:37"></hs_TimeCode>. If this
market fails or becomes more difficult to access, where will ordinary
citizens in the EU, including the majority of the 70 million
individuals in the UK, be able to go for this service? We must be
conscious of this. We know that the national pension schemes and
provision of healthcare will be insufficient with our increasingly aged
population. Our Government must focus on this and the future problems
arising from it.</hs_para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:09:06"></hs_TimeCode>problem with
much financial services business is that it is so complicated and,
unlike other businesses, takes place in the ether, rather than in the
practical trading of normal products such as grain, mining products or
manufactured products. Those involved work on, oblivious to the fact
that the industry is incomprehensible to most people outside their
world. Europe adds bureaucracy to this and thinks that “one size

must fit.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032678000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000038">The
magic word seems to be “harmonisation”—do it my
way rather than compromise and use delegated regulations. Look at the
financial transactions tax. We had Herr Bergmann, the director of the
EU tax department, in front of our committee the other day. When asked
what the main objectives of the FTT were, he said, first, harmonisation
and, secondly, raising money. They are hiding behind the soundbite of
harmonisation; it would be good for us all, they say. Surely the first
objective of any tax before you can even think of harmonisation is to
raise money. That is the next stage, papering over the cracks later on,
but they have put it first because of the way that it sounds. The
initial deal for the Cyprus bailout just demonstrates how confident and
secure one of our nations feels to put such a proposal on the table.
Next they will call for the harmonisation of this
tax—and where next? Incidentally, as a colleague of mine said,
the only people who have taken money out of the bank in that way were
the IRA in Belfast. Charles Moore wrote in the <I>Telegraph</I>

impression after being on the committee for a year is that this area is
highly complex and few people outside the City could begin to
understand it. In other committees that I have sat on, witnesses
invariably feel that they have the right answers. In our deliberations,
however, our witnesses have said that they hope so, they do not know
the full answer for sure or, “This will not necessarily stop a
future crisis”. It is pretty unnerving to listen to experts in
that frame of mind.</hs_para>

such a high percentage of our GDP, yet my impression is that the City

developments in Brussels. Yet the Government seem far too relaxed and
are doing little to fight London’s corner. In contrast, I am

deal from serving on his committee. We have benefited from his huge
experience, linguistic skills, total impartiality and unfailing good
humour. One of the reasons why it has been rather a productive
committee is that it has been extremely well chaired, and I thank him.
I also thank our clerks, Rose Crabtree and Stuart Stonor, the latter a

the matter that we are discussing today, I thank the Government for
maintaining a civilised dialogue with us. The government response to
our report was a serious point-by-point reply, and at all stages the
discussion with the Government has been informative. I hope that what
we have said has proved helpful. I contrast the Government’s
response with that of the Commission, which always replies to our
reports but in this case sent a particularly deadpan response. The
Government sent a very interesting and helpful one. Why am I saying
this? To make a point, of course. On this matter, the Government have
maintained a dialogue with us, but on the matter which has been raised
by all previous speakers in this debate because it worries us the most,
the financial transactions tax, there is a complete dialogue of the
deaf with the Government. We are unable to persuade Mr Greg Clark to
engage with us. Our correspondence with him is wholly unsatisfactory,
and he has still to address the key point we raised in our
report—a much larger and more substantive report than the MiFID
report—exactly a year ago.</hs_para>

advantage of this debate by putting six questions to the Government

co-operation of 11, if implemented, will damage the London market?
Thirdly, if so, why did the Government abstain at the January ECOFIN?
Why did they not oppose the proposed enhanced co-operation? Fourthly,
did they seek before then, and are they seeking now, to construct an
alliance against the enhanced co-operation of 11 among our natural
allies not participating in it—the Dutch, the Danes, the Swedes,
the Poles, the Finns, the Irish and the Luxembourgers? It is not
Britain against the rest; we have a majority on our side. Are we making

did we seek and are we seeking legal advice on whether the conditions
laid down in the treaty for permitting enhanced co-operation are met,
given that these conditions include the need not to prejudice the
interests of non-participating member states? Sixthly, why did the
Prime Minister at the European Council this month merely take note of
this pernicious proposal? According to its conclusions, the European
Council noted it. I do not know how well briefed the Prime Minister
was. Can the Minister confirm that the Prime Minister is fully briefed

to follow the example of the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, I am going to
revert to my usual bonhomie and to the subject of this debate. MiFID II
is the grandson of the original 1993 investment services directive, on
which I was one of the negotiators. Our aim was and still is to create
a single market in financial services, which is of course massively in
the UK’s interests since the UK is the principal EU provider of
such services; they are our largest export; and our share of the EU
market has grown as the internal barriers have come down. That is what
we hoped, and it is what has
happened.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000046">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:17:58"></hs_TimeCode>
particular purposes of MiFID II are to create greater competition in
trading in securities in order to reduce costs for investors, to apply
equivalent regulatory rules to different market models and to enhance
and harmonise investor protection—all plainly worthy aims that
are beneficial to the EU and the UK. However, the devil lies in the
detail. As our report shows, and the Government have agreed with us, we
need to be in there fighting. I believe that on this subject, unlike
the financial transactions tax, the Government have been in there
fighting and that UK negotiators have done very well. It is very
important that UK negotiators have been present. Let us suppose for a
moment that we were in the nightmare situation of Norway. Let us
suppose that we were country members of the single market and we had to
take the rules, written in Brussels in the sort of process that we are
talking about today, from the fax machine when they had been completed
with no say in what they said.</hs_para>

Government have done well and the chances are that MiFID II is going to
come out okay. However, I have a two-part question for the Government
and a comment. My particular concern about MiFID was with the
provisions for third-country access, as discussed by the noble Lord,
Lord Harrison. The 
<?notus-xml column=275?>committee thought that they were deeply flawed, and the Government
agreed. The proposal was that third-country firms would have to
register with the European Securities and Markets Authority and could
trade in the EU only if authorised to do so by ESMA, which would be
required to certify that these third-country firms came from countries
whose home-country jurisdiction imposed requirements equivalent to
those in MiFID II and provided equivalent reciprocal recognition of EU
firms. Try selling that on Wall Street. It would not fly there, and the
effect would be to restrict third-country access into our markets,
which would be damaging to them and to us. Clearly, this amounted to a
significant risk of shrinking the EU market and hence the London
market, since it is the premier location for third-country firms and
their branches.</hs_para>

Commission’s objective is to ensure that EU financial markets

would have been proud of that 20 years ago. The fact is, though, that
the balance was not correct. The Government have since told us in their
helpful reply to our report that the requirements for equivalence and
reciprocal access have been eliminated in Council discussion, one of
the reasons why I feel like congratulating them. However, I need to ask
a question: is that still the case? Is there a stake through the heart
of these third-country provisions? Has the Commission dropped its
emphasis on equivalence? If not, and if the Commission is still going
on about it, will the right-minded, such as the UK Government, hold
firm in

as the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, said, what about the Parliament?
Compared with my days in Brussels in the early 1990s, the Parliament
has—rightly, in my view—much more power than it had then.
Sadly, though, our Government have rather less influence than they had,
which may be the inevitable consequence of the Conservative Party
choosing to distance itself from the EPP in Brussels and Strasbourg,
thus sharply reducing its chances of obtaining senior and influential
positions in the Parliament, and of course removing a principal
opportunity for influencing and alliance-building with like-minded
Members of the
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:23:12"></hs_TimeCode>. How
confident are the Government that a good deal in Council—if it
is a good deal, which I think it probably is—will not unravel in
co-decision procedures with the Parliament? Are the Government acting
on the first point that we made in our report when we said,</hs_para>

we, in alliance with our friends in Council, lobbying hard in

is nearly all I want to say, but since the debate has ranged a little
beyond MiFID, I will make one final point. As eurozone Ministers, along
with those aspiring to join the eurozone, get together more and more
closely—in the past fortnight they have been meeting a great
deal—to discuss banking union, FTT, bail-outs and bail-ins for
Cyprus, it becomes more important, as the noble Lord, Lord Harrison,
pointed out, that we in the UK try even harder to stay alongside the
debate or, ideally, at the heart of it, among the same people on the EU
financial services legislation that is so important to this country.
There will be caucusing among eurozone and eurozone-plus members. There
is nothing we can do about it because it will happen informally. The
Commission will try to prevent it. If in the end we wanted to go to the
Court, we would obtain valueless rulings on our side. Caucusing is
wrong but it will happen. And “les absents ont toujours

best way of limiting the risk and mitigating the damage is to be as
active as we can in making the European case for open markets. We

will make three points by in introducing what I have to say. First, I
agree with the final point of the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, and with his
tribute to my noble friend Lord Harrison and his fellow committee

work that they do in bringing informed debate to the

I will avoid the considerable temptation offered by the speech of the
noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, to engage in the debate about the euro that
he has so richly offered. I will just say—this is not meant to
be a cruel point—that he has been making the same speech ever
since I was privileged to join the House in 2010, 
<?notus-xml column=277?>and the euro has not collapsed yet. Even in what I agree was the

Liddle:</Member></B> They knew perfectly well what they were doing by
signing up to the deal that they did. Perhaps I may make another aside.
The idea that taxpayers should always pick up the bill for the
irresponsibility of bankers is offensive. A lot of people in Cyprus
have enjoyed the benefits of relatively high interest rates, which
pensioners in Britain have not enjoyed over the past few years. The
idea that they made these investments in a noble way that should be
protected by the European taxpayer is, I think,
offensive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:30:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032678000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000058">Thirdly, I agree with
the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, that the issues raised in this
report are very complicated. I am certainly not in a position to talk
about the details. Instead, I want to focus on the Government’s
political strategy for handling these financial services questions.
This is not a party point; it seems to me that as a nation we have a
real difficulty here. A number of propositions form the approach on
this side of the Room. The first is that we need a healthy financial
services sector; I agree strongly with the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton,
and the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, on this. Yes, we need to
rebalance our economy. My noble friend Lord Mandelson was right to say
that we have had too much financial engineering and not enough real
engineering, but the financial services sector is a huge overseas
earner for us and we cannot do without it. It is a vital national
interest where we have a comparative
advantage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:31:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, we have to acknowledge that things have gone wrong in the City
in the recent past. Grave reputational damage has been done as the
result of the LIBOR scandal and the scandals around mis-selling. Risks
were taken that should never have been, and as a result we need to
rethink the way we regulate the
City<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:31:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032678000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000059">The second proposition
that should inform government policy on a national strategy in this
area is that the City benefits hugely from being the financial centre
of the European single market. The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, is right to
say that what Britain achieved in the 1990s and the early
2000s—I was slightly involved in the 1999 Financial Services
Action Plan—was tremendous. It opened up the market and ensured
that London got a larger share of it. What happened, though, was that
we had liberalisation without putting in place proper cross-country
regulation, and we have to acknowledge that that was a UK mistake. It
was a UK consensus that we should have light-touch regulation and we
got it wrong. The Turner report that was published at the start of the
financial crisis said that we have to choose between European
regulation and being part of the European market or going back to
national regulation, and that is basically right. I think that both the
then Labour Government and the new Conservative/Lib Dem coalition have
accepted that we are part of a properly regulated European single
market in financial
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:33:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

all this is that on the Continent there is now a great suspicion of UK
motives in this field. I sense this an awful lot as I travel around to
various meetings. Therefore, the third objective we have to set
ourselves is to accept that we need re-regulation at the European
level, but that it has to be done in a proportionate and sensible way.
I have some sympathy with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton,
about shutting the stable door and things moving on so that the new
regulations will not cope with the new circumstances, but we must
recognise that we have to put a national effort, as the noble Lord,
Lord Kerr, said, into getting our regulatory strategy right.</hs_para>

here. There are some basic asymmetries that put us in a difficult
position. We had very strong support from what you might call the
northern liberals for the positions that we took in the 1990s and 2000s
but I am not sure to what extent that support is as solid as it once
was, which I think is one of the reasons why the coalition on the
financial transaction tax that the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, wants has not
occurred. There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:35:51"></hs_TimeCode>
is an asymmetry of expertise. People complain about the bureaucracy of
the Commission, but when you look at the thousands of people employed
in the regulatory agencies in London and the dozens who are dealing
with these matters in the Commission—a very small group of
people covering a very wide brief—it is not surprising that
sometimes the proposals that come forward are flawed in key respects.
The Commission tries to listen and amend in the light of
representations made to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:36:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000062">Another
major asymmetry, which is a very serious one, is that there are
euro-ins and euro-outs. We are among the euro-outs, and that is the way
it is going to be, but we have to recognise, as a euro-out,
that financial regulation is fundamental to the financial stability of
the eurozone. If they are going to do whatever it takes to stabilise
the euro then they will be prepared in the eurozone to adopt whatever
financial regulations they believe are necessary to stabilise their
currency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:36:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000063">In
this situation, the national strategy clearly has to be to go out of
our way to win friends and influence people. That is where the
Government—or perhaps only one part of the coalition—has
got it so badly wrong. There is a difficult environment for us in the
European Parliament. They think bankers are to blame for the crisis and
that Britain is, in part, to blame because we pushed a deregulatory
agenda. How do we deal with that? Not by going in with the Thatcher
handbag, nor by doing what David Cameron did at the December 2011
European Council in circulating a paper—which, incidentally, has
never been disclosed to Parliament, although we have seen it and know
what is in it—that had “unanimity” written at the
top and which, to anyone who looked at it, would look as though the
British Government were basically seeking to reverse qualified majority
voting on a large number of financial services questions. It was a
disastrous strategy: how could you expect the eurozone to agree to
surrender sovereignty over their currency to Britain through our having
a veto over financial regulation?
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:39:31"></hs_TimeCode> have to argue
from a position of qualified majority, and we have to win friends and
base our position on reason and good argument.</hs_para>

agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, that we have to point out to
people the advantages of London being the global centre of the single
market and all that that brings. At the same time, though, we have to
acknowledge the criticisms of the City that have been made and
demonstrate that we are prepared to see them tackled. That is basically
the question that I put to the Minister: how are the Government going
to do that? What is their political strategy for dealing with these
questions, which are of vital national importance, even though they are
of great complexity and difficulty for many members of the

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, like other speakers, I congratulate the
noble Lord, Lord Harrison, and his committee on producing such a
comprehensive and thoughtful report on such a technical subject. I hope
that noble Lords will forgive me if I start by dealing with some of the
technical issues that the report covers before I get on to some of the
broader issues that we have
discussed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000067">As
noble Lords have accepted, since it came into force in 2007, MiFID has
had a major impact on how EU financial markets operate. This in turn
has fed through to a significant impact on the wider economy. The
directive has been instrumental in reducing barriers to trade in
financial services and increasing competition in trading services. To
build on these benefits, the Government agree with the committee that a
review of MiFID I was necessary. The Commission’s proposals for
a new directive and regulation broadly seek to address three areas
where problems have arisen: negative side-effects resulting from the
implementation of the original legislation; technological developments
in how financial markets function; and issues exposed by the financial
crisis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000068">There
is much to welcome in the proposals. For instance, the creation of a
new category of trading venue, called the organised trading facility,
will capture virtually all organised multilateral trading. Another
objective of the review—greater transparency in financial
services—should help to protect investors and generally lead to
greater efficiency in price formation. A policy of open access between
trading venues and clearing houses will remove an important obstacle to
competition, helping to create a more competitive single market in
clearing and trading services. However, the policies contained in the
MiFID review must be extremely carefully designed. The
Government’s primary focus is ensuring that the measures
contained in the review meet their objectives and do not damage
competition or the efficiency of financial
markets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000069">First,
the Government share the committee’s concerns over the design of
the organised trading facility. The Government continue to work hard in
negotiations to try to ensure there is sufficient detail in primary
legislation so that the proposals achieve their
purpose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000070">Regarding
the Commission’s proposal to extend the rules on market
transparency to non-equity markets, the committee rightly notes that we
must avoid a one-size-fits-all approach, as trading characteristics can
differ significantly across asset classes. As the 
<?notus-xml column=280?>committee also observes, without proper understanding of these issues
there could be an impact on liquidity and the cost of capital. The
Government agree with both these points and continue to prioritise
these issues in
negotiations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000071">The
proposals also increase transparency for so-called systematic
internalisers. The Government believe that the systematic internaliser
model has a role to play, but we acknowledge the committee’s
comments that this category has not been heavily utilised and that some
clarification of the purpose of the regime may be
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000072">As a
consequence of recent technological advances in financial markets, the
Commission has proposed new rules governing the operation of
high-frequency trading. As the committee recommends, the
Government’s position is that measures applied to algorithmic
and high-frequency trading should be firmly grounded in evidence about
its real impact. The Government note the welcome contribution that the
Foresight report has made in this
regard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000073">The
Commission’s proposals also introduce an EU-wide third-country
regime. This would harmonise the rules under which investment services
can be provided by non-EU firms into the EU. Although we believe that
there would be an economic rationale in extending the benefits of the
single market to third-country firms, we fully agree with the
committee’s comments on the global nature of financial markets.
Our prime objective is to ensure that the UK, and indeed the entire EU,
remains open to trade in financial services worldwide. The UK has
worked hard in Council to amend the proposal and we believe that the
current compromise will avoid the disadvantages and difficulties that
the committee has
identified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000074">While
we support greater transparency in commodity markets, the Government
agree with the committee that price volatility in these markets is
dependent on a range of factors. In particular, in 2011, the G20
commodity study group was clear that fundamentals—in other
words, supply and demand—have been driving commodity prices. The
Commission’s proposed rules for commodity markets did not
recognise this, placing undue emphasis on a particularly rigid
regulatory regime. However, we are satisfied that the current

that the evidence suggests that inducements are being shown time and

main obstacles are the open access provisions, which Germany and a
group of member states oppose, and the equity transparency regime,
where France and some others want to see a uniform standard of
transparency across all venues. On both these issues, the
Government’s objective is to ensure that the regulatory
framework does not impose unnecessary costs on the end users of
financial services and supports growth in the real economy. We continue
to work constructively on these high priority areas in Council, with
the aim of reaching a

agreed in September. As it stands, it is likely that the biggest

regime, Parliament has broadly opted to retain it, but with some
positive amendments. However, in many other areas the Parliament and

Kerr of Kinlochard:</Member></B> I have tremendous respect for the
noble Lord, but that is the kind of answer we have been getting for a
year on the financial transactions tax. The Council made a decision in
January, with the UK—absurdly, in my view—abstaining. The
point of principle is whether we agree that they may go ahead with
levying a tax among 11 countries but requiring the rest of us,
including the UK, to collect the tax for them and send it to them. Do
we agree to damage our 
<?notus-xml column=282?>market? Do we agree that they have the right to do that? The key
question is whether our interests are adversely affected. If so, they
do not have the right to do it. Why did we

Newby:</Member></B> We agree that they have the right to do it. The
question which the noble Lord asked about whether this measure would
damage the EU and the UK is not one to which there is a simple or
straightforward answer. There are two completely different views about
the impact of this tax on London. To a certain extent, we will not
know, until it is implemented, which of these two views is correct. One
view is that London will benefit significantly because we are out of
it. If you look, for example, at what happened in Sweden, which had a
transaction tax, the bond market collapsed totally and Sweden had to
abolish it. If you take that view, a financial transaction tax is good
for
London.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000083">Other
people take a completely opposite view. The modalities of collecting
the tax, and exactly how those will work, are clearly, from everything
that the Commission has said, a work in progress. It is not, I believe,
a unique suggestion within EU law and practice that member states will
collect taxes that revert to other member states. I do not think it is
a matter of principle; it will be a matter of practice and whether it
is possible to put in place a practical
solution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000084"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Kerr of Kinlochard" PimsId="1274" UID="13032678000131" xid="1717" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0001.htm#13032678000131">Lord
Kerr of Kinlochard:</Member></B> Surely, the complacent school of
thought that says all the business will flow to the United Kingdom,
others will damage themselves and we stand to gain, does not still
exist in Whitehall. Surely, Whitehall has now persuaded itself that
putting more grit in the cogs of the London financial markets is a bad
thing, as is trying to persuade two American banks doing a transaction
in London that, according to an instrument which originated in Germany,
we should collect from both banks not for the British Exchequer but to
send the money to the Germans. Surely, Whitehall has decided that that
scenario is mad because the American banks will not trade in London if
we apply this absurd regime. Surely, Whitehall is clear that we are
approaching a crossroads and that we do not know which road to take.

have to decide what to do on the balance of the evidence. Surely, the
balance of the evidence is overwhelming that this measure is a bad
thing for the EU and a bad thing for the UK. Eleven countries do not
agree, but I guess that 15 or 16 other countries do agree with us. Are
we trying to construct an alliance with them or have we, as the noble
Lord, Liddle, said, such a pariah status that we cannot construct an
alliance? I do not believe that. I still think that this situation
could be remedied. Are we going to go to law? We need legal advice on
who is right. I believe that if we could be damaged by this measure,
and the chances are that we will be, it is not permitted under the
treaty. Therefore, I do not understand why we abstained and I do not
understand why the Prime Minister was

to do virtually anything, but the question I was addressing was whether
the 11 countries that have signed up to this tax can be dismissed as
not knowing what is best for them, even though we are deeply sceptical
about it and are not going to sign up to it. We have had a number of
debates in your Lordships’ House about Greece, for example, in
which some noble Lords seem to have known what is best for Greece. It
is just that the Greeks have not agreed. We have to let other member
states move forward with this within the rules because they are keen to
do so.</hs_para>

I am sure that we will come back to the financial transaction tax, but
it is not unreasonable to say that an extremely complicated tax using
very difficult mechanisms to make it work should necessarily be capable
of instant analysis in terms of how we are going to deal with it. We
are looking at it. We have had the proposal for only a few weeks, and
my right honourable friend Greg Clark, as the noble Lord, Lord

patience, but we are now past the point where we can affect it. The
only question remaining for us is whether we can overturn it. After the
January ECOFIN it is now up to those who participated in it to devise
the tax as they think is best for them. We cannot affect that, but we
will be obliged to collect it. I am not clear what we are working hard
on at the moment. What are we trying to do? We are not in the room any
more. I would say that we ought to try to derail this exercise by going

turn to some of the other points that have been made in the debate. I
would say to the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, that one
person’s harmonisation is another person’s single market
rules. Sometimes harmonisation works very much to the benefit of the UK
and sometimes it does not. We have to take this on a case-by-case
basis, but let us remember that by common consent the single market has
been very beneficial to the UK. If we can, we want to strengthen it
even if, as inevitably will be the case, some of that strengthening
includes common rules.</hs_para>

Brookeborough:</Member></B> I did not say that harmonisation was not a
good thing, rather I looked at the way this tax is being brought
forward. They were talking about harmonisation before they started
raising the money. They did not like to talk about why they were
raising the money and doing it only over a certain number of
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0002.htm#13032678000095"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13032678000140" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0002.htm#13032678000140">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Lord for that
clarification. The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, asked about the benefit of
the EU to the City as a whole, and both whether the Government
recognise that and whether are doing anything to promote it. There is
no doubt in my mind, having watched the Government in action, that they
absolutely understand the role of the City and how having a strong
financial services sector is immensely valuable to the UK and to the
EU. The Government themselves are working very hard, as noble Lords
have said, on this directive and others to make sure that we end up
with proposals which are compatible with the ongoing success of the
City.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0002.htm#13032678000096">One of
the frustrations I felt before I was a Minister and which, to a lesser
extent, I still feel, is that the City is not always its own best
advocate. Although things have improved considerably with the formation
of TheCityUK, and there is now a much wider recognition that the
financial services sector needs to get its act together, as it were, to
promote itself, there is still some way to go. Although the UK
Government are active in the Council and in the European Parliament,
they need the UK financial services sector to be independently active
in those institutions as well. There was a period when a lot of senior
people in the City felt so battered with the experience that they had
following 2008 that they were not willing to put their heads above the
parapet and make the arguments. I think that that phase is over, to a
certain extent at least, and the Government are encouraging them very
much to do that. I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, for
quoting Lord Thomson of Monifieth. He, of course, was from that great
tradition of canny Scots who could fully understand the benefits of
engaging with the
EU.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0002.htm#13032678000097">I will
make just two points before I finish in response to the noble Lord,
Lord Liddle. First, he talked about asymmetries. There are a number of
asymmetries. Looking at the future of this directive, we are talking
about the possibility of making considerable progress 
<?notus-xml column=285?>while Ireland still has the presidency. However, the amount of financial
services expertise which Lithuania is going to bring to the party in
the second half of the year is relatively limited. It is a terrible
burden on the officials and Ministers from small member states who have
to grapple with what, by common consent and as anybody who has read the
report knows, is an immensely technical subject. Virtually the only
people other than members of your Lordships’ committee who
understand it are the people who work in it every day. The truth is
that there are not many of them in small member states, which is an
asymmetry. Clearly, there is also an asymmetry between the Commission
and the UK. There is one asymmetry that we can benefit from by using
our expertise. I was extremely interested that, despite the fact that
we are not in the euro, a group of Treasury officials went to Cyprus at
the weekend in order to help sort out that problem. It will be very
interesting when they get back to see what they have learnt from
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0002.htm#13032678000098">The final
point is about how we exercise influence in an environment where we are
not part of the euro-in group. In my view, the model—which I
have seen in operation—is that adopted by my colleague in
another place, Ed Davey, when he was in BIS, who established something
called the “like-minded growth group” for promoting the
single market. At every point, Mr Davey carried in his pocket a little
laminated piece of paper which showed the voting strength of every
member of the 27, and he was forever working out how you got that
qualified majority or majority. He worked very hard, and succeeded, at
getting a majority of member states, both euro-ins and euro-outs, to
co-operate to promote the single market. That is a model that I think
is still pursued within BIS. We have got to, as the noble Lord, Lord
Kerr, said, be very active working out where we can form alliances,
which we can do on many things. One of the ironies about the current
financial circumstances is that we, as a euro-out, have much more in
common with some of the northern European countries that are trying to
impose fiscal discipline. For good or ill, we are now something of an
expert on that in this country and we need to make the most of it.
There are no permanent alliances; you have to rebuild and refresh them.
One of the challenges for the Government—or any
Government—is to do that as best they
may.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032678000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0002.htm#13032678000099">Finally,
reverting to the splendid report that we have been discussing this
afternoon, the Government welcome it and agree with all the points it

MiFID II does, indeed, get it right for the City and, most importantly,

humorous note, saying that I wake up every morning and thank the Lord
that the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, is not like other men. That has
been well demonstrated. In fact, he reminds me of the story that
William Hazlitt tells in one of his essays about going for a walk with
Coleridge. He says that he set off with Coleridge down a Somerset lane.
He, Hazlitt, would walk in a straight line; Coleridge was forever
diverting, off up on the left, off up on the right, forward and
backward and then eventually coming back to join his friend Hazlitt.
This debate has been a little bit like that. I began to puzzle why it

that is being borne in upon us by having adopted what I understand to

one point about Mr Bergmann, who was referred to several times this

mounts—that this is wholly legitimate under subsidiarity and in
other ways because it does not infringe the single market—is
simply wrong. It does infringe the single market, and it infringes not
the gang of 11 who are going forward, but the gang of 16, who are not
participating. If we as the UK are not alert to that and if we are not
very careful, we will lose our goose that lays a golden egg. In losing
that golden egg of the City of London, we will lose it not just for the
United Kingdom: we will also lose it for the European Union. That is
why we must take such care. We are in conversation with the FST, Greg
Clark, and I was in conversation with David Lidington this afternoon. I
hope that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, will take it upon himself, with
his deep knowledge of the City of London that he has demonstrated so
often, to express the urgency and concern that has caused this debate
on the narrow subject of MiFID to spill over into the other dossiers
that are before us which cool and chill our
hearts.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13032678000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-gc0002.htm#13032678000143">Motion

achieve environmental benefits without imposing unnecessary costs on
farmers, and to secure value for taxpayers. The council agreed to

is that sugar beet quotas will finally be scrapped, benefiting

pay up to 7% of their direct payment budget as coupled payments. The
remaining member states will be allowed up to 12%. I was disappointed

were available to eligible higher education students who were enrolled
between 1990 and 1998. Borrowers are required to repay in fixed monthly
instalments over a defined period, typically five or seven years.
Interest is charged at a rate equivalent to the Retail Prices Index.
Repayments can be deferred for a year at a time if a borrower’s
income is below the threshold, which is 85% of the national average
earnings. Currently the threshold is £27,813. There will be no
change to borrowers’ terms and conditions as a result of the

our plan is to put to market a competed management contract in 2016. We
will further develop this proposition in the light of experience with
the Thameslink competition, which has similar infrastructure

announce that a £1.6 billion contract has been signed today to
provide a search and rescue helicopter service for the whole of the UK
with Bristow Helicopters Ltd. I would like to recognise the very high
quality and the maturity of the bids provided by the two companies that
reached the final stages in this vital competition for an emergency
service in the UK. In buying such an important service that protects
the safety of individuals in our maritime industries and in dangerous
conditions on land and around our coastline, it is vital that we had a
robust competition with credible and thoroughly developed propositions
from industry. I am confident that we did. I am equally confident that
the contract we are entering into with Bristow Helicopters Ltd
represents the best solution for the UK over the next 10
years.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032660000301" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326-wms0001.htm#13032660000301">This

of front-line operations has informed the military decision that the
skills required for personnel recovery on the battlefield and in the

personnel being engaged in UK search and rescue. I want to pay tribute
to the outstanding service personnel who have displayed such enduring
commitment and bravery in RAF and RN search and rescue squadrons. The
service they have provided for over 70 years has been exemplary and the
country owes them all an enormous debt of gratitude. The decision to
cease military involvement in search and rescue in the UK was not made
lightly. But with the Sea King nearing its 40th year of service, the
time has come to change the way the service is provided and the
aircraft used.</hs_para>

flying times, with the average flight time reducing from 23 minutes to

important predator of hedgehogs and both species eat similar
invertebrates, such as earthworms and beetles. The Defra-funded
research project ZF0531: Ecological consequences of removing badgers
from an ecosystem, assessed the consequences of removing badgers from
an ecosystem using information collected as part of the randomised

increased by more than 100% in the proactive cull areas, in comparison
to the no-cull control areas where they experienced a slight decline.
This effect was limited to amenity grassland areas in and near
villages. It can be concluded that the removal of badgers from an

in Budget 2013, the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) forecast
shows the UK economy rebalancing over the forecast period. Having grown
strongly in 2012, business investment is forecast to pick up again in
2014 and make an increasing contribution to GDP growth thereafter,
rising to nearly 1 percentage point by 2017. After falling in 2012, UK
exports are also expected to pick up and net trade is forecast to make
a small positive contribution to growth from 2013. Household
consumption is forecast to grow more slowly than GDP on average, with
the saving ratio declining but remaining at 5% or above
throughout.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032659000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326w0001.htm#13032659000051">The

lasting and slow moving areas of high pressure are a common feature of
meteorology. These act to effectively “block” or redirect
migratory low pressure systems; hence they are often known as blocking
highs. These blocks can remain in place for several days or even weeks,
causing the areas affected by them to have the same kind of weather for
an extended period of time. In winter blocking patterns are linked to
cold, dry and calm conditions over northern Europe, whereas blocking
patterns in summer are associated with heat wave conditions with little
wind and if prolonged can cause drought. By implication the impacts of
blocking in spring and autumn tend to be less
severe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032659000422" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130326w0001.htm#13032659000422">The

While there is large variability in the record we experienced less
blocking in the late twentieth century when compared to the late
nineteenth century for example. However, there was a relatively high
occurrence of blocking during recent winters such as 2009 and 2010
although not as frequent as those periods recorded during the late 19th

have also analysed the frequency of blocking  by season for
north-west Europe over the period  for which satellite records
contribute and strengthen the reliability of observations (1979
onwards). This more recent record again shows there is a
high level of variability in the frequency of blocking from year to
year resulting in no statistically significant trends in blocking
frequency found for any season over this period. Nevertheless, blocking
in winter has become more common since 2000. While similar short term
trends have occurred in the past, some lines of research suggest that
this recent increase in blocking could be in response to rapid Arctic
sea ice decline. However it 
<?notus-xml column=226?>is not clear whether this is the dominant factor in recent
trends and the research community has yet to reach a consensus on the
role of declining sea ice in the context of other climate
change. The Met Office, along with international colleagues, is
currently investigating this

studied peak hourly rainfall rates over the last 10 years, although it
is expected that analyses over this length of time would be dominated
by natural variability. However, the Met Office has investigated daily
rain rates over the past 50 years and preliminary research indicates
there has been an increase in the frequency of very wet days over this
period. Moreover, there is evidence that increases in greenhouse gases
and the subsequent rise in global temperature has increased the
severity of short period (up to a day) extreme rainfall for the
Northern Hemisphere and that this is expected to continue as the
climate warms. Given that 24 hour rainfall totals are expected to
increase, we should expect rain rates for shorter periods to increase
as well. Recent research<Sup>1</Sup> using high-resolution regional
climate model simulations, for example, shows that one-hour
precipitation extremes increase at a rate close to 14% per degree of
warming in large parts of Europe when mean temperatures exceed 12
