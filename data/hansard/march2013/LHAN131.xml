Commercial Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Deighton):</Member></B> My
Lords, we are spending more on infrastructure projects this year.
Capital spending by the departments responsible for economic
infrastructure—DfT, DECC and Defra—is increasing. The
transport budget, for example, rises from £7.7
billion last year to £8 billion this year, then
£8.7 billion next year and £8.9 billion in
2014-15, which is more than at any point under the last Government.
This has been possible because the Government increased infrastructure
spending by £10 billion over the past two Autumn Statements,
increases which the Budget committed to making permanent, with a
further £3 billion a year from
2015-16<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T14:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hollick" PimsId="995" UID="13032511000731" xid="1271" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000731">Lord
Hollick:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for that Answer. However,
the Office for Budget Responsibility reported a rather different
situation last week, when it announced that public sector net
investment would fall by 34%, from £38.7 billion in 2010-11 to
an estimated £25.5 billion in the current year,
2012-13. The OBR also forecast that, taking into account all the
measures so far announced, including those announced in the Budget last
week, there would be zero growth in infrastructure spend between now
and 2017-18. Will the Minister please explain why these measures have
failed, and continue to fail, to boost overall infrastructure
investment, and which additional measures he plans to introduce to
improve the dire forecast for the next five
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T14:38:59"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deighton" PimsId="7002" UID="13032511000732" xid="2168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000732">Lord
Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, first, it is necessary to clear up the
numbers. There is a significant difference between public investment
numbers and investment in infrastructure. Public investment includes
huge investments in health and in defence, so there is a significant
difference there. Also, if you look at the national infrastructure
plan, you see that approximately 80% of the investment that we expect
over the next 15 years in fact comes from the private markets and not
from public capital
expenditure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T14:39:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Flight" PimsId="5908" UID="13032511000733" xid="2118" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000733">Lord
Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, the national infrastructure
plan has identified some £200 billion of energy infrastructure
investment and £200 billion of communication and transport
infrastructure investment. What proportion 
<?notus-xml column=790?>of that total does the Minister estimate might be under way by the end
of five years, and to what extent are any delays caused not by the
absence of finance—where sovereign funds and others are willing
to put up the money—but by planning and environmental legal
constraints in this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T14:40:10"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deighton" PimsId="7002" UID="13032511000734" xid="2168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000734">Lord
Deighton:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for that question, which
focuses us on the issues to do with accelerating the delivery of this
very important programme. With respect to the proportion that will be
under way within this Parliament, this Government have focused activity
on the top 40 programmes and projects, which accounts for about
£200 billion of the £400 billion my noble friend refers
to. Approximately 20% of those projects are currently in construction,
and we would expect that proportion, by 2015-16 and the end of this
Parliament, to be approximately 50%. There is no question but that the
gate that most constrains our ability to accelerate the stream of
projects is to do with the variety of planning regulations that
surround any major public infrastructure
investment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T14:40:55"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Soley" PimsId="4897" UID="13032511000735" xid="1906" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000735">Lord

Deighton:</Member></B> If I may say, my Lords, those are two quite
separate questions. I am very enthusiastic about private sector
investment. Infrastructure investments lend themselves to financing in
the private markets because they generate a cash flow that can repay
those investments. The question about Heathrow Airport is an entirely
separate one, although I accept that airports are a particularly
attractive investment proposition for the private

previous years. I agree that that is part of the

the amount of resources required, we are not simply discussing the
resources in Infrastructure UK here; we are discussing the 
<?notus-xml column=791?>resources right across government, particularly in the
government departments that are charged with delivering infrastructure:
the DfT and DECC being the two primary examples. Between now and June,
we will work precisely to define their requirements, based on the
project load that they are managing, and what they ought to be staffed
with in order to make that happen. That gap is thus being defined, and
we have to assess what is in the departments as well as what is in

to avoid as far as possible these dreadful
circumstances—dreadful for the prison staff who have to deal
with them and dreadful for the families who have lost loved ones. The

There have been three recent deaths—the first in
youth custody for more than five years, so it is
important to keep these numbers in perspective.
The Youth Justice Board—YJB—which is responsible
for the placement of young people in custody, is
working closely with the Department of Health in the development of the
comprehensive health assessment tool to screen and assess the needs of
young people aged under 18 on reception. The Department of
Health has developed a youth justice health and well-being
needs assessment toolkit, which is now available to help with the
planning and commissioning of health services for young people across
the justice system. I should also add that the three recent deaths have
been investigated by the Prisons and Probation
Ombudsman.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000025"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T14:49:45"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Finlay of Llandaff" PimsId="3238" UID="13032511000753" xid="1634" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000753">Baroness

mental disorders among the prison population is estimated to be 15
times that of the rest of the population and up to 35-fold higher in

problems of our Prison Service is the need of so many prisoners in the
criminal justice system for mental health support. We are talking with
the Department of Health to make sure that we can assess prisoners and
that those who are in need of mental health support are given it. Since
2007 all establishments operate an individually focused care planning
system for prisoners identified as being at risk, the key benefits of
which include an initial assessment and faster first response, the

that can be learnt from these deaths. The ministerial board

if it put proposals to the Procedure Committee, to decide that one way

on the number of speakers. As with so many things in this House, there
is another side to the argument: if one had a fixed limit and the first
noble Lords who put their names down to take part all had the same
view, we would not have much of a debate. As often, then,

not matter very much if from time to time debates ran on a little
longer. That would facilitate the kind of more spontaneous and lively
debating that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, rightly calls for while
ending what is, frankly, the demeaning practice of limiting the time
for noble Lords’ speeches sometimes to three minutes, and
sometimes to two minutes or even
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T14:59:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Hill of Oareford:</Member></B> The whole House has taken a view about
time-limited debates. The advantage of them is that noble Lords know
how long they have to speak, when the debate is going to take place and
so on. The ingenious suggestion from the noble Lord, Lord Howarth,
about allowing things to run on would effectively take time from
someone else, and they would have an equally strong view the other way.
These are not straightforward issues. One point worth making generally
is that the amount of time in the previous Session set aside for
debates was actually greater than that in the previous three Sessions.
The noble Lord will probably know that I have brought forward proposals
to the Procedure Committee to try to increase opportunities for debate
and, importantly, for topical debates in particular because I know that
there is widespread demand for that
opportunity.</hs_para>

of measurement of poverty that looks at interventions and at ways of

make it clear that I believe in the relative poverty measure, which is
a way of measuring what happens over the medium-term period, although
there have been some rather perverse impacts in the past couple of
years in the current recession. What is really important is that we
drive our attention to the underlying causes of poverty. That is what
the current consultation is about. We will be reporting on how to

I said that there has been an increase in the use of food banks and
that, indeed, there had been a large increase under the previous
Government. We have since September 2011 been advising people of this
local resource and other resources. We are transferring elements to the
Social Fund so that local areas can create local welfare support for
people who are in crisis. It is important that we have that kind of

“food banks” confusing to many people? They are actually
temporary measures for people who are suddenly put out of work and do

banks under the Trussell Trust give families food for three days while
it puts them in touch with social services, charities and other
organisations. If there is time, would it not be a good idea to have a

essential point is that we are moving to local authorities support for
people who are in trouble as that is the best place for them to get
that support. Food banks may well be part of that. One thing that local
authorities are looking at is providing support in kind to people who
would otherwise have taken cash. It is a more effective way of doing

Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to move
the amendment on the Order Paper to insert a new clause after Clause 2,
entitled “Annual report to Parliament”. It will give my
noble friends on the Front Bench some comfort, perhaps, if I tell them
that this is a probing amendment. This is a case of once bitten, twice
shy.</hs_para>

it is important to spend some time reviewing the context in which the
Third Reading of this important Bill takes place, particularly against
the background of our not having had the advantage of having the Budget
Statement available to us when we were on Report. We are now better
informed in terms of the updated projections that have been done by the
Office for Budget Responsibility, which inform this debate directly. I
cannot resist the temptation to say to my noble friend that we are also
better informed on CPI in that, as we were speaking on Report last
week, the BBC was reporting that the February monthly figure for
inflation had ticked up by 0.1% from 2.7% to 2.8%.
Admittedly, that is two points away from the magic 3% that I was using
in an amendment—as it happens, unsuccessfully—to try to
get some inflation protection for people on benefits.</hs_para>

in passing. I will not go back to discussing what we did on Report
because I would be out of order to do so, but it illustrates the point
that inflation can be capricious. It is a difficult thing to forecast.
Some commentators who know more about it than I do were saying that,
for example, the recent weakness of sterling, which has dropped by 7%
in recent days, increases the risk of inflation, and so does the new
monetary policy framework that Mark Carney, the Governor-designate of
the Bank of England, is going to work with. We therefore need to look
at the Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:11:45"></hs_TimeCode>
carefully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000066">This
amendment is a rather clichéd parliamentary device, as an annual
report to Parliament is the last thing I could get the clerks to accept
as being in order. However, it gives us time to reflect on the
full-blown consequences of this Bill as we launch it on to the statute
book. I still have some deep concerns, which are not merely around the
question of the reduced household budgets of low-income working-age
families. As I said in Committee, the Bill sets a very dangerous
precedent for future Governments. If you believe, as I do, in the value
of social protection then implicit in that is your understanding that
temporary or maybe even long-term benefit recipients are also entitled,
over the longer term, to have a share in the national wealth of the
country. We all know that that national wealth is stagnating and we are
in difficult times; I understand that perfectly well. However, since
1992—and 
<?notus-xml column=800?>I stress that date, which is a long time ago—we have had the
absolutely implicit foundation of an understanding across party
divides: an acceptance that the uprating formula would be
sacrosanct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:13:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

times. Certainly, if the Government had said, “For the
forthcoming 12-month period, 1% is all we can afford”, as they
did, I am perfectly willing to consider that. I am sure that other
noble Lords are, too. On the savings in this Bill, colleagues may have
an advantage over me because I am just off a train from the Siberian
north and I have not had a chance to look at the new impact
assessment—I assume that one exists—on the new costs of
the Bill. Obviously the OBR’s estimates for inflation have
changed from 2.6% and 2.2% to 2.8% and 2.4%. Again, there is an
inflation uplift, which will adjust, in the Treasury’s favour,
the savings that the Bill will make. The Bill covers two years of
uprating but not this immediate year’s uprating, so an extra
£500 million will be saved in the coming year. Of course,
housing allowance, which is a different category of benefit, is not
covered in the Bill so the totality of the savings is not reflected in
the impact assessment, and last week’s impact assessment has
been adjusted because of the OBR’s more recent and accurate
estimates of
inflation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:25:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:15:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

reason for suggesting an annual report to Parliament is that this Bill
is different. It interrupts a well established tradition of how we deal
with uprating benefits. If we start to consider this as a conventional
way of doing things, it will be very tempting for future Treasury and
DWP Ministers to look in this direction for savings. Again in passing,
we learnt from the Budget last week that the Treasury—lo and
behold—is beginning to look at annually managed expenditure,
which is the demand-led part of the benefit system. How you put an
envelope around a demand-led service is a complete mystery to me.
Between<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:17:45"></hs_TimeCode> now and
the July comprehensive spending review announcements, we will look to
the Government Front Bench—either the Treasury or the DWP, or
both in concert—to assuage the fears that some of us have about
the announcement that we had the advantage of hearing in the Budget
last
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:16:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000069">We
need to be very careful about the Bill and to study its effects.
Subsection (3) of the proposed new clause suggests studying the effects
individually, benefit by benefit. It will otherwise be difficult to be
confident that we know what the consequences really are. Again, I say
in passing that I regret that there is no inflation protection in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:17:22"></hs_TimeCode>. The
amendment seeks merely to monitor the impact of the Bill. What I am
looking for from the ministerial Front Bench is, at the very least,
some rock-hard assurances that this will be very carefully studied. I
understand that everything is kept under review all the time, but this
falls between two stools. I would have a lot more confidence if
somebody took responsibility for the short-term and long-term
monitoring of the Bill. Should it be a Treasury Minister, a DWP
Minister or a joint Cabinet committee? Who or what will have the
responsibility for getting up in the morning to check the consequences
of the Bill carefully, month in and month out over the rest of the
Parliament and the CSR period, and all the way through to
2020?</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=801?><hs_para UID="13032511000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000070">If you alter the
baseline for an uprating system, as we have done in the Bill, you do it
in perpetuity. There is no way in which the money can be won back,
because the baseline is reduced and all the arithmetic is then
calculated from a lower starting level. Over the next 10, 15, 20 and 50
years, the effects of this uprating will be felt. That is something
about which we should be very
careful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:19:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000071">The
first period that I am concerned about is between now and the
comprehensive spending review Statement that will be made in June or
July. I think that we have a date for it. I hope that between now and
then we will be able to think carefully about the consequences of the
Bill. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:20:00"></hs_TimeCode>These
things are difficult to see when you are up close and they are
happening in front of you in real time. It is clear to me that, over
this Parliament, one of the biggest differences that there will be
between the previous Administration and this one by the time we get to
2015 is in the incidence of cuts on the working-age part of the benefit
caseload. The previous Government invested quite a lot of
money—some might say too much—on tax credits in order to
try and make work pay. One can argue about that. However, what one
cannot argue about is that by the time we get to 2015, one of the
biggest changes that I anticipate seeing to the profile of public
expenditure will be the relative reduction in the money that we are
devoting to supporting working-age families. I have looked carefully at
some of the Office for Budget Responsibility figures.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032511000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000072">There is, of course,
the very welcome policy of taking people out of tax. I agree with and
can see the force of that. However, that does not help the lower two
deciles of the household income distribution; people who are not
getting into taxation levels with their annual household income or,
indeed, people who are getting cycled into the threshold of income tax
levels. If their household income increases and they get housing
benefit, the income tax savings that they make for the household
increases their income and they get penalised in their housing benefit.
That will change when universal credit comes in. However, I do not
think universal credit will start carrying the weight that some of us
hoped it would as soon as we expected. I think that will be in 2017-18,
which is a long time coming for those in the bottom two deciles of the
household income distribution. Therefore, I am concerned about people
in poverty—the people who are cycling in and out of part-time
agency and temporary jobs. They are doing the best they can. The Work
Programme is not picking them up yet. There is a potential problem that
we need to monitor very carefully, as the amendment tries to
do.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032511000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000073">One point
I make in passing concerns the reconsideration of measures of baseline
poverty. I want to make a case for the Government to encourage in any
way they can the continuation of the concept of minimum income
standards, which are very important for two reasons. They are not
levels of benefit that Governments can expect to pay to low-income
households. They do two things. First, they measure the difference
between what people take into their households by way of income, month
in and month out, as against what the general public believe households
of that composition need to live on a modest but adequate income. That
tests public opinion about what people 
<?notus-xml column=802?>need to live on much more accurately than some opinion poll questions
about whether people are strivers or skivers, or any of the other
emotional language that is used. Having minimum income standards is an
important concept. Even if it is only through the academic work that
has been valuably done by Jonathan Bradshaw and his colleagues in the
past, I hope that minimum income standards will be part of the
background to the annual report which the amendment seeks to
introduce.</hs_para>

use some of the other evidence that we will get about households below
average income, which will be published in June or July. I hope that
that evidence will inform the discussion that will happen on
the comprehensive spending review to make sure that we are making
sensible arrangements and decisions for the following CSR period from
2015 to 2018. In addition, we should use an
annual report to Parliament to work with our local authority
colleagues, as this amendment suggests, to learn what they are doing by
way of services for working-age families in their areas. My
intelligence from local authorities is that they are already struggling
to provide services in that department, and we need to rely on them,
particularly in relation to changes in community tax benefit and the
abolition of discretionary grants under the Social Fund, which was
abolished, as noble Lords

that additional reports on the Bill are simply not necessary. As I said

said,<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:33:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:33:00"></hs_TimeCode>
at Budget last week the OBR revised its forecasts for inflation
slightly upwards. The forecasts increased by 0.3 percentage points for
the purpose of uprating in 2014-15, and by 0.1 percentage points in
2015-16. As I said last week, it was always a possibility that the
forecasts would change. Similarly, they can change again at the Autumn
Statement, and again at Budget 2014. These forecasts could go up as
well as down. However, Governments must make decisions based
on the best forecasts available at the time. The
OBR’s forecast at the Autumn Statement showed that
while inflation is forecast to be above 2% in the near term,
it is then forecast to fall back towards the target in the medium term.
This has not changed. As I set out last week, the OBR is not alone in
taking this view. The IMF, the OECD and the Bank of England all show
inflation falling back to target in the medium term. Nor has the
inflation target changed: it remains at

thing that has changed since we were last in this House is the Budget
announcement on public sector pay. The Budget announced that public
sector pay awards will be limited to an average of up to 1% in 2015-16.
This will be on top of four years of pay being either frozen or capped
at 1%, which included the period when inflation was at 5.2%, far above
the forecasts for the periods covered in the Bill. This is not a
justification for the Bill, but it is a reminder that people face
inflation risk in everyday life. The decision that the public sector
should continue to face a further year of pay restraint was a
difficult, but necessary, decision to support fiscal

is against this background that I repeat what I have said many times on
the Bill: that this Government do not take decisions to find savings
from welfare lightly. However, this Bill is necessary to make vital 
<?notus-xml column=805?>savings from welfare, to help reduce the deficit and to restore economic
recovery. The Government have set out their plans for spending in
advance to give confidence to the markets that we are taking the
necessary tough decisions. We can do that only by using the best
forecasts available at the time. These forecasts have changed, but they
continue to show inflation falling back to target in the medium term. I

purpose of these amendments is to introduce what is known as a forum
bar in extradition proceedings. A forum bar, which is an additional
ground on which extradition could be refused, was introduced in
2006 but it was never brought into force. The reason, as
given at the time by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Scotland—and I wish she was in her seat—was that it would
have put us in breach of our bilateral treaty obligations with all our
extradition partners. She was, surely, right about that. On 8 September
2010, the Home Secretary announced a review of our extradition
arrangements. Sir Scott Baker, a recently retired Lord Justice, was
appointed, with two colleagues, to consider the question of our
extradition arrangements generally and the forum bar in particular.
They produced a massive report which I have beside me here and they
came down firmly against a forum bar for all the reasons set out in
Part 6 of their report, which I will not repeat. They thought it was
much better that, 
<?notus-xml column=806?>where there is a contested forum, the forum should be agreed between the
prosecuting authorities in the two competing jurisdictions, not by the
court in one or other of them. Sir Scott Baker’s report was
published on 20 September 2011 and nothing happened until October 2012

Commons amendments, which I hope the House would wish to get on with.
The noble and learned Lord’s handwritten amendments have been
scheduled for debate at a particular point. At that time, he can move
the amendments he is speaking to or, indeed, the adjournment of the
House if that is what he would wish to do. I do not believe that he
reflects the sentiment of the House, which is that we have a lot of
business to get through today. This is clearly an important piece of

Lloyd of Berwick:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope that what I am about to
suggest will find favour with the noble Lord and the rest of the House.
I remind noble Lords that we have 20 pages of amendments before us to
consider at some time tonight. They were never considered at all on the
Floor of the House of Commons and have never been considered by us at
all, until now. They could have been brought before us last year. They
were not. They have been brought before us at the last moment, and it
is almost disgraceful for us to be asked to amend the law in an
important respect that will undoubtedly affect our foreign relations
without the matter having been properly considered in this House and
the other place. I am sorry that the noble Lord does not immediately
rise to that debate, but I seriously suggest to him—and I hope
that there will be support for this—that instead of debating
these 20 pages of amendments, the whole part that deals with
extradition should be considered in the next Session of Parliament. It
could easily be dealt with as a new Bill brought before either this
House or the other place at the beginning of the next Session. That
would be the proper way to deal with a matter of this
importance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:41:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendments in the Commons at the last minute that, by definition, we
cannot debate fully because we are dealing with Commons amendments. We
cannot have the proper debate that we would be likely to have in
Committee and on Report. We are being treated rather badly by the
Government. This is an important issue. A couple of years ago, when I
was a member, the Joint Committee on Human Rights spent a lot of time
considering extradition—it is an important issue. In terms of
parliamentary democracy, the Commons did not consider these amendments
at all, and we are being asked to do so in a truncated

Lords, particularly the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. We have
here a situation that is uncomfortably analogous to that which applies
to the Jobseekers (Back to Work Schemes) Bill, whereby these Commons
amendments are, in effect, being treated as if they were emergency
legislation. Admittedly, they do not have retrospective
effect, which I suppose is welcome, but the timetabling aspect is
extremely unsatisfactory. This House does not have an opportunity to
consider the amendments fully. There are a great many matters that your
Lordships will wish to discuss, not least around Leveson, which itself
has come late in the day—although one understands the reasons
for that. There is no particular reason why the measures to which the
noble and learned Lord referred must be dealt with today. I hope that
the Minister will acknowledge that it is asking too much of your
Lordships’ House to deal with this matter sensibly, fully and
thoroughly—as it needs to be—at such short notice,

<?notus-xml column=809?>well. However, with the creation of a National Crime Agency, it is
reasonable that the Government consider afresh how the current
counterterrorism policing arrangements work and to review whether there
might be a role that the agency could play to enhance our response to
the terrorist threat. These are questions that can sensibly be
considered only after the NCA is up and running and then
only after a full review. If a decision is made in the future that
there is a counterterrorism role for the National Crime Agency, then
the super-affirmative process, and the conditions that are tied to it,
provide ample opportunity for this House and the other place to
scrutinise the draft order to the degree that it deserves.</hs_para>

for a committee of either House to report on the draft order which the
Home Secretary must consider along with any other representations
before the original order, or a revised version of it following such
reports and representations, is placed before both Houses for approval.
It will then be for both Houses to debate and agree the order before it

the responsibility to lead the fight against serious, organised and

agreed with the Government that such a provision was not unprecedented,
and indeed the notion that additional functions could be conferred on a
statutory body by secondary legislation was well established. We have

have no preconceived notion as to the outcome of a review of
counterterrorism policing arrangements and the future role of the NCA,
if any, in those arrangements.</hs_para>

some noble Lords will know, and indeed will have experience of,
counterterrorism policing today is a partnership endeavour among all
police forces. Chief constables each retain their full operational
responsibility for policing in their force area, but they have put in
place through ACPO a framework of agreements which underpin the present
national counterterrorism policing arrangements. These consist of a
range of national lead responsibilities and support roles distributed
among several forces and undertaken by those forces on behalf of all
forces.</hs_para>

is right that in the future we should be giving consideration to how
the NCA might be able to enhance those arrangements. We continue to
believe that it is also right that we should build into the Bill the
flexibility to implement the outcome of such a review in a timely 
<?notus-xml column=810?>fashion through secondary legislation, but subject to a high level of
parliamentary scrutiny in the form of the super-affirmative procedure.
The Government would rightly be criticised if they could not implement
the findings of a review for a year or more for want of the necessary
primary legislation. This is not about whether the NCA should or should
not exercise counterterrorism functions. That debate is for the future.
Rather, the issue today is about the mechanism by which such functions
could be bestowed on the agency.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:53:29"></hs_TimeCode> mechanism
provided for in Commons Amendment 1 is therefore a perfectly proper
one. I would urge the House to agree the amendment and to

Smith of Basildon:</B> My Lords, as we have heard from the Minister, at
the Report stage of the Bill in November, your Lordships supported the
deletion of the clause that provided the Secretary of State with the
power to transfer by super-affirmative order counterterrorism functions
from the Metropolitan Police to the National Crime Agency. The
amendment was in my name and those of the noble Lord, Lord Blair, and
my noble friend Lord Rosser. The reason for the amendment was not the
transfer of functions, which may well be appropriate at some point in
the future, but because such an important and crucial decision should
benefit from the appropriate scrutiny of Parliament, which cannot be
provided for without primary legislation. As the Minister said,
government Amendment 1 would bring back that clause. My amendment, to
disagree with that amendment, would delete that provision and retain
the status
quo<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:55:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000110">The
reasons for bringing this amendment back to your Lordships’
House are perhaps three-fold. First, the priority of any Government and
any Parliament is the security of their citizens, and counterterrorism
is, as the noble Lord would readily confess, a key issue in that
security. I repeat and emphasise that we are not passing judgment on
whether it may, in future, be desirable for the NCA to have
responsibility for counterterrorism; only that such a decision must be
evidence-led and appropriately consulted on and scrutinised. The
Metropolitan Police have built up considerable expertise and skills in
relation to counterterrorism and if the Government wish to remove that
responsibility and function from the Met—the noble Lord referred
to a review—they would need to have a very strong case to do so.
I am sure that if it becomes the right course of action in time, that
case will be made, and considered appropriately. However, we do not
believe that this decision deserves anything other than full and proper
scrutiny, which can only be provided by primary legislation. That view
was fully endorsed last year by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in
its report on the Bill, which
stated:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13032511000229" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000229">“In
our view, the potential human rights implications of a decision to
confer counter-terrorism functions on the NCA are sufficiently
significant to warrant primary rather than secondary 
<?notus-xml column=811?>legislation, to ensure that Parliament has the fullest opportunity to
scrutinise the possible implications. We recommend that
clause 2 be deleted from the
Bill”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13032511000210" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000210">Your
Lordships’ House agreed with that conclusion and removed Clause
2 before sending the Bill to the other
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:56:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13032511000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000111">In
terms of effective scrutiny, which the noble Lord referred to in his
comments, it is disappointing that the Government did not reintroduce
this clause at the Committee stage in the other place but waited until
Report. Similar comments were made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Lloyd. I find it difficult to accept that this was a last-minute
decision by the Government to bring this clause back. Why did they not
bring it forward earlier, to allow the other place to have the
opportunity to debate it in Committee and have a fuller discussion? The
Minister said that it had full and, I think, considerable discussion in
the other place. In fact, it had two and a half hours on Report and I
am not convinced that that was long enough for the Commons fully to
consider the matter.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:57:35"></hs_TimeCode> is a big
decision and a major issue. Whatever decision is taken in time by the
Home Secretary and the Government about removing counterterrorism to
the NCA, if that is what they so decide, I want the Home Secretary and
the Government to have the full confidence of Parliament and the full
confidence of all those involved in counterterrorism that the right
decision has been
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:57:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000112">My
second point is that, although the noble Lord is right in that the
super-affirmative procedure allows for greater scrutiny than an
affirmative resolution, it does not provide the level of scrutiny that
gives that confidence for the Government or the Home Secretary that I
spoke about. The Minister helpfully wrote to me about the
super-affirmative order, for which I am grateful, and sent copies of
the letter to other noble Lords, repeating the process that was
originally in the Bill. He is right when he says that it provides the
highest degree of parliamentary scrutiny other than primary
legislation. That in itself recognises how important it is that this
measure has appropriate scrutiny. However, the briefing note
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13032511000230" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000230">“Whilst
the process makes express provision for a role of Committee of either
House (it is expected that this would fall to the Home Affairs Select
Committee in the House of Commons) this does not preclude a role for
those Standing Committees with interests in secondary
legislation”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13032511000211" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000211">The
note continues to say that the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments
and the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee will continue to
discharge their duties under this procedure. I did not know it had ever
been suggested that they would not. Of course they would. That is not a
reassurance but merely a statement of existing procedures for all
orders that come before your Lordships’ House.</hs_parafo>

the Report stage, we were assured that a super-affirmative order is, in
effect, amendable. To an extent, that is right, but, crucially, it can
be amended only at the draft stage that the noble Lord spoke of by
permission of the Secretary of State and by the Home Secretary. The
Secretary of State and the Home Secretary in the super-affirmative
order must have regard to any representation made. Parliament does not
have the power to amend; only the Secretary of State has
that power.</hs_para>

this clause has taken on a far greater significance on an issue that
the Minister did not refer to in his speech, but is important. As a
result of the failure to gain agreement on a legislative consent Motion
from the Northern Ireland Assembly so that the National Crime Agency
can be genuinely national and not the nearly National Crime Agency that
we have now, we have an amendment in the next group to disapply the
provisions of the NCA to Northern Ireland. We will have an opportunity
to discuss that in more detail in the next group. However, it is
extremely serious that the Government have got into a position where
they have scrapped our existing national organisation for serious and
organised crime, SOCA, before reaching agreement with the Assembly
about its replacement. We now have no nationally reaching
equivalent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000115" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000115">I
think I heard the noble Lord mutter, “Is that relevant?”.
It is entirely relevant to the discussion before us today on the issue
of scrutiny. We understand that some Members of the Assembly have
significant concerns over the provisions relating to the operations of
the NCA in Northern Ireland, particularly in the potential future
responsibility for counterterror operations within Northern Ireland.
Clearly, the history of counterterrorism and the link between
paramilitary organisations and serious and organised crime in Northern
Ireland mean that special consideration will need to be given to how
the NCA might operate in relation to counterterrorism in Northern
Ireland. That is not a job for secondary legislation. We have serious
concerns that the re-introduction of Clause 2 by the Government will
make any agreement with Northern Ireland regarding the NCA even more
difficult than is now the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000116" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000116">Why are
the Government insisting on a clause that might put any agreement on
the NCA’s operations in Northern Ireland permanently out of

heard previously in the debate, and resoundingly rejected by your
Lordships’ House. The Minister of State, Jeremy Browne, said in
the other

Government have not taken a view as to whether counter-terrorism should
be transferred into the NCA. The NCA is not even up and running yet. It

the Home Secretary may wish to
consider”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13032511000212" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000212">That

will have to be considered if there is to be a change include the fact
that more than 80% of terrorist offences on the mainland are played

and prevention are as important as detection. Therefore, an integrated
approach, which the Metropolitan Police has built up over decades with
school visits, visits to mosques and neighbourhood policing, is as
important in the fight against terrorism as the drama of executing
warrants early in the morning and dramatic seizures of explosives. This
is an integrated effort that has been built up over

This amendment raises exactly the same set of questions about the
quality of scrutiny that is possible for executive decisions. The
Minister said that no decisions have been taken and that whether this
is something the Government will want to do is an open question. He
said that we need to see how the National Crime Agency develops and
that only then will it be necessary to review and perhaps bring forward
proposals. If that is the case, why do we need to legislate in this
Bill for this process to happen in this particular way? If the Minister
was saying that for the next 10 years the Home Office will not be
presenting any Bills to Parliament and therefore this is the only
legislative opportunity that exists, then maybe there would be a case
for it. However, I do not recall a year when the Home Office has
managed with no Bills. Sometimes it has had as many as four Bills

will not be a suitable legislative opportunity at whatever time in the

be a simple matter which could be considered through even the elevated

noble Lord, Lord Condon, stated, of counterterrorist 
<?notus-xml column=815?>work with mainstream policing is extremely important. I have probably
said this in your Lordships’ House before but I live
close to the Finsbury Park mosque. On the occasion that the Finsbury
Park mosque was raided, as I arrived at the Underground station
Metropolitan police officers were distributing leaflets explaining to
the local community what had happened, why it had happened and what
safeguards had been taken to protect the religious parts of that
mosque. That was because counterterrorism is integrated into mainstream
policing and there was a recognition that the Metropolitan Police would
have to continue to police those streets after such a raid. That is why
the integration of and arrangements with the counterterrorist units
within the various forces around the country are so important. Shifting
some or all of that to the National Crime Agency is complicated. These
are not straightforward issues and they certainly ought to be debated
properly in Parliament. That is what we are likely to
miss.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000130">I
have another concern. We all now need the National Crime Agency to be a
success and I believe it probably will be but it is going to take a
while. Every reorganisation takes time. Every time you throw all the
pieces up in the air and wait for them to settle, there is a period
when the organisations have to come together. This is saying to an
organisation which is not yet formally established, as this legislation
is not yet through, that there may be some massive change to its remit
just around the corner. I do not believe that is good for the current
functions of the National Crime Agency; nor do I think it is
necessarily good for counterterrorism if that change is to be made at

Regulatory Reform Committee, I confirm that the Minister is right that
we said that the super-affirmative procedure had been used before in
similar cases and, in principle, could be used. However, that is not a
key question. The key question has already been put and I do not wish
to elaborate on it too much. Is it appropriate to use that procedure or
would it in fact be better for quality-of-legislation purposes to have
new legislation in the situation described in the proposed new clause?
I tend to the view that if you are going to make a decision
of that type, then new legislation would be better.</hs_para>

it might become urgent to do that and whether we would then need urgent
legislation, given that it deals with terrorism. I find it difficult to
see the circumstances in which that might happen, but if it did then
both Houses are quite capable of urgent legislation. However, that does
not seem to be on the agenda. The real question is whether we would get
the legislation right. In those circumstances, particularly 
<?notus-xml column=816?>given the nature of the cross-party consensus that one is usually able
to build when you are looking for ways of dealing with terrorism, I
would be surprised if it were not possible for a new Bill to be dealt

Reid of Cardowan:</Member></B> My Lords, I approached this issue with
an open mind and attempted to ask myself what benefits might be gained
from doing this particular thing in this particular fashion. I do not
think that I have ever been accused of being soft on terrorism. I
genuinely believe that the first obligation of a Government is to
protect their citizens. I therefore sought to discover, in asking
myself and in listening to others, what might be the huge advantage and
efficacy, first, of transferring from the Metropolitan Police to the
NCA and, secondly, of doing it in this fashion. I am afraid that I
failed to persuade myself that there is such a case.</hs_para>

my noble friend Lord Harris and the noble Lord, Lord Condon, I have no
particular interest in the Metropolitan Police, although obviously I
have an interest as a former Home Secretary. However, the points that
they made about the nature of the fight against terrorism were very
well made. This is not just a mechanistic operational question. It
covers far more than investigations and intelligence. It covers
community relations, counter-radicalisation, relationships in the
community, and so on. I fully accept that there is a degree of
resistance, sometimes unspoken, from police services throughout the
country as the Met has the lead on this. However, I think that it has
discharged that responsibility very well indeed. In the absence of any
problem to be solved, we have to ask why a solution of this nature has
been
proffered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:18:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000136" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000136">My
second point concerns the emerging nature of the National Crime Agency.
Every time I read about the NCA, which has not yet been formally
established, as my noble friend Lord Harris pointed out, it seems to
have inflated its own powers and scope. I am not quite sure who now
controls the fight against illegal immigration as the UK Border Agency
has been split off into a different agency and there is a second
agency that comes under the Home Office. I understand that
there are thoughts about the NCA having responsibility for controlling
our borders as well and now counterterrorism is being envisaged. My
third point is that we cannot start this from scratch. The fight
against terrorism relies on a reservoir of experience, a culture, an
operational expertise, knowledge within the system and so
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000137">My final
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:18:47"></hs_TimeCode> is about
the nature of doing this. If it was absolutely essential to transfer
such powers immediately, in a very short period or without obstacle or
difficulty, I could see the Government’s case, but I have not
yet been able to envisage such circumstances. Indeed, if I envisage
sudden emergencies arising, I would have thought that that was
precisely the time you do not want to change the agency handling them.
You would want to carry out such a profound change 
<?notus-xml column=817?>in such an important area over a period of time with a great
deal of thought being given to the transition. If that is
the case, why are we looking for some immediate expedient to transfer
it with the minimum of parliamentary
scrutiny?</hs_para>

with an open mind, I have found what I have heard so far entirely
unpersuasive. I have listened to everything that has been said but I do

assist
it.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_25_PT_1/7FFF9BB1AB3AC5AE7FA738BC1703B940D86A05C9" __version__="1.12"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 March 2013">Monday,

thing and ask one question. I gather that in the other place it was
said that this is a procedural matter. It is not a
procedural matter, but a matter of national security. The
deputy national co-ordinator of counterterrorism, a Metropolitan Police
officer acting under the command of the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner, said in public this week that the terrorist
threat is rising. As my noble friend Lord Condon said, and I can vouch
for it from my time as commissioner, there has not been a
single plot that did not arise in, pass through or aim at
London. When the bombs go off, whether in London or Glasgow,
only the Metropolitan Police can put thousands of officers on the road
or fly people in Chinook helicopters to Scotland.
That is because the Metropolitan Police is the size it is.
The NCA will never be that size. That is one other aspect of why the
Met is the right beast to do this job of enormous national
importance.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032511000141" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000141">I
echo the points being made to the Minister. Has there been any evidence
of failures in counterterrorism by the Metropolitan Police? There is no
evidence that anybody seems to be aware of. Is there any evidence that
having counterterrorism policing in a separate agency from territorial
police forces is a good idea? No, there is not, and there is exactly
the opposite if you look across the Atlantic with the divisions between
the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the CIA, the New York
Police Department, and so on. The person who first began to mention the
idea that counterterrorism should be taken from the Metropolitan Police
is one Boris Johnson. He made that point in 2008 at the Conservative
Party conference. I would like reassurance from the Minister that the
sectional interests of London Conservatives are not being put in front
of national security because the reason that Boris gives for this is
that it would allow the Mayor of London alone to choose the
Metropolitan Police Commissioner without the influence of the Home
Secretary. That is a very poor argument for imperilling national
security.</hs_para>

Hamwee:</Member></B> What we are being asked to do this afternoon is to
consider the procedure around a substantial issue, but it is the
procedure. It seems quite logical that counterterrorism should be dealt
with alongside and as part of dealing with serious crime 
<?notus-xml column=818?>and organised crime. They are often inseparable activities that fund
terrorism, and I suspect they largely come within the remit of the NCA,
or will do when it is in operation. The NCA will be able to task police
forces. Can the Minister confirm that it will not have a lot of bodies
on the ground, but will be able to task existing
forces—including, presumably, the Met? Is this the way it is to

that this is not about the Metropolitan Police any more than it is

is about a procedure whereby we can use or consider using the National
Crime Agency as a co-ordinating body within any future counterterrorism

disappointment but it does not remove the opportunity, as we
will find when we discuss the next series of amendments, for
the National Crime Agency to operate in Northern Ireland. That is not
the point at issue. It has always been recognised that in
counterterrorism matters the Police Service of Northern Ireland has a
particular role of its own, and this legislation respects that role. We
are not making a decision about the future of counterterrorism. We are
putting in place an opportunity for Parliament —my
noble friend Lady Hamwee is quite right about this—to put the
conclusion of a future review in place without undue delay so that
there is an opportunity, perhaps for the first time, to consider fully
the implications of how counterterrorism is co-ordinated on a national
base. It would not be understood by people outside this place if,
having conducted a review, and that review having been announced to

until the NCA is up and running. This is about

Indeed, he is right that there is almost nothing I disagree with in
what he said, with one exception: his lack of explanation as to why one
could not have legislation following a review. It is quite possible to
have consultation in a review and then parliamentary scrutiny. He is
presenting it as if one can only have a review and consultation if one
is going to the affirmative procedure. What he has not explained is the
need for that mechanism and the avoidance of further parliamentary
scrutiny, not in the detail but on the major issue, should it arise, of
the transfer of the lead on counterterrorism. That is a substantial
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:41:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> I am certain it is the nature of these
things that following the review, Parliament would have an opportunity
to debate the issue before the super-affirmative proposal is laid. I
made the point earlier that any party affected by this secondary
legislation has the right to be consulted. Parliament itself is likely
to express a view when that decision of a review is made, before a
super-affirmative procedure is even tabled. I cannot imagine an issue
of this importance passing noble Lords’ attention and not being
brought to the attention of the Minister in this House to account for
what was being proposed. I cannot see that being a realistic scenario.
I would expect to have to answer to this House for a decision of that
nature. Indeed, the super-affirmative procedure provides for an
opportunity for full consideration of the detail, as the noble Lord has
said, of what is going to be required in the transfer of these
powers.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032511000162" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000162">My
noble friend Lady Hamwee asked about tasking powers in the NCA because
they apply to police forces in England and Wales and they would apply

such functions were confirmed through secondary legislation, or the

falls into the same mistake that his colleague Jeremy Browne made in
the other place as seeing this as a procedural issue. He will have
heard from noble Lords tonight with enormous experience—far more
experience than either he or I have in these matters—that it is

well. As the noble Lord, Lord Reid, said, adding scrutiny to what he
regards as a questionable transfer—although others would see it
differently—but to something that raises concern, can only help
rather than hinder any Government. Our Cross-Bench Peers with enormous

that the NCA is operating correctly, those doubts should be raised in

the most noteworthy amendments in this group. They are Amendments 28,
29, 44, 47 and 138, which, as I alluded to in the previous debate,
relate to the National Crime Agency’s role in Northern Ireland.
These amendments are a regrettable but necessary response to the
Northern Ireland Executive’s decision not to take forward
legislative consent for the National Crime Agency. To say that this is
a disappointing outcome does not do justice to the implications that
this will have for the effectiveness of the National Crime Agency, the
integrity of the collective operational response to serious and
organised crime and, most importantly, the protection of the people of
Northern Ireland.</hs_para>

clear that the National Crime Agency will continue to operate in
Northern Ireland, albeit that its activity will be limited to reserved
and excepted matters such as immigration offences and drug trafficking.
The amendments and the new schedule that are necessary to ensure that
the Bill does not break the Sewel convention give effect to
that limitation.</hs_para>

introduced by Amendment 138 sets out those provisions that will not
extend to Northern Ireland. As a result, for example, NCA officers will
no longer be able to be designated with the powers of a constable in
Northern Ireland, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland will no
longer have oversight of the NCA in Northern Ireland, and the PSNI has
been removed from the duties to co-operate and share information. These
are important operational losses, but as transferred matters they are
areas on which we in this House cannot legislate without
consent.</hs_para>

importantly, the new schedule also provides a series of order-making
powers whereby should the position of the Northern Ireland Executive
change in the future, the NCA provisions can be extended to Northern
Ireland, subject to the agreement of the Northern Ireland Assembly. We
will, of course, do our utmost to minimise the operational impact of
the Executive’s decision, but the limitations on the
agency’s activity in Northern Ireland will have implications for
the fight against serious and organised crime in Northern Ireland. I
must not mislead the House on that point.</hs_para>

I have indicated, the NCA will continue to operate on a UK-wide basis,
including in Northern Ireland. Even with the restrictions in the new
schedule, there is still much that the NCA can do to tackle serious,
organised and complex crime in Northern Ireland, both through its own
investigations and by supporting the Police Service of Northern Ireland
and other agencies. The strong operational relationship that the
Serious Organised Crime Agency has built up with the Police Service of
Northern Ireland will continue with the National Crime Agency. NCA
officers will still be able to be designated with customs and
immigration powers and will therefore be able to take action against
serious, organised and complex customs and immigration cases.</hs_para>

able to focus on asset recovery work, whether through the excepted tax
assessments under Part 6 of the Proceeds of Crime Act or through taking
forward civil recovery cases against property in 
<?notus-xml column=827?>Northern Ireland in respect of reserved or excepted offences such as
immigration offences, fuel duty evasion and drug trafficking. More
importantly, operational partners will continue to be able to access
the wider specialist capabilities that will reside in the National
Crime Agency, such as the new National Cyber Crime Unit, the
NCA’s network of international liaison officers and the Child
Exploitation and Online Protection
Centre.</hs_para>

that my right honourable friend the Home Secretary is continuing to
work with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Northern
Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, to secure agreement. These
amendments do not in any sense denote an end to our negotiations. It
remains our objective to ensure that the NCA can operate in Northern
Ireland in the same way that it can in the rest of the
United Kingdom. Until that time, these amendments are but a necessary
stop-gap so that we respect the Sewel convention. We will continue to
strive for an equitable agreement between the parties in Northern
Ireland and, once secured, these amendments will ensure that we have
the necessary order-making powers to give effect to such an
agreement.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032511000177" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000177">I
hope that I can deal briefly with the other amendments in this group.
Commons Amendment 2 to Clause 2 converts the existing power on the Home
Secretary to set strategic priorities for the NCA into a duty to do so.
The Home Secretary’s role in setting the strategic direction for
the agency is obviously of central importance. The Government’s
intention has always been that the Home Secretary would set the
strategic priorities, in accordance with the power granted by Clause 2.
By placing such a duty on the Home Secretary, we will ensure that the
agency will always have clear strategic direction from the Government
of the day.</hs_para>

namely Commons Amendments 52 to 60 to Schedule 8, are essentially
technical and drafting in nature. I can provide further details if any

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister’s proposals are, as
he said, a matter of deep regret with regard to Northern Ireland. For
those noble Lords who perhaps have not followed the case, the Northern
Ireland Executive refused to allow the powers of a constable to be
conferred on an NCA official. This means that, in practice, Sinn Fein
vetoed the establishment of the National Crime Agency in respect of
reserved matters.</hs_para>

different ways. We can hope, as the Minister says, that there will be a
change of heart. There will not. My fear is that this will
inadvertently result in Northern Ireland being used as a back door
whereby people who are focused on crime could use the absence of the
NCA to carry out their activities unmolested, unless the Police Service
of Northern Ireland undertakes some of the roles that would otherwise
have been carried out by the NCA in Northern Ireland. That will incur a
cost that I doubt very much there are currently resources to meet. It
also means that the national expertise that the National Crime Agency
could bring to bear on these criminals will not be 
<?notus-xml column=828?>brought to bear. Common sense dictates that where you have a vacuum,
people will fill it. While I accept the regrettable need for these
amendments, I do not share the Minister’s current optimism that
these matters will be resolved by negotiation. I just do not believe
that they will be
resolved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:09:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about the devolution of policing and justice to Northern Ireland in the
absence of a full agreement between the parties on how things would be
done. There was no such agreement. It was a political necessity that
was politically driven in the same manner as the euro was. The working
out of the downstream consequences had not been done. It is therefore a
matter of deep regret. Can the Minister tell the House what steps the
Government will take if evidence emerges that there are elements of
activity in Northern Ireland that are not dealt with by the PSNI, thus
creating a vacuum in which people can indulge in criminal activities
which could spread to the mainland? While I understand the conventions,
I have to say to the Minister that devolution means precisely what it
says. Power is devolved, but what is devolved can be
undevolved. If there is therefore a national threat, I would
like an assurance that the Government will meet
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:11:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Browne of Belmont:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, regret that the role
of the National Crime Agency in Northern Ireland has had to be limited
due to the intransigence of Sinn Fein and the SDLP in blocking
agreement to the legislative consent Motion for the NCA. Every year in
Northern Ireland, hundreds of millions of pounds are lost to the
Exchequer only to pass into the hands of criminal gangs, often to
finance terrorist activities. To date, as a result of the joint work
between SOCA and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, some 11
million drugs have been seized, 33 potential victims of human
trafficking have been rescued, 23 million counterfeit and
smuggled cigarettes have been intercepted, and £4 million of
criminal assets
seized<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:12:09"></hs_TimeCode>. How will
this work continue, when the National Crime Agency will have very
little input into key issues in Northern Ireland as Clause 14 will
abolish SOCA, which currently operates with the PSNI? After Royal
Assent, that will not
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:12:28"></hs_TimeCode>. I trust
that the Government will continue to negotiate with the Northern

years I had the privilege of chairing the Northern Ireland Affairs
Committee in another place. The first major inquiry we conducted was
into organised crime. The report was received with concern, but also

for very hard, but when it came to the devolution of policing and
justice, many of us had considerable concerns and misgivings. Even so,
we were glad that further progress was being made in what had been the
most troubled part of our kingdom. However, the noble Lord, Lord Empey,
was right in what he said in his concluding words. We have not
dissolved the United Kingdom. Supreme authority rests with this
Parliament. If those to whom we have 
<?notus-xml column=829?>devolved behave in such a way that not only do they endanger Northern
Ireland, but by implication the rest of the United Kingdom, this
Parliament cannot sit idly by. Although this should not be taken, any
more than the words of the noble Lord, Lord Empey, as any sort of
threat, it is a statement of the reality of the situation. Devolution
does not mean independence. Devolution means responsibility, and if
responsibility is not exercised responsibly, those who have devolved

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, when the Crime and Courts
Bill first came to your Lordships’ House, I questioned the
Minister as to whether it was—I think I used the
term—“oven ready”, as there seemed to be so much
left to do in the Bill. Given that what was then a 41-clause Bill now
has 18 new clauses, it was right to ask that question. The extradition
issues, as we have heard from noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, have
been tagged on to the Bill. Indeed, the framework document which
outlines everything the National Crime Agency should do and how it
should do it is still not available, despite promises made at almost
every stage of the Bill in your Lordships’ House and the other
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:15:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000186" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000186">One
thing that emphasises that point is that no agreement was reached with
the Northern Ireland political parties or the Assembly around what kind
of architecture would work for Northern Ireland to ensure that, as we
started the process, there would be a legislative consent Motion. To
scrap SOCA, which has worked effectively with the PSNI in Northern
Ireland, before the National Crime Agency is properly in place across
the whole of the UK is an absolutely shocking state of affairs. It does
a disservice to Northern Ireland and is hugely unfair to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:16:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000187" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000187">I
understand that having discussions and negotiations with all those
involved to ensure that agreement can be reached can be difficult and
very time-consuming. The Government were right to have discussions and
negotiations with David Ford, the Justice Minister, and I would accept
and agree that he has worked extremely hard to find a way through this
to ensure that the National Crime Agency could fully operate in
Northern Ireland. However, I say to the Minister that the
responsibility has to be that of government. I realise that in their
negotiations with David Ford the Government have worked hard, but what
I am puzzled about, and where I have a question mark over the
Government’s actions, is that those who have been involved more
closely in Northern Ireland know that in order to reach agreement on
this issue—I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, is very
aware of this—you have to start early discussions with all the
political parties, the elected representatives and all those who have a
role to play. The comments made by Mark Durkan in the other place last
week indicate to me that the discussions did not take place early
enough.</hs_para>

Ministers and officials have met “a wide variety of

Kingdom. Discussions were needed not with international partners but
with the political parties and representatives of the Northern Ireland
Assembly. That may mean that the Government, or the Home Office, have
been talking to the Irish Government, which is a fair way forward, but
not to be having those discussions that I think were necessary has led
us to the point where, like the noble Lord, Lord Empey, I do not know,
and do not share the Minister’s confidence, that this can be
resolved in the way that we would like to ensure there is a fully
functioning National Crime Agency across the whole of the

Questions—if he has to write to me I will accept that but if he

first raise the issue of the National Crime Agency, with or without the
counterterrorism functions, with the Northern Ireland Ministers and
political parties? Who has led the discussion? Has it been the NIO or
has it been the Home Office, and who did they meet? However, the
crucial question has to be: what happens now? What next? The Motion
before us today from the Government that removes application provisions
from the Bill is, under the circumstances, perhaps the only way forward
at this stage. However, I hope we are going to see a step-up and
continuation of the process in the interest of fighting serious and
organised crime effectively in Northern Ireland and that there is not

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I understand the distress
and disappointment, and if I may use the phrase used by the
noble Lord, Lord Empey, the pessimism that he feels about these issues
is clearly reflected in other contributions that have been made 
<?notus-xml column=831?>by other noble Lords. On the other hand, I am optimistic because,
despite the criticism made by the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, we have
sought to address these issues properly. If we had been overassertive
in the requirements of the United Kingdom in this regard, we would have
alienated a legitimate discussion process that was correctly placed
with David Ford, the Justice Minister in the Northern Ireland
Executive, and in the key position of securing these agreements. We
were keen not to put him in the situation where we were seeking to
second-guess where he was taking these
discussions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000192" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000192">I
will answer the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, in writing because she
asked particularly about dates and so on. I do not have that
information. Ministers and officials have had a number of meetings with
David Ford throughout this process. The noble Baroness will know that I
have talked to her about this on occasions outside this Chamber when
she has asked me how things were going on this. I remember saying that
it is a difficult and delicate matter. All noble Lords with experience
of Northern Ireland will understand exactly why that is so. The
Government were right that while we were prepared to compromise on a
number of challenging areas, the negotiations had not been held on the
basis of securing consent at all costs. I think noble Lords will be
pleased that that is the case. That must be the right position for the
Government of the United Kingdom to take on this
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000193" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000193">For
noble Lords who think that the Government should have intervened
directly, I should say that this is devolution, a devolved process. It
is absolutely right that the Justice Minister in Northern Ireland,
David Ford, led these discussions. He has admirably served the
interests of Northern Ireland in this regard with remarkable
resilience, driving the discussions and negotiations at each turn, even
in the face of some clear opposition. I have confidence in him, which
is why I am ultimately optimistic that the people of Northern Ireland,
through their elected representatives, will see the importance of
having a combined national involvement with the National Crime Agency
because of the capacity that it will bring to policing in Northern
Ireland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000194" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000194">We
are not in the business of creating gaps. The NCA was intended to close
gaps in the current arrangements. That was in the Bill that we planned
to create, but the Executive could not agree, which is why these
amendments are before the House. We remain open to discussion and we
have provided the necessary order-making powers to fully extend the NCA
provisions to Northern Ireland should the position of the Executive
change. Assuming the Executive stick to their decision, it is up to
them to decide how to develop alternative capabilities for Northern
Ireland to replace the work currently done by SOCA. As I have said, we
are committed to providing as much operational capacity and capability
as possible for the NCA operating in Northern Ireland. But, as I made
clear, in the absence of legislative consent there are some things that
the NCA will no longer be able to do, such as using Northern Ireland
police powers to investigate serious and organised crime. This is to be
regretted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:25:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving that this House do
agree with Commons Amendment 3, I shall speak also to
Commons Amendments 4, 7 to 10, 32 to 37, 42, 43, 51, 61 to 92, 93 to
130 and 132. This group of amendments covers a range of issues in
respect of provisions in Part 2 of the Bill, as well as adding some new
provisions to that part, but I believe that they will generally be
welcomed. I propose to focus my remarks on the most significant of
these
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000198">Commons
Amendment 3 makes a specific and technical amendment to the youth
secure remand provisions in Section 102 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing
and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012. Under those provisions, local
authorities are liable to pay the Youth Justice Board the accommodation
costs of children subject to secure remand. As of 3 December 2012,
courts ordering a secure remand must designate a local authority as the
designated authority for the child. Full financial responsibility for
the accommodation costs of securely remanded children will fall to the
designated local authorities as of 1
April.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000199" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000199">This
amendment addresses a gap in the current law. When remanding
a child, the court will tend to designate the local authority where the
child lives. However, this is not always clear at the early stages
of the case, so the court may designate a different local
authority. By the next hearing, more information is generally
available, so the court can change the designation to the local
authority where the child lives. But under Section 102 of the 2012 Act,
the liability to pay the secure accommodation costs for the period
before the change is made still rests with the original
local authority. This creates an unfair burden on a local 
<?notus-xml column=834?>authority where the child does not live, and puts at risk the effective
recovery of costs by the Youth Justice Board. Therefore,
Commons Amendment 3 gives the court powers to make a replacement
designation, so all the accommodation costs can be recovered
from the local authority that has subsequently been
identified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000200" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000200">In
addition, the amendment introduces the assumption that the court should
designate the local authority where the child lives rather than the
authority where the offence took place. The Government believe that in
most cases it is right to designate the local authority where the child
lives in accordance with the habitual residence test from which the
duty for a local authority to provide accommodation and support flows.
Of course, the court will retain overall discretion over deciding which
local authority to
designate.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13032511000283" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000283">5.30

amendments on judicial appointments, the House will recall
that as part of the changes the Government are making to the judicial
appointments process, the details of the selection process for certain
judicial offices, including for the office of the Lord Chief Justice
and heads of division, will be removed from the Constitutional Reform
Act 2005 and instead be set out in secondary legislation. As the
current Lord Chief Justice is soon to retire, the Government want a new
selection process for the Lord Chief Justice to be applied to the
selection of his successor. If the appointment process is to be
completed in good time for the start of the new judicial year, we
cannot wait until the required secondary legislation is made once the
Bill is enacted. Commons Amendment 4 therefore adds the new selection
process to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and provides for the
process to come into force on Royal Assent. This is a transitory
measure and will cease to have effect when the subsequent regulations
are
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000202" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000202">Commons
Amendment 93 applies the tipping-point provision to UK Supreme Court
appointments, similar to the one being applied to other judicial
appointments by Part 2 of Schedule 13 to the Bill. The
Government’s position has always been that the tipping point
should apply to Supreme Court appointments. We believe that
Section 159 of the Equality Act 2010 could already be applied to
Supreme Court appointments, but on Third Reading my noble friend Lord
Marks expressed some doubt as to whether this was the case. After
considering the points raised by my noble friend, the Government
brought forward Commons Amendment 93, which removes any
uncertainty that a tipping point can apply to Supreme Court
appointments. Commons Amendment 130 relates to the judicial deployment
provisions in Schedule 14 to the Bill, which aim to provide greater
flexibility in deploying judges to different courts and tribunals.
After further consultation with the judiciary about the extent of these
flexible deployment provisions, and given the particular skills and
experience needed in Crown Court cases, we have concluded that the
Crown Court should be removed from the deployment
provisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000203" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000203">On
the UK Supreme Court, I am sure the House will wholeheartedly welcome
Commons Amendment 7. Both on Report and at Third Reading in
this House, 
<?notus-xml column=835?>the Government indicated that we were discussing the appointments
process for the chief executive of the UK Supreme Court with the
president of the court with a view to arriving at an agreed way
forward. I am pleased to report that these discussions were
successfully concluded, and as a result Commons Amendment 7 amends the
Constitutional Reform Act 2005 so that the president of the UK Supreme
Court, rather than the Lord Chancellor, is made responsible for the
appointment of the chief executive, and it is no longer necessary for
the chief executive to agree the staffing structure of the court with
the Lord
Chancellor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000204" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000204">On
broadcasting, as the House is aware, Clause 28 confers on the Lord
Chancellor the power to make an order, with the agreement of the Lord
Chief Justice, setting out circumstances in which the current
legislative ban on broadcasting court proceedings below the Supreme
Court level may be disapplied. When we debated these provisions
previously, I believe all were agreed that while it is important for
justice to be seen to be done, this must not be at the expense of the
proper administration of justice. I remember talking to this particular
amendment at the time. Let me just reiterate some of the reassurances
that were given. Any order made under Clause 28 will be subject to a
triple lock requiring: first, the agreement of the Lord Chancellor;
secondly, the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice; and, thirdly,
scrutiny by Parliament under the affirmative procedure. In addition to
this, there is a fourth lock, which will give judges the discretion to
stop filming or to refuse to allow broadcast of recorded footage in a
particular
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000205" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0001.htm#13032511000205">Clause
28(3) sets out the judicial tests that a judge must apply when
considering whether to stop or prohibit filming in order to protect the
interests of victims, witnesses and other parties. As currently
drafted, only individuals who are party to proceedings are protected.
We strongly believe that the court should be allowed to consider the
impact on individuals who are not party to proceedings—for
example, the families of victims and offenders—when considering
whether to use the judicial veto. As such, Commons Amendment 9 would
modify these tests to give the judge a wider discretion to stop the
filming or broadcasting of court proceedings.</hs_para>

to consider whether “any person involved in the proceedings is
not unduly prejudiced” would be replaced with a broader
requirement for the court to consider whether any person will be unduly
prejudiced, irrespective of whether they are a party to the
proceedings. Commons Amendments 8, 10, 33 and 37 put beyond doubt the
fact that the UK Supreme Court may record and broadcast its
proceedings. They are essentially amendments that clarify this
position.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000207" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032511000207">On
the issue of self-defence, as the House will recall, Clause 30 provides
householders with greater protection to defend themselves in the event
that they are confronted by intruders in their homes. Householders will
not be treated as criminals in these terrifying circumstances if they
use a level of force that was reasonable in the circumstances as they
saw them but which turns out to have been disproportionate. The 
<?notus-xml column=836?>Government are anxious to avoid any unnecessary delay in delivering what
is a specific coalition commitment and an important enhancement to the
protection that householders have to defend themselves. We think the
public would find it difficult to understand why commencement had been
delayed beyond Royal Assent if, in the intervening period, a
householder came face to face with a burglar and could not rely on
the heightened defence. Commons Amendment 43, therefore,
will mean that the householder defence provisions in Clause
30 of the Bill will come into effect on Royal
Assent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000208" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032511000208">In
moving on to the restorative justice provisions in the Bill and Commons
Amendment 132, I reiterate the Government’s absolute commitment
to ensuring that high-quality RJ is embedded into and established
across the criminal justice system. Following further debate in the
other place, it was agreed that it would be beneficial to amend the
Bill to provide that RJ practitioners must have regard to any guidance
that is issued by the Secretary of State, with a view to encouraging
good practice in the delivery of pre-sentence restorative justice. The
Government believe this will allow us to ensure that RJ can continue to
grow and local innovation can continue to flourish while at the same
time ensuring that good practice is spread nationwide. Commons
Amendment 132 gives effect to
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032511000209" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032511000209">Finally,

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I will confine myself to two topics.
Taken in reverse order of importance, the first is what has become
known in common parlance as “bash the burglar”
legislation. The Minister emphasised the need for bringing this measure
into force as quickly as possible. Given the paucity of cases to which
this would apply, as we discussed when we were debating the Bill, I
find this to be little more than an example of gesture politics of the
cheapest
kind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032519000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032519000002">The
second more significant matter, which I entirely support the Government
in raising, is Amendment 9 about making use of films and other
recordings of proceedings. I would not have spoken at all on this
matter except that there was a report in the press at the end of last
week about the position in Scotland where it now appears that a drama
is going to be broadcast based entirely on recordings in the criminal
court. This is under Scottish legislation; it is not legislation that
applies in this country. This is exactly what those who have expressed
fears about filming proceedings in court were really worried might take
place. Apparently witnesses, parties in criminal cases and, in this
particular case, a retrial of a significant case regarding a serious
offence have been filmed and will be shown on Scottish television,
presumably, as a rather dramatic production rather than a factual and
low-key look at how the courts work. The English legislation that we
are debating does not facilitate that, and I would be glad to hear the
Minister give a firm assurance that it will not be extended to allow
that kind of development, which would be a significant change in the
way that the 
<?notus-xml column=837?>Government have envisaged matters and one in which we should in no way

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for his support
for much of what has been covered. He referred to self-defence as
“bash the burglar”. He may think that; I could not
possibly comment. We believe it is important that if the legislation is
passed, no one should fall into the trap between Royal Assent being
given and this becoming law so that it can be used as a defence. If we
are making these changes, it is important that they happen as quickly
as possible so that we prevent any occurrence of people who act. I
contend that anyone confronted with a burglar, faced with such a
situation where they are protecting their home, their family and their
loved ones, is often faced with that instant decision. It is important
that we give that instant protection. I therefore believe that the
Government have taken the right way forward on this. I am sure that, on
reflection, the noble Lord would agree with

mentioned broadcasting and, again, I welcome his support. As I said, we
have put four locks in place. He raised the specific issue of
broadcasting in Scotland and the filming of all parts of a trial. I
assure him that we are not proposing to allow this at all. The
safeguards that I have outlined will protect such an extension. He
raised the specific issue of witnesses. I share his concern. The
Government’s intention is to provide that level of protection.

things, they will remove antiquated and confusing laws, provide clarity
about the power of bailiffs, allow for the introduction of regulations
setting out what goods a bailiff can or cannot seize and introduce a
clear and fair charging regime. Furthermore, new mandatory training and
an enhanced certification system will ensure that the individuals
carrying out this difficult job are the right people, and will build on
the existing remedies available if things go wrong.</hs_para>

Government believe that the framework for the regulation of bailiffs in
Part 3 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 generally
strikes the right balance between ensuring that all bailiffs operate to
appropriate minimum standards and not subjecting the industry to
overburdensome regulation. As such, I hope that the House can readily
agree Commons Amendment 5, which will enable us to correct a number of
inadequacies in the legislation. Having done so, we will be able to
move quickly to bring Part 3 of the 2007 Act into
force.</hs_para>

key changes made to the 2007 Act are threefold. First, it removes the
ability to make regulations that would confer a power on enforcement
agents to use reasonable force against debtors. It is one thing to
countenance the use of reasonable force to enter premises; it is quite
another to authorise such force against a person. Here the 2007 Act
plainly got the balance wrong and it is right that we should
provide this additional safeguard.</hs_para>

the amendment will allow enforcement agents who are executing a High
Court or county court debt to use reasonable force to enter commercial
premises. As I have said, using reasonable force to secure entry into
premises is quite different from using force against an individual.
Enforcement agents already have such powers under common law and we
believe that the failure to confer an equivalent statutory power was an
omission from the 2007 Act. The third key change to the 2007 Act is to
allow enforcement agents to re-enter any premises, domestic or
commercial, where the debtor is in breach of a controlled goods
agreement to which they have consented. Here again, we are seeking to
provide in statute what is already the position under common
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032519000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032519000010">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:46:13"></hs_TimeCode>
balance of our reforms is to encourage compliance by debtors, including
by encouraging the use of controlled goods agreements, which allow
debtors to keep their possessions but enter into an agreed payment plan
with the enforcement agent. There is a danger that without these
changes we may remove the possibility of negotiation and in fact
encourage bailiffs to use 
<?notus-xml column=840?>aggressive action. Without the assurance that they will be able to
re-enter premises quickly and remove goods should the agreement be
broken, it is likely that they will remove goods straight away.
Safeguards for this process will be included in regulations,
stipulating that a bailiff will be required to give notice to the
debtor of their intention to use reasonable force to re-enter
premises<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:47:08"></hs_TimeCode>. As I
have indicated, these amendments to the 2007 Act will not increase the
existing powers of entry available to bailiffs. Rather, they codify in
statute existing common law powers.</hs_para>

removes Clause 26, which was inserted at Third Reading when this House
agreed an amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher,
who I see in her place. As I stated then, we believe that the
provisions expanding the remit of the Legal Services Ombudsman to
include complaints against bailiffs is unnecessary. Existing forms of
redress are already available to debtors, including in-house complaints
processes run by creditors, bailiff companies and trade associations.
Furthermore, under the Government’s reforms, all individuals
undertaking enforcement action will be required to have a certificate
from the county court to practise. Should a debtor wish to complain
about the conduct of an individual, they will be able to complain
directly to a judge who may decide whether the certificate should be
withdrawn or whether any retraining could be appropriate. Carrying out
enforcement work without a certificate will be a criminal
offence.</hs_para>

is also worth remembering that 80% of debt enforced by bailiffs is
local government debt, and in these circumstances bailiffs are either
directly employed by or contracted to act as agents on behalf of local
authorities. In these cases, the debtor can also seek redress from the
Local Government Ombudsman if they feel that the local authority has
not satisfactorily considered their complaint. The Local Government
Ombudsman has taken a particular interest in local authorities’
use and monitoring of private contracted bailiffs. In November last
year, they published a focus report, <I>Taking Possession:
Councils’ Use </I><I>o</I><I>f Bailiffs </I><I>f</I><I>or Local
Debt Collection</I>. This is a very helpful report that highlights the
need to reform bailiff law, and its recommendations were taken into
consideration in the Government’s response to the
<I>Transforming Bailiff Action</I> consultation published in January
this year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032519000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032519000013">Of
the other 20%, the majority of the debt is enforced on behalf of
central government, which includes Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs, Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service and the
Department for Work and Pensions. Again, bailiffs are either directly
employed by, or contracted to act as agents on behalf of, these
departments. If the department does not deal with any complaint
satisfactorily, then ultimately the individual, through their MP, could
complain to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman.</hs_para>

debt enforcement that private bailiffs enforce are High Court writs and
commercial rent arrears recovery. High Court enforcement officers are
authorised by the Lord Chancellor through his delegate, therefore any
complaints not dealt with satisfactorily by the High Court Enforcement
Officers Association can be sent to the Lord Chancellor’s
delegate. For commercial rent arrears recovery, there 
<?notus-xml column=841?>is no ombudsman. However, we estimate that this is only 1% of debt
collected by bailiffs and only affects business. I should add that we
have received very few complaints in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032519000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032519000015">For
all these reasons, the Government consider that the introduction of
another ombudsman complaints system is unnecessary at best and at worst
confusing. As I have previously said, we believe that the underlying
causes of most, if not all, complaints will be dealt with by our
reforms. Officials are working with the advice sector to consider once
more the types of complaints received and will work with them to ensure
they are adequately addressed by the regulations. It is our intention
to make these regulations available by the summer to take effect by
April 2014.</hs_para>

with external bodies that are involved in developing training
programmes for the enforcement industry and know that it is important
that the training includes how to deal with situations which involve
vulnerable individuals; for example, those with mental capacity issues.
The Money Advice Trust and the Royal College of Psychiatrists have

Meacher:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 6A relates to an amendment
passed in this House to provide for an ombudsman service as a basic
minimum of protection for victims of abuse by bailiff services. The
lack of an independent regulatory system for bailiffs affects hundreds
of thousands of our most vulnerable citizens, and we know that the
recent and ongoing welfare benefits legislation will swell the numbers
of such victims in the coming years. The purpose of bringing back this 
<?notus-xml column=842?>amendment to the House is to provide an opportunity for the Minister to
explain the action taken since our debate. In December, the amendment
had strong support from the Conservative Benches. The noble Lord, Lord
Lucas, chair of the Enforcement Law Reform Group, said that he did not
know one bailiff who would not support the amendment. The noble Lord,
Lord Cormack, spoke eloquently about the importance of your
Lordships’ House approving such a reform, but the Minister at
the time could give no
assurances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032518000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032518000021">Full
ombudsman services are provided in health, housing, local government,
financial services, legal services, telecommunications, prisons and
other sectors, but we know that members of the public are probably more
vulnerable to abuse of power by bailiffs than by almost any other cadre
of workers. After all, bailiffs cone into our homes to seize our
property. Little could be more offensive than that. Yet, in response to
our amendment, the Government in the other place have rejected even
this most minimal of protections for people who will inevitably include
many mentally and physically disabled people who cannot fend for
themselves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032518000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032518000022">I
thank the Minister and his officials for a meeting last week when they
explained many of the actions taken since our debate in December. I am
grateful to the Minister for giving an assurance to this House—I
think he gave this assurance—that every individual who is
subject to abuse by a bailiff will have access to one or
other ombudsman. It is a splintered system, not a complete system, but,
if they can find their way through it, every victim will
have access to the Local Government Ombudsman, the Parliamentary
Ombudsman or the Legal Ombudsman. I hope the Minister will confirm that
he said that. I should be grateful if he could make very clear that the
Local Government Ombudsman will be able to deal with complaints about
private bailiffs as well as in-house bailiffs. As the Minister made
clear, the one area that is left out of this is companies. I have
concerns about small businesses—perhaps one or two-person
businesses—that may get into terrible debt trouble and have very
unpleasant experiences. They will have no access to an
ombudsman.</hs_para>

his opening remarks, the Minister referred to training. I do not think
he mentioned this, but I should be grateful if he could confirm that
there will be a specific module on identifying vulnerability and
vulnerable people. I should also be grateful if he could clarify that
the training will not only include how to identify a vulnerable person
but will be very clear about what the bailiff should do having
identified a vulnerable person. It is no good identifying them if the
bailiff proceeds to act inappropriately.</hs_para>

December, I probed a lot about the length, breadth and depth of the
training, and I am delighted to hear that there will be training of in
the region of three months, including this rather important module.
However, I should like to pursue the matter a little further. The
Government’s response to the consultation referred to mandatory
training. I should like an assurance from the Minister that there will
be a set standard that a bailiff is required to meet. I am familiar
with training in certain areas where the company simply has to tick a
box to say that the bailiff has attended training. I am 
<?notus-xml column=843?>even familiar with security officers who will quite happily get someone
else to complete the training for them and somehow or other the box
gets ticked. We need an assurance that there will be a standard that
bailiffs are required to meet. Will there be any independent
verification of meeting those
standards?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032518000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032518000025">Finally,
will the Minister say something about the work on information for
victims that he mentioned at our meeting? We have a splintered and
confusing system of ombudsmen for victims in different scenarios. It
would be helpful to have on record the work going on with the CAB
service, the web and so on to try to make sure that people know that
they have access to an independent ombudsman. As the Minister said, the
Government will reform the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007
to prevent the use of force against the person. Again, I should be
grateful if the Minister could—perhaps he cannot—give
some timeframe for that
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

summary, the Government will introduce a certification process with no
independent regulation of bailiffs and a rather incomplete and
splintered form of ombudsman service. However, we can expect the
quality of enforcement services to improve somewhat from a very low
base. Of course, one cannot generalise, but we know that some very
unpleasant things happen out there. There will be a staged process, to
which the Minister referred, of implementation review. I hope the
Minister can confirm that the results of those reviews will be made
public and, at that stage, perhaps the Government will finally accept
the crying need for independent regulation of bailiffs. I await the
Minister’s

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I join the noble Baroness in welcoming
the Government’s moves to tighten up the arrangements for
bailiffs. Like her, however, I regret that they have failed to take the
ultimate step of establishing a clear and relatively
straightforward regulatory system. I am slightly puzzled by some
aspects of their response to the consultation. For example, in
paragraph 18 of their response, the Government say that they will
implement Section 64 of the Act and “produce regulations”
about the regulation of enforcement agents, which is a somewhat
circuitous expression. Nor is it entirely clear where that would be
heading<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:01:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the response goes on to say at paragraph 134 that the
Government,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13032518000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032518000085">“will
continue to work with stakeholders from the enforcement and advice

procedure”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13032518000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032518000042">I
take it that that means that, ultimately, the Government will produce
regulations to be approved by both Houses. Perhaps the noble Lord would
be able to confirm
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:02:17"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
clear, as the Minister has pointed out, that much of the
work—or, any rate, the function—of the industry is
directed towards recovering sums due to local or central government,
hence the involvement of the local government ombudsman. That work is
likely to be enhanced considerably as councils seek to recover, if it
is economical to do so, the likely shortfall in the collection of
council tax now that a significant cut has 
<?notus-xml column=844?>been made in council tax support, and many people will now be called
upon to pay council tax who have not hitherto done so, in rather small
amounts. That may make collection
uneconomic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:03:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

that as it may, and quite taking the point about the local government
ombudsman’s position, would it not be sensible, if we are
thinking in terms of sensible regulation without offering competing
avenues for this, for the local government ombudsman’s
responsibilities to be widened so that he can undertake that regulatory
role for the whole system? Why not? Hopefully, local authorities,
either singly or collectively, will in any case employ staff directly
rather than contract out. It is in the contracting out of the service
that we see so many of the
problems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032518000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032518000030"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:03:45"></hs_TimeCode>It
is interesting that the advice sector did not agree with the not
unexpected majority of the enforcement sector and creditors in saying
that the existing complaints process was sufficient and did not require
any further government intervention. The advice sector thought that the
processes,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13032518000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032518000086">“have

the Government’s propensity to rely on the voluntary sector to
make good the damage inflicted upon advice services
generally—the withdrawal of legal aid and legal advice, for
example—one might have thought that they would pay rather more
attention to the advice of the sector in this sensitive area. As the
Minister has, in fairness, readily recognised, there have been too many
instances of abuse for us to be comfortable with the present
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:04:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13032518000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032518000031">Finally,
the Government propose a rather curious process of review at one, three
and five-year intervals. It is not clear quite what form that would
take, but I ask the Minister for an assurance that if it is seen that
there is no significant improvement in how the system is working, they
will revert to the concept not merely of support, advice and
certification but of a proper regulatory system to which people can
have ready and inexpensive

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I will re-emphasise why we are not
introducing an independent regulator. The legislative changes that we
are making to protect people in debt from aggressive bailiffs together
with the new laws and mandatory training and certification scheme,
which bailiffs must pass before going into business, will provide
enough protection against aggressive bailiffs. Bailiffs who do not
follow the rules will be barred from the industry. We will also clarify
the complaints process so that debtors know how to seek redress and
what the responsibility of creditors and enforcements agents
are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:05:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032518000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032518000033">As
I have explained, in the process, the appropriate regulator in each of
the areas where bailiffs are used will be able to be appealed to. We
mentioned this small degree of commercial debt—less than
1%—and I would happy to receive any representation from either
the CBI or the Federation of Small Businesses if they thought that this
was a genuine loophole causing a real
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:06:41"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:06:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032518000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032518000034">Every
individual will have access to an appropriate complainant authority. As
the noble Baroness pointed out, we have indicated that we are looking
for something like a three-month training programme; it will not just
be a tick-box exercise. We are looking at other parts of 
<?notus-xml column=845?>the forest, as it were, to see whether there are training modules and
practices that we can readily
adapt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:07:22"></hs_TimeCode>. I confirm

noble Baroness rightly raised the problems of dealing with people who
may have some difficulties with mental capacity. We would hope that in
the training will come a clear responsibility to recognise and assess
such situations. Where they identify that a vulnerable person is
involved, they will refer back to the relevant authority to further
instructions and, where necessary, bring in other assistance to deal
with the
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:08:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032518000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032518000036">As
i have said, we are developing training that we consider a minimum
requirement. We have not yet been able to gauge exactly the length of
time that the training would take. However, we are clear that, at a
minimum, bailiffs will need to understand the role that they play, the
law that governs their powers, the practice of taking control of goods,
the fees that they can charge and, as I have said, specific training to
deal with vulnerable
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:09:03"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:09:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032518000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032518000037">On
whether the system will allow complaints against bailiff firms as well
as individuals, most complaints about bailiff companies relate to the
fees charged by their bailiffs, the type of goods seized and the ways
in which they were seized. All these issues will be dealt with under
the new regulations and will be subject to the means of redress. The
behaviour of individual bailiffs on the doorstep will be regulated
through the certification system. Poor behaviour can be addressed by
the removal of a certificate. We are working with the advice sector to
identify any complaints that would fall outside the regulation. All
bailiffs will have to be certified, and I can confirm that
training will be independently

will bring forward the regulations by negative resolution. The

available by the summer. As set out in the Tribunals, Courts and

interest over the last week, since the Prime Minister announced last
Monday that he had reached agreement with the Deputy Prime Minister and
the Leader of the Opposition on proposals for a royal charter. As part
of that agreement, the three parties also agreed proposals and
exemplary damages and costs that are designed to incentivise publishers
to join the new regulatory framework. These proposals are the subject
of this group of Commons

will first explain the key features of the Commons amendments. Commons
Amendments 11 to 15 relate to exemplary damages, which are already
available under the common law. They are, however, very rarely awarded,
as they are reserved for the most serious cases. They are designed to
punish, and only where there is no alternative. That general position
will not change, although the new scheme for relevant publishers will
change the position for them in relation to certain types of cases
relating to the media, namely cases for defamation, misuse of private
information, breach of confidence, malicious falsehood and harassment,
as specified in Amendment
19<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:13:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

incentivises publishers to join the regulator by making it clear that a
court may contemplate awarding exemplary damages only in cases where a
publisher has not joined the regulator, with very limited exceptions.
This is on the basis that a publisher joining the regulator will face
the prospect of regulatory fines of up to £1 million. However,
subsection (3) of the new clause also provides that if a court is
persuaded that a regulated publisher has acted in a way that would lead
the court to award exemplary damages but for their membership of the
regulator, and the regulator has acted manifestly irrationally in its
approach to sanctioning that conduct, the court may exceptionally make
an award for exemplary damages in that case. I know that this is one of
the points on which my noble friend Lord Lucas has sought clarification
in his Amendment 11A. I hope that he will agree that this is a very
limited and clear exception to that rule, being available only when a
court concludes that the regulator has acted in a manner that is
manifestly irrational—a very high bar.</hs_para>

this is a necessary safeguard for victims to ensure that the press
self-regulator sanctions in an appropriate and meaningful way and is
not tempted to give the press an easy ride. Exemplary damages would be
awarded only in the most serious of cases. This is in line with both
the Leveson report and the report of the 1997 Law Commission. The test
for the award of exemplary damages would be where the
defendant’s conduct has shown a deliberate or reckless disregard
of an outrageous nature for the claimant’s rights. That conduct
is such that the court should punish the defendant for it, and other
remedies would not be adequate to punish that
conduct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:15:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

completeness, I should also mention Amendments 16 and 38.
Amendment 16 implements recommendation 71 in Lord Justice
Leveson’s report, and confirms that in cases under the new
system, aggravated damages should be awarded only to compensate for
mental distress and should have no punitive element. Amendment 38
provides that the provision on exemplary damages will come into force
one year after the date on which a body is established by royal
charter. This will be a powerful incentive to the press to establish a
new regulator on a timely basis so that they will have the opportunity
of becoming
regulated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:18:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

provisions relating to cost in subsection (1) of Amendment 17, which
will be subject to government Amendments 17D and 17H. This new clause
is designed to give effect to Lord Justice Leveson’s
recommendation that the award of costs in media torts should be another
tool to encourage publishers to join the regulator. The effect is that
there would be a clear presumption that where a claimant took a
publisher inside the regulator to court, even if the claimant was
successful in their case, the normal rule that their costs would be met
by a losing publisher would not apply. In other words, a defendant
publisher who had joined the regulator should only pay the
claimant’s costs in limited circumstances.</hs_para>

establishes a second presumption: that a defendant publisher who does
not join the regulator should always pay the claimant’s costs,
again, subject to the exceptions in limited circumstances. Those
limited circumstances are subject to government Amendment 17D, where
the issue could not have been resolved at arbitration, even if the
publisher had been a member of a regulator, or if it were just and
equitable for the defendant publisher not to pay the
cost.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000009">Government
Amendments 17D and 17H make two technical amendments to the new clause
on costs. The first refers to subsection (2)(a) of the costs clause.
The 
<?notus-xml column=849?>intention of this provision is to allow for costs to be
awarded against a regulated publisher only if the claim is not capable
of being resolved through the regulator’s arbitration scheme.
However, to achieve this, the word “not” must be inserted
into the condition of subsection (2)(a), to avoid the opposite being
the case. Amendment 17D simply corrects this drafting

the industry-standard clause and will be exposed to a £1 million

the past week, I have seen some concerns voiced regarding the extent to
which bloggers or tweeters may be caught by this definition. I will
return to this point in a moment. Lord Justice Leveson distinguished
between the often grass-roots, small-scale activity of individual
bloggers’ sites and social networking, and those activities 
<?notus-xml column=850?>that have developed over time into more sophisticated, multi-authored
and edited news-related businesses. He referred
to:</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13032538000290" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000290">“a
number of news blogs—the Huffington Post is an early, high
profile example of one, which has developed over the years into
something much more like an online newspaper—which specifically
aim to bring a range of news stories and views on those stories to
their
readers”.</hs_quotefo><hs_para UID="13032538000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000015">This
is an important distinction. Leveson is describing a press-like
operation online. In order to future-proof our regulatory approach, we
need to keep up with changes in technology. Any regulatory system that
seeks to cover news publishers cannot ignore the fact that the print
forms of press are facing real economic challenges, both structural and
cyclical, and that distribution methods are moving increasingly online.
Reforms to press regulatory systems must take account of the increasing
online presence of the national news publishers, as well as press-like
news publishers who operate solely
online<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:25:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000016">In
future, the digital world is likely to be the principal method of
distribution for much of our news, and our regulatory system must
reflect this. It is important because the public have different
expectations about different kinds of media, and in taking a regulatory
approach we should take seriously those public expectations. Clearly,
the online version of the national press, its regional counterpart or
an online yet press-like news site, carry very different public
expectations when compared with a small-scale blog—or, for that
matter, a tweet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:25:46"></hs_TimeCode>.
Our definition of “relevant publisher” seeks to make this
differentiation. It does so by employing an interlocking series of
tests, all of which must be met before the threshold of the definition
is reached. They are, first, whether the publication publishes
news-related material; secondly, whether it is written by different
authors; thirdly, whether it is to any extent subject to editorial
control; and, fourthly, whether it is published in the course of a
business. The definition is therefore intended to protect small-scale
bloggers while capturing the more sophisticated, press-like online
material that Leveson
described<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:26:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000017">Equally,
the definition of “relevant publisher” is not intended to
capture the news aggregation services of operations such as Yahoo! or
MSN. Nor is it intended to capture social networking sites where
individuals post user-generated material. Nor is it aimed at sites that
simply moderate the comments of others, or aggregate a series of blogs
without any active consideration of the content, such as the
blog-hosting services WordPress and
Tumblr<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:27:09"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:27:09"></hs_TimeCode>.
I also clarify that, contrary to some recent reporting, the definition
is equally not aimed at covering individual journalists. The definition
of “relevant publisher” is aimed at organisations that
employ or otherwise commission journalistic content, and, even then,
only to the extent that these organisations operate in line with the
four interlocking tests that I
outlined<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:27:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000018">I
recognise that people have been seeking clarification on how the
legislation could apply to small-scale bloggers, and how the
interlocking tests work. This is reflected in some of the amendments
before us, and includes the suggestion that there may be a case for
making an express exemption in respect of small-scale blogs in the new
schedule inserted by Commons Amendment 131. 
<?notus-xml column=851?>To allow a period of reflection in advance of the next round
of ping-pong in another place after the Easter Recess, the Government
have tabled manuscript Amendment 131BA in recognition of the concerns
over Amendment 131. As part of this, my right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has agreed that her
officials will collate and engage with any issues that are raised

is a need for a further

hope it is clear to noble Lords that when this is next considered by
the other place, the Government may come forward with an alternative

“relevant publishers” and in addition to the four tests,
I draw the attention of the House also to the new schedule that will be
inserted by Amendment 131, which outlines specific
exclusions from the definition of “relevant publisher”.
In referring to Lord Justice Leveson’s view of the membership of
a future press regulator, we have provided exclusions for a range of
otherwise unrelated activities that might have been caught
unintentionally. To that end, we have provided a specific exclusion for
broadcasters who broadcast news-related material in connection with
broadcasting activities authorised under their broadcasting licence,
special interest titles, scientific or academic journals, public bodies
and charities, company news publications and book publishers.</hs_para>

getting the balance of incentives is also very important. It is
important that we draw the right line between the publishers intended
to be caught and those who are left outside. I am confident that the
Government have drawn the line in the right place and I have set out my
reason for that today. Through the cross-party talks, we have agreed a
set of proposals that will create a tough new system of press
self-regulation. We are, I believe, striking the right balance through
these amendments, which enable the implementation of this system but
which, equally, do not compromise freedom of expression. They form a
crucial part of the new regime for press regulation as Lord Justice
Leveson set out and which, as politicians, we have a collective duty to
implement. I will wait to hear what noble Lords have to say about their
amendments, particularly in the light of manuscript Amendment 131BA,

<I>Good Schools Guide</I> is clearly going to have register under these

this approach to press regulation—I am sure that
others will do that better than I could. I am going to confine my
remarks to, “Well, if the Government are going to do it this
way, how could they do it better?”. As far as I understand it,
the procedure today is that, as with the other groups, we will deal
with everything as a whole. But if we get to the point where we are
faced with a widespread disagreement with what the Government are doing
and an unwillingness to listen, we have the option of re-debating each
of the amendments one by one when we reach their place in the

crucial thing from my point of view is exactly what the Government
intend to do with their manuscript amendment. I was comforted very much
by what the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said—that this is
essentially a device to make sure that the Commons has Easter to think
through exactly how to deal with small bloggers and, given the width of
the Commons’ powers, also to make any other necessary changes to
these clauses. Therefore, if we are dealing with small amendments and
things we think need further thought, that government amendment is
enough to enable these to be achieved, and therefore all we need to do
is speak to the Government today and, over the next three weeks, good
sense will gradually percolate through and result in the
Commons—when the Government’s amendment comes back to
us—having taken the appropriate action elsewhere within this
group. I hope that that is the correct understanding. I am sure that my
noble friend will confirm if that is the case.</hs_para>

11A. I understand what my noble friend says about the purpose of the
lines that I am seeking to take out—they are to deal with
circumstances when the regulator has gone doolally—but I think
that this is the wrong way to do that. I can see that as a possibility,
but by doing it this way the Government are introducing uncertainty
into the whole question of whether exemplary damages apply to a
publisher. By joining a regulator, you can exempt yourself from
exemplary damages. You sign up to the regulator, you do things its way
and you are not in danger of exemplary damages. You do not have to get
insurance against exemplary damages—which is not exactly going
to be cheap—and you know that you have gone down the road that
Leveson has recommended.</hs_para>

he can tip you into exemplary damages. I cannot see that introducing
that level of uncertainty, danger and risk in a procedure which is
supposed to encourage people to sign up to avoid that risk, is the
right way of doing it. If we are worried about the regulator going 
<?notus-xml column=853?>native then we need to provide for that in the charter and provide some
way of bringing a regulator back to where they should be. Indeed, I
suspect that if we had that then it might well be that Parliament would
legislate again anyway. Surely this added uncertainly is not the right
way to deal with the problem.</hs_para>

amendments in my group, Amendments 17C and 17G. The object of these
paragraphs is effectively to force publishers to use arbitration. I
have two objections to that. The first is that there ought to be a real
incentive for those who offer the arbitration, for the regulator, to
make it good and something that publishers want to use. If there is no
such incentive then there is the tendency, as exemplified in Australia
for instance, for the arbitrator to start to get really rather
eccentric views on what publishers should be doing and to seek to widen
its own authority by pushing the boundaries and the rules in ways which
I am sure Parliament is not currently envisaging.</hs_para>

seriously complicated things. They can be dealt with by arbitration but
actually are far better dealt with by the courts. Surely we want to
allow the decision to continue to be made by either side in the
argument that a particular case would be better dealt with by a court,
with the additional powers and procedures that courts have. I cannot

to Amendment 18, which is to take out subsections (3) and (4). I think
that I am proposing this amendment because I do not understand the
wording of those clauses. I understood my noble friend when he
addressed this and said that, clearly, he wanted to see the
<I>Huffington Post</I> included as a publisher. But it seems to me that
subsection (3) removes, at least if not the <I>Huffington Post</I> in

potential publishers from the scope of “relevant
publisher”. It says:</hs_para>

fine; but suppose the publisher—whatever they be called;
“Comment is free” would be a pretty good
example—had offered payment to the person who posted that
article on the website, or had commissioned it, or had merely given
permission for it, as one has to with “Comment is free”.
You cannot just post something on that site; you have to get its
agreement to posting it. Effectively, in the likes of “Comment
is free”, you are creating a newspaper, but it is not made up in
the usual way; it is made up of unpaid—although there is no
reason why they should not be paid—contributions from outsiders.
They may 
<?notus-xml column=854?>well have been moderated, as is allowed in subsection (4), which
effectively means edited. Permission has been given and sometimes
contributions are sought, in that they might say, “We would like
something like that—who shall we ask to make the
posting?”. The wording of subsection (3), as it is now, allows
some very major businesses to escape this set of clauses entirely. They
may not exist at the moment but, if you allow them to exist under this
clause, I think that they will get through. That may be my
misunderstanding of how the wording operates, but it certainly seems
the case to

19A is my original take on how to deal with the small bloggers problem.
Essentially, most publishers of any ambition are going to have to join
this regulator, and my noble friend clearly expressed the intention of
the Government and Lord Justice Leveson that this should be the case.
But a lot of these publishers, particularly at the early stages of
their existence, when they are pretty sharp-edged and contentious, do
not have much income. They survive on the sheer effort of a few
individuals, who may scrape a living through journalism elsewhere, or
do something else to keep body and soul together, but are not earning a
lot from the publishing enterprise that they have founded. If the
regulator charges a large fee for annual membership or charges little
bloggers full fees for access to the compulsory arbitration service, we
are effectively creating quite a high barrier to entry for new
publishers. We are saying that they will have to find £100,000
or £200,000 to deal with those charges before they are allowed
to become a
publisher.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000034">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:43:40"></hs_TimeCode>
am sure that that is not the Government’s
intention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:42:10"></hs_TimeCode>, but
it is one of the reasons why their own amendment does not go far
enough, and dealing with this issue is probably a matter for the
charter and not for the Bill. But it is important to make sure that we
are not in this Bill introducing a barrier to entry for new publishers,
who will generally feel obliged to register. Unless there is a very
clear moment when they transition from being a small blogger, in the
words of the government amendment, to a not small blogger, they will
register early for their own protection. But if they face the sort of
fees that a vexatious litigant could use to really punish them, just by
putting them through the procedures, we will put in place a real
barrier. I am sure that my noble friend realises that there are people
around the world with whom you can get into severe difficulty if you
say what you think about them, such as the Scientologists. That is not
an uncommon feature, and we should not create a barrier for entry into
such controversial and, in the overall scheme of things, worthwhile
activities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:43:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000035">My
other amendments, Amendments 131B and following, are slightly further
on. I am sure that this is my misreading, but it seems to me that there
is nothing in the wording that exempts the <I>New York Times</I>, or
<I>Le Monde</I>, from having to register. We are going back to our
imperial habits and stretching our net across the world. They are
certainly publishers of news on a large scale about the United Kingdom,
but they are surely not intended to be caught and have to register just
because they choose to report what is going on in these islands, on
page 59. If that is the intention, I feel that it is the wrong

Amendment 131B is really a companion to the limitation of fees and
costs for small publishers. If the regulator has to run at a loss on
small publishers, subsidising their fees and arbitration costs out of
the fees and costs charged to larger publishers, it may decide that it
really cannot be bothered and say, “You’re not big enough
yet—go away”. If the regulator says that to you at the
moment, you are caught, because you cannot join the regulator and,
therefore, you are in for exemplary damages, without the option. I do

later amendments deal with other ways in which to deal with a small
publisher. There have been several representations from the local press
that really they should not have to qualify for this. I can see from
what my noble friend says that there is really not much hope
of getting that exemption. There are questions of whether charitable
campaigning organisations should be caught, but it is clear that they
come within the definition of publisher, as set out in these clauses.
Is that really the Government’s intention? With my last
amendment, the Government’s amendment is better, but we need

want to make two points, but they are quite important ones. What is
welcome and what we need to remember when we discuss these issues is
that there is a world of difference between an individual who might say
something factually incorrect and even insulting as an individual and a
very large-scale international organisation such as News International
doing the same thing. That is really where this problem has come from.
People reacted to Leveson from the press side by saying that
it was an attack on 300 years of press freedom, but that is nonsense.
Press freedom was about small individuals and small groups fighting for
the right to publish their views, and that remained the case until
quite late in the 19th century, when the press barons emerged and these
large-scale and powerful organisations developed. That is when it
became difficult, because you could no longer feel the same about an
attack by an organisation such as News International that was factually
incorrect and severely intrusive, and that of an individual. That sort
of balance needs to be kept in
mind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000041">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:48:10"></hs_TimeCode>
I listened to the Minister’s opening comments, I felt that the
Government were aware of the difference between the large and small
organisation. But it is a problem for the small organisation. I started
a blog in, I think, 2003, then came here and converted it to
“Lord of the Blog”, and then it became “Lords of
the Blog”, which is still operating, and is run by the Hansard
Society on behalf of the House. I think that 
<?notus-xml column=856?>it is relevant—and this refers in a way to some of the comments

second main point is that we need to review the legislation over a
period of time. Part of the reason why we need to do that is the
rapidly changing technology; it is so fast and so dramatic that it is
difficult to keep up with it. I do not believe that all the press will
suddenly go out of business because of the internet, but they are under
more severe financial pressure because of it. Frankly, good newspapers
are likely to survive—and likely to survive also because of
their online material. We have to break away from the old culture
whereby, if you felt that you could not publish a story, you got
someone to put it on the internet and then, lo and behold, it suddenly
appeared in News International newspapers, or
wherever<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:49:33"></hs_TimeCode>—and

someone who set up those blogs, I would have welcomed at that time some
sort of code that was external to what I was inventing myself. The
noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said that you may be threatened by that. He may
be right. I do not want to disagree with a great deal of what he said
as I have a lot of sympathy with it, but I think he may be overafraid
of this. When I started the blog in 2003, I was not concerned about
individual attacks on me—any MP gets used to that fairly quickly
and takes the rough with the smooth—but I was concerned about
attacks on third parties or statements about third parties. We saw a
dreadful example of that recently with the challenge to Lord McAlpine.
In my view, none of this regulation threatens good investigative
journalism. Indeed, I gather that the BBC programme tonight on Boris
Johnson will be pretty critical and that is a regulated media outlet,
so we should not be too concerned about this issue. However, vast
changes are taking

give another example, after the Iraq war, at the request of some Arabs
in my then constituency, I set up the Arab-Jewish Forum, which was
essentially a conference organising group, but I have recently
converted it into a blog organisation for Arabs and Jews in this
country, although, inevitably, it will go worldwide. In doing that, I
am worried about regulations. A group of Arabs and Jews will regulate
it. I will also keep a close eye on it although, as someone of neither
Jewish nor Arab heritage, I will be less good at that than the
moderating group. It would be good to have guidelines on what to do if
something is factually incorrect. Although what we are discussing is
not directly relevant to that issue, it underpins it and may indicate a
way forward in dealing with the emerging internet communications, which
will replace newspapers to a large extent, although not completely, in
my view. We will then need constantly to review the
legislation.</hs_para>

will be made that I am just tilting at windmills and that no one has
anything to fear if they are part of an approved regulator. This is the
so-called “incentive”, the carrot and stick to provide
statutory support to underpin a regulatory system. Regrettably, that
argument is a mirage, because the way this legislation is structured
means that membership of a regulator is not a complete protection
against exemplary damages and costs orders. I am thinking in particular
of subsection (3) of Amendment 11. While the Bill provides that
exemplary damages should not generally be awarded against a
“relevant publisher” which is a member of an approved
regulator, the court can disregard this prohibition and make an award
of exemplary damages in strikingly wide circumstances that render the
apparent protection of being a member of a regulator entirely illusory.
All the court needs to do is to be satisfied either that the regulator

is compounded by the new clauses in subsection (2) of

said, have to pay a lot of money along with exposure to fines, and then
it could still face the prospect of exemplary damages and crippling
costs in court. Why on earth should publishers do that and face paying
twice? I fear that this Bill makes it less likely that publishers would
want to join an approved regulator. Some smaller publishers in the

about these proposed new clauses is wrong. They were cobbled together
late at night over pizza, with no thought for the legal and
constitutional issues involved. They exhibit no understanding of the
digital world into which all publishers are moving. They are alien to
decades of English law, and almost certainly illegal under European
law. They would provide a serious blow to investigative journalism.
They would disproportionately impact on smaller publishers and, in
particular, the regional press. If ever there was a case where this
House should have asked the Government and the other place to think
long and hard, and to take their time studying the massive implications
of what is being proposed, it is this. However, we do not have the
ability to do so. I may be a lone voice making these points, and the
cross-party deal with Hacked Off on its proposals means that these
amendments will inevitably become law. I understand that. However, my

and welcome the framework agreed by the parties. It is not perfect
Leveson, but it is about 80% or 90% Leveson. In fact, the 10% to 20%
that is not Leveson is a compromise in favour of the press, and we
should be clear about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T19:16:20"></hs_TimeCode>. It cheers
my heart to hear those who have absolutely railed against the Human

only a week ago last Monday night, we created an entrenchment clause to
protect the charter from meddling from behind closed doors by
politicians, privy counsellors and Ministers. It was a way of using law
to protect press freedom; indeed, I hope the Defamation Act will do so,
too. The other way in which we can protect press freedom is by
returning to high ethical standards. That is what is forgotten by those
who hyperventilate about the great horrors of a regulatory system. It
beggars belief that the noble Lord, Lord Black, who sat on the PCC for
years and was basically hugger-mugger with those who were not really
interested in what was happening to the victims of press excesses, now
speaks about the “chilling effect” of this regulatory
framework<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T19:18:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000078">The
costs element in this new arrangement is an important aspect of the
Leveson incentives and is at 
<?notus-xml column=864?>the heart of the matter. The problem with the PCC was always that it had
no teeth, and one had to find a way of dealing with that. However, as
for the business of exemplary damages, perhaps we should make it clear
that they would be used only in the most exceptional circumstances
where the most egregious conduct took place. Almost invariably, it
would go hand in hand with criminality of some kind. The criminality
can be dealt with in some ways, but we know that the civil and
defamation courts should have at their disposal some way of registering
the horror of what happens to
victims.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000079">Noble<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T19:09:59"></hs_TimeCode>
Lords should have in mind circumstances such as when medical
information has found its way into the hands of
journalists that discloses, for example, that a woman has
had an abortion, that someone has had psychiatric treatment, or that
someone has a disease such as Huntington’s chorea
that will manifest itself at a certain point in their lives. How dare
the media expose such information? It is right that the courts should
be able to respond appropriately when such things are done. We know
that, except in exceptional circumstances, they are going to be dealing
only with those who refuse to sign up to being part of this regulatory
framework. This hyperventilation about exemplary damages is yet another
manifestation of the huffing and puffing that we have seen in the press
recently about the Rubicon being crossed and the end of freedom of the
press as we have known it for hundreds of years, when the reality is
far from

a moment for this House to reflect on the fact that over the past few
months, while Lord Leveson was conducting his hearings and since he
reported, there have been regular polls, and every poll conducted with

framework. Indeed, all the polling indicates that
the public support Lord Leveson’s report. More recently, as
agreement has been reached across parties this week to create the
framework that we are discussing tonight, all the polling indicates
that the public want something of this sort to happen. So we should

will make a couple of quick points. The first is that you could not
have a more modest provision of exemplary damages than you have in this
Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Black of Brentwood, if I may say so, did not
give the full picture. He gave a telling account of the meaning of the
word “outrageous”, but not the full context in which that
word appears. New subsection (6) in Amendment 11

I make a point about the meaning of “publisher”, because
the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and others have mentioned the extent to
which this could impinge on smaller publishers rather than the great

not like, and I hope the House will not like, the provision in

this provision is to be in the Bill, it needs to be expanded. This
would allow a publisher or operator of a website to get away in the
circumstance where, for example, the person who posted the awful stuff
was a subsidiary company or a partner or was paid to put the stuff on
the website. If you were a really malicious operator, you could think
up a shell company in the Seychelles that could post the most dreadful
stuff about a person or a group of people, and under this clause the
operator of the website would not be liable. That needs looking at.
However, as I say, all in all, I believe that, in this most difficult

Inglewood:</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to address a few
remarks to my noble friend Lord McNally about the general scheme behind
the provisions in the Bill on which he has to some extent helpfully
elaborated already. In so doing, I shall go on from where the noble
Lord, Lord Soley, left off when talking about changes in the digital
world. At the start I declare an interest as chairman of the Cumbrian
Newspaper Group, but I am not going to talk about any of those
interests at all. However, noble Lords may know that I am also chairman
of the Communications Committee of this House. I do not want to breach
any confidence, but at one o’clock in the morning this coming

say in public that one of the things the committee was very interested
in is the phenomenon known as television-like material as defined 
<?notus-xml column=867?>in the European Union audiovisual media services directive. This is
material which can be viewed through an internet protocol television
set but it is not broadcast and it is not a website. Your Lordships
will be aware of this service because my noble friend Lord Dobbs has
just had a great hit on Netflix, which is an example of one of these
businesses. It is a fast-growing and significant part of the media
landscape. In the committee’s view, because of the way that
regulation is being proposed for broadcasting, the press and websites,
TV-like material falls completely outwith the various definitions and
so is not going to be caught. The committee does not think that that is

specific provisions of the Crime and Courts Bill and the amendments we

Baroness, Lady Kennedy, if the entrenched law can be amended. Is it
wise to start off with a big lacuna in the scheme; that is, before the

Allan of Hallam:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to make some similar
points to those just made by the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, and in
doing so I should like to declare an interest. I work for Facebook,
which is a website operator. The points around definition have been
made effectively in the scope of the amendments and in the comments of
my noble friend Lord Lucas. They exemplify how hard it is to define
anything in this area. As the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, and his
committee have found in trying to draw out these definitions, the more
one goes into it, the more one finds that in many cases it is an
imprecise science. It is hard to define precisely what it is one
intends to regulate and does not intend to
regulate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T19:33:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble friend Lord McNally were extremely helpful in clarifying the
Government’s intention not to include a wide range of services
or individual activities within scope and I picked up on two particular
phrases that he used. The first was “press-like” and the
clear intention to regulate such services, and the second was
“future-proof”, in that these provisions should be
future-proofed. Subsection (7) of the proposed new clause
set out in Amendment 19 refers to the concept of “News-related
material”, but nowhere does it talk about the format of that
material. Referring to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord
Inglewood, it seems on first reading that “TV-like” and
“radio-like” services would be covered. The new schedule
set out in Amendment 131 provides an exemption for those who are
licensed under the Broadcasting Acts, but again what we see
increasingly is the ability to launch services over the internet that
are TV-like and radio-like, but where no licence is required. If the
legislation is to be future-proofed, it is important to 
<?notus-xml column=868?>understand whether it is the Government’s intention to restrict
this to services that we would regard as being press-like
today—most people in common parlance would understand that as
being primarily the printed word—or if in the future someone
launches a video or audio channel that consists primarily of
news-related material—the new online TV-type and radio-type
services—it is intended that it should be included in the
scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T19:35:20"></hs_TimeCode> we are

number of businesses and individuals who would like to move into this

like to receive their news through these new channels rather than the
traditional

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to all
noble Lords for participating in this debate, which has echoed a number
of occasions on which we have been able to touch on these topics in the
context of several Bills over recent months. We have not always stood
opposite the noble Lord, Lord McNally, although he has been quite
strong, particularly as we saw his cherished Defamation Bill begin to
slip away from him. However, I think I see it looming in the
background, and the noble Lord has cheered up again, which is nice. We
also touched on them in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill,
where we did a great deal of work with the excellent amendments tabled
by the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky. They were not moved, but they
certainly raised the issues that we are considering today. Of course,
we now have the Crime and Courts Bill before us, so there is endless
flexibility, and long may that
last<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T19:36:18"></hs_TimeCode>. I should
like particularly to thank the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, who has been
tireless in tabling amendments that give effect to the detail of the
Leveson recommendations and reinforce the fact that the royal charter
and its statutory underpinning have been agreed by all three parties in
an historic
agreement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T19:36:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that the debate on Leveson has moved on. The most important thing now
is to be clear on what the government amendments intend to do and avoid
any unnecessary scaremongering. I shall focus on a number of the
amendments before us and, like the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, I should

exemplary damages, but I have been sufficiently warned off by the noble
Lord, Lord Phillips, even to go down this route. However, there are a
couple of points that I would like the Minister to respond to. I
understand that a considerable amount of time was spent in the
all-party talks on the question of what happens to damages when it
transpires that the facts of a case have changed in that the court has
facts which were not available to the regulator. Can the Minister help
us on this issue as it has happened in recent months? Can he confirm
that this is a matter which will be returned

that the common law gateway for exemplary damages will not apply. Can
the Minister confirm that the “for profit” test is not
required if the “outrageous” test is met?
Amendment 11D makes it clear that a relevant publisher will
be vicariously liable for wrongdoing by an employee or a person
contracted to work for a publisher which results in 
<?notus-xml column=869?>liability for exemplary damages in accordance with the ordinary common
law tests. Can the Minister confirm that further work will be done on
this question? It is a key issue that is dealt with succinctly in the
amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky. Vicarious liability
bears on the morality and culture of the press. It is important that
the Government should put on the record today that they agree with the
noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, and that they intend to return to this
issue in the Commons to the extent that this may be required. The
recent history, after all, shows that it matters. We do not want a
situation where publishers literally have a get out of jail free card,
and it would be strange if the media were to be in a privileged
position in relation to vicarious liability compared with all other
interests in this country. Lastly in this group, Amendment 13A is
intended to reassure small publishers that, in deciding the amount of
exemplary damages, the court will have regard to the means of the
defendant. Can the Minister confirm that the Government will return to
this issue when it is considered again in the
Commons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T19:38:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

amendments that I would like to look at contains those
amendments that are intended to make it clear that to benefit from cost
protection the publisher would have to participate in the
self-regulator’s arbitral scheme. With regard to
Amendment 17E, the Government’s intention is that in
order to benefit from cost protection the publisher would not only have
to be a member of an approved regulator but would also have to
participate in the scheme. There are those who have argued differently.
Surely it makes no sense to provide benefits to publishers simply on
the basis that they recognise that an arbitration scheme exists. The
point here should be that it is the active participation by publishers
in the scheme that entitles them to get cost benefits. In any case, as
Lord Justice Leveson pointed out, an incentive to join an arbitration
scheme is good for all publishers and will help them and the claimants.
Can the Minister confirm that this is his understanding of the
situation and that the Government stand ready to confirm this position
in the other

17J asks for clarification, as raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Skidelsky, about the commencement of Sections 44 and 46 of the LASPO
Act 2012, which was taken through the House by the noble Lord, Lord
McNally, so he should know his stuff on this. I should be grateful for
some confirmation about the issues that arise from that question.
Amendment 19B would require that the recognition panel, which approves
the self-regulator, is subject to freedom of information. This is an
important matter which surely should be brought forward at this stage.
After all, it is something that can be dealt with by secondary
legislation. No one would surely expect that the recognition body
wishes the power to act in secret. This really is important, so will
the Minister give us an assurance that the relevant statutory
instrument will be brought forward in good time before the regulator
starts its work? Amendment 131A concerns relevant publishers which hold
broadcasting licences. The drafting here is a little opaque. We seek an
assurance from the Minister that a person who holds a broadcasting
licence is excluded only in so far as they publish news-related
material in 
<?notus-xml column=870?>the course of their broadcasting activities. Can the Minister confirm

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I am extremely grateful to all noble
Lords who have contributed to what has been a very thoughtful debate. I
should perhaps start with the intervention by the noble Lord, Lord
Black, because I am not sure whether it was the case for the defence or
a warning of battles to come. He said that Lord Justice Leveson was as
immune from being criticised as Florence Nightingale. I would have
thought that the lady would have got a fair old battering from the
noble Lord, Lord Black, if his speech was anything to go
by.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000107">Looking
round the Chamber and listening to the contributions, and following
this debate right through, I have never been in any doubt that many of
the politicians in this Parliament would literally lay down their lives
for the freedom of the press. It is not the case, as has been suggested
in some of the very newspapers over which the noble Lord, Lord Black,
has influence, that this is some Orwellian plot against the freedom of
the press. As my noble friend Lord Phillips said, if by chance we saw
what follows as an attack on the freedom of the press, I believe that
the people who would be most likely to leap to the defence of the press
would be not some of the media barons but noble Lords in this Chamber
tonight and Members in the other

it was a well thought out and well delivered critique, I regret a
little bit that nowhere in the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Black,
was there any apology. There was no recognition of the law-breaking on
an industrial scale, no understanding of how deeply wounded the victims
of press intrusion have been and no recognition of the deep disgust of
the general public, which is reflected in the opinion polls that we
have seen. I understand the message that was delivered. He asked me to
pause. I genuinely ask the noble Lord, Lord Black, to pause and think
whether he could not go back to those with whom he has immense
influence and say, “Rather than trying to wreck this,
couldn’t we see if we could make it work?”. To my mind,
the prize is a great one—a free press, but a free press
operating to the highest standards of ethics and one that is
law-abiding. I believe that that is within our grasp if we can work
together on this.</hs_para>

agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, that where the proposals
that I have put forward tonight are not completely Leveson, that is
where we have really thought hard to see where we can
underpin the free press. I went into some detail about exemplary
damages, which are going to apply in very extreme cases, as a number of
noble Lords have made clear. We are quite confident that, as drafted,
these provisions are compatible with human rights
legislation. I think that it was my noble friend
Lord Phillips who pointed out just how narrowly they would be
drawn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000110">A
number of points were made and I will try to cover them all. The noble
Lord, Lord Lucas, asked whether we were trying to regulate the <I>New
York Times</I> or <I>Le Monde</I>. No, but equally nothing would
prevent them from joining if they saw an advantage in doing so. Of
course, international publishers can still be susceptible to defamation
torts in the UK; they are not exempt. The noble Lord, Lord Soley, asked
about the review of this legislation. It will, as normal legislation,
be subject to post-legislative review three to five years after Royal
Assent. I take the point that we are, in a way, taking a trip into the
unknown here. I am sure that the warnings and concerns that have been
expressed around this House will mean that Parliament will continue to
keep a very close eye on how this works out in practice. It is more
likely to work well if we can work together on it, on both sides of the
industry, so that we can make this
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000111">A number
of noble Lords mentioned trying to future-proof this. I was involved in
the Communications Bill with the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, 10 years
ago, when we were trying to future-proof that. In the modern world it
is extremely difficult, but we want to keep a close eye on how this
develops. Certainly, the legislation, as it is boxed at the moment, is
on the news scene as we have it at the moment. We will have to see how
much the changes that take place will need these issues to be
revisited.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000112">The
noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, asked about the ability of people to sue
using conditional fee agreements. This will remain. What is in the
LASPO is that the success fees will come from the awards made to those
who have sued and will not be in addition. This was part of the Jackson
recommendations to prevent what were seen as inflationary trends in
this part of legislation. It is also true that we expect there to be
fewer court cases, as the new regulator will resolve issues free of
charge to
claimants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000113" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000113">The
noble Lord, Lord Phillips, asked whether there were any examples in
legislation where the quantum damage was judged, as it were, on the
ability of the defendant. I think that most magistrates tend to work on
that principle, but I am told that there are instances in the Data
Protection Act where this also applies. The points made by the noble
Lords, Lord Inglewood and Lord Allan, about the impact on digital
provision on the internet are well made. The noble Lord, Lord Allan,
picked up the point about “press-like”. I intentionally
clung to that line to try not to get carried too far forward by this
legislation and I think that it is one that will be taken up.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, made, I agree that the regulatory framework
for content including TV, TV-like and TV news will need to respond to
the challenges of convergence that the Lords committee inquiry has been
investigating and will be reporting on. I also agree that, because of
this, we should now be looking to make sure that where possible the
regulatory framework has the flexibility to adapt to these new
challenges. However, there are considerations against which this must
be balanced, such as allowing for certainty in the market and avoiding
unnecessary and burdensome regulation. The communications review has
been considering this challenge and how to strike the balance, and
these issues will be addressed in the communications White

number of the points that have been raised in relation to the
amendments need clarification. I will stick closely to the text because
what I am saying has been agreed and looked at by lawyers in a way that
perhaps not all politicians’ speeches are. The noble Lords, Lord

17C would remove one of the exceptions to the general rule that a
regulated publisher defendant does not pay the claimant’s costs.
This is where the issue raised by the claim could not have been
resolved by using the arbitration scheme of the regulator. Amendment
17D clarifies the original drafting error in this provision. In such a
situation, it would not be fair to have a presumption that a particular
party should or should not pay the costs, and the general rules on

it would not be fair to have a presumption that a particular party

Amendment 18C, my noble friend is seeking clarification about the
position of online publishers. The definition of a relevant publisher,
as it stands, carefully captures those publications that we believe
Lord Justice Leveson intended to be incentivised to join a
regulator—namely, the press and sophisticated press-like online
activity—and excludes those that he considered should fall
outside the scheme, such as small-scale bloggers. This is what lies
behind subsections (3) and (4) of our definition of relevant
publisher. In striking out these subsections, the effect of my noble
friend’s amendment would be to incentivise websites that operate
a moderator function or which collate material but do not themselves
post it, such as Twitter, Facebook, Yahoo and WordPress. These are not
websites 
<?notus-xml column=873?>that Lord Justice Leveson intended to incentivise and I believe that it

my noble friend has indicated, Amendment 19A is an attempt to address
concerns among small publishers about the potential financial burden of
the new system. However, as proposed by Lord Justice Leveson and
reflected in the recognition criteria, the new system allows for
varying terms of membership between different classes of publisher. It
is, therefore, for the industry to determine a varying system of fees
which is fair and proportionate and which allows the self-regulator to
fulfil that role
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000120">Finally,
my noble friend has tabled a number of amendments to Commons Amendment
131, which lists exclusions from the definition of relevant publisher.
In Amendment 131C, my noble friend introduces a new exemption from the
definition, with the intention to exempt all local and regional online
and traditional print titles from the entire scheme of recognition and
incentives. The proposed royal charter already sets out to
deal with the particular interests of the local and regional press. An
outright exemption, such as is proposed here, would allow publishers of
local news, read and relied on by many people, to be wholly removed
from the new regime being established under the Leveson proposals.
While the Leveson report accepted the particular needs of the local and
regional press, it did not recommend that these publishers be removed
wholesale from the recognition
regime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000121" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000121">With
Amendment 131D, my noble friend would exclude non-charitable
campaigning organisations that publish material that is
incidental to the organisation’s aims and objectives.
The Government’s definition of a relevant publisher already
excludes charitable organisations, which will represent the vast
majority of campaigning organisations. A “non-charitable
campaigning organisation” would have, first, to be run as a
business and, secondly, to be publishing news, opinion or information
about current affairs before it would be caught by the
Government’s current proposed definition. The concept of a
non-charitable organisation is a very broad one and could cover a wide
variety of websites or magazines that publish
news.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000122">In
Amendment 131E, my noble friend seeks to extend the list of

my noble friend has indicated that, in contrast to his other
amendments, Amendment 131B is more than probing. This amendment would
create a significant loophole in the scheme proposed by Lord Justice
Leveson. A publisher’s focus may be on events in a country other
than the United Kingdom, but that does not change the fact that, in the
process of reporting and commenting on such overseas events, people
with a connection to those overseas events may be defamed, harassed or
otherwise have their rights breached here in the United Kingdom.
Provided that the publisher in question is able to join the regulatory
scheme if he or she wishes to do so, there is no good reason why the
costs and exemplary damages incentive should not apply to that
publisher if he or she is sued under English law and in this
jurisdiction.</hs_para>

turn to the amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky.
Amendments 17A and 17F would have the effect of extending the
protection of the costs clause to any publisher against which a claim
is made. These amendments would extend the ambit of the cost provisions
in Amendment 17 beyond those agreed by the three main parties. We have
been clear that we wish to cover within a self-regulatory regime those
publishers that properly qualify as news publishers. Any attempt to
broaden this could lead to unintended consequences, even though the
noble Lord’s aim is to encourage the use of low-cost arbitration
schemes, which I agree is laudable. Given the terms of the agreement
last week, we do not consider these amendments are
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000126">Amendment

the definition of a “relevant publisher”. This would have
the effect of introducing doubt in relation to which publishers are in
fact covered because many publishers, particularly traditional print
media publishers of newspapers, do not make a profit. The exemption in
paragraph 6 of the exclusions schedule already exempts public bodies
and charities publishing news-related material in connection with the
carrying out of their functions. This is narrower than the breadth of
the exemption that is sought here, which, as indicated, could exempt
mainstream
newspapers.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13032538000127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000127">Amendment
18B seeks to limit the definition of relevant publisher to businesses
with a turnover of more than five times the threshold for VAT; that is,
£385,000, which is five times the annual threshold of
£77,000. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw this
amendment, given the Government’s manuscript Amendment
131BA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000128">Amendment
131A proposes an amendment to the broadcasting definition to make clear
that it is only when broadcasters publish news-related material in the
course of their broadcasting function that they fall within the
exemption. However, this point is already covered adequately by the
operation of the existing provisions. The existing schedule refers to
news publications in connection with licensed broadcasting activity,
and needs to be read alongside Amendment 18(6), which
provides that a broadcaster gets an exemption only in so far as its
publication is in its capacity as a broadcaster. So if a broadcaster
established a separate 
<?notus-xml column=875?>news publishing service, not linked to its broadcasting, it would not
benefit from the exemption. I think that was the clarification the
noble Lord was
seeking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000129" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000129">Concern
has been expressed that the wording of Amendment 11B would not capture
the situation in which a regulated publisher had deliberately concealed
information from the regulator, as in that situation the regulator
could not be said to have acted in a “manifestly
irrational” way, as it would have been unaware of the true
picture. We believe that this is not a matter that needs to be provided
for in the provisions regarding exemplary damages, nor should it be. It
is properly a matter for the regulator’s procedures and we do
not think that there will be a problem in practice, for the following
reasons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000130">Where
the court becomes aware of new facts that were concealed from the
regulator, we believe that it will be open to the court to highlight
these in its judgment, and for the regulator to reopen its
investigation of the case and reconsider any penalties that it has
imposed, or any failure to do so. There is nothing in the provisions
relating to the royal charter that would prevent a case being reopened
by the regulator in this way, and indeed nothing to stop a victim from
bringing those new facts to the attention of the regulator regardless
of the court’s intervention.</hs_para>

will be a number of very strong incentives on publishers not to conceal
information from the regulator. Requirements of a new regulatory system
established on a contractual basis are likely to include the need for
members to be bound by the terms of their membership to disclose
whatever information is reasonably necessary for the regulator to
fulfil its functions, and contractual terms preventing non-co-operation
or the withholding of information can be built in. Concealing of
information could also reflect the failure of governance standards on
the part of the publisher, which can be the subject of penalties by the
regulator.</hs_para>

would also raise questions of criminal liability. A publisher who
dishonestly keeps secret information that he is contractually bound to
give to the regulator, or to a claimant in the context of arbitration,
in order to avoid a sanction or paying damages could be guilty of
committing a crime under the Fraud Act 2006. That is equally so where
the publisher makes a false representation. We believe that it is
appropriate and in accordance with Lord Justice Leveson’s
recommendations for the powers of the regulator to control any attempt
by publishers to conceal information to be established through the
contractual terms governing the operation of the new regulatory system.
We do not consider that anything needs to be added to this clause to
enable that to
occur.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000133">Amendment
11C is unnecessary. It seeks to ensure that the new statutory test is
not limited by the existing common-law test where exemplary damages are
awarded if the defendant effectively balances the advantage to be
gained by committing a wrongful act against the likely compensation
that he or she would have to pay to the claimant, and decided that it
was worth doing. The point of this common-law test was to show the
defendant that “tort does not pay”. However, the 
<?notus-xml column=876?>common-law test is entirely displaced in all “relevant
claims” against “relevant publishers” as a result
of Commons Amendment 11(4)(b), which makes clear that where Amendment
11 applies, exemplary damages can be awarded “only under this
section”. Therefore, exemplary damages cannot be awarded against
a relevant publisher in common law and so the “outrageous
disregard” test in Commons Amendment 11(6) is the only test that
can apply, and there is no need for the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000134">Amendment
11D would add a subsection to Amendment 11. Amendment 15A makes a
consequential change to Amendment 15. This would mean that both
regulated and unregulated publishers could be vicariously liable for
any exemplary damages awarded against one of their
employees. It is well established that a publisher can be vicarious
liable in common law to pay compensation for the acts of its employees.
That position will not be changed by the Commons amendments. The
position is different in relation to exemplary damages. Claims for such
damages are very rare; cases in which they are sought for the act of an
individual journalist even more so. In fact, we are aware of no cases
at all in which exemplary damages have been awarded against a publisher
found vicariously liable for the conduct of a
journalist.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000135">I
understand the spirit in which the amendment is proposed. However, the
cross-party talks and the Commons agreed a specific approach to
exemplary damages—that exemplary damages would not be available
in relation to regulated publishers as an incentive to their joining a
voluntary self-regulator. There is one exception to that rule set out
elsewhere in the clause—that the court may award exemplary
damages against a publisher who has joined a regulator if, in the
court’s view, the regulator acted manifestly irrationally in its
imposition of a penalty. This amendment would introduce a second
exception by allowing that publishers, whether regulated or not, could
be held vicariously liable for exemplary damages awarded against
journalists. That would go beyond the terms of the cross-party
agreement. However, I should be clear about a number of points that I
hope will give some reassurance. First, the liability of individual
journalists at common law remains as it is now. Secondly, as far as we
are aware, a publisher has never been held vicariously liable for an
exemplary damages award against a journalist. Thirdly, the new
regulator would have the power to fine publishers both for connivance
in such activity and for ignorance of it. We think, on the merits, that
the approach of the Commons amendment is the right one.</hs_para>

accepted, would mean that in deciding whether to award exemplary
damages the court would have to reach a value judgment as to whether
the defendant’s reasons for not joining the regulator were
themselves objectively reasonable. We do not believe that this would be
practicable or
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000137">Amendment
13A would require the court to take account of the defendant’s
means in deciding the amount of exemplary damages to award. Courts can
already take means into account and there is no need for the

17B and 17E make two changes to Amendment 17(2) which relate to the
costs incentive. First, the amendment excludes relevant publishers 
<?notus-xml column=877?>which are unable to join a regulator, or which have objectively valid
reasons for not joining the regulator, from the costs incentive.
Secondly, it imposes an additional requirement on the availability of
the first exception to the rule. That exception provides that if
arbitration under an approved regulatory scheme has not resolved the
case, then the ordinary rules on costs apply rather than the general
rule that the defendant does not pay the claimant’s costs at
all. The amendment adds a requirement to this exception that the
defendant was a participating member of the arbitration scheme itself
and not just a member of the regulator. This is inappropriate because
it presumes that participation in the arbitration scheme will be an
optional extra for members of the regulator. This will not be the case
and therefore the amendment is not required. I think that that is
another clarification that the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, asked

confirm that we do not intend to implement Sections 44 and 46 of the

publication and privacy cases until the new costs protection regime has
been introduced. The position is clearly set out in a Written
Ministerial Statement of 12 December 2012. The LASPO Act 2012

forward than allowing the recoverability of “after the

meritorious cases to be pursued at proportionate cost; “after
the event” insurance allows cases to be pursued but
only at substantially increased cost. In taking this course we are

Act. The Government’s recent response following post-legislative
scrutiny of the Freedom of Information Act reiterates their commitment
to extend the Act to a range of bodies performing functions of a public
nature using the order-making power in the Act. We are happy to
designate the recognition panel using an order under the Freedom of

Mackay of </B><B>Clashfern</B><B>:</B></Member> Before my noble friend
sits down, I have one question. He will remember vividly that the noble
Lord, Lord Puttnam, moved an amendment to the Defamation Bill on
Report, which this House carried. My noble friend anticipated at Third
Reading that that would be dealt with in due course by an agreement
that would supersede the amendment. The passage of time has fulfilled
his prophecy, and I am sure we are all glad of that. I am assuming that
now the Defamation Bill will be able to proceed, as it merits, to Royal
Assent by the end of the present
Session.</hs_para>

the tingle in my shoulder blades when I realised that the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Mackay, had risen to his feet. I thought, “My
God! What question of law is he going to ask me to pronounce
on?”. I am very pleased to understand that there is all-party
agreement and that after the due process of whatever they do down the
other end the Defamation Bill will be returned without the Puttnam
amendment, although when the history of this saga is written, it will
be said that the Puttnam amendment did its job. I am not so bitter
about it, especially since the Bill is coming back without
it.</hs_para>

At risk of prolonging that, before my noble friend sits down, will he
confirm, in order that he might get his supper this hour rather than
next, that the matters that the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, raised in
his speech will be under active consideration in the Commons before
this Bill returns to this

</B><B>McNally</B><B>:</B></Member><B> </B>I will look at what the
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, raised, but I warn the House against the
idea that what is going back to the House of Commons is a reopening of
these discussions. We have said what we want to see passed, we have
asked noble Lords to withdraw. I have explained. I do not want to
mislead the House. The Commons will be able to consider only their
amendments that have been amended by this House. For example, if we do
not today amend Commons Amendment 14, that amendment will no longer be
in play during the next round of ping-pong. We are not sending the Bill
back to the Commons for another go. Quite frankly, that would be
extremely dangerous. My reply was carefully crafted by many hands far
more expert than mine in a way that I hope gives the assurances that
were sought in raising the amendments, not least those tabled by the
noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, However, the way that ping-pong works keeps
the debate very tight and I do not want to mislead the House that it
allows a rerun of negotiations on this. To even suggest that would be a
bad mistake.</hs_para>

Lucas:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to the Minister for
all the time he has taken on my amendments. I would quarrel with him in
his interpretation of how ping-pong works. I spent time talking to the
clerks at 
<?notus-xml column=881?>this end and in another place before I put down my amendments, and my
understanding is that the other place has very wide powers to suggest
amendments in lieu; it is not restricted to individual amendments. The
Government’s amendment on small bloggers will allow amendments
to be made at any other position within this group of amendments. I may
be misquoting the clerks—I am quite capable of that—but
that was what entered my brain as a result of the conversations I had
before I put down my amendments. In particular, I should be sad if the
conversations that I started on my Amendment 18C were not to have any
result.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000161" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0002.htm#13032538000161">My
noble friend doubtless remembers what a difficult performance a
three-legged race is on school sports day. He has had to indulge in a
four-legged race today with his left leg tied to the Labour Party and
his right leg tied to the Conservative Party, and he has been finding
it extremely difficult. He has provided an excellent illustration of
the problem, dealt with by my noble friend the Leader of the House at
Questions today, of reading out a pre-prepared speech when what had
been said was something completely different. I said in my address to
Amendment 18C that I felt that the way in which the Government had
drafted this clause would allow large news organisations to create
structures that were in no way subject to the Bill. My noble friend did
not address that at all in his reply, because it had been pre-prepared
and did not allow him to reply to the remarks that I had made. I
particularly feel that the Government have not understood the way in
which the world is moving on the internet, and have not allowed for the
sort of structures that seem to be arising even now, let alone those
that will

Government will take advantage of the freedom that I believe that they
have to think through the wording and ensure that they are giving
themselves the powers that they wish. To come back to what my noble
friend Lord Black of Brentwood said, we are trying to achieve a
regulator here that will be participated in, agreed and effective. I am
sure that another look at the questions that I have raised with
Amendment 11A would consider whether introducing uncertainties in this
way in the position of someone who registers is really the best way of
getting people to sign

speak to Amendments 21 to 23, 27, 30, 39 to 41, 45, 48, 50, 134, 135
and 139. This group of amendments deals with two aspects of the
operation of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Commons Amendments 22, 23,
39 to 41, 50, 134 and 135 seek simply to return the reach of the civil
recovery scheme under the Proceeds of Crime Act to the position it was
believed to be in before last year’s Supreme Court judgment in
the case of Perry v SOCA. The amendments to the 2002 Act do not
introduce any new policy and we are certainly not breaking any new
ground.</hs_para>

that the courts will again be able to make civil recovery orders
against property anywhere in the world, provided that there is a link
back to this jurisdiction. For example, the High Court of England and
Wales will be able to make an order in respect of a Spanish villa
bought by a criminal who is resident in England, or with money made
from unlawful conduct committed in England.</hs_para>

make it clear that requests can be made to other civil investigations

recovery process. These Commons amendments also put beyond doubt that
investigation orders can be made against persons as well as property to

civil recovery order.</hs_para>

between the restored Proceeds of Crime Act and how civil recovery
operated prior to the Perry judgment. In the absence of a
legislative consent Motion, the new schedule inserted by Commons
Amendment 139 provides that the relevant amendments to the Proceeds of
Crime Act do not extend to Northern Ireland. This means that for many
offences the civil recovery regime in Northern Ireland does not have
the international reach of the civil recovery regime in the rest of the
UK. This is regrettable, especially for the people of
Northern Ireland. However, as with the 
<?notus-xml column=885?>National Crime Agency, which we debated earlier, we have taken a series
of order-making powers to enable us to extend the provisions to
Northern Ireland at a later date. Of course, any extension
will require consent from Northern Ireland for matters that
are within the legislative competence of the Northern Ireland
Assembly.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032538000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#13032538000167">The
second issue addressed by the amendments relates to the provision of
publicly funded legal aid to wealthy individuals whose assets are
restrained under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The 2002 Act prevents
restrained funds being released to a defendant for legal expenses in
relation to the offences to which the restraint order relates. Prior to
the Proceeds of Crime Act, there was a risk that individuals might
recklessly dissipate assets through lavish spending on their defence in
order to try to secure an acquittal at any cost. However, this has led
to a public perception that rich offenders with significant restrained
assets are receiving vast sums of free legal aid when they could afford
to make a contribution to their
defence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032538000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#13032538000168">Since
the Proceeds of Crime Act was introduced, a system of means testing for
legal aid has been introduced for all Crown Court defendants. Those who
can afford to pay some of or all their legal aid costs are required to
do so. While anyone charged with a criminal offence and facing
imprisonment or loss of livelihood is entitled to legal aid, I think
the whole House would agree that if the defendant can pay some of or
their entire legal bill, they should. After all, as we ask people on
modest incomes to pay something towards their defence costs, it is only
fair and reasonable that we ask millionaires to do so.</hs_para>

Amendments 20, 21 and 27 amend Section 41 of PoCA to allow
payment of a contribution towards, and up to the full amount of,
defendants’ publicly funded legal aid costs. The detailed
mechanism of how this will operate in practice will be set out in
regulations subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. In framing
such regulations, we will take into account the compensation paid to
victims and the funding of further asset recovery work by law
enforcement and prosecutors. We can already freeze criminals’
assets to make it easier to recover these ill gotten gains and
compensate victims, but that often leaves the state picking up their
legal bills, even if the offender has plenty of money to pay them as
well. I hope that the whole House will agree that our aim should be to
increase the overall amount of money being taken from criminals. The
new clauses inserted by Commons Amendments 20 and 21 will enable us to
do just that. I beg to

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I will make a few comments,
in particular in relation to the civil recovery process. The Government
are right, following the Perry judgment, which left a huge hole in our
powers to recover criminal assets, to bring forward the
matter and put it on a legislative footing. However,
we come back to the very strange position in Northern
Ireland, which was confirmed by the Minister here and by Jeremy Browne,
the Minister in the other place.</hs_para>

primary purpose of the schedule is to ensure that it is not possible to
make a civil recovery order against property located outside the UK if
the unlawful conduct occurred in Northern Ireland but the property is
located outside Northern Ireland. This is a strange position. If
somebody lives in Birmingham, Manchester or London and they stash their
ill gotten gains in another part of the world such as Dublin or Spain,
there is a legislative remedy to seek an order to have the funds
returned. However, if somebody lives in Belfast, Armagh or another part
of Northern Ireland and they have their ill gotten gains just a few
miles away across the border, they are completely outside the remit of
the legislation of this
country.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T20:44:39"></hs_TimeCode>
Criminals in Northern Ireland will be able to invest their criminal
gains across the border in the Republic of Ireland, just a quick drive

way of seizing those assets. I find that a shocking state of

of the town of Belleek where, if you walk down the high street, your
mobile phone signal beeps from one side to the other because the border
is so close that it is switching from the Irish server to the UK one.
If you follow the border along, it is very difficult. A criminal could
buy land in that area. We do not assume that everyone in Northern
Ireland is going to do this, but criminals will know that if they live
in Northern Ireland but store the proceeds of their crime just a few
miles across the border, they are going to be outside the remit of

will amend the 2003 Act by requiring the judge at an 
<?notus-xml column=888?>extradition hearing to consider the issue of forum—that is, where
the offence should be prosecuted. The Government’s decision to
introduce a forum bar to extradition responds to the widespread concern
within Parliament, as well as among the public more generally, that
insufficient safeguards are currently built into cases of concurrent
jurisdiction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032540000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#13032540000004">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T20:52:03"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lords may be aware, there is an existing uncommenced forum
provision in Schedule 13 to the Police and Justice Act 2006. This
provision has not been commenced for good reason; simply put, we do not
believe that it is fit for purpose. It would be cumbersome in practice
and lead to wholly unacceptable delays in the extradition process.
Instead, the Government’s forum amendments to the 2003 Act
introduce a very carefully constructed provision, which has been
designed to provide greater openness and scrutiny in relation to the
question of where the most appropriate jurisdiction for trial is for
those facing the possibility of extradition, while minimising delays as
far as
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032540000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#13032540000005">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T20:52:46"></hs_TimeCode>

the extradition would not be in the interests of justice. In
considering whether to bar extradition, a judge will have to consider
whether a substantial measure of the alleged offences occurred in the
UK and a list of other facts such as where the most harm occurred, the
interests of any victims, the location of witnesses and the

in the UK, because there is insufficient admissible evidence available
or because it is not in the public interest for such a prosecution to
take place, a prosecutor’s certificate can be issued to that
effect. This will prevent extradition being barred on forum grounds.
The purpose of the prosecutor’s certificate is to ensure that
the subject of the extradition request, who may be wanted for a very
serious offence, does not escape prosecution altogether because a
domestic prosecution is not possible, but the judge decides none the

The amendments point to particular circumstances where a
prosecutor’s certificate may be appropriate: namely, in cases
where there is sensitive material which cannot be disclosed in open

it is not in the public interest for such a prosecution to take

believe that these measures will make our extradition arrangements more
open and transparent and will ensure that, in cases of concurrent
jurisdiction, due consideration will be given by the prosecutors to any
decision about whether or not a person could be prosecuted in the UK.
Under these new arrangements, prosecutors will know that they will be
called upon to justify any decision in front of a judge in open court,
not behind closed doors, as happens at the moment, and that any
decision to issue a prosecutor’s certificate is judicially
reviewable in the High

of the new schedule will transfer the discretion to consider final
human rights representations from the Home Secretary to the courts. At
present, the Home Secretary is obliged to consider human rights 
<?notus-xml column=889?>issues raised after a person has exhausted their appeal rights because
she is a “public authority” for the purposes of the Human
Rights Act 1998. By specifically preventing the Secretary of State
considering whether extradition is compatible with the ECHR and
transferring examination of such matters to the courts, the amendments
will strike a better balance between two competing considerations: on
the one hand, ensuring late human rights issues which are deserving of
the court’s attention are properly considered and, on the other
hand, ensuring that people are not able to abuse the system and delay
extradition endlessly by means of raising last-minute, specious human
rights points which can then be the subject of judicial
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032540000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#13032540000009">It is
legitimate for the Home Secretary to play some role in the extradition
process and that will remain the case. Ministers will still sign an
extradition order for Part 2 countries: that is, those countries not
covered by the European arrest warrant, to confirm that there are no
statutory bars to extradition once it has been approved by the district
judge. This covers issues such as the death penalty, ensuring people
are tried only for the charges on which they have been extradited,
onward extradition from a third country and transfers from the
International Criminal Court. These are areas where diplomatic
assurances are occasionally required and it is right that Ministers,
rather than the courts, should continue to deal with
these.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032540000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#13032540000010">Part 3
of the new schedule makes provision in respect of Scottish extradition
proceedings. In extradition proceedings in England and Wales, it is
possible for a point of law to be appealed to the Supreme Court. In
extradition proceedings in Scotland, the final court of appeal is the
High Court of Justiciary. There is one exception to this in that there
can be an appeal to the Supreme Court against the determination of a
devolution issue raised in Scottish extradition proceedings. Devolution
issues include questions as to whether the Scottish Ministers have
acted in a way that is incompatible with the European Convention on
Human Rights or EU law and so can arise in Scottish extradition
proceedings. However, the 2003 Act does not take account of devolution
issues in Scottish extradition proceedings being appealed to the
Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has expressed concern that this could
create problems in certain cases about the power to detain a
person pending the outcome of an appeal to the Supreme Court and the
time limit for extraditing a person following such an
appeal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032540000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#13032540000011">The
amendments provide that where the authority or territory that issued
the extradition warrant seeks to appeal a devolution issue to the
Supreme Court, the court has power to remand the person whose
extradition is being sought in custody or on bail. Where the person is
remanded in custody, the court may grant bail at a later date. The
amendments ensure that the court has this power until the person is
extradited or the extradition proceedings are discharged. They also set
up the time limit for extraditing a person where a party to the
proceedings seeks to appeal a devolution issue, raised in Scottish
extradition proceedings, to the Supreme Court. Part 3 of the new
schedule essentially ensures that a consistent approach is taken in the
2003 Act to appeals to the Supreme Court in extradition

the matter of deportation in national security cases. Commons
Amendments 25 and 49 limit the circumstances in which
national-security-related deportations attract in-country rights of
appeal on human rights grounds. The amendment would allow the Home
Secretary to certify that removal pending the outcome of the
substantive appeal would not be in breach of the appellant’s
rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Home
Secretary could make such a certificate on the grounds that temporary
removal would not result in the individual facing a real risk of
serious, irreversible harm, or that the underlying human rights claim
was clearly unfounded. The certificate would render any in-country
appeal against deportation out-of -country. The test of serious and
irreversible harm is that used by the European Court of Human Rights
when deciding when to issue a direction to suspend removal from a
country prior to its substantive consideration of appeals against
deportation or removal. Appellants will have a right to
apply to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission for the certificate
to be set aside. The commission would review such an application fairly
but expeditiously.</hs_para>

certificate made under this provision is obviously not to prevent an
appeal. It is only to change the location of the appellant during that
appeal. The change is not unprecedented. Out-of-country appeals already
happen in relation to appeals against deportation which are certified
under Section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.
Those certificates are issued when the underlying human rights claim is
assessed to be “clearly unfounded”. As such the courts
are well used to reviewing decisions that a human rights claim is
clearly unfounded; and appeals are frequently pursued from overseas. It
is the Government’s view that bringing an appeal from overseas
does not of itself handicap the appellant’s ability to argue his
or her case on
appeal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032540000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#13032540000014">As
national security deportation cases often involve human rights claims,
where it is alleged individuals may face the risk of torture—or
worse—on return, there are significant constraints on our
ability to deport before an appeal is heard in the UK. The Government
only ever take deportation action when they consider it lawful to do so
and would not deport if they thought there was a real risk that the
person would be tortured on return. Nevertheless, this amendment will
support our ability to deport in future cases, in particular where
individuals raise less fundamental human rights issues such as the
right to a private life or where their human rights claim is unfounded.
For example, a person may suffer no serious, irreversible harm in being
away from their family for a few months while their substantive appeal
is determined. The person will still have an appeal and if they win
will be able to return to the UK. Having the individual out of the UK
pending the appeal could be of real benefit in the context of the
relatively small number of national security deportation
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032540000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#13032540000015">This

the Government is to clarify what will change materially. If the

the basis that there was no clear evidence to suggest that the present

the introduction of a forum bar would create long delays in the
extradition process and give rise to a whole host of satellite
legislation, increasing both the cost and length of such processes,
which would not be in the interests of justice, the victims or, least
of all, the individual accused. We must ensure that the new procedures
and arrangements do not lead to the sort of lengthy delays that we have
seen in the cases of Gary McKinnon and Babar Ahmad. In that regard, one
notes that under the new forum bar procedure, the prosecutor’s
certificate effectively applying a veto is judicially reviewable, but
only against the tests set out in the Bill.</hs_parafo>

has had on the speed and efficiency of extradition arrangements and

Parliament. Clearly, it is in the interest of all parties, and in our

appeal against the deportation on national security grounds where she
can certify that either the individual would not face the risk of
serious irreversible harm or where the whole or part of any human

the test of serious irreversible harm is one that was established in a

any human rights claim is “clearly unfounded”, is less

Lloyd of Berwick:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may speak to
Amendment 24B, which is included in this group. Earlier today I
suggested that Commons Amendments 24 and 136 should be postponed for
the reason that these amendments, unlike all the others we have been
discussing today, were not considered at all on the Floor of the House
of Commons, and are only being considered at this very late stage in
this House—one that is, let me say, barely

I said earlier today that these two amendments should be postponed, I
think I made it clear that the Government should withdraw these two
amendments now and bring them back early in the next Session of
Parliament when we can debate them properly both in the
other place and here. I cannot see what the Government can possibly
lose by taking that course. Yes, there would be some delay, but as it
is seven years since we have had a forum bar on the statute
book and it has never yet been put into force, I find it
impossible not to ask what the hurry is now. Although there
would be a delay of a few extra months, it would not make all that much
difference, and at least it would mean that we had done justice to
these very important amendments, which now we shall not be able to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T21:18:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

every single word of the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, in his excellent
speech, but he will not actually expect me to support the detail of his
amendment. That is because we already have the Scott Baker review,
which was published just under two years ago. What we ought to be doing
today is implementing that review rather than legislating in its teeth
and asking for another review in three years’ time. I repeat,
what a way to legislate: to appoint a group like that led by Lord
Justice Scott Baker to go into this question and then to ignore what it
said. I believe that I am right in saying that the noble Lord, in
proposing his amendment, did not once refer to Lord Justice Scott
Baker’s report. Again, what a way to legislate.</hs_para>

the new forum clause and ask how it would fare judged
against the Scott Baker report. I can say that it has all the defects
of the 2006 forum clause, which was so strongly criticised by Lord
Justice Scott Baker, with some more defects besides. The basic mistake
is to believe that the question of where a defendant should be
prosecuted when there are different countries claiming jurisdiction
should be decided by a judge, on the grounds, so it seems, that that
will produce a fairer result. I can understand that view but, in my
strong opinion, it is not the way ahead. Where there are competing
jurisdictions, the question can only sensibly be decided by agreement
between the 
<?notus-xml column=895?>two competing jurisdictions. One of the main considerations in these
cases must always be where the bulk of the evidence lies on which the
defendant is to be convicted, if he is to be convicted. That is
essentially a question for the prosecuting authorities. They will have
all the material at their disposal. How is that material to be put
before the judge? Are they to appear before the judge and argue the
toss before him—is that what is proposed? If it is to be a
judge, why should it be a judge in England rather than a judge in the
requesting state? At pages 222 and 223 of the report, the authors give
nine distinct reasons why a forum bar is not the way ahead. I would
have liked to have heard the noble Lord’s answer to each one of
those reasons. However, I will content myself with simply reading their
conclusion, at page
228:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1303266000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303266000087">“However,
in our firmly held view the issue of forum is better decided by the
prosecuting authority than the court. A decision about where a case
should be tried is par excellence a prosecutorial decision, as is a
decision whether it should be prosecuted at all: the prosecuting
authority will be familiar with the detail of the case, the available
evidence and the viability of proceeding in one jurisdiction rather
than
another”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="1303266000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303266000079">That

of the many reasons why the 2006 forum bar was never brought into force
was that it was thought to be too complicated. If the 2006 Act was
complicated, how much more complicated is this forum provision, where
we have prosecuting certificates of the designated prosecutors being
questioned, under proposed new Section 19E in Amendment 136, before the
High Court in judicial review proceedings? How is that going
to speed up the process of extradition, which is the whole object of
these proceedings? It is madness to think that it will; it will
not.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="1303266000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303266000006">Another
reason that has been given—this is the last that I shall
mention—is that enacting these provisions will automatically put
us in breach of our international obligations. That is certainly a
point which was carefully dealt with by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser,
and I agree with what he said. In respect of category 1 countries, for
example, we already have a system for deciding between two countries
where there is a dispute as to where the proceedings should take place.
That is known as Eurojust, and it is a system that is operating now and
without any difficulty. If we pass a forum bar, we will have to opt out
of Eurojust. Are we to be the only country to do so? No other country,
so far as I know, has suggested anything similar to a forum
bar.</hs_para>

countries? Exactly the same applies as when we had existing extradition
arrangements. Why should other countries which are not in Europe be
satisfied with the decision of our court about which is the most
suitable jurisdiction for the defendant to be prosecuted? Those are
reasons which were given by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Scotland, and they were absolutely sound. No answer to that objection

come back to where I started. These are but three of the reasons why
this forum will not work. I prophesy that it will not ever be brought

actually impede the speed which is so essential in these
extradition cases. I wish the noble Lord had accepted my suggestion
that this matter should now be withdrawn by the Government and brought
back again in the next session when we could debate it properly.

Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and one or two other Members of this House

matter. I have to say that I cannot recall an instance where the
Government have introduced a fundamental amendment not in Committee or
on Report, but actually when the Commons were discussing the Bill and
amendments to our amendments. There would have been plenty of time in
the early stages of the Bill in either House for the Government to have

was caught. Had he been a Back-Bencher—and I hope he is not
going to be a Back-Bencher as a result of all this—I suspect
that he would have agreed with out arguments. However, being the

Opposition or other Cross-Benchers are right and the Government are

this part of the Bill, when we are dealing with Commons

not have the flexibility that we have in earlier stages of legislation.
We are caught in a position where we have a very serious matter, and

there might well be situations where the courts would operate in

For example, if we did not have a forum bar, the UK prosecution would
not be able to require disclosure of foreign secret evidence. If we had
a forum bar, we could demand that as a condition of the extradition,
and that would be an added way of having openness and secrecy in our
procedures. The Minister said that there would be no secrecy so there
is a bit of a dispute as to the facts here; perhaps the Minister could
clarify that. For example, as it stands, if the United States refused

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, despite the criticism of
noble Lords about the quality of debate that we might have on this
issue, I feel that we have had an opportunity to discuss the matter in
some depth. It forms part of the Bill that is before us as a result of
the Commons amendments. It is our responsibility to discuss the Bill
and it is my responsibility to encourage noble Lords to see these
particular amendments through. I believe that they are in the interests
of good governance and in the interests of this country. The measures
we have introduced on the forum will make the extradition process more
open and transparent. Making the courts the sole body to consider human
rights issues, which has not been discussed much but is a very
important change, will ensure that people are not able to abuse the
system and delay extradition endlessly by raising specious last-minute
human rights points which can then be the subject of judicial review.
Together, our proposals will improve our extradition arrangements and,
in my view, make them fairer.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1303266000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303266000019">The noble Lord, Lord
Rosser, has asked my right honourable friend the Home Secretary to
commission a review of our proposals and their impact on the speed of
extradition procedures, as well as on our current and future
extradition relations. This is the substance of his Amendment 24A. As
the noble Lord will be aware, we commissioned a review by Sir Scott
Baker. His report, referred to extensively by the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Berwick, was a comprehensive and detailed analysis of our
extradition arrangements. The findings of Sir Scott Baker’s
panel were very carefully considered by the Government. He has helped
us to come to a view about the changes that needed to be made to our
extradition procedures, including those we have brought forward in this
Bill, with a view to not only improving those procedures but addressing
public and parliamentary concern about their fairness. I can assure the
noble Lord that once the new forum bar is operating these arrangements,
together with other changes to the Extradition Act, will indeed be
subject to the normal post-legislative scrutiny process, which was
introduced by the previous Administration, three to five years after
Royal Assent.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1303266000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303266000020">I now turn to Amendments
136A to 136C in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. As I have
already said, it is important to improve the protections offered to
individuals under the Extradition Act. That is why we have introduced
our own forum provisions. However, the interests of justice demand that
our extradition arrangements are properly balanced to ensure that,
while there must be proper safeguards in place for 
<?notus-xml column=899?>those subject to extradition, our arrangements do not allow a person to
escape justice altogether. Therefore it is important that the test for
whether extradition should be barred on forum grounds contains no
implied presumption against extradition, even where it is
clear that no prosecution is possible or likely in the UK. If the Crown
Prosecution Service or another prosecutorial body decides after proper
consideration—importantly, that will now be tested in open court
and I am pleased that the noble Lord welcomes that position—that
a domestic prosecution cannot take place, extraditions should not be
barred on forum grounds. Justice will otherwise not be done and
potential victims will see their assailant, in some cases potentially a
suspected terrorist, walk away scot
free.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303266000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303266000021">There has
been concern from the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, about whether we can
ensure that the bar does not refuse to provide any
information—in other words, what will happen in the absence of
information? This is not the case under our treaties and, under the
Extradition Act 2003, a requesting state must provide certain
information. That is not being changed by these
arrangements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T21:40:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

propose a non-exhaustive list of factors for a judge to consider when
deciding whether extradition is in the interests of justice. Our strong
preference is for an exhaustive list, so long as it is the
right list, in order to prevent unnecessary delays in the extradition
process arising from individuals raising irrelevant considerations in
front of the judge. We believe that the strength of connection to the
UK is a relevant factor—I am sure that noble Lords will
agree—and we have included it for the judge to
consider among others. However, we do not believe that
nationality should be identified as a factor in its own right. The UK
has historically not had a bar on extraditing its own nationals, which
is reflected in all current extradition treaties. There is no intention
to introduce such a
bar<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T21:41:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

strike out the provisions in Schedule 19 transferring responsibility
for determining human rights representations from the Home Secretary to
the courts. The determination of human rights issues is properly a
matter for the courts. The courts already consider such issues during
the extradition process. This change, which was recommended by
Sir Scott Baker in his review, will ensure that human rights
issues arising late in the process are properly considered by the
courts while also ensuring that people are not able to abuse the system
and delay extradition endlessly by means of raising, at the last
minute, specious human rights points with the Home Secretary that can
then be subject to judicial

shall answer some specific questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Rosser. He asked what the purpose was of the prosecutor’s
certificate. The purpose of the forum bar is to ensure that prosecutors
give due consideration to whether a prosecution should take place in
the UK. That does not always happen at the moment. Our proposals ensure
that a decision on forum is either taken in open court or, in a case
where a certificate is issued, in the High Court following any judicial

the issue that the noble and learned Lord raised right at the beginning
of our debate, before we even started considering Commons amendments. I
understand his concerns about this matter but, as I made clear in my
Statement to the House on 16 October last year in response
to the review by Sir Scott Baker of UK extradition procedures, the
Government wished to legislate as quickly as possible to introduce
provisions on forum. We made that clear at the time.</hs_para>

worked hard, taking into account the views of prosecutors, to develop
an approach which will be acceptable to Parliament and the public. The
Official Opposition gave a relative welcome to these proposals when
they were tabled in the other place, which I think shows broad
acceptance that we have got these proposals right. If we were to remove
these proposals from the Bill now, it would be a year or more before
those facing extradition would see the benefit of this new and
important safeguard. In light of these comments and the response I have
given to this debate, I respectfully ask the noble Lord to withdraw his

provision for the delivery of services for female offenders. This
included making provision for women to participate in unpaid work and
rehabilitative programmes with their particular needs in mind. As noble

ensuring that there are credible, robust community sentencing options
available for sentencers; gender-specific services for female offenders

punishment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303266000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303266000048">Included
in the consultation were proposals to complete the provision of a wide
range of services and to introduce payment by results, so that in
future the taxpayer will pay for those services that demonstrate a
reduction in reoffending. National commissioning would replace
commissioning by probation trusts. We intend to open up rehabilitative
services to a wide range of new providers in the private and voluntary
sectors who will bring their creativity and innovation to bear on this
pressing problem, and who will be paid by results to drive down
reoffending. The close work between probation trusts and the voluntary
sector women’s community services can be seen as a precursor of
this approach. The amendment agreed in this House at Third Reading
failed to recognise this new landscape for the delivery of probation
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303266000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303266000049">I
assure noble Lords that, in taking forward these reforms, we are very
aware of the particular needs and priorities that are
relevant to services for female offenders, and that we will ensure that
these are addressed within our overall approach. Our consultation
document specifically asked for views on how we can use our new
commissioning model, including payment by results, to ensure better
outcomes for female offenders and for others with complex needs or
protected characteristics. It is also worth noting that our
rehabilitation reforms will extend the provision of rehabilitation
services to offenders released from custodial sentences of
less than 12 months, who currently do not qualify for
statutory licence or rehabilitation provision. Proportionately more
women than men are serving short sentences, so they in particular will
benefit from this element of the

million funding via probation trusts to support 31 of these centres in
the current financial year. This £3.78 million has now been
embedded in the NOMS community budget for 2013-14, and has been
ring-fenced to enable probation trusts to commission the delivery of
enhanced services for female offenders. Probation trusts are planning a
range of new partnerships with the voluntary sector in the coming year,
including opening new women’s community services and the
delivery of a new bespoke training programme for women. This inevitably
means that some women’s services may find that they receive less
funding in the coming year. However, at this time of financial
constraint, the commitment to provide £3.78 million to trusts
for the provision of women’s services is a strong indication of
the priority the Government give to the needs of female
offenders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303266000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303266000054">A
further £300,000 is being invested in women’s services by
trusts, which I find very encouraging indeed. I am a strong advocate of
the women’s centre approach, which provides practical support
for women in addressing their many needs, whether it be housing,
domestic violence, substance misuse or a range of other issues. These
centres are located in the centre of our communities and provide a
positive, flexible environment to help vulnerable women sort out their
often troubled lives. When I visited the Minerva women’s centre
last year, I was very impressed by the number of women that I met who
had first come to the centre as clients, sometimes very reluctantly,
but then remained at the centre to support other women as mentors and
helpers. This is exactly the sort of benign circle that we want to
encourage.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1303266000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303266000055">I

committed to ensuring the provision of appropriate services that will
address the specific needs of female offenders, and that this is an

rehabilitation, we feel that Part 7 of Schedule 15 is neither necessary

my noble and learned friend Lord Woolf—sadly, he cannot be here

amendment sought to obtain much needed statutory protection of measures
to ensure that the distinct needs of women offenders were prioritised
and met. It was said to be unnecessary because it specifically
mentioned probation trusts and, because probation was under review, it
did not make sense to legislate on probation provision, and because the
Government were already committed to working on women’s
provision, the legislation was not needed. The genuinely interested
Committee threw out my noble and learned friend’s amendment,
denying other genuinely interested colleagues any opportunity of
considering it at Report. What a message such treatment sends to those

was the first occasion on which similar dismissal had been the fate of
proposals concerning the specific needs of women offenders, it could
perhaps be more easily understood. The point about probation is a
semantic quibble because, whatever the outcome of the review, someone
will be responsible for the provision of services to female offenders.
But the point about legislation is important, because the
amendment is an attempt to ensure that consistent and continuous action
is taken by successive Ministers, rather than a continuation of past
practice, which I can best characterise as being seven times bitten
and, understandably, eight times
shy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303266000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303266000060">The
strategic direction announced by the Minister includes sections on
enhanced provision in the community and transforming rehabilitation,
with at its heart an advisory board. In principle, I welcome strategic
direction, because a strategy is a single aim uniting the contributions
of all those concerned. But as this one contains nothing new and is
noticeably short on detail, I can best describe it as pretty thin wine.
While not against advisory boards per se, I am not happy that the
Minister should put so much hope in this one, because boards do not
provide leadership or take positive action, and positive action, not
yet more advice, is what is so badly needed.</hs_para>

became involved with the criminal justice system, I have been amazed
that Ministers seem so unwilling to look at facts when trying to reason
why their good intentions are not realised. If they worked in business,
a hospital, a school or local government, they would know that named
individuals are responsible and accountable for separate departments,
so why, unlike every other operational organisation throughout the
world as far as I can discover, do they tolerate continuous failure,
for which they can call no one to account, caused in large measure by
the almost complete absence of any named individual responsible and
accountable for each type of offender in the National Offender
Management Service, particularly women, a discrete group with distinct
characteristics and needs? If they looked, they would be struck
immediately by the marked difference between the consistency and
improvement in the high security prisons, under their own director,

children has been transformed by a Youth Justice Board under its own
responsible and accountable

dreadful track record explains why my noble and learned friend, I and

<?notus-xml column=909?>for making consistent improvement, we despair of progress being made and

intentioned, come and go. While responsible and accountable to
Parliament, they have countless other ministerial, parliamentary and
constituency tasks and simply do not have the required time to provide
24/7 oversight of any single part of their ministerial portfolio.
Oversight can be provided only by someone responsible and accountable
to them, aided by advisory boards or whatever. I challenge anyone to
disprove that the one common denominator behind the failure of every
previous good intention for improving the position of women is the lack
of anyone responsible and accountable to the Minister for implementing
it. I would hate to see this one, however thin, go the same way. That

for the Minister. First, why does he not accept the need to appoint a
named official to be responsible and accountable to Ministers for women
in the criminal justice system? I note that, on 3 October 2012, Sadiq
Khan MP, the shadow Justice Minister, announced that Labour would set
up a women’s justice board, bringing together central
government, local councils, police, probation and social services to
tackle female offending, modelled on the Youth Justice Board. When I
asked him about what appeared to be a damascene conversion of his party
line, bearing in mind how many of his predecessors had vetoed that idea
when put forward by the Prison Reform Trust and many others, including
me, he said that, coming in as an outsider, he had looked afresh at all
the evidence and that its need stood out. I welcome him warmly to the
club, as I hope to do the present ministerial team.</hs_para>

Minister tell the House why, without statutory provision, it should be
confident that what the Minister has outlined will come to pass when so
many previous but similar intentions have failed? Helen Grant, having
recognised the genuine interest of parliamentary colleagues in both
Houses and the importance of keeping people informed about what the
Government are doing for female offenders, says that she will consider
what more she should do, going forward, to communicate with
stakeholders and others with an interest in female offenders. I would
like to recommend one thing that she could do, which is to undertake
that either the Justice Minister or the Minister responsible for
women’s justice will make an annual statement to Parliament
about progress with the strategy, which will be debated on the Floor of
both Houses. Will the Minister give an undertaking that annual
statements will be made, or at least considered, and an announcement
about them made during the further passage of this Bill? I beg to

Corston:</Member></B> My Lords, I support Amendment 133A in
the name of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. He suggested that my
report had sunk without trace. Perhaps I may reassure him that I have
not. Having waited over a year from the day when the noble Lord, Lord
McNally, promised this House that we would have a strategy for women
offenders which would be published “quite shortly”, 
<?notus-xml column=910?>the statement released last week was acutely depressing. It was thin and
took us back to the days of the women’s offending
reduction programme. It is extraordinary that this can happen,
particularly as I know that the noble Lord, Lord McNally, and his
parliamentary colleague Helen Grant MP have been visiting
women’s centres up and down the country and must have got the

recognised the plight of women at risk of offending? It was reported in
the papers that the women’s prison population had gone down by
400 since the previous Government started implementing my
report. Given that the women’s prison population is, at any one
time, just under 5,000, that is a proportionate reduction that the
Minister might be quite proud of if it happened in the male estate. Why
has it happened? It has happened because of the focus on women at risk.
Magistrates’ courts up and down the country now do this work but
there is no reference to it whatever. Will the Government please stop
talking about payment by results? I have been in Parliament for 21
years and I have never known a Government that wanted payment without
results.</hs_para>

is being cut and they are finding it hard to cope. The £3.78
million, to which the noble Lord, Lord McNally, referred, is all well

correspondence I have had with Helen Grant, being given the job of
ensuring that that funding is spread. A smaller pot of money is being
spread further so centres like Anawim in Birmingham—I challenge
anyone visiting that centre not to be profoundly impressed with the
work it does with very troubled women—are finding it difficult

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to support the
amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham. I believe that what
happened in the Commons, the way in which this whole area was tossed
aside and not debated at all, was disgraceful. I believe that the very
least that the Government can do is to answer the three questions that
my noble friend has put to the Minister. I would lay the greatest
emphasis on having an annual report on progress that is made in the
whole of this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303269000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303269000002">I am
especially concerned about the differences in the treatment of men and
women for two reasons. First, there is a distinct difference in the
backgrounds of women who are in prison for very short sentences. As we
have heard, such sentences account for the vast majority of
women—and indeed men—in prison. As one example, 5% of the
prison population are women, and yet 31% of self-harmers in prison are
women. The Government should receive full marks for starting to
outline, at last, these plans, as we have begun to get a picture of
what we hope will happen in the future. I am very supportive of these
plans as there are so many women in prison who should not be there,
certainly not to serve short sentences as is currently the
case.</hs_para>

these women should not be in prison because of the effect that it is
having on their families. How many of those families will find
their own way into prison as a result of having had their
family broken up, having been taken into care or placed with relatives
and, above all, having lost that very particular relationship between
mother and child? I believe that that is the worst aspect of all. How
many facts are we given about the number of families who are repeatedly
in and out of prison in a continual spiral of offending?</hs_para>

Government with their plans, but please let us have a report on what is
happening, and let us have real progress. Quite apart from the women
concerned, I believe that we will find that this kind of treatment
could be as applicable to men in our prison service. We need a whole

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, I would be surprised if some Members of
your Lordships’ House were satisfied with a report as
infrequently as annually. The questions, rightly, will come quite often
to my noble friend, as they have done over the years. I know that this
is something that he holds close to his heart, as does Helen Grant. I
note that the document published on Friday—which I, too, thought
was shorter than expected—is headed <I>Strategic Objectives for

noble friend one question which follows on from what the noble Baroness

that in the strategy. The developing knowledge

something that we should take very seriously, and no doubt we will be
considering it in the Children and Families Bill. I hope that my noble
friend can reassure the House that the whole-system approach which is
referred to in the strategic objectives is a whole system that will
extend in all the ways we know it should, and not just to the narrow
punitive and personal rehabilitative aspects that we have mostly been

seems, has been implemented in full. In the light of the publication of

Government do not want to take this legislative opportunity to deal
more effectively with women who offend. To begin with, funding is not
ring-fenced for service provision delivered by women’s centres

funding cuts or even closure. The inclusion in the National Offender
Management Service’s <I>Commissioning Intentions for 2013-14</I>
of an intention that provision should take into account the
“specific needs” of women offenders falls far short of
any statutory guarantee of women-specific provision. There is evidence

statutory commitments in a Bill. It would be very easy to accept it and
go on just as before. Part of my problem with the interventions of the
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, is that he always seems to think that a
new structure or reporting method would solve these things. Like the
noble Lord, Lord Hurd, every women’s prison I have visited has
depressed me profoundly; and yes, if you ask my opinion, at least half
the women we have in our prisons should not be there. However, it is no
use the other side making pious observations now they are in
opposition. The fact is that they were in office for four years after

the fact that we are for the first time dealing with prisoners serving
sentences of less than 12 months. I know that the previous Government
tried that and then abandoned it. However, every time a Government try
to make progress with an advisory committee it should not just be
dismissed. I have been working for six months with Helen Grant and she

just pray that one day this penny will drop because I fear that Helen

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak to Amendments 1
and 3 in this group. These are probing amendments, but I want to start
by saying how much we deprecate the fact that we are having to debate
this significant and retrospective piece of legislation at this hour
and to complete all the stages before we draw stumps this
evening.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1303269000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303269000024">It
might be helpful if I set out from the start how we are approaching
these matters. We accept from Second Reading that, whatever our
fundamental concerns, the Bill will retrospectively make regulations
lawful that the court has thus far considered to be unlawful and that
notices that were inadequate are now to be treated as satisfactory.
What we are seeking to probe by these amendments is whether individuals
adversely affected by this will be in no worse a position as a result
of this Bill than they would have been had the regulations and notices
been lawful in the first place. This, in 
<?notus-xml column=918?>particular, requires focus on the reconsideration and appeal situations
so that we are clear how they are to
operate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303269000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303269000025">Where
individuals have been sanctioned and are not part of the stockpile,
they may have appealed already. Their appeal may have been stayed
because of the High Court decision, may have been successful or may
have been unsuccessful. Where such individuals have been successful in
their appeal, it is presumed that the position would stand. Can the
Minister please confirm this? Where appeals have been stayed, what is
the position? If the appeal was based on the unlawfulness of the
regulations or the notices—a defence that is no longer
available—are appellants now able to bring forward new reasons
that they thought unnecessary to explore before? This raises the
question of those who have not hitherto appealed a sanction. It is
understood that, under the rules, the time limit for an appeal is
generally one month from the date of the recent decision, but this can
be extended if the decision-maker does not object or if the First-tier
Tribunal extends the time limit. Has any specific guidance been given
to decision-makers on this matter or to those who have been
sanctioned?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303269000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303269000026">For
those cases that have been stockpiled and will now proceed to be
sanctioned, the key issue is how, in retrospect, the individual can now
be assured of availing themselves of good cause provisions, the
opportunities to mitigate and the hardship provisions. My noble friends
Lady Sherlock and Lady Hollis will develop these themes in subsequent
amendments, but it would be helpful if the Minister could set out for
us what consideration has been given to this issue to ensure that there
is fairness.</hs_para>

stockpile of cases is concerned—those for which no decision to
sanction has yet been made—it is understood that no sanctions
will be pursued when someone is now in work. Can the Minister please
expand on this? Does the individual need to be in full-time paid work
for the purposes of being ineligible for JSA or is there another test?
What if the individual has been in work since the failure to comply but
has fallen out of work again? As was raised at Second Reading, there
will be those whose employment is not very secure or whose hours,
particularly with the proliferation of zero-hours contracts, will
fluctuate. The point in time when a decision on sanctions for them will
be made could determine whether or not they end up being sanctioned.

again touched on at Second Reading, will the Minister say something

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, I support my noble friend in
his amendments. Timely and efficient appeals systems are always
necessary and in these circumstances they are essential. The social
security appeals system is under strain and that strain will be
intensified as a result of what claimants will now be experiencing.
What are those difficulties? The number of social security cases going
to tribunals in general were 418,000 in 2010-11, 70% higher than just
two years previously, while, as far as I can tell, this year’s
statistics are up a further 14% or so, and appeals against sanctions as
such are only a modest proportion of these.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1303269000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303269000031">Social security appeals
represent half of all tribunal cases. The tribunals are receiving
social security cases faster than they can clear them, so that although
half of all cases take 14 weeks or less, one-quarter take between three
and six months to be heard and 10% take between six months and a year,
so only half of those cases meet the key performance indicator, the
KPI, of 16 weeks laid down by the department. During that
time—that extra long waiting period already
experienced—claimants’ circumstances change, they lose
oral evidence based on memory and above all they are left without any
benefit, some of them for months, and suffer real hardship. Timeliness
and efficiency, therefore, are key.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1303269000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303269000032">We need the Government
to tell us what problems they will meet in unleashing the stockpile of
sanctions cases into a system already under strain, with the inevitable
appeals that will follow, and how they propose to resolve them. How
many cases are currently outstanding? Do the Government have the
capacity to increase sitting days beyond the 80,000 or so required at
the moment to deal with the full backlog? How long does the Minister
expect claimants to have to wait? How many, and what percentage, will
be over the three-month KPI
target?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303269000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303269000033">The
second issue is not about numbers but about verdicts and outcomes. Of
those cases going to appeal, some 40% overall are won by the claimant.
Former presidents’ reports on this are, frankly, an excoriating
indictment of the DWP decision-making process and their findings over
the years are confirmed by the recent November 2012 report analysing
appeals. The main reason why appellants win is that they produce
additional oral evidence not previously taken into account by DWP.
However, the reports and the research have noted that tribunal judges
were continually frustrated by the behaviour of decision-makers within
DWP. In the latest statistics, about one-third of local decisions on
sanctions were reconsidered by the decision-maker and, of those, half
were in favour of the claimant. Of those not accepted by the
decision-maker, just over one-third are going on to tribunal.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=920?><hs_para UID="1303269000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303269000034">Why are those tribunal
judges so continuously frustrated by decision-makers’ efforts
within DWP? First, we are told by tribunal judges that decision-makers
choose not to accept additional, usually oral, evidence without having
any good reason for refusing it. That is because they have often failed
properly to engage with the claimant. Something like 65% of all appeals
come into this category. Secondly, there is little evidence that
decision-makers reconsider cases at all. They were, the report said,
reluctant to do so and did not bother to explore any discrepancies in
evidence or to follow up requests for further
information.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1303269000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303269000035">Thirdly, decision-makers
did not weigh medical evidence at all appropriately, especially for
mental health claimants, nor did they seek further information when
dealing with a progressive condition. That applied to something like
15% of the appeals that went to tribunal. Most damning of all, they
often made different decisions from the tribunal decision-makers on the
basis of the same evidence presented to the tribunal, which meant that
decision-makers got it wrong, according to law, in 30% of the cases
lost by DWP. In other words, had the decision-makers within DWP done
their job properly, these reports suggest that DWP would either not
have had the appeal because the decision-maker would have rightly
reversed the original decision, or at appeal the DWP would have won
most of the appeals that it lost because the tribunals would have
accepted that all the appropriate evidence had been properly assessed.
That is a pretty searing judgment of the current system.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1303269000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303269000036">What are the
implications for those caught by this Bill? The problem is clearly
threefold. First, local offices are making flawed decisions, including
on sanctions, and that is before we get on to the disgraceful area of
targets. Secondly, decision-makers are not doing a proper job reviewing
those local office decisions and are endorsing flawed decisions that
they should have corrected. Thirdly, the tribunal service cannot keep
up with the increased number of appeals coming its way. Of course, this
will get far worse now that legal advice and support are withdrawn and,
as a result and as we shall argue later, tribunal cases will take twice
as long to
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303269000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303269000037">Will
the Minister reduce the pressure on tribunals and better support
claimants by requiring decision-makers to do a more conscientious
review of the original decisions? It is clear that at the moment too
many of them are not doing a professional
job—bluntly, they need to brought face to face with the
evidence. Are decision-makers informed of the tribunal’s
findings and is their performance reviewed when their
decisions are overturned by the tribunal? Could
that perhaps be a KPI? What guidance and additional training will be
made available to decision-makers to improve their
performance? If the Minister is going to review
any targets, could we please have a new performance indicator, a really
useful target that reduces the number of successful appeals
by claimants from the current 40% or so down to, say, 20% or even 15%?
That would really transform decision-makers’
behaviour.</hs_para>

for sanctioning claimants uncovered by the <I>Guardian</I>, many of
whom we can expect to appeal, thus increasing the backlog before 
<?notus-xml column=921?>eventually being overturned at appeal, as many of them will be, will the
Minister ensure that cases going to appeal are pre-reviewed and
re-reviewed by decision-makers to improve their own poor-quality
decision-making? Will he also ensure that the number of tribunal
sitting days is appropriately increased to meet the target of within 16
weeks, so that they are timely, and that—I am trespassing into a
following amendment—sufficient advice is given to claimants, as
my noble friend Lord Bach will argue, to reduce the number of
unsuccessful appeals, given the delays? I hope that the Minister will
be able to answer these questions and those of my noble friend tonight
and in the process perhaps allay our very real concern for these
claimants who are going to be caught up in an appeal system that is
increasingly flawed and
failing.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_25_PT_1/03D71E81702625C816AAA692E5D79D26F248365E" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 March 2013">Monday,

the stockpiled cases, including any appeals and

goes without saying that every claimant has the right of appeal. It

<?notus-xml column=925?>enforced? That is where the problem arises. At present any claimant who
has sanctions imposed can obtain legal advice as to an appeal, whether
the appeal is in the form of a review to the department or to the
First-tier Tribunal. If a claimant is eligible, they are, as we speak,
entitled to legal aid. Therefore, in reality they can get the advice
perhaps from a solicitor or, more probably, from a not-for-profit

advice is not expensive—about £150 for this sort of case.
It does not make the lawyers rich. It is quality advice. It often tells
the claimant that he or she has no chance in any review or appeal. On
the other hand, it may tell the claimant that he or she has a proper
legal appeal. Early advice of this sort stops people going to the
First-tier Tribunal. It does not encourage them to do so. The advice
does not extent to representation. What it does is give these citizens
some limited access to justice, which a mere right of appeal does not
do.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1303269000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#1303269000062">Of course,
in a week’s time on 1 April, legal aid will no longer be
available to a claimant in this kind of case however poor, disabled or
marginalised he or she may be. It has been taken out of scope. The
question arises: from where is the client who believes that he or she
may have an appeal to get advice? Law centres, CABs and other advice
centres rely on legal aid as a major part of their income. How will
they survive? Will it all be done pro bono by other lawyers? I would
argue it is not possible in the real world for that to happen. There is
not the expertise in this field of law or the time for busy lawyers to
do pro bono work to cover all these cases. All pro bono lawyers agree

Government’s more general assertion has been that welfare

complicated, easy to understand and is not really law at all. One only
has to state that point of view to know what rubbish it is. The
thousands of pages of legal textbooks, the comments of tribunal judges

concerned all claimants who face sanctions since the introduction of
the new regulations on 12 February this year, following the Appeal
Court judgment. However, there is a past and pressing problem for those
claimants whose cases have been put on one side as a result of a Court
of Appeal judgment. The decision to sanction those people will either
not be made, or it will have been made under what were ruled to be
unlawful regulations, their time for appeal not having run out by 12
February. In both cases, they would have a reasonable expectation of
knowing their fate some time ago. Any decision to sanction them would,
of course, have been subject to appeal. Of course, claimants are
entitled now to get legal advice and, if eligible, entitled to legal
aid for that advice. But in a week’s time, while still
theoretically they are entitled to legal advice for an appeal, they
will not be entitled to legal aid, which means in practice 
<?notus-xml column=926?>that many fewer than should will be able to get that advice. How can it
be just that those people are put into a worse position by a delay that
is absolutely no fault of their own but is, frankly, the responsibility

there was the other sort of case that came to tribunal, people who came

through without any advice, unaware of what it was that the tribunal
needed to know and what would count as relevant evidence. I recall one
man, Indian or Pakistani, who was there with his wife; his eyes never
left the floor, and he sat hunched over as he tried to explain in poor
English and a low, faltering voice, why he was appealing against a
refusal of DLA—and he could not. The superb chair, which we now
call a judge, spent nearly two hours trying compassionately to coax his
story and evidence out of him in some sort of order. It took more than

lessons may we draw from the situation in which there is no prior legal
help or support for advice? Social security decision-makers, as we
argued on the previous amendment, frequently fail to review decisions
properly. Unless the claimant is savvy enough to put his case in ways
that fit guidance on reconsideration, we end up with an unnecessary
tribunal case, and the tribunals handling such cases clear, as a
result, two or three cases a day instead of five or six. I plead with
the Minister to learn from this. I do not know whether he
has sat in on any social security tribunals, but he would quickly see
which claimants had had prior advice and which had not. Remove the
advice and the need does not go away; it is merely displaced to the
very much more expensive and time-consuming stage of the tribunal
itself. Instead of advice being given in advance, the whole untangling
of that mess has to be done by the tribunal judge in person. That seems

advice, which we are told we cannot afford, is not a luxury; in my
view, it is essential because social security is complex and most
claimants, by definition, are probably poorly educated, not especially
articulate, confused about what they are due and need help at the early
stages. They are aggrieved. However, as my noble friend Lord Bach said,
early advice may discourage people from pursuing unfunded and unfounded
cases. Legal advice also helps ensure greater consistency and a common
approach across regions. We are getting a lot of research evidence

therefore deeply worried about the situation of claimants under the
Bill who will not know what their rights are and whether the proposed
sanction is valid. In some cases, they may have been stalled for many
months. They do not have fresh evidence to bring to bear and can no
longer rely on their memory to give a coherent account of what happened
when. Did they have good cause? At the preliminary stage, legal or
welfare rights advisers can perhaps help them find out, track hospital
or school records, organise paperwork and explain to the claimant what
will happen, why he has lost his benefit and whether the case against
him is soundly based. If that welfare rights officer or the legal
advice is not there to do that, the tribunal judge will have to, as I
have seen with my own eyes. Can that individual stop the sanction? Is
it possible for him to comply? Jobcentre staff cannot or will not now
give that advice, especially given the evidence about targets.
Claimants need the supportive, friendly, neutral, professional, cheap
advice from outside the system. However, of course all this hinges on
whether the department wants people to get the right benefits and the
right outcome. Does

we have heard, it is currently possible for a claimant who meets the
eligibility criteria to get free legal advice and assistance to cover
preparatory work for a hearing. Legal aid may also be available for
higher tribunals and courts appeals on a point of law. However, from 1
April, all welfare benefits will be out of scope for legal aid. The
context for this Bill makes this all the more complicated because, as
we heard from the Minister, the law on sanctions has changed, so
claimants may struggle to work out what applies to their case. Further,
since there may often be significant delays between alleged breach and
appeal, claimants may also struggle to work out what good cause or
recompliance mean so long after the event, subjects to which we will
return on a later amendment. This brings me to my questions for the
Minister. First, will he clarify the position? If a claimant would have
been entitled to legal aid to help prepare his case had he appealed
within a month of a decision to sanction him, will he still be entitled
to legal aid on the same basis should he appeal after 1 April? If the
answer is yes, how will this happen? Who will provide the advice and
who will pay for it? If the answer is no, given that the Courts and
Tribunal Service is likely to be inundated with cases once the deferred
decisions pile is unleashed, what assessment have the Government done
of the likely delays and the consequent additional cost to the Courts
and Tribunal Service of having so many unadvised appellants arriving at
once?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032615000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#13032615000003">If

very least that the Government should do is provide a considered

to Amendment 2, the Secretary of State will, within a month of the Act

Minister to tell us before the Bill is passed. Will the Minister kindly
reflect on that and consider whether it is not an absolute disgrace

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, I may be to blame for moving off the
particular amendment. We are not having a Second Reading debate now: we
are dealing with a set of amendments. Amendment 2 seeks to ensure that
the Secretary of State will have to publish, within one month of the
Act coming into force, a report on whether claimants would have
sufficient access to legal advice and support including legal aid.
After 1 April, claimants who appeal to the First-tier Tribunal in
England and Wales on welfare benefit issues will not, as a matter of
course, be able to claim legal aid. This will be the position for all
claimants affected by the legislation where they have applied for legal
aid after 1 April. I hope that clarifies the position for the noble
Baroness, Lady Sherlock. There will not be entitlement to legal aid
after 1
April.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032615000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0003.htm#13032615000009">It is
important to note that the change in legal aid in no way
affects a claimant’s right to ask for reconsideration or appeal
to the tribunal. This change in legal aid eligibility will have a
limited impact on the claimants affected by sanction provisions in this
Bill. Official statistics show that, of the 170,000 claimants
sanctioned on ESE or MWA schemes, only around 5,000 appealed to the
First-tier Tribunal. Based on these data, we therefore estimate that
only between 1,500 and 2,000 claimants in the cases that have been
stockpiled—cases, not people—will eventually appeal to
the First-tier Tribunal. I also think that due to the nature of these
cases it is likely that the vast majority of cases brought before the
tribunal will be about a factual dispute where the claimant will need
to present their case in plain language and will not require legal
support. They will still be able to ask for support from, for example,
a citizens advice

a reputation that is well deserved over many years. One of
the jewels in the crown of the English legal system is that people,

applies to everyone, not just to the rich and powerful but applies,
sometimes to a limited extent, to those who are
at the bottom of the pile. That is the glory of the legal system. What
the Government do not seem to understand is that it does not matter
whether there are 20 cases, 500 cases, or 5,000 cases; these are fellow
citizens who should be entitled to the protection of the law
like everybody else. Is the Minister really saying that if the numbers

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Amendment 4 I will
speak also to Amendments 5A and 6. I look forward to hearing from my
noble friend Lady Lister on Amendment 5 and what appears to be a very
worthy extension of the scope of the promised review and report, which
we can also support. Amendment 4 relates generally to the
criteria for Clause 2, and Amendment 5A has been tabled with the strong
support of the shadow Secretary of State following press revelations of
the existence of sanctions targets and league tables operating in
London. It insists that the review specifically report on this
matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032624000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000002">Clause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T00:01:44"></hs_TimeCode>
2 brings some redemption to what is otherwise a deeply unsatisfactory
Bill. The clause exists because of the perseverance of my right
honourable friends Stephen Timms and Liam Byrne in another place and
gives us the hope that at least something positive may yet come from
this debacle. The clause requires the appointment of an independent
person to prepare a report on the operations relating to the imposition
of penalties. The sanctions which are in scope for the review are those
imposed for failures in the period from June 2011, when the defective
regulations were first introduced, until February 2013, when the Court
of Appeal judgment was delivered. We are told that the sanctions
involved amount to around 25% of all JSA sanctions, which is clearly a
minority of such sanctions. For those both delivered and withheld,
covering the ESE and MWA programme, this amounts to in excess of
300,000 sanctions, mostly relating to those assigned to the Work
Programme. The huge growth in the number of sanctions and the amounts
involved—on average some £600 for ESE sanctions and
£800 for MWA sanctions—are real causes for concern.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T00:04:35"></hs_TimeCode> are
suggestions that the growth of sanctions is a significant cause of the
proliferation of food
banks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032624000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000003">Recent<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
revelations about targets and league tables are deeply worrying and
reinforce concerns that the sanctions regime is being used to control
benefit expenditure rather than for its proper purpose of supporting
conditionality and changing behaviour. Ministerial denials will cut no
ice until these matters have been fully and speedily investigated. We
should be appalled if the reports of the suggested behaviour are true,
as it demonstrates not only that a climate of fear is being created
within jobcentres but that staff are being actively encouraged to refer
customers for sanction, especially to fine customers that they can
claim are not fully available for work if they make mention of looking
after a grandparent or having informal arrangements sharing custody of
children. Jobcentre Plus is supposed to support vulnerable people not
try to trip them up on
technicalities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032624000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000004">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T00:04:35"></hs_TimeCode>

around appeals on reconsiderations subject to any comparison, either 
<?notus-xml column=934?>intra a Jobcentre Plus area or between areas? Are the data broken down
into individual decision-makers and matched against appeal performance?
Do these form part of any discussion at appraisal time for individuals?

limited just to those sanctions identified above? Of course, a

which is why we have particularised, in Amendment 4, specific questions
posed by the right honourable Stephen Timms in another place. We have
added to the list the important matter which my noble friend Lady
Lister spoke to at Second Reading concerning the public sector equality
duty. I am sure that my noble friend will pick up that issue shortly
and expand on her telling intervention that the Government know that
they are treading on thin ice on this matter. It is too late for this
legislation to be able to benefit from the scrutiny of the JCHR, which
makes it imperative that it is covered by the
review.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13032624000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000006">The
items included on the list are for the most part self-explanatory and
have been discussed numerous times before. However, now is the time to
have an independent assessment of what is actually happening in
practice. These include how penalties are being applied to those with a
mental health condition, or rather a fluctuating health conditions,
which has been a longstanding concern under this Government and, to be
fair, under the previous one as well. As we need to know how in
practice the sanction and hardship provisions are really affecting
people’s ability to survive, it is important that the review and
report are thorough and that sufficient time is available to do the job
effectively. However, this should not preclude an interim report, which
is what Amendment 6 suggests.</hs_para>

is fast-track legislation which we now have very limited time to
consider further. The independent review was an important consideration
for us in our approach to this Bill and we need to nail this down as
tightly as possible tonight. Paragraphs (a) to (l) of the amendment
must be deliverable, and if the Government are approaching this in a
spirit of co-operation it really should not present them with a
problem. Will the Minister commit now to these being included in the

all, however, we need to be certain that we get to the bottom of the
alleged existence of targets and league tables, which is why Amendment
5A is essential. If the Government are committed to their mantra of low

to Amendment 5 as well as in support of Amendment 4, moved by my noble

behind it is that the sanctions in scope of the review established in

we are to understand how the sanctions regime is working, the review
needs to set the narrower group of sanctions in scope of the Bill into
the wider context of the operation of sanctions more generally. I have
tried to make sense of the sanctions statistics, and it seems that
there has been a massive increase since March 2010 in the number of
fixed-length sanctions applied in relation to work-related programmes,
and a smaller increase in other varied-length sanctions, albeit in both
cases with some month to month
fluctuations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032624000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000011">The

she could not afford not to, but her two little girls were very

made to me that in assessing the overall impact of sanctions, we need

but where they have been threatened, sometimes inappropriately; in
other words, when claimants have been led to believe that failing to do
something is a sanctionable offence when it is not.</hs_para>

we debated the Universal Credit Regulations my noble friend Lady Hollis

previously. I asked the Minister why hardship payments will now be
recoverable, thereby potentially causing further hardship, and how
claimants were going to be expected to prove that they had ceased to
incur expenditure not deemed to be on essential and basic needs by the
department, as they will now be required to do. In his helpful letter
to my noble friend Lord McKenzie, in which he responded to questions he
had been unable to answer in the debate, the Minister answered neither
of those questions so I would be grateful if he could do so now. It is

need for a review in this amendment I would add the question of the
costs, which have been calculated as a maximum of £130 million.
At the risk of being pedantic at this time of night—and I
apologise to the House—I refer the Minister to page 6 of the
impact assessment and Annexe A on the methodology of the calculation.
Paragraph 18 describes the total value of the money allegedly at stake
in this Bill. Frankly, I cannot understand it, but that may just be the
hour of the morning. It states that the total value equals the number
of sanctions multiplied by the number of weeks, although, in passing, I
have to say that sanctions are variable in weeks—they are not
all fixed-week sanctions, so I do not know quite how you can multiply
by a number of weeks when they vary. That is multiplied by the
percentage of cases of under-25s multiplied by the rate for under-25s
and the percentage of cases of over-25s multiplied by the rate for
over-25s. However, the final clause puzzles me, because that total
value
is,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13032624000141" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000141">“multiplied

have a multiplier multiplied by a reduction. Either my arithmetic is
not good, which it is not, or the language in that paragraph is wrong.
If the language in that paragraph is wrong, I would like to be told,
because that is what we are being invited to consider as the potential
cost to the taxpayer as a result of these changes. If the impact
assessment has not got the methodology of the calculation correct, it
would be good to know.</hs_parafo>

recompliance. My experience in the Wise Group is that although many of
these sanctions are originally set at, say, 26 weeks, the participant
in the programme gets the message that they are going to lose out
rather quickly and they come back into compliance. They are therefore
reduced from a 26-week penalty to a four-week penalty as a matter of
course. I do not know to what extent that is factored into the
calculation of the total value. There are a number of methodological
problems that I do not understand. One of the things that this report
should do—I am not suggesting for a moment that we need answers
to all these things this evening—is to look carefully at exactly
what the total amount at stake in this Bill is. We look forward to
getting that confirmed one way or the other.</hs_para>

that the Work Programme was introduced with indecent haste. The
flexible New Deal programme was in the middle of its
operation and in 2010, in a very short space of time, everything was
changed. I understand the need to take away everything that went
before, but everyone I now talk to tells me that the loss of
corporate knowledge is a difficulty in working with the department. A
lot of serious and expert people are no longer in the
positions that they had. Bringing this programme in so early
and losing such a lot of corporate knowledge over a short space of time
is bound to lead to symptoms and consequences of this
kind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032624000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000037">Part of
the problem generated by these sanctions is that the notices that are
given to participants in these programmes are often handled not by
prime contractors but by subcontractors. I do not believe that some of
them are authorised by the Secretary of State as they should be under
the Jobseekers Act 1995, which is part of the reason why some of these
notices are not detailed and informative. Therefore, it does not
surprise me that the court took the view that it did. That is something
that this review should be looking at as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032624000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000038">Finally,
one thing that I am clear about from my Wise Group experience is that a
lot of participants in these courses do not appeal against sanctions
because they cannot do without the benefit for the duration of the
pending appeal—it is a serious loss of money to them. I hope
that this will be investigated in the review, but we really need to
look at whether the sanctions are being properly scrutinised in terms
of the numbers who go to appeal. I think that people just throw in
their hand because they cannot afford to do anything else.</hs_para>

a lot of important work to be done. I hope that the review will be
serious in undertaking that work and making the results and conclusions

regrettable that loose drafting of an internal e-mail suggested
otherwise. If noble Lords look at sanctions, there is no clear trend in
the proportion of the caseload who receives them. Prior to 2007, the

the staff in local offices believe, because they are told by their
managers, that they have to increase the number of sanctions. In the
e-mail, the manager of the particular jobcentre was criticised and told
that she would be subject to first-stage disciplinary hearings because
that office was something like 93rd out of 101 in sanction production;

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, let me make very clear the difference
between having targets, having business or management information, and
doing something with 
<?notus-xml column=942?>that information. Clearly, you collect this data not just to answer
parliamentary questions but to run the business. It is used to look at
where there are outliers and peculiarities, and what the norms are.
When a particular jobcentre may be well outside the norm on either
side, you might want to ask it why that was the case. Was it
justifiable, and what were the dynamics of that? In some cases you are
clearly looking at particular parts of the operation that are not
operating in line with the norms. That is not having a target culture.
A target culture—as the noble Lords opposite will know, because
they were running one in many parts of the public services—is
where you incentivise and drive performance based on particular
targets. We do not do that. We do not have targets. We do, however,
have management information and, as I say, we need to understand why
outliers

Clearly, we have internal management information. It is vital that we
keep it, and we publish a lot of it. We need to understand why some
areas, some jobcentres, have higher rates than others and why some have
lower rates. Some may have very good reasons for having lower or higher
rates, while others may not. We therefore need this information to
correct the anomalies, and that is normal business practice. It may be
that in particular cases a jobcentre manager is told, “You are
running very high or very low figures, and you cannot justify the
reason for that, so you need to get more into line”. It may
happen. I have not got the particular

re-emphasise that we do not have targets, we have management
information. I may not have convinced noble Lords on the other side,
but they should be very familiar with running targets because that is
how they tried to run the economy. We do not run targets because they
create perverse behaviours. We collect information in this area, not
least because it is required for public purposes. Furthermore, we need
to run a business and we need to understand what different areas are

when I am not familiar with the particular example. It may have been a
strategy. As I said, there is a general strategy to prevent
non-compliance by using the device of asking people to come in on
different days. Sometimes people are asked to come in on every day of
the week. The example I am thinking of is the five workings days, but I
have seen examples of that. I saw that example under the previous
Government to be honest. I do not know why noble Lords opposite are
looking aghast as this was absolutely standard procedure under the
previous Government and nothing has changed. It was standard procedure
and has been maintained because it works in areas where we are

over 50,000 reconsiderations, with claimants being successful in just
over half of them. Following this there were about 5,000 appeals to the

linked Amendment 6, the purpose of which is to ensure that there is an

as the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, that the review is expedited and we
will endeavour to complete it as quickly as possible. However, it may
help if I set out why an interim report would be unhelpful
in providing a complete picture. A claimant who has a
sanction imposed on them has 13 months to bring an appeal against that
sanction, so by imposing a six-month deadline for an interim report we
would miss those appeals made at a later point. That could then give a
misleading view of the overall picture in a way that could
be unhelpful. As I said earlier, we are committed to
producing a report as soon as is reasonably practicable and it would be
far better to wait for the full annual report. I hope that the noble

think we would all agree is a very troublesome picture of
what is happening on the ground in too many instances. She
specifically asked about whether the review would receive evidence from
outside bodies, and I do not think that the Minister has addressed that
point. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, too, for his
support, at least in spirit. I believe that he is absolutely
right that the projected cost of £130
million is excessive. Of course, from the
Government’s point of view, the higher that figure,
the greater the weight given to the opportunity of retrospective
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T00:50:46"></hs_TimeCode>. But
I think that the noble Lord’s analysis is

for the Government to answer about how the sanction system will work in

to the question of recompliance raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood
of Kirkhope. The Jobseeker’s Allowance (Employment, Skills and
Enterprise) Regulations 2011—the regulations that were found to
be at fault by the Court of Appeal—explain the consequences of
failure to participate in the scheme covered by those provisions.
Regulations 8(4) to 8(6) provide that a claimant who fails to
participate in an activity may face a loss or reduction of benefit for
a period of two, four or 26 weeks. Regulation 8(7) provides that if
someone has been sanctioned for 26 weeks but has recomplied,
the period for which benefit is stopped is reduced to four
weeks—a point 
<?notus-xml column=949?>explained by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. Recompliance is defined in
Regulation 8(8), which refers to the claimant as “C”. It

come the questions, and I apologise that they are not very exciting.
Can the Minister tell the Committee how this will work some months
after the event? Let us say that a claimant with a fluctuating health
problem has failed to turn up for a training course imposed as part of
skills conditionality and has been sanctioned for 26 weeks. The course
ended last September. Had he been sanctioned at once, he could perhaps
have attended the remaining days of the course and had the sanction
reduced from 26 weeks to four weeks. Can the Minister explain how that
person could now show compliance? It is obviously too late for him to
recomply under Regulation 8(8)(a), but perhaps he could recomply under
sub-paragraph (b). If so, can the Minister explain how that will work?
If the person has been given any subsequent direction and has complied
with it in any way at all, will that count as recompliance; does the
recompliance have to be specific to the particular scheme that he was
put on; or does it have to be specific to the requirement made of him
at the time—that is, that training
course<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T01:08:44"></hs_TimeCode>?
Presumably, the Government would want to make sure that this person was
not treated any less fairly than he would have been had the
Government’s regulations and notices not been found to be
unlawful, but how would the Minister do that? If he is not in a
position to explain to the Committee in detail now, I would press him
to accept the amendment, which simply asks that he issues guidance
explaining to jobcentre staff how they should act in order to put the
claimant in the position in which they would have been but for the
delay caused by the failure of the regulations to be accepted by the
Court of Appeal as
lawful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T01:09:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032624000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000081">My second question
relates to the question of good cause, which the Minister referred to
at an earlier stage. If a claimant fails to participate in the scheme,
they are notified by the DWP and will be sanctioned unless they show
what is known as “good cause” for their failure to
participate within five working days.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032624000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000082">Let me give another
example. I am interested in exploring how good cause works in this
time-delayed world. Let us imagine a single mother who was due to
attend a course but missed the registration on the first morning
because her 13 year-old son was up all night vomiting and she could not
take him to school. She could not leave a sick 13 year-old at home
alone the next day, so she phoned up the course and explained what had
happened and that she would not be in that day. She talked to the
receptionist who took a message and said that it would be passed on.
The message was not passed on and when she turned up the next day she
was told that she could not join the course because she failed to be
there for the start. I should say that I have heard of real cases where
precisely these things have 
<?notus-xml column=950?>taken place, and I am sure that the Minister has as well. Can the
Minister help us to understand what would happen in that
circumstance?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032624000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000083">I
understood from what the Minister said early on that that lone parent
would have been written to at the time that this alleged breach took
place, asking if she had any good cause for failing to turn up for the
course. So what happened then? Presumably the decision-maker did not
make a decision at that stage, so perhaps this would be sat on from
that point, say the previous September, until it got around to being
processed from the pile of deferred decisions. Would she at this stage
have to explain more about what happened? For example, if there were
not enough information in the explanation, did the decision-maker go
back at the point at which this happened last September to say,
“Tell me more”, or will that happen, say, the following
April or May? If so, will she be expected to recall precisely what
happened with this child’s bout of sickness last September, when
it is now potentially April or May? Will she be asked for evidence for
a bout of sickness that may not have required a medical appointment if
the child was recovered within 24 hours? If she did give all the
information but she was then deemed not to have good cause, presumably
she could now appeal. If so, can the Minister explain to the Committee
how the normal standards of evidence will be relaxed, if at all, given
the serious time delay, to deal with the evidential problems and the
possible recall problems that come with
that?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032624000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000084">Finally,
can the Minister explain which set of regulations will apply to someone
who committed the alleged breach under the old sanctions regime? Will
he or she be sanctioned using the provisions that applied at the time
of the alleged failing, because of course the ability to reduce the
sanction by recomplying has since disappeared? Can the Minister
reassure us that in fact someone will be able to reduce a sanction
period by recompliance even if such an option no longer exists under
the current
regulations?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032624000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000085">I
apologise for having to go into such detail at this stage, but I did
not choose to be conducting a Committee stage at quarter past one in
the morning. I do think, if we are going to be asked to fast-track a
Bill of this complexity and importance, that it is very important that

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to support my
noble friend by saying that I am mortified about the additional numbers
on the other side as the result of our strenuous debate. I thought that
we might have persuaded a few more to
abstain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032624000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000088">I
hope<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T01:13:02"></hs_TimeCode> that the
Minister can agree to this amendment. There are three broad reasons why
we need new guidance and clarity on the sanctions regime: the issue of
targets/norms, good cause and compliance. The Joseph Rowntree 
<?notus-xml column=951?>research that came out in December 2010 shows that claimants have a low
level of awareness of sanctions and that the more disadvantaged they
are, the higher the risk of sanctions and the less knowledge they have
about them. This applies to young claimants, those with a disability,
those with a poor education, those with large families and those from
an ethnic minority. The research shows that they are not out to flout
the system but that they have poor information or non-intentional
behaviour such as forgetfulness. In that context, I want us to support
my noble friend’s
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032624000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000089">I
turn first to the issue of targets. The Minister was at some pains to
explain to us earlier that “targets” is a relevant word
only where you are rewarding behaviour, but when you are punishing it,
that is a “norm”. We know that if you exceed, you get a
target, and that if you underachieve, that is a norm. It is clear that
targets or norms, whatever we want to call them, are the enemy of
mitigation. Using them to allow the Secretary of State to claim clean
hands while the staff do the dirty work under pressure from above is
completely unacceptable. We need clear evidence, guidance and clarity
from the Minister on the sanctions regime to ensure that targets do not
stand in the way of mitigation. If people are allowed to mitigate and
sanctions numbers therefore reduce, so will the targets, and staff will
obviously have an incentive to fail to ensure that claimants follow
good procedure and appropriate behaviour because they themselves face
disciplinary action. That is a moral, or immoral, position, into which
they should not be put.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032624000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000090">Secondly, we need this
guidance to ensure that claimants
are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T01:15:29"></hs_TimeCode> aware that
they may be able to mitigate sanctions by establishing good cause. My
noble friend gave the example of the lone parent unable to attend an
interview. Every parent in this House has had a child who has been sick
and they may have missed an interview as a result. There is no
doctor’s evidence because, by the next day, the child is well.
Certainly that happened to me on numerous occasions. However, in this
new, suspicious, look-for-any-benefit-cutting-excuse, hunt-them-down
culture, of course we all now assume that any lone parent will keep her
child at home and away from school simply to avoid an inconvenient
interview. She says that the child was poorly, but why believe her? As
she can provide no evidence, the office has got her and another tick is
put on the whiteboard.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032624000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000091">The third reason for
needing guidance on mitigation is that, as the courts have indicated,
claimants need to know and have a right to know how they may end their
sanction by complying with jobcentre requirements. This issue marks the
crucial line as to whether we are using sanctions to reduce the benefit
bill or whether we are using them to change behaviour. If it is the
first, giving little information or hope for people to find their way
back into the system, then the Minister risks creating a growing
underclass without income, without much hope and without any help. But
people, as Carlyle pointed out 150 years ago, will not starve quietly.
Some may have families to help them, and they will be the relatively
lucky ones. Some may beg, while others will cross the line into
thieving, drug selling and semi-criminal behaviour. This is what the
Rowntree trust warns us of. They will come to regard 
<?notus-xml column=952?>social security laws, in so far as they understand them, and
increasingly other laws, as not applicable to them. We will all then
pay a high price. If it is the second—that instead of simply
trying to cut the benefit bill on any hook we can find, we want people
to change their behaviour and sanctions are part of the tough love
regime, as I believe they should be—then we absolutely must
encourage people to end sanctions by complying with what they are
expected to do. When they do so, we should rejoice, even though it
means fewer ticks on the whiteboard of targets to be met.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032624000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-0004.htm#13032624000092">Research evidence shows
up that up to two-thirds of those sanctioned do not know the whys or
wherefores, or what they can do about it. The Minister, whose integrity
we totally respect, accepted at Second Reading that that was indeed the
case and that therefore the issue of sanctions had to be revisited. If
the issue has to be revisited, he should now accept my noble
friend’s amendment, because it amplifies what he himself has
already agreed. Mitigation means ending the culture of targets and,
incidentally, protecting any whistleblowers in the process. It means
ensuring that people have the help that they need to claim good cause
where that exists and it ensures mitigation so that claimants will know
how they can end the sanction by conforming to benefit
requirements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T01:19:00"></hs_TimeCode>. I
hope that all in this Committee agree on these three goals. In which
case, I hope that the Minister will accept the
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T01:19:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Secretary of State to issue guidance on the way in which claimants can
mitigate any penalty imposed under the ESE or MWA regulations after the
Act comes into force, is unnecessary, as this information is provided
to claimants as a matter of standard practice. When a claimant is
issued with a benefit sanction, they are as a matter of course sent a

turn to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, on
recompliance. If a claimant has been issued with a 26-week sanction but
has complied in the intervening period, they will be served with a
four-week sanction. Recompliance is not particular to any scheme and
can include participation in any other 
<?notus-xml column=953?>scheme. Of course, the sanctions regime has changed, so if the failure
to participate was before 22 October last year, the old regime, which
includes the re-engagement, applies. However, if the failure to
participate is after 22 October, the current sanctions regime, which
has no engagement and which builds up, will apply. That goes on the
time of the failure to participate.</hs_para>

concerned about the time between the failure and the sanction being
imposed on the stockpiled cases. I am sorry that I have not
yet found a better word than stockpiled but it is for cases

that information takes place immediately on the failure. They receive a
letter and need to provide good cause at that point. Clearly, where
there is a problem and there needs to be amplification, and there is a
problem of information or evidence, the decision-maker will have to
take that into account in the normal way, given that there is a gap and
it is a justifiable

Sherlock:</Member></B> I am not trying to be pedantic, although I
confess that it is a hobby. The reason it matters in this case is that
normally, if I were sanctioned for not participating in a course, the
obvious way to comply is to start going to the course. As the course 
<?notus-xml column=954?>has long since finished, there are all kinds of unrelated things that
may have happened in between then and now, which would not be the
obvious way for me to re-comply with a direction on something that has
long since ceased. Therefore, the fact that these things could count
does not necessarily mean that they will. The reason that I wanted
guidance was precisely to make clear to jobcentre staff that in these
circumstances they should interpret any form of compliance as being
enough. I encourage the noble Lord to say that on the

recently the Government announced that  they would make

prosthetics. We are also improving rehabilitation services across the
country for service personnel and veterans who are amputees. We are
putting in place support and help for those who have suffered serious

three key features. First, AFIP will provide ongoing financial support
for the most severely injured. They will not have to be assessed or
reassessed to access these payments. Secondly, this will simplify and
streamline the support that service and ex-service personnel receive.
It means that additional support can be offered based on an assessment
already performed under the Armed Forces Compensation 
<?notus-xml column=190?>Scheme. Thirdly, all recipients will receive £134.40 per week,
which will be tax-free and not means tested. PIP will also be tax-free

the order, it may be helpful if I provide some background to the new
payment. In July 2012, the Prime Minister announced that the Government
would simplify and enhance the financial support system for members of
the Armed Forces who have been seriously injured, as part of the
measures to uphold the Armed Forces covenant. Since that time, my
department has been working closely with the Department for Work and
Pensions to consider how such support could be designed. This close
co-operation resulted in the design of AFIP.</hs_para>

stages of AFIP, we sought feedback from ex-service organisations and
charities via the Central Advisory Committee on Pensions and
Compensation. This was to ensure that we had input from those who
represent in-service and ex-service families and the bereaved. Those
whom we contacted included the Royal British Legion, the War
Widows’ Association, the British Limbless Ex-Servicemen’s
Association and Combat Stress, as well as service members. The feedback

benefit and the additional access to benefits that will accompany it?
All service and ex-service personnel seriously injured since 6 April
2005 will be eligible. To clarify, the “seriously
injured” are defined as those awarded a guaranteed income
payment of 50% or more under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme. It
is important to note that AFIP will cover those with both permanent
physical and mental injuries caused by service. It is the level of AFCS
award that provides eligibility for AFIP. No additional assessment is
undertaken and no further reassessment is required. This will provide
ongoing financial security for the most severely injured. All those
eligible will receive a flat-rate, ongoing payment of £134.40
per week. This will be tax-free and will not be means tested. AFIP is
to be introduced on 8 April this year. Seriously injured service and
ex-service personnel who claim AFIP cannot also claim other disability
benefits from the Department for Work and Pensions, including
disability living allowance, personal independence payment and
attendance allowance, no two of which can be claimed at the same
time.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032513000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032513000009">Other
disability cost benefits, such as personal independence payment and
disability living allowance, are used to provide access to a number of
other benefits, schemes and services that are offered by other
government departments, devolved Administrations and local authorities.
These are often referred to in this context as passports. To ensure
that AFIP recipients also have access to these additional benefits, we
are bringing forward two packages of consequential amendments. The
majority of these consequential amendments are to secondary legislation
and so will form a package of regulations that was laid on
18 March this year. As for PIP, these included Motability,
jobseeker’s allowance, legal aid, NHS costs, working tax credit,
child tax credit, housing benefit and the council tax reduction
scheme.</hs_para>

access to three important passports, we are required to amend three
other parts of primary legislation. That is what we are here to debate
today. These minor but important legislative changes are in respect of
carer’s allowance, Christmas bonus and the seatbelt exemption
for medical reasons. The legislative change in respect of
carer’s allowance will ensure that those who provide valuable
support to seriously injured members of the Armed Forces in receipt of
AFIP have access to DWP’s carer’s allowance, which will
be £59.75 from April 2013. This change will specifically make
provision for those who devote their lives to supporting our seriously
injured people, providing some financial support for doing so. It is
only right that a person caring for an AFIP recipient should have
access to carer’s
allowance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032513000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032513000011">As
for the Christmas bonus, these provisions will ensure that all
recipients of AFIP automatically qualify for the tax-free, lump sum
Christmas bonus, which is paid annually by the Department for Work and
Pensions. In cases where the injured serviceperson requires, on medical
grounds, an exemption from wearing a seatbelt, the individual must hold
a valid certificate of exemption from compulsory seatbelt wearing. Only
a medical practitioner may issue this certificate. This amendment will
enable the medical practitioner to seek reimbursement from the
Department for Transport for the cost of medical assessment that is
required in these cases. As I have set out today, these three minor,
but important, new provisions are designed to ensure that our most
seriously injured service and ex-service personnel are able to access
the additional benefits and schemes that they
deserve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032513000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032513000012">AFIP
is another example of the Government’s commitment to uphold the
Armed Forces covenant and deliver tangible benefits for members of the
Armed Forces and veterans. AFIP will provide ongoing financial support
for the most severely injured service and ex-service personnel on the
basis of their Armed Forces Compensation Scheme award without
assessment or reassessment. Furthermore, AFIP will provide them with
passports to additional benefit schemes and services that are offered
by other government departments, devolved Administrations and local
authorities. The Government will track the progress of the AFIP and

the order was discussed in the other place earlier this month, the
Minister of State, Mr Mark Francois, said that at the initial design
stages of the Armed Forces independence payment, the Government sought
feedback from ex-service organisations and charities via the Central
Advisory Committee on Pensions and Compensation. He went on to say that
the feedback received was valuable and helped to inform the final
design of the AFIP. However, paragraph 8 of the Explanatory Memorandum,
which covers the consultation outcomes section, indicates a degree of
division among the key ex-service organisations. It states that, while
the organisations recommended change to only the eligibility criteria,
they,</hs_para>

There is a level of agreement flowing among us today from which I will
not demur greatly. The only real question that I have is how

as the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, said, a little more elucidation on the
disagreement among the veterans and those with an interest in the order
would probably help the House and all those outside. Although they come
together to speak with one voice, they come from different angles and
have a different approach. It would probably be beneficial for
everybody who is interested in the covenant if we could have an

avoiding rapid reductions to tariff levels, which can create market
uncertainty and instability, neither of which will help us to achieve
the goals that I have just outlined. We have learnt lessons from the
feed-in tariff scheme in developing this current mechanism. It
introduces flexible controls which will provide certainty to investors

the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme Regulations 2011. They will
implement the outcome of a consultation, published last July, which
sought views on the best way to control spending under the scheme until
March 2015. The consultation attracted 100 responses from a wide range
of stakeholders. The results are set out in the government response
published on 27 February. More than 70% of respondents supported the
proposed degression mechanism. The feedback on the design of the
proposed degression has resulted in adjustments to the proposals that
were set out, although the broad principles remain the

regulations build on the foundations laid down for controlling spending
introduced under the feed-in tariffs scheme, following the
consultations that took place on that scheme in 2012. The framework for
financial control of the renewable heat incentive scheme will therefore
also be based on a system of degression. Degression is not a new word:
it is used in economics to define a system which gradually reduces, by
stages, a rate or specified sum. A system that sets out clearly how and
when tariff levels may be reduced, and by how much, will undoubtedly
provide greater certainty to the industry—and certainty is what
industry tells us that it
wants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032513000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032513000038">Let us
also not underestimate the current level of public interest in how
taxpayers’ money is spent. More than ever, we need to constrain
spending within budgetary limits, and the regulations aim to do that.
Simply put, degression will reduce existing tariff levels if uptake of
renewable heat technologies is greater than we require to meet our
renewables target. They will help to safeguard against the possibility
of overspend and against the detrimental impact on the supply chain of
a reduced budget next year that would be caused if we spent more than
expected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032513000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032513000039">Last
July, the Government introduced an interim, or stand-by, mechanism of
budget control for the RHI while we developed a longer-term approach.
Under the interim mechanism, the scheme would have been suspended had
spending levels reached 97% of the budget limit, which in real terms
meant if we had forecast spending to reach £67.9 million in
2012-13, against a budget of £70 million. The interim mechanism
would therefore have temporarily closed the scheme’s doors to
potential investors.</hs_para>

hands and accept that the regulations are not at first glance simple to
understand. If I may, I will therefore attempt to summarise the main
features of the degression scheme. At its simplest, degression will
mean that tariffs available to new applicants may be gradually reduced,
but only if uptake of the various technologies supported under the RHI
is greater than has been forecast. This will be done by monitoring
uptake on a quarterly basis against a series of expenditure limits,
listed in the schedule to the regulations, to which I will refer as
triggers. The reason why I use this term is that if those limits are
hit, they will trigger a fixed reduction to tariff levels. Monthly
updates on progress towards all triggers will be published online so
that stakeholders can readily access them, and one month’s
notice will be given before any reductions are made to the tariffs for
new applicants.</hs_para>

degression of which noble Lords should be aware are as follows. Those
who are already in receipt of RHI support will not be affected by any
future reduction to the tariff levels taking place as a result of
degression. Applicants to the RHI scheme will receive existing, that is
non-degressed, tariffs, if the date of accreditation for their
installation, or date of registration for a biomethane producer, is
before any new tariffs came into effect for the full 20
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032513000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032513000043">The
system includes a rule which means that degression will not be
activated for a particular quarter—so tariffs will not be
reduced—if total expenditure in any quarter is estimated to be
equal to or lower than 50% of what we expected it to be at that point.
In that way, the Government intend to avoid reducing tariff levels if
only a few technologies are performing well and contributing towards
heat targets. Where total expenditure is more than 50%, the regulations
prescribe the assessment that government must make to determine whether
degression has been activated, and whether any tariffs should be
reduced and by how
much<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:04:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13032513000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032513000101">4

total trigger ensures that overall spending levels for the non-domestic
scheme are protected. Fixed annual budgets, which cannot be exceeded,
have already been set for the four years of this spending review
period. The total trigger has been set based on the combined estimated
uptake of all of the technologies supported by the non-domestic RHI
scheme. It is the estimated cost of support needed for that
part of the scheme’s contribution to the heat portion of the
Government’s 2020 renewables target as set by the renewables
directive. Monitoring uptake will take place on a quarterly basis, and
the annual total trigger has been split into quarterly amounts which
are shown in the schedule to these

reason for having separate technology-specific triggers is to prevent
one technology dominating  the RHI market. If there were only a
total trigger in place, market forces would ultimately determine which
technology deployed well, which could easily force out 
<?notus-xml column=197?>technologies which have a role to play in the UK in the longer term. The
Government wish to encourage uptake across all the technologies
supported by the scheme, hence the need for technology triggers. Once
again, these triggers, which are based on projected market uptake, have
also been split into quarterly amounts as shown in the schedule to the
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032513000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032513000047">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>
tariff triggers—tariffs are for each technology and, in some
cases, different sizes of the same technology—are based on the
deployment levels that we were expecting when the scheme was launched,
but have been increased by a proportionate amount above these levels.
The Government’s intention is to build greater flexibility into
the system, and this approach recognises that what happens in practice
may differ from projections. This flexibility is possible because we
also have the total trigger. The precise level of scaling for tariff
triggers depends on expected levels of uptake. For most of the
technologies where forecasts indicate good levels of potential uptake,
triggers have been at levels that are 50% higher than these.
Conversely, where uptake forecasts are low, triggers have been set at
5% of the value of the total trigger to ensure plenty of scope for
deployment to increase without triggering degression.</hs_para>

is vital that we avoid overreduction of tariffs, as this could easily
undermine the renewable heat market. The level of reductions to
individual tariffs will commence at a rate of 5% initially if the
triggers are hit. However, the regulations allow reductions to increase
by up to 20%. These higher levels would be needed only if any earlier
reductions had not been successful in bringing deployment levels back
into line with estimates.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T15:59:59"></hs_TimeCode> the total

the same time as consulting on proposals for budget management, the
Government sought evidence on the link between uncertainty and
deployment of renewable heat. They suggested a possible solution
through enhanced preliminary accreditation, which is in essence a form
of tariff guarantee. We have subsequently announced that we will not
implement this proposal at this time but will continue to work with
stakeholders to determine how greater certainty can be provided. The
Government recognise that projects with long lead-in times will have
greater uncertainty as to future tariff levels when investment
decisions are taken, which in turn can affect the cost of project
finance and viability of schemes. However, we have not yet identified
cost-effective ways of managing the risks associated with tariff
guarantees, which can be gamed, encouraging speculative applications
and significantly increasing the cost of the scheme. We need to find
ways of unlocking the investment needed at an acceptable cost to the
public and we will therefore continue to work with industry throughout
2013 to achieve this.</hs_para>

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, in this freezing cold, it is nice
to talk about heat being released. As for these regulations, if there
was a competition for the most inscrutable, least easy-to-follow set of
regulations, these would surely be a contender. Can anyone honestly say
they have read all these documents and fully understood them? I have
spoken to the trade association, the Renewable Energy Association, and
its expert who tracks this in great detail said he finds it almost
impossible to follow. What hope do the rest of us have? I shall
endeavour to work out what is happening here.</hs_para>

that these regulations broadly aim to introduce a system for what to do
in the event of overspend, so that the department can manage its
budgets. The RHI as a policy differs from the electricity market
because funds made available for this support mechanism come from the
public purse—the taxpayer—not via the market. Therefore,
the Treasury takes a keen interest. I can understand that, and the
desire to stay within budget is of course laudable. However, to what
extent is this really necessary? These are hugely complicated
regulations, which, I am afraid, potentially undermine investor
certainty, despite what the Minister has said. How needed are
they?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032513000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032513000065">In
reality, as the noble Baroness has indicated, this policy remains
drastically underspent. If anything, we should concentrate on how to
boost uptake, not worry about paranoid penny-pinching in the event of
overspend. The operational budget under the cost control mechanism is
around £70 million for the current financial year and estimates
of committed spend are only around £25 million. That is slightly
more than a third of the budget spent, so two-thirds are unspent. The
curious fact about this policy is that any underspend simply returns to
the Treasury. It is not carried over to help the industry, but simply
disappears into the Treasury. It is not even clear if it will come back
to the taxpayer; it is not good for the taxpayer, but good for the
Treasury.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032513000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032513000066">That
£70 million is already a reduction on the estimated budget of
£133 million that was first put forward, so this policy is not
in danger of overdelivering and overspending, but of underdelivering.
Our target for renewable heat is around 12% of heat. This, it is said,
can make a contribution to our legally binding 15% renewable energy
target in 2020. We are currently at only a few percentage points and
starting from a very low base. Where do we currently stand on the
percentage of heat coming from renewable sources, and are we getting
any more on track? The last data that I saw for 2011 showed that we

stop-start. It runs out in 2015. Under the comprehensive spending

What happens after that? I should like reassurance that the scheme will
continue and be open to new applicants. Otherwise, we are in danger of
all this time and effort being spent on something that is completely
stop-start and provides no certainty for investors. The proposals will
introduce no fewer than eight degressionary reviews in the coming two

years of visibility and certainty for the scheme. That must be
addressed. The noble Baroness made some comments about being open to

the noble Baroness will know, the industry has proposed a solution of
tariff guarantees, whereby you book your place on a tariff ahead and
then have two years in which to get your scheme up and running. The
industry feels that that is a fair system. It notes that it is already
in use in the small-scale feed-in tariffs, so the Government have used
that mechanism before. It is being considered for the CFD—the

am especially concerned about the splitting up of cash, because it is
all based on models. We all know that models cannot predict the future;
they are at best a guess of what will happen. Already, we have evidence
that those models are out of step with reality. It was predicted that
biomass would take up to half of the budget but so far it has taken
92%. Heat pumps were predicted to take up to one-third of the budget;
they have taken only 1% of it. The modelling was an attempt to guess
what would happen with very little information, starting with almost
nothing, and obviously got it wrong. The way in which people are
responding to the system is not as predicted. Yet we have rigid
budgets—per technology, per scale of technology—that seem
to be out of step with
reality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:20:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032513000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032513000074">I
should like some reassurances that we will perhaps move away from this
micromanagement and heavy-handed, very complicated regulatory process
to something more akin to a market-based system. That has to be the
future and I want to hear more about how we will get there. Some
concessions have been made on the workability of the proposals. An
important one is that if the overall market is underperforming by more
than a half it will not be degressed. If we carry on with the woeful
underspend that we have at the moment there will be no degressions.
That is welcome but the 50% cut-off is probably too low. I say that
because there is a plausible scenario in which a certain technology
could be degressed even with a very large underspend. I can give an
example of small biomass. Small-scale biomass has been more successful
than we thought; it has taken up more of the budget to date. If the
same number of new small biomass boilers as we accredited this year are
accredited next year, that new money, plus the legacy money will exceed
its degressionary trigger. That will be a success and will just about
take the underspend over the 50%
threshold<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:21:29"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is the situation in which one very successful deployment seems to make
the whole scheme succeed, even though it is just over half in terms of
spending, and then it has a degression. That is crazy; we are capping
the one thing that is helping to deliver on targets at a point when we
need to be boosting uptakes. I want to hear more from the Minister

shall say a few words on the RHI in general. It is a good scheme and we
support it. There is no doubt that it could provide credibly

investment into the UK which are much
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:22:17"></hs_TimeCode>. I was
going to talk a little about trying to compare the costs of the RHI
with other support mechanisms because it bears good comparison. On
offshore wind, we are preparing to spend in excess of £150 or
£180 per tonne of carbon abated. That seems a lot but it is a
very important industry. I mention that very high number because when
we look at the costs per CO<Sub>2</Sub> tonne abated in the RHI, it
compares incredibly favourably. When looking at large biomass projects
of more than a megawatt, the costs per tonne abated—this is
based on assumptions that it is displacing gas—are as low as
£30 per tonne  of CO<Sub>2</Sub>. That is to be
celebrated. We should be putting 
<?notus-xml column=203?>more money into that. Even when we reduce to medium-scale biomass
projects, it comes in at around £120 per tonne of
CO<Sub>2</Sub>. That is pretty comparable to the cost of carbon abated
by offshore
wind<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:23:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032513000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032513000076">Those
are the sorts of things that we should be celebrating, which raises an
important question. When we focus on the minutiae of this statutory
instrument and the cost savings and penny-pinching, are we missing the
bigger picture? We have a fledgling industry showing that it can start
to make progress. It needs support but it will not need support for
ever. Carbon prices will eventually mean that it can stand on its own
two feet, but at the moment it needs support. Where is the flexibility
in the Government’s thinking, by saying, “Hey, you know
what, this is a winner? These technologies are delivering and we need
to be thinking about giving them more money, not trying to penny-pinch
and pulling money away from them, because they are succeeding”?
I know that everyone has had their fingers burned with PV. Everyone
knows that by the time it was introduced things had moved on and prices
had crashed. We do not want a repeat of that, but are we now in danger

respond to some of the questions that the noble Baroness raised. She
must recognise that when we are using taxpayers’ money, we need
the right balance between certainty, value for money and clarity for
investment, and we need to respond to the market. We do not want to
disadvantage any technology in the scheme of things, so when the noble
Baroness says that we have many triggers for degression, it is also
important to see that some technologies have reached a further stage of
development than others. We do not want to exclude or disadvantage some
of those that will have a longer lead time. Therefore, it may well be
that there are a lot of triggers for a range of technologies, but I
would rather be in that position at the moment than to disadvantage any
technology that may need a longer lead

asked why the number of applications was so low. I think that is an
unfair comment. By and large, take-up has been relatively steady.
Applications for non-domestic RHI may appear low but a greater interest
is beginning to be shown. It is right that we address the issues behind
the low take-up, and therefore this engagement with industry and other
stakeholders is really important. I absolutely agree with the noble
Baroness that that is crucial to the debate but she also asked whether
degression would put investors off. I absolutely think that it will
not. Adopting such measures places much greater certainty in the hands
of investors. We have learnt from other schemes not to repeat those
mistakes again. We have tried to put mechanisms into place that support
the longer-term aim of what we are trying to deliver. Of course, we
still have plenty of learning to do. There is no doubt that we have to

asked why budget management was necessary. There is a degree of
uncertainty about how the market will respond over time, so it is right
to be prepared for unexpected changes in the uptake that may arise. The
noble Baroness also raised the point that budgets are not flexible, and
spending less than the allocated budget in one year does not permit
that underspend to be transferred to future years. It is about
balancing what we need to do—which is in line with what the
Treasury expects us to do—with ensuring that, as we hope, the
uptake will not lead to as big an underspend as in the past, given that
we are putting in place these mechanisms to encourage better

booking tariffs and guarantees and referred to the EPA. We do not
propose to bring forward the EPA at this time, but recognise that there
are arguments for introducing measures to improve certainty, even
though these can be difficult to evidence. We intend to monitor the
introduction of degression and other planned improvements to the

noble Baroness asked about biomass. It is true that biomass accounts
for the majority of the applications and accreditations on this scheme.
However, we want to see more deployment across a fuller range of

more questions. The noble Baroness asked why the mechanism was
necessary. It has been supported by 77% of the respondents we spoke to
as being the most appropriate mechanism. As I said, they are on side

be able to provide them with clarity and they are supportive, so I

responses. I am very impressed. I asked a lot of questions and I think
she covered most of them, although there are a few outstanding,
particularly on liquid biofuels and associated things. However, she
acknowledged the complexity of the main matter before us and argued the
need to provide certainty around the technologies. That is fine in the
early stages but at some point we have to start backing winners. The
targets that have been set for us are challenging. There is only so
long that you can flog a dead horse. There are some technologies which,
for whatever reason it may be—be it non-market barriers or there
being no appetite for them—you just cannot get deployed, whereas
there are others which seem to hit a sweet spot, where there are lots
of reasons why people like them and, suddenly, off they go. Those are
the things that you can build a business around. They can give you
great potential for investment and, one hopes, lead to exports. It is
great that we are trying to nurture as many technologies as possible,
but that cannot be the case for ever. These reviews are important but,
please, let us not have too many of them. A good, solid review after a

CRC energy efficiency scheme, formerly known as the carbon reduction

users of energy across the public and private sectors to be more
energy-efficient is one that we share, but we inherited an overly

regulations before the Committee today are the product of an extensive
dialogue with CRC participants on how best to retain the key drivers of
the scheme while making it less of a bureaucratic burden. I am pleased
that we have managed to more than halve the bureaucracy in the scheme.
The CRC is a mandatory UK-wide trading scheme introduced in April 2010.
The 2,700 large businesses and public sector organisations in the
scheme represent around 10% of the UK’s total greenhouse
emissions and typically spend more than £500,000 a year on

concerns set out for us by CRC participants. Those concerns fell into
three broad categories: that the rules of the CRC were too complex,
difficult to understand and costly for participants to administer; that
the CRC overlapped with other policies and, in particular, with the EU
emissions trading system and climate change agreements; and that the
CRC forced organisations to participate in ways which did not
accommodate their natural business energy management structures and
processes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:40:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

those representations, we acted, and in July 2010 committed to simplify
the scheme. We swiftly introduced a first round of legislative
simplification, which came into force in April 2011, and committed to
consult thoroughly on how to improve the scheme. The extensive formal
and informal consultation by Ministers and officials has led to the
order before your Lordships today. The Government set out their policy
conclusions, which will be enacted by this order, in their response to
the consultation published on 10 December 2012.</hs_para>

changes to the CRC address concerns about complexity and associated
administrative costs, enable greater business planning by introducing
two fixed-price sales of allowances each year, one forecast and one
retrospective, and allow greater flexibility for organisations to
participate in natural business units—that is, to reflect the
way they choose to organise themselves. They also reduce the reporting
burden by reducing the number of fuels reported, using only electricity
measured by settled half-hourly meters for qualification purposes, and
ending the requirement for footprint reports. They reduce scheme
complexity by removing the residual percentage rule and climate change
agreement exemption rules, and they reduce the overlap with other
schemes so that input fuels to CCA facilities and EU emissions trading
system installations are outside the scope of the
CRC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:42:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

note that maintaining the qualification threshold at 6,000 megawatt
hours of settled half-hourly metered electricity only, instead of all

the CRC in April 2014. However, the Government are keen to maximise the
potential benefit to participants and have concluded that it would be
desirable to bring forward certain simplifications in advance of the
beginning of phase 2, where the benefits of early introduction for
participants will outweigh any difficulty in adapting to the new

Government have therefore decided that a number of simplifications will
have effect from May 2013 and will apply for the last two years of the
first phase of the CRC—that is, 2012-13 and 2013-14. These
include a reduction in fuels from 29 to two. The CRC will now cover
only emissions generated from the consumption of electricity and gas,
the latter only when used for heating
purposes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:43:48"></hs_TimeCode>. They
also include the introduction of an organisation-wide 2% de mimimis, or
minimum reportable percentage, threshold for gas. Therefore, if from
2012-13 a participant’s gas consumption is below 2% of their
overall electricity consumption figure, that participant will no longer
have to report on that gas or purchase allowances to cover its
use<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T16:44:13"></hs_TimeCode>. Also
included is a meter-based exclusion for domestic gas supplies which
have an annual quantity of 73,200 kilowatt hours or less, and an
extension of the CRC allowance surrender deadline from the end of July
to the end of October. The changes also include the abolition of the
performance league table with the CRC administrator, the Environment
Agency, and publishing participants’ aggregated energy use and
emissions data instead.</hs_para>

all these simplifications will radically reduce the administrative
costs of participants by more than half, which equates to savings of
around £272 million for CRC participants up to 2030. The
Government are therefore satisfied that this order meets our objectives
for simplification—namely, to optimise the projected energy
efficiency improvements delivered by the CRC and to reduce its overall
complexity. The simplified CRC will continue to deliver energy

Grantchester:</Member></B> The Minister explained the over-burdensome
nature of the original CRC order and we agree with her. This simplified
scheme is to be applauded, although there are a few concerns about the
reduction of benefits as a consequence. Nevertheless, it is right that
the Government proceed with the scheme. Despite cost-effective energy
efficiency savings being available, the Carbon Trust reported as far
back as 2005 that organisations’ emissions were not being
reduced. Indeed, they have remained constant for the past 20 years, due
to a lack of awareness at board and senior management level, a lack of
financial incentives to reduce emissions and a lack of prestige
associated with efficiency activity.</hs_para>

tend to be only 1% or 2% of operating costs for business. While I can
confirm acceptance of the order today, I want to ask the Minister about
one or two concerns arising from this simplified scheme. Since the
scheme began in 2010, it has drawn considerable criticism for being too
complex, burdensome, difficult to understand and costly to administer.
It is good that the Government are bringing in a more practical scheme,
but has something been lost in the
translation?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032526000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032526000018">While
the memorandum explains that considerable savings will be made—a
55% reduction in overall administrative costs—it does not
explain what percentage reduction in efficiency improvements and carbon
emission reductions may result from the simplification. For example, it
says that there is a reduction in fuels from 29 to two and that the
scheme will cover only emissions generated from the consumption of
electricity and gas. This is still important, but will the Minister
confirm that the scheme will still capture a major percentage of the
efficiency improvements targeted by the original
scheme?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032526000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032526000019">On
this benefits side of the equation, there is a loss from the original
scope of the order. The impact assessment puts this at around
£183 million. The Secondary Legislation 
<?notus-xml column=210?>Scrutiny Committee also commented on this in its 33rd report. It is not
clear from the Minister’s department’s reply to the
questioning on the validity of the order, when set against such loss of
benefits, whether this is due to double counting of benefits as a
result of reducing the overlaps between CCL, CCA and EU ETS
instruments. Will the noble Baroness explain whether this loss of
benefit is per phase or a loss for the total scheme to

be grateful if the Minister could clarify the impact of the loss of
benefits and the effect that that will have on our carbon emission
reductions. The memorandum also explained that in December 2010, when
the impact assessment was published, the devolved
Administrations’ decision to retain the schools CRC scheme
participation was still pending. In February this year—last
month—all devolved Administrations confirmed that their schools
would continue to participate in the CRC scheme and that only English
schools would be withdrawn from it. Will the Minister explain the
rationale behind this decision to withdraw English schools, and the
difference or added benefits that that will bring? I understand that
the memorandum talks of it having an effect on the revision of the
baseline of the CRC. That I well understand, but will it lead to any

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as chairman of the
Climate Change Committee. I am pleased that we are looking to make such
arrangements as simple as they can be. One of the most important things
that we have to do is ensure that this very important business of
making Britain able to meet the statutory target of an 80% reduction in
emissions by 2050 is accomplished with as little harassment and
difficulty as possible. When the original scheme was introduced, I
criticised it because of its complication. We now all agree that it
would have been better to make it less complex, but it was an important
step that I am not undermining in any
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:02:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032526000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032526000023">I
have a particular question for the Minister, the answer to which I
found hard to discover in the documentation. It is about the half-hour
meter. This is a boring technicality but it is very important. For
reasons that no one has ever understood, the original system depended
not just on the amount of energy used but also on whether one had a
half-hour meter. The difficulty is that many firms with a half-hour
meter use less energy than firms without a half-hour meter. More
importantly, there is a competitive problem. Some companies that have
them—restaurants, for example—are competing with other
companies that do not. One is paying and the other is not. It may be my
own ignorance and inability, but I have been 
<?notus-xml column=211?>unable to discover whether the new CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme Order
will overcome this problem. I was promised by the then Minister in the
House of Commons that this would be put right “when the
opportunity arose”, which I think was the phrase used. I should
very much like to understand whether that comes into the purview of
this order, and if not, why not. Will we now put this right? With a
Government who are very committed to competitiveness, it would be sad
if this quirk in the system should continue to make things
difficult.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032526000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032526000024">Let
me explain why I feel strongly about this. There are many organisations
which, in the aggregate, meet the requirements of the CRC. It was very
important to have an aggregated system, because, if we had not, we
would not have reached out. I congratulate the former Government on
recognising that, for example, franchisees had to be part of the
system, otherwise there would have been a major disadvantage for other
companies which were not so organised. However, the difficulty is that
some franchised organisations have a clear advantage over others
because of the half-hourly meter arrangement. I shall say something
that I hope the Minister will not be upset about. When I inquired into
this matter previously, it became quite clear that the only reason for
it was none of the reasons which Ministers of both sides have proposed;
it was just administrative convenience. It happens to be true that
people think that this is a convenient way of doing it rather than the
right way of doing it. I do not want to make it more
complicated—nor do I want to get into names of particular
companies—but I can think of two restaurant chains, one of which
pays the CRC and the other does not, yet their customers and turnover
in many of their individual restaurants are very similar. That does not
seem to me something that we should allow in this structure. Therefore,
I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me that, under these
arrangements, the half-hourly meter element will be removed and that we
will go to a much more sensible system, which is a proper, basic amount
of energy used on this narrower basis of gas and electricity. It would
be de minimis arrangement, but one which did not discriminate between
organisations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:06:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032526000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032526000025"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13032526000041" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032526000041">Baroness

Due to the continued growth of academies and their independence from
local government, the CRC is not the best mechanism to achieve energy
efficiency across the English schools estate. The Government therefore
decided to withdraw all state-funded schools in England from CRC
participation and implement alternative measures to incentivise and
support those schools in obtaining 
<?notus-xml column=212?>both energy cost and emission savings. However, that does not mean that
schools will not partake; it just means that they will take a different

noble Lord asked whether the benefits of the scheme would be reduced.
The loss of emissions coverage is very small, being less than 5%. The
key drivers—awareness, publication of data and the financial
incentives arising from needing to buy allowances—will still be
part of the scheme. As I said in the previous debate, we want
continually to review what we are doing so that we get the best

of Graeme Nuttall’s conclusions was that the company law
provisions on share buy-backs are overly burdensome. The Nuttall review
recommended that the Government consult on improving the operation of
internal share markets to support companies with 
<?notus-xml column=213?>direct share ownership models. Companies that wish to encourage their
employees to hold shares directly—that is, without the use of a
trust—will often seek to buy back shares from employees who are
leaving, or have left, the company to redistribute them to new
employees. That allows the company to avoid the risks that, over time,
shares earmarked for allocation to employees become predominately owned
by former employees or others outside the company.
Buy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:13:25"></hs_TimeCode>-back
arrangements will depend on the departing shareholder, the seller, and

accepted this recommendation to examine company law about buy backs,
the Government held a consultation to obtain views and evidence

in treasury; and potential problems or unintended

increasing the flexibility available to companies in how they fund

arrangements for their particular needs. Specifically, the proposals
will, first, allow shareholders in any company to approve off-market
share buy-backs by an ordinary resolution—that is, by a simple
majority vote—and, where such buy-backs are connected with an
employee share scheme, allow for approval to be granted in advance.

will make it simpler for private limited companies to finance share

will enable shareholders to authorise directors of private limited
companies to pay for shares out of cash without having to identify it
as distributable reserves. That will allow small share purchases of
less than £15,000, or equivalent to less than 5% of share
capital, whichever is lower, each year. That will give private

me remind the Committee of the key benefits of the regulations.

prevent or set conditions on share buy-backs. In addition, most of the

the heady days of only a few days ago when we were in the Chamber
debating the ERR Bill and voting on this and that, to be reduced to
only three people here for this purpose, although two seem to have
drifted in for other reasons, and we are outnumbered by those in the

Nuttall report is interesting. As the Minister said, it argues
forcefully for an increase in the employee share ownership arrangements
and makes its case with some verve. It is, however, short on detail on
costs. The Minister kindly said that he thought that the outcome of
what is in this modest proposal, to which I do not object, by the way,
is that administrative burdens would be reduced, there would be more
flexibility inside companies to provide shares for employees and that
it would help growth.</hs_para>

the Minister explain how he arrives at that conclusion, because the
impact assessment statement which accompanied the measure, which I have
read, contains remarkably little about the costs? The assertion made
early on is that there is simply no way to identify the various costs
one way or the other. I do not disagree that it would be difficult, but
it does seems rather odd to base an argument on the benefits that will
flow to businesses if you cannot identify them in cash terms. Perhaps
the Minister can reflect on that point and give me any update that he
may have
received<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:19:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032528000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032528000016">Secondly,
I note that the intention is that there will be a post-implementation
review three years after enactment. Paragraph 56 of the government
response to consultation, on pages 15 and 16, covers the
issues 
<?notus-xml column=215?>that and explains what areas will be looked at. Once again, it does not
come up with anything tangible in cash terms. It just states that the
review,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13032528000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032528000033">“will

I would be grateful if the Minister would reflect on whether the
post-implementation review goes far enough. It would be helpful, when
government measures of this nature are being brought forward which
strike at the heart of the legal structure within which companies
operate, if some cost consequences were
provided.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13032528000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032528000017">My
third point is whether this will achieve any lasting value. The general
view that I have read in the comments about the Nuttall review is that
it may have some effect but, as the impact assessment states, there are
unlikely to be many benefits from employee ownership if it is not
combined with enhanced engagement practices to reap the full benefits.
There is a lot of literature that says that this should do a lot. The
Minister said that he thought that staff would be happier, that
turnover might be up and profitability greater. I am not saying that I
am sceptical, but it would be interesting to know on what he bases that
argument. Clearly, none of that will happen if more work is not done to
introduce the benefits of employee ownership. Can the Minister explain
what the department and the Government are doing to promote employee
share ownership more widely so that people are happier, that turnover
goes up and profitability is increased?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032528000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032528000018">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:21:36"></hs_TimeCode>
final point is that employee share ownership affects significant tax
issues. The Minister did not mention that, partly because it is
obviously not for his department. However, for example, tax rules say
that where a company buys back shares from a former employee within
five years of that employee leaving, all the income paid to the person
who is leaving has to be taxed as though it is a dividend. Is that to
continue? If it does not change, it does not seem that there is much
benefit in making sure that the shares of a former employee are bought
back, whether or not it is done with sequential permissions under the
articles. If the tax is going to be so great that no one is interested
in doing it, it seems that that will vitiate what is being
applied<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:23:09"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, there are ways around that in the sense that the scheme that
seems to apply most to companies in this area is the creation of
employee share ownership trusts, because sales to the trusts are taxed
only as capital gains and, in the present environment, that is quite
reasonable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032528000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032528000019">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:21:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:21:36"></hs_TimeCode>
those issues are ignored in this report. Therefore, as I said, my final
point concerning tax is that it would be helpful if, in carrying out
the post-implementation review, an additional point could be made that
the taxation implications should be considered, perhaps with a view to
looking again more widely at the whole way in which employee share
ownership taxation takes place. If one could correct that, I think that
there would be more take-up of the scheme and it would have an impact.
However, until that time, it will not have much
effect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:23:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

regulations have merit in themselves, they are part of a wider package
of measures that implement the recommendations of the Nuttall review of
employee share ownership. They simplify the company law provisions on
the buy-back of a company’s own shares in a manner which reduces
administrative burdens and increases the flexibility available to
companies to administer and finance buy-backs in a way that best suits
their needs. The proposals in the regulations were endorsed and
enhanced by the consultation process, and as I mentioned earlier, are
mainly targeted at private limited companies that undertake buy-backs

up the point about costs raised by the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, he

from the measures, I can make no other substantive comments on costs,
but it may help the noble Lord if I also mention the question of
savings. It is not possible to quantify the potential savings to
business, as these will vary greatly depending on a range of factors,

the noble Lords who are taking part in this debate and to the many
others who contributed to the report on which this Question is based. I
shall explain in a little more detail what I mean by task-sharing and
skills-mix changes to make sure that we are all in the same position on
that but, first, perhaps I may say a few words on the
background<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:30:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032530000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000003">Health and health
services are very much about people and knowledge. The Department for
International Development has a good record on both but on people, 
<?notus-xml column=218?>in particular, I think there is more that DfID could do, and I shall
make that point here in relation to this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:31:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032530000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000004">There are four key
points relating to the background. The first is that there is a
pressing need in the world for more health workers. The best estimates
I have seen are that there are about 1 billion people in the world who
do not have access to a health worker. In Africa, it is estimated that
there need to be about 1.5 million more health workers in order that
80% of the women who want to can have access to a skilled health worker
when they are in labour. That is not even a high standard; it is not
what we expect, which is 100%. Therefore, there is a massive shortage
of health workers, and people die or are damaged or diseased for lack
of access to a health worker who has some knowledge and who can help
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:32:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032530000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000005">The second point of
background is that if, through the efforts of DfID, national
Governments and everybody else, there is to be a real improvement in
health in, for example, India’s million villages, then the
staffing structure for looking after people in those villages will not
be the same as it is in the UK. There will not be a GP in every one of
those villages or, indeed, in Africa’s million villages. People
will have to do things differently and there will have to be a
different range of skills mix. Nurses will perhaps be doing what
doctors are doing, and other people will perhaps be doing what nurses
are doing, all enabled by technology. That is the real theme that we
are talking
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:32:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032530000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000006">My third point is that
we actually know what to do. The report demonstrates how a skills mix
can be changed successfully to reach more people. Finally, the UK has a
particular role that it can play in this, and I shall deal first with
this final
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:33:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000007">I
know that other noble Lords are going to speak about education and
training and about the role of British institutions. In this country we
have a fantastic track record of educating and training health workers
and, indeed, others, and there is a part that we can play in that.
However, I also suggest that we have an important role in training and
educating more health workers, not least because of our history and
links with so many of the countries that we are talking
about—the low and middle-income countries—through the
Commonwealth and through our history of education. We know that many
people from those countries have emigrated to our country and have
become health workers here, and we know that emigration is part of the
problem faced by other countries. I make it clear that it is not the
whole story. The best estimates I have seen are that 135,000 health
workers from Africa have moved to other, richer countries over the past
35 years. That is a very big number but it should be compared with the
1.5 million that are needed in Africa. If everyone went home, the
problem would not be solved. The bigger issue is getting more people on
to the pitch to provide more education and
training<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:34:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that we set out to address in the report, <I>All the Talents</I>. We
undertook a review and were joined by expert witnesses. We had a group
of parliamentarians who quizzed those witnesses, and we came up with
four or five clear recommendations, which are the ones that I want to
put to the Government.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=219?><hs_para UID="13032530000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000009">Let me say a little more
about what we mean by changed skills mix and better teamwork. We looked
at examples from about 20 countries where access was improved because
of using staff members to do different things from what would happen
traditionally. The example we give in the brief version of the report
is in Malawi, where some 135,000 manipulations of bones have been
undertaken by technically trained people, not by doctors. As a result
there has been improved access. Incidentally, they were trained by
British doctors in this particular case in Malawi. So, we have seen
improved access by changing the skills mix and allowing different
members of staff to do work that others had previously
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:35:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000010">We
have seen improvements in quality. The example given in the report is
in the UK, where nurse practitioners doing more prescribing has
improved quality as perceived by the patient. It is just as safe as it
being done by doctors but it has improved quality, as perceived by the
patient. Finally, there are examples of improving cost. The example
that we use here is that in Mozambique for the past 25 years almost all
the caesarean sections outside the capital have been done by nurses
with additional training at a third of the cost of using doctors in
that
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:36:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000011">These
issues of changing skills mix, task-sharing and changing what
professionals do can have profound effects on access, quality and
costs. We looked at the success factors because we know that many such
examples have failed. We identified some very clear success factors
that are obviously spelt out in the report. They are about leadership,
planning, training, supervision, ability to refer and teamwork. They
are about some very obvious ways of doing things. We also identified
failure in the absence of those things. It was also interesting for our
all-party group to notice that a lot of the most innovative and
interesting examples were happening in low and middle-income countries
that did not have our resources and, to some extent, our baggage and
vested
interests<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:37:19"></hs_TimeCode>. Here,
we saw a compelling
story<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:37:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000012">We
also decided that we would want to phrase the report in positive terms,
in part thanks to the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, and call it <I>All
</I><I>t</I><I>he Talents.</I> It is about how to bring all the talents
of all the health workforce together to have the biggest impact on the
biggest health problems in the world—those in low and
middle-income countries. We think that it is a compelling story. If
DfID and other organisations are to help national Governments to
deliver healthcare in the million villages in India or the million
villages in Africa we need this sort of change in how services are
delivered to be
effective<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>. How
can DfID act? We know that it is always difficult for Governments and
international development agencies to deal with staffing issues. The
argument is: if we train more people, will they not just migrate? How
will we handle the professions and the recurring costs? Our four
recommendations to DfID are clear. The first is to assist national
Governments to develop their human resources and workforce planning. We
must help them to make those changes. Secondly, we want to ensure that
workforce innovations are mapped and shared. We need to collect and
capture the innovation, then share it. Thirdly, together with 
<?notus-xml column=220?>others, we need to invest more in workforce research and develop better
metrics. Fourthly, we should undertake systematic analysis of the
effectiveness of role and skills-mix change. Changes can fail as well
as
succeed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:39:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

people making similar proposals. As the Minister will know, Jeff Sachs,
in a recent meeting in Parliament which we both attended, pointed out
strongly that if we had a million more community health
workers—the lowest trained group of health workers in the
world—we would have a much better chance of delivering the
millennium development goals. It will be interesting to hear the
Government’s response to that as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:39:31"></hs_TimeCode>. We argue
in the report that professionals need to lead the changes but
Governments, international agencies and DfID, with its very high
standing—the highest standing of any development agency in the
world—need to lead and to stress the importance of these sorts
of
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000014">People
will be the biggest part of the solution in healthcare. They are not
the only one—knowledge, science and technology are
important—but caring hands, the knowledgeable helper, the
professional and the well-trained non-professional are the biggest need
and the biggest deficit in healthcare. That means investing in
education and training, setting examples, supporting organisations such
as the Global Health Workforce Alliance and promoting the needed
solutions. I ask the Minister
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:40:05"></hs_TimeCode>three
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T17:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>. How
does she respond to those four recommendations? How do she and the

Eccles:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, is a
tireless worker in the cause of global health, including, as we know on
this occasion, through the development of a mix of appropriate and
innovative skills in many places—here and elsewhere, but
predominately in countries less fortunate than ours. He referred to the
UK resource, and I want to go down a rather narrow path, talking about

medicine and the contribution that we can

briefly declare my interests. I am involved with development at UCLH. I
am also involved with the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and have on a
number of occasions been involved with the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine. It is usual for us in this House to discuss malaria
and parasites, of which there are many different types which can lead
to all sorts of very nasty results, and, lately, neglected tropical
diseases. I am slightly less certain about our debating neglected
tropical diseases. As a matter of fact, if you take the total UK
capability, I am not sure that much is being neglected. As we know,
ever since Manson and Ross connected the mosquito to malaria and the
schools in London and Liverpool were founded, we have made an important
contribution to fighting tropical diseases. Indeed, the Hospital for
Tropical Diseases itself was founded nearly 200 years ago.</hs_para>

briefly about London as a centre for excellence. It could perhaps be
entitled “The Bloomsbury Campus”. The London School of
Hygiene 
<?notus-xml column=221?>and Tropical Medicine in Keppel Street and the hospital, with its beds
in Gower Street and outpatients and diagnostic laboratories in Mortimer
Market, off Tottenham Court Road, are a real centre. Of course, we need
to add the Wellcome Foundation, which is very close by. All those
institutions are within walking distance and work very closely
together. In particular, if a tricky case comes into the hospital, the
conversations that go on between those institutions are close and
entirely relevant. The people who practise in the hospital are also
teachers and lecturers at the school, so there is a close combination
of
skills.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000018">They
have two agendas. The first is the domestic agenda, given the amount of
travel and immigration. I expect that some noble Lords will know Dr
Paul Clarke, who founded a tropical disease clinic called MASTA. Paul
said to me one day, “John, you know that there are people who
have come into Southwark”—he lived in
Southwark—“from some strange places and have brought
things that I have never seen before”. That is the domestic
agenda. There is the rapid diagnosis of malaria and the concentration
of quite rare diseases going on in the Hospital of Tropical Diseases.
There is still some leprosy in this country, and it has often been
misdiagnosed, and therefore having that capability is extremely
important. Also important is the service whereby all GPs in the country
can go on line or ring up for rapid advice if they are faced with a
patient who they think may have returned from a foreign part quite
recently.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000019">On
the overseas challenge, training, study and research are enormously
endorsed by the Wellcome Trust, which makes large grants every year to
both the London and Liverpool schools, as do Bill and Melinda Gates. It
is an extraordinary amount of money, in one sense, and a great
endorsement of the contribution of the Bloomsbury campus in London.
Other institutions also make a contribution. DfID, as has been
mentioned, is a strong supporter of this endeavour, as, indeed, is
HEFCE, because they are either connected to or counted as higher
education
institutions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000020">This
proliferation of support and the institutions involved bring
challenges. Several departments of government are involved, and
government departments are not always brilliant at talking to each
other and providing a co-ordinated response. I wonder whether there is
co-ordination.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000021">Notably,
the NHS, which is under pressure, changing configuration and always
under some reorganisation, does not have the same agenda as DfID or the
charitable institutions. I should like reassurance that DfID fully
endorses this Bloomsbury campus and its contribution to those countries
overseas which need that contribution, and that it will continue to
give the participants enthusiastic support. Given that several
departments are involved—notably the Department of Health and
the NHS, with the ever present problems that they have to face—I
ask the Government to make sure that nothing slips between the
cracks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000022">Do the
Government agree that the UK’s leading position in study,
research, teaching and tropical disease clinical practice can continue
to be a growth point for the economy? This endeavour has grown over the
years and I see no reason why it should not grow 
<?notus-xml column=222?>further. Enormously satisfying careers are available in this activity
and there is a huge job to be done overseas. If we can continue to get
international support, surely this is an opportunity—and we are
looking for such opportunities wherever we

Warwick of Undercliffe:</Member></B> My Lords, <I>All the Talents</I>
is an excellent report from the two All-Party Parliamentary Groups on
Global Health and Africa. It gets straight to the point—that
there is a critical shortage of healthcare workers in many
countries—and it sets out clearly what can be done to tackle the
problem. Crucially, it also provides us with the evidence that global
health services can be improved by giving people extra skills and
changing their roles to enable them to expand their capability. I
congratulate the groups on their work in bringing the evidence together
in this report. I also take the opportunity to thank the noble Lord,

was particularly struck by the example of the creation of orthopaedic
clinical officers, or OCOs as they are called in the report, in Malawi.
Currently—this is an astonishing statistic—there are only
seven orthopaedic surgeons for Malawi’s 14 million people. Here
in the UK we have roughly one per 30,000 people. It is an
astonishing contrast. These OCOs were once local medical assistants,
people who left school at around GCSE level and, after a two-year
course in basic clinical care, ran the country’s small health
centres. An 18-month training course in orthopaedics has enabled these
medical assistants to develop sufficient skills to give good-quality
care to around 90% of all injuries. They are expected to be competent
to treat burns, septic joints, osteomyelitis and Malawi’s high
incidence of club foot deformities. They can provide casts for the most
common fractures and emergency resuscitation in the case of severe
injuries. Every district hospital in Malawi now has at least one OCO
and they are estimated to treat more than 30,000 fractures a year. What
a great example of task-shifting that is, and there are others
throughout this report that are similarly
inspiring.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000025">Of
course, task-shifting, or task-sharing, is not a new concept. We have
been reminded by the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, that there is a shortage
of 4.2 million health workers world wide, with 1.5 million
needed in Africa alone. Therefore, in many countries with severe
shortages of trained professionals, health workers often have no choice
but to get stuck in and carry out tasks which are not in their job
title.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000026">This
makes the words of warning contained in the report all the more
important. If changes to a health workforce are managed badly, they can
lead to poor-quality and unsafe services. We must not risk more burden
being placed on poorly trained, poorly paid workers who are expected to
deliver an increasing range of priorities. But done well, as this
report shows us, giving people new skills can improve access to
services, improve quality and possibly reduce costs. The
report’s list of recommendations forms a sensible checklist of
what will make the difference between success and poor-quality, even
dangerous, care. When 
<?notus-xml column=223?>a health worker takes on a new task or responsibility, it is essential
that they are effectively trained, supervised and
supported.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000027">The
report emphasises that successful skills-mixing starts with health
professionals and local health organisations leading the changes, with
Governments and national health systems enabling them to do so. We need
more evidence of the effectiveness of skills-mixing to help support
further development. I was struck by the point made in the report that
significantly more investment is made in drug research than in human
resources research, even though health workers account for a much
greater proportion of costs. This was reinforced for me by <I>OECD
Health Working Paper No.54</I>, helpfully provided by the Library,
which emphasised the many barriers to be overcome and how Governments
have to support the process to overcome them. In her response to this
debate, will the Minister tell us what measures the Department for
International Development is taking to assist Governments to develop
their HR and workforce planning
capacity?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000028">The
real benefit of skills-mixing is that experiences can be shared between
countries. That is where international and national volunteering can
play an important role. International development agencies such as VSO
can assist national Governments to train medical staff and draw up
sustainable plans for skill-mix changes. I declare an interest as a
life vice-president of VSO and draw your Lordships’ attention to
the work that VSO is doing with regard to task-shifting, or
skills-mixing.</hs_para>

sees these as positive ways of getting skills and health services to
the grassroots, and as close as possible to those who need access to
services and education. Skills-mixing also supports VSO’s belief
that citizens are active agents of change and that communities will
prosper if people are given the skills and opportunities to develop.
But—and there is always a but—for this approach to be
successful and sustainable, it must receive continuous investment. If
community health workers and volunteers are to be given increased
skills, responsibility and tasks, they must have the equivalent
increase in support. They need the professional training and management
that will ensure that they are able to deliver this work
effectively, and their increased responsibility must be reflected in
their
remuneration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000030">In
every situation, in every country, ongoing training and support are
vital in health services. Health workers should be supported to learn
continuously, and to be trained in the latest medical developments,
healthcare approaches and effective
techniques.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000031">VSO
makes this happen whenever it can. I will give just one example, still
in Malawi, where VSO volunteers are training health workers because,
again, the country has a critical shortage. VSO is pushing for improved
supervision and management of these health workers. The Malawian
government is listening and making a concentrated effort to tackle the
shortage through recruitment, training and retraining. I hope the
common sense approach contained in <I>All the Talents</I> will give
extra support to VSO's representations in Malawi. I know VSO
will make some of these points tomorrow  
<?notus-xml column=224?>to the APPG's review on overseas volunteering, which itself acknowledges
the importance of the direct exchange of knowledge and skills between
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000032">The UK
has taken some positive steps in this area. DfID's £20 million
four-year health partnership scheme enables volunteer British doctors,
nurses and midwives to train overseas health care workers across many
disciplines. These skilled health professionals offer practical
assistance to their counterparts in the developing world, including
one-to-one mentoring and developing guidelines to ensure that clinics
run more effectively. Will the Minister give us any assurances that
opportunities for skills mix changes and task sharing are being
promoted as part of the health partnership
scheme?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000033">Health
workers—midwives, clinical officers, community workers, nurses
and doctors—provide healthcare in many of the world's hardest to
reach areas. They face daily challenges and do amazing work, but there
are not enough of them to get the job done properly. They often lack
support and supervision, the right training and equipment. In the best
possible way, <I>All the Talents</I> states the obvious when it
addresses these points. It makes sense to develop the talents of
everyone working in healthcare, so that money is not wasted, quality
can continue to improve, and above all, so that more people can access
the health services that they

Flather:</Member></B> My Lords, I have just had tea with a friend from
Nigeria. She said that she spoke to her mother over the weekend. Her
mother told her about her cousin, who had come home from having a baby
and had blown up because part of the placenta had been left inside her.
Nobody could give her antibiotics—no antibiotics were
available—so she died. This is what we are talking about today.
I unashamedly say that I am passionate about women’s issues and
how women in Africa and India suffer the most. I know
because I have had opportunities to visit and see for myself what goes
on for women. Nobody really cares: “A woman dies, so what? There
are so many others”. That is why this debate and the report of
the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, are so valuable. Everything the noble Lord
said is absolutely correct. Any support that can be given for what he
wants done would be wonderfully
valuable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000035">We
have talked about birth attendance, village women helping and so on,
but it has never been done in a proper way. The noble Lord is so right
to say that if things are not done properly, it is better not to do
them at all. My friend also told me that in her village, the woman with
the smallest hands pulls the baby out and the mother usually ends up
with a fistula. Things are not getting better; they are getting worse
in the developing countries and we have to recognise that. Why are they
getting worse? Because the population is increasing by a very large
number and more people need help.</hs_para>

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord
Crisp, for securing this debate. His commitment to improving the health
workforce is international and has been internationally valued. This
debate on skills-mix changes and task-sharing is very welcome and is
derived from the extremely interesting report, <I>All the
Talents</I>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032530000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000055"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>One
of the refreshing aspects of the report for me, as spokesperson for
both DfID and the Department of Health, is that it applied its analysis
and conclusions and took its evidence not only internationally, across
a range of both developed and developing countries, but from across the
United Kingdom. That meant that 
<?notus-xml column=228?>it brought fresh perspectives in both quarters. Often, the assumption is
that in developing countries it would be good if more basically trained
personnel undertook more work, whereas in the United Kingdom we need a
workforce that is as regulated and as trained as possible. I note the
reference made by the noble Lord, Lord Collins, to what Peter Carter of
the RCN said in the report and I look forward to discussions in health
debates. However, this report challenges us to think again and to look
beyond our assumptions to what works and why it works in various
settings and what does not work in various settings. The noble Lord,
Lord Crisp, emphasised leadership, planning, supervision and teamwork
as being essential. The noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, also emphasised
how important it is to do this work well, otherwise it will not work at
all.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032530000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000056">We fully
support the principle that a strong health service needs skilled and
motivated health workers in the right place at the right time. As the
noble Baroness, Lady Flather, knows, we have promised to save the lives
of at least 50,000 women during pregnancy and childbirth, and the lives
of 250,000 newborn babies by 2015 in developing countries. We have
promised to support 2 million women to deliver their babies safely with
the support of skilled midwives, nurses and doctors.As the noble
Baroness, Lady Flather, made clear, meeting these commitments means
improvements across the health systems in developing countries but,
above all, demands skilled health workers across all levels of the
workforce<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:15:18"></hs_TimeCode>. We
strongly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Crisp. We are supporting the
workforce in 28 of the countries in which we work. This includes
training new health workers, building skills among existing health
workers and supporting government
planning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:15:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000057">Even
in the wealthiest countries it is not easy to make sure that everyone,
rich or poor, living in town or country, can see a health worker when
they need to. Many countries, especially in Africa, suffer from a
critical shortage of health workers, as we have heard. Tackling this
shortage demands creative and innovative approaches. Task-sharing and
organising the roles of health workers can be such a creative approach.
Around the world, health workers are taking on new responsibilities as
countries try new ways of building an effective health workforce in the
face of financial constraints and a serious shortage of health
professionals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:16:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000058">The
excellent report of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Global Health,
of which the noble Lord is co-chair, is a valuable addition to the
thinking about the issue. The report pinpoints the factors that create
success when reorganising roles and makes practical recommendations on
how professionals, Governments and institutions can best support the
talents of health workers. With increasing global focus on universal
health coverage, the timing of this report is
excellent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:16:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000059">I
can assure noble Lords that we share their concern about the importance
of this area. We agree that task shifting can improve health service
access and quality. I can assure the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, and
others that we support partner countries which wish to do this. In
Ethiopia, for example, DfID is supporting the Ethiopian Government to
expand access to health services through the training and deployment of
village 
<?notus-xml column=229?>health extension workers. With one year of training, these workers can
take on basic preventive and curative services that would otherwise be
seen as the preserve of health officers, nurses and doctors, who remain
scarce<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:17:30"></hs_TimeCode>. UK
support means an additional 2,000 community health extension workers
will provide a package of basic health services for 5 million
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:17:38"></hs_TimeCode>. Other
countries, such as Zambia, are looking to learn from Ethiopia’s
experience with UK support. It is important to learn from the good and
bad examples of where this is
happening<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:17:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000060">To
answer the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, on assisting national Governments
with human resource planning, which is a key point, it is very clear
that robust health workforce planning is recognised as being critically
important. That is why DfID works with Governments, such as the
Government of Nepal, to develop such national health workforce
strategies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:18:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

where strengthening the health workforce is key. The noble Baroness,
Lady Flather, is right to make reference to the significance of family
planning. I thank her for what she said. The UK’s leadership of
last year’s family planning summit encouraged new thinking about
expanding access to contraception. It was notable that several
countries included task-shifting for family planning within their
summit commitments, and DfID is working with country partners on
implementing these. For example, Zambia has just confirmed its summit
commitment to allow community health assistants to provide
contraceptive injectables, an excellent development that will expand
access to family
planning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:18:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000062">A
number of organisations are focusing on task-shifting and I hear with
interest what the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, had to say about VSO.
In east Africa, a mid-level cadre of ophthalmic clinical officers
provides most of the community eye care services. This cadre has only
recently been admitted to the professional body for ophthalmologists,
the East Africa College of Ophthalmologists. I can assure the noble
Baroness, Lady Warwick, that through the United Kingdom
Government’s health partnership scheme, about which she asked,
the UK’s Royal College of Ophthalmologists will work with its
east African counterparts to integrate these clinical officers and
boost the quality of their work still
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000073">Sharing
skills beyond those traditionally considered to be the responsibility
of the health workforce can also be successful. Again, the Health
Partnership Scheme is also supporting the East London NHS Foundation
Trust to work with Butabika Hospital in Uganda. In this innovative
project, recovered psychiatric patients work alongside community mental
health services to provide care—an example of
task-shifting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:20:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000063">My
noble friend Lord Eccles has spoken compellingly about the UK’s
track record on research—in particular, the practice of the
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Hospital for
Tropical Diseases and other institutions. He is, as are we, rightly
proud of the international contribution that our institutions have
made, not least in rendering neglected tropical diseases less
neglected, as he says. I assure him that UK institutions successfully
secure a high proportion of the global funds available for research,
including 
<?notus-xml column=230?>from DfID. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine are two among many centres of
excellence for health research in the United Kingdom, and we expect UK
institutions to continue to compete effectively for funding in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:21:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000064">My
noble friend also asked about working across government departments. I
would point out that the Department of Health, for example, funds the
National Institute for Health. The London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine and other institutions can and do apply for grants,
and there is a lot of discussion between DfID and the Department of
Health on
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:21:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

aware, and as the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, pointed out, DfID puts
women and girls front and centre, recognising that they are likely to
be the poorest and the most vulnerable in the world. Supporting women
and girls brings particular benefits to the individuals themselves, as
well as to their families and their communities. Task-shifting can
bring particular benefits to women both as employees—many
community health worker programmes prioritise women’s
training—and as beneficiaries of expanded services.
Pakistan’s Lady Health Worker Programme, which we support, makes
it easier for women to access healthcare. However, as <I>All the
Talents</I> points out, and as noble Lords have emphasised,
task-shifting needs to be done well. Fragmented approaches, delivered
separately from the wider health system or driven solely by efforts to
cut costs, are not the way forward. Crucially, Governments need
evidence of what works to be able to design effective programmes.
Research and evaluation need to establish best practice and inform
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:22:36"></hs_TimeCode>. The
noble Lord, Lord Crisp and the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, are right
in this regard.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Crisp, asked me, interestingly, about Jeffrey
Sach’s campaign to train 1 million community health workers. We
believe that the initiative to expand access to good-quality healthcare
is welcome. However, we are concerned that the evidence to support such
a dramatic scale-up in community health workers is weak. Any such
initiative needs in-built evaluation plans to build evidence and
understand impact. The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, emphasised that and so
do

UK Government support research into task-shifting. DfID has
commissioned a cost-effectiveness study on using community health
workers to deliver essential health services, and the ReBUILD research
programme looks at opportunities to reallocate health worker
responsibilities in fragile and post-conflict situations. An
overarching policy question for this research is: can they be a
cost-effective investment for MDG progress? If so, can a defiant set of
competency-based roles and functions, founded on a strong evidence
base, be specified to maximise value for money and health systems
requirements for effective
scaling-up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-25T18:24:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000068">How
might things move further forward, given that we are already strongly
supporting this in a number of countries? This November, there will be
a Global Forum on Human Resources for Health in Brazil, convened by the
Global Health Workforce Alliance and hosted by the Government of
Brazil. This will be 
<?notus-xml column=231?>an important opportunity to ensure that the human resources for health
agenda remains relevant to current global health policy discussions.
Task-shifting will undoubtedly form part of this. We are playing our
role in the run-up to this conference and looking forward to hearing
the evidence brought to it. This will be a chance to map and share, in
the way that the noble Lord, Lord Crisp,
outlined.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032530000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-gc0001.htm#13032530000069">In
conclusion, I thank all noble Lords for taking part in this debate, and
even more for all the work they are doing, nationally and
internationally, to ensure that, wherever people need medical
assistance or healthcare of one sort or another, we work across
barriers to do 
<?notus-xml column=232?>everything possible to maximise their chance of receiving such support.
DfID will continue to work with developing countries, to support them

and Security Review (SDSR), announced in October 2010, marked the start
of the process of transforming defence and identified the need for
rationalisation of the defence estate. This included the sale of
surplus land and buildings and the delivery of associated running cost
reductions. The Army Basing Plan announcement by the Secretary of State
on 5 March 2013, enabling the return from Germany and implementation of
Army 2020, indicated that there would be a further announcement
concerning other changes elsewhere in the Ministry of Defence (MoD)
estate across the UK.</hs_para>

number of changes have occurred on the defence estate that justified a
further review of the basing options for Lightning II. This review has
concluded that RAF Marham is the most appropriate station for the main
operating base. Given that RAF Lossiemouth will now host three
squadrons of Typhoon and given the altered drawdown profile and out of
service date for Tornado (in line with the SDSR decision to concentrate
our fast jet fleet on Typhoon and Lightning II ), RAF Marham will have
sufficient capacity for the basing of Lightning II, which will be
operated jointly by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. Further
work will now be carried out to determine the precise investment
requirements as the base transitions to support Lightning
II.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303254000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-wms0001.htm#1303254000023"><I>Drawdown

industry sites should be considered further, and discounting the other
types. However, based on the findings of the public consultation,
alongside recent legal advice, it has been decided that the
process of selecting a specific site for the interim storage of ILW
should consider all UK nuclear licensed and authorised sites
that might be suitable. This will therefore include MoD sites, industry

Service Children’s Schools (North West Europe) Defence Agency
and the Service Children’s Education Authority. The SCE mission
statement is to provide a coherent and co-ordinated education service

operating as a self-contained business unit has been diluted by recent
changes to the defence operating model, in particular the
centralisation of MoD corporate services. These changes, coupled with
tighter manpower controls being applied to the agency (in common with
all areas of the MoD), have meant that the efficient and effective
delivery of agency objectives is now much more dependent on decisions
taken elsewhere within the MoD. Moreover, the SCE operating context is
changing significantly. The drawdown of British Forces from Germany
will see the number of SCE schools reduce, on current
numbers, to 12. Managing this transformation without compromising
educational standards (either in those schools that are closing or
those that remain) will require sound policy decisions rooted in
educational realities and informed directly by the needs of children
and service families. The continued separation of policy-making from
delivery, as required by the agency constrict is therefore no longer
helpful.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1303254000164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130325-wms0001.htm#1303254000164">The
SCE title will remain, so that the sense of a shared identity is
retained by schools. The change will have no impact on teaching staff.
Some rationalisation

Initial savings are estimated to be in the region of £180,000
