Lexden:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend will be aware of the
deep concern that exists in Northern Ireland over this issue, which is
taking so long to bring to a conclusion. I welcome very much the news
that he gave us about the forthcoming meeting. Since the Republic of
Ireland has a corporation tax rate of 12.5%, it is widely felt that
Northern Ireland needs its own low rate to help it to compete for new
inward investment. Will my noble friend confirm that there is
widespread support among businessmen and employers in the Province for
the devolution of corporation tax to the Assembly, and that all the
main parties are in favour of it? Have their views been fully taken
into account? Finally, I pay tribute to my noble friend and his
colleagues for their commitment to rebalancing the Northern Ireland
economy by stimulating the growth of the private sector, which the
Province needs so

been taken of views expressed from many quarters. However, the
complication, as the noble Lord will be aware, is that if the Northern
Ireland Assembly were to cut the rate of corporation tax significantly,
its own budget would have to be cut by an equivalent

Government have taken on board the recommendations of the Silk
commission, which, in the context of corporation tax, recommended for
Wales that, if Northern Ireland were to have corporation tax powers, so
should the National Assembly for Wales? Given that the Government have
welcomed the Silk commission’s first report, will he confirm

Browne of Belmont:</Member></B> My Lords, will the Minister confirm
that the Government will take steps to ensure that any reduction in

proliferation of artificial tax avoidance arrangements such as the

that there would be widespread concern that, if corporation tax was
devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Scottish Government
would wish to be treated in a similar fashion? If that were the case,
by how much would the budget of Scotland have to be reduced from
central moneys if corporation tax in Scotland was reduced to 12.5%?

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, it would not really be at the discretion
of the First Minister of Scotland because the Azores criteria mean that
if there is a differential cut of tax the region or nation that bears
that cut has to take the full fiscal consequences of doing so. I do not
have the figure on the cost of such a cut to Scotland. However, bear in
mind that the estimate of such a change in Northern Ireland is that
there will be a cut in its grant of between £300 million and
£400 million. I think that the noble Lord can
possibly scale that up for
Scotland.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_18_PT_1/737BB8BE5C17784607CBF883F44A7CB2F305E1B1" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 March 2013">Monday,

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, we recognise that there are
issues within the park homes industry, and the Government have
supported the Mobile Homes Bill to ensure that home owners are better
protected and that local authorities can enforce against breaches of
site licences. On the resolution of county court judgments, these are
not monitored and the civil courts only provide a forum in which
individuals can resolve their disputes. However, the Government believe
that an effective enforcement system is important and reforms have been
made to strengthen these
methods<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T14:46:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Graham of Edmonton:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the
Minister for his reply, as far as it goes. Is he aware that last year a
park home owner admitted or acknowledged to the Communities and Local
Government Select Committee that he had £150,000 standing
against his name as unpaid? Does the Minister recall that in the West
Country a family of park home owners have £150,000 against their
names? Earlier this year, the Isle of Wight dealt with this matter and
two park home owners, who have form, were convicted on 11 counts. They
were then fined £300,000, and according to the local
authority’s press release £275,000 was for compensation.

acknowledged, the Government are taking steps in this regard. Again, I
highlight some of the methods we have looked at. The civil courts offer
several enforcement methods, including warrants of execution,
attachment of earnings, third-party debt orders, charging orders and
orders for sale. We have also looked at the ways by which debtors
should be providing means. For example, people can apply for orders to
obtain information. As I have already said, the Government recognise
that effective enforcement is crucial to ensuring a successful civil
justice system. However, we are not planning a return to imposing
prison sentences for debtors who do not pay their
debts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T14:48:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

friend. There are more than 85,000 park homes across 2,000 sites and
such instances occur. That is why the Government are taking steps to
tackle site owners who take advantage of tenants and then reregister
themselves as another company. Through the changes we are bringing
forward, we are ensuring that local authorities will issue licences to
directors who apply to set up other companies, therefore giving them
greater control over the issuing of such licences to people who have
been found to be neglectful of their responsibility to their

However, that does not mean that we support the pricing of young

Some of the measures we are thinking of have a cost and could have an
adverse impact, perhaps meaning that young drivers do not bother with a
driving licence at all. Therefore, we have to be very careful about
what measures we put in place. As to the noble Lord’s
substantive point about the cost of insurance, we are well aware of
this. At a previous encounter, I said that my right honourable friend
the Secretary of State was shortly to have a meeting with the insurance
industry. We intend to hold a further meeting with the motor insurance

ensure that in government discussions with the insurance companies, the

Soley:</Member></B> I put it to the Minister that the royal charter, a
draft of which I read today, is statutory underpinning. I understand
the problem that he has about the timing, but we should not worry too
much about that. The central message is that we need the agreement of
the whole of Parliament to take this forward, if only to give the
public the confidence in the press that they need. We also need to
remind the press that this is an opportunity for it to change
the culture that has done it so much damage over the years.
I say that as someone who introduced the Freedom and Responsibility of
the Press Bill 23 years—nearly a quarter of a
century—ago. Much of what was in that Bill is in a combination
of the royal charter and the Leveson report. Therefore, let us work
together jointly and give the press the opportunity that it needs to
improve its
standards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T15:06:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T15:06:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000076"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Gardiner of Kimble" PimsId="5760" UID="1303189000302" xid="2035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000302">Lord
Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> What the noble Lord has said is a
powerful statement of a view that many will share; I certainly do. This
is an opportunity for the press to change some of the practices that
have occurred but should never have occurred. The important thing is
not just that we think of the victims but that we ensure that we have
in place something that means these things do not happen again. What
the noble Lord said certainly chimes with me. I am sorry that the

operate within. I think my English grammar is going a bit awry here,
but I will explain to the House where we are in terms of what is
happening elsewhere and here, and I will then explain what it means for
us today. The House is of course fully aware that my right honourable
friend the Prime Minister, together with the leaders of the other main
parties, has asked the Speaker of another place for an emergency debate
this afternoon on the matter of the party leaders’ response to
the report from Lord Justice Leveson on the culture, practices and
ethics of the press. Until that debate has started, we will not know
absolutely for certain what has been agreed between the party leaders.
That is not saying that there is no agreement, it is saying that as a
matter of practice we will give them the courtesy of being able to set
out what they believe may be contained within that agreement. Until
then, we simply have nothing on which we can proceed
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000084">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T15:13:56"></hs_TimeCode>

certainty about when this House will be able not only to listen to the

that the debate on the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill will start
at 5.30 pm. In other words, we will go from this to the Motion of the

will adjourn the House further to 5.30 pm. This House will have full
opportunity to debate the amendments on Leveson, of which there are
many, at 5.30 pm. As I have said, I have discussed this with the

proper question. The noble Lord, Lord Hughes, asks about things that
are on the point. It is the case that whenever a Statement is to be
made by the Government in another place, it is offered to the
Opposition, but against the background of all the proceedings that are
taking place today, I understand that the Opposition decided not to
take the Statement. If there is another opportunity when it may be
properly taken, we will certainly look at a way of facilitating a
debate. I may be sending shivers down the spines of the business
managers here who have to schedule these matters, but I understand the
strength of feeling. There may indeed be other opportunities when we
are able to deal with the issue, but for the moment the Opposition
decided that perhaps this is not the time. I know that the noble

before the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, rises to speak. It is merely a
matter of timing. The noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, has ownership of most
of the amendments in the first group. The reason it is convenient to do
it in this way is that the House would not have a chance to listen to
the leaders by the time that any mover of those amendments decided
whether to withdraw or even to press them. Again, it is simply a matter
of timing so that we all have an opportunity to listen to what the
leaders set out. Just the opening remarks alone will make it too late

Statement being made in the House of Commons on what has happened in
Cyprus. People’s savings are apparently going to be raided by
the Government. That is a very important  
<?notus-xml column=424?>matter which has implications not only for the eurozone but perhaps
throughout the EU and the world. Bearing in mind what the noble
Baroness has said about the timing of the debate, I know the House of
Commons well and I know that when it gets hold of the Statement on the
press, there could be a very long debate indeed. There is no guarantee
that we will get the timetable that the noble Baroness and the

Royall of Blaisdon:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may say two
things. First, it would be an excellent idea if the Minister, at the
beginning of the proceedings on the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform
Bill, could inform the House by means of a Statement or whatever
exactly what has been happening in the Commons. That would be extremely
useful. On the Statement on Cyprus, as is usual, the Government
informed Her Majesty’s Opposition that there would be a
Statement on Cyprus and we were asked whether we wished to take
it.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T15:19:40"></hs_TimeCode>
Notwithstanding the importance of the situation in Cyprus, and not
underestimating the importance of the Statement, it was offered to us
before we knew of the changes to the procedures today, and the
Statement would not have come until much later on. We deemed it
important for the House to discuss and debate the issues pertaining to
Leveson on the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill. That is why we
did not ask for the Statement to be repeated. It does not undermine the
importance of that issue at all and I will support the noble Baroness
the Chief Whip in ensuring that we have a debate on this issue in the

procedure whereby we at least have the courtesy of giving notice of
such matters as Statements. We offer Statements to the
Opposition as soon as they are known and we wait for a response. That
response was given against the background of what was known at the time
today. Negotiations were clearly in play both in this place and in
another place. We cannot at this stage simply turn things on their
head. However, I do understand the view of probably the majority of
this House that at some stage there should be a debate on the matter.
It is clearly something that is not going to be easily resolved, so it
is not something that has to be done today, but I will actively look
into the matter. In doing so I know that this House is keen to devote

explained earlier, if the Motion in the name of my noble friend Lady

will—then we will go seamlessly into it. However, what I expect
to happen is that the Motion of my noble friend Lady Tonge will take a
shortish amount of time. She may find some supporters she did not
expect, but after that we will adjourn. It will be on the monitors, but

they wait for this hugely momentous Motion, Statement or whatever it is

placing this Motion of Regret before the House, first, I declare an
interest. Nearly nine years ago my daughter was electrocuted in her own
kitchen in front of two small boys aged two and four, with no one else
in the house. We discovered that this had happened because of dangerous
electrical work carried out when her kitchen was extended and refitted
four years previously. I will not go into detail; the full story
remains on the Electrical Safety Council website alongside other tragic
stories of electrical accidents, including another young
mother—also with two little children, also alone at the
time—electrocuted in the bath of a rented holiday cottage
because of faulty wiring in the bathroom. These stories remain as a
warning to householders about the danger of electricity in the home and
to people doing electrical work without proper
training.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000110">I was
amazed at that time to find out that electricians were required to work
only to guidelines and that there were no statutory regulations
controlling their work. When I approached the Labour Minister at the
time, Phil Hope, I discovered to my delight that his department was
aware of this problem and was working on additions to the building
regulations. These additions are now known as Part P, and required
electrical work to be done or inspected by a registered electrician and
notification to be sent to the building regulations department of the
local council, to ensure that the work was done properly. I was invited
to help with the campaign to introduce Part P and to publicise the new
regime, which of course I did willingly. I have since become a patron
of Electrical Safety
Council.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000111">Part P
regulations have been protecting us since 2005. The introduction of
residual current detectors—RCDs—has been a great safety
measure but, again, there is a question about how many homes are
covered and whether the devices they have are adequate. A poll of 4,000
registered installers in 2011 found that 53% believed that
the standard of electrical installation work had improved under Part
P.</hs_para>

the coalition Government decided in their bonfire of the regulations
that Part P must go and with it the regulations for electrical
installations in the home. Can the Minister tell us what pressure the
Government were under to scrap Part P? Was it pressure from a few
disgruntled, unqualified cowboys who did not want to be registered or
have their work inspected? Some of them certainly wrote to me. Why was
the decision made on Part P in particular? No one has suggested
scrapping the regulations for gas fitters. They are equally dangerous,
why the
electricians?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000113" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000113">After
protest from safety campaigners, the Department for Communities and
Local Government agreed to go out to consultation and announced last
December that minor electrical work undertaken in kitchens, in
bathrooms, more than 0.6 of a metre away from water, and outdoors
should no longer be notifiable or subject to inspection. Work done in
the very places in the home where electricity and water can be close
together—and dangerously so—the Government have decided
needs no regulation.

statistics are sketchy, the impact assessment published by the
department in December showed that since the introduction of Part P
regulations, 2.3 deaths per year from electrocution alone
have been prevented and, in addition, up to a 30% reduction of mains
wiring incidents. In terms of electrical fires, they are estimated to
have prevented 2.6 deaths a year and cut by 15% the number of domestic
incidents due to faulty electrical equipment. Twenty-seven thousand
contractors have had their work inspected for safety on an annual basis
in the past nine years and sales of electrical safety testing equipment
have gone up by over 100 per cent. I hope, too, that the skills and
expertise required by a good electrician are now being valued more as
more and more of them seek registration from an approved body so that
their work does not have to be inspected. This is all a result of the
Part P
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000115" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000115">Since

department, in its wisdom, has concluded that it is not possible to say
whether Part P has delivered health and safety benefits, and yet the
Minister, Don Foster, in the Westminster Hall debate last September
said that the Government do not want changes to Part P to
unduly diminish safety. At an extra session of the Select Committee for
Communities and Local Government two days ago, the same confused
message came over, with the additional nugget of information that
scrapping the regulations would save £14 million. We were also
told that the building regulations challenge panel would oversee what
was going on in the industry. How much will that panel cost and will it
challenge shoddy electrical work? Where does the figure of
£14 million come from? It all sounds a bit confused
to me.</hs_para>

undertaken by the department, we are told, showed that of the 158
respondents, 65% supported making more electrical work
non-notifiable, but that was the response to an open

specifically, and low-risk areas of bathrooms, a much higher percentage
opposed scrapping the regulations. It is also worth noting that
although electrical contractors supported the proposals to scrap Part
P, building control bodies were not supportive of reductions to
notifiable work and the Which? organisation and the Trading Standards
Institute were also opposed.</hs_para>

leaves great cause for concern. Refitting kitchens is big business and
very popular with householders. It often requires adjustment to
electrical wiring, as happened in my daughter’s kitchen. In
2004, the year she died, an impact assessment carried out by the
Department for Communities and Local Government showed that some of the
worst electrical work at that time had been carried out by kitchen
fitters. Recent statistics for 2010-11 on electrical fires originating
in the kitchen listed 14,700 incidents. The kitchen is a dangerous area
and surely electrical work there should remain notifiable, as it should
in the bathroom and outdoors where water and electricity are also in
close contact. There is no requirement, either, for do-it-yourself
outlets, such as Homebase and B&amp;Q, to insist or even recommend that
their products should be installed by a registered and qualified
electrician. I ask the Minister: why not? How do the Government intend
to monitor these changes over the two-year period of the review that
they have announced? Will she promise that Part P regulations can be
restored if
necessary?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000120">The

admit that I gave little thought to broader regulations and the impact
they have until 2006, when I moved from the Northern Ireland Office to
become Minister at the DCLG and was told that I was responsible for,
among other things, building regulations. If I am honest, I was not
exactly overjoyed at the thought, yet my view quickly changed because
it is through building 
<?notus-xml column=429?>regulations that we set standards. Their purpose is
not rules and regulations for their own sake but for reasons of health,
safety, practicality, equality in ensuring good access to public
buildings, and, more recently, the environment. Those are sound,
practical reasons for regulations, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Tonge,
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000123">Regulations
also create a level playing field for the building and associated
industries. I clearly recall small, medium and some large companies,
and individuals, telling me why good regulation was important to them
and their business. It sets standards and prevents good companies and
individuals being undercut by cowboys reducing standards. It is
important to get the right balance and to be proportionate, providing
regulations which offer protection to consumers and businesses but
which, at the same time, do not impose unreasonable or unsustainable
costs. Whenever building regulations are introduced, that is the
guiding principle, as it was in the debates leading to the introduction
of Part P regulations in 2005 that are the focus of today’s
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000124" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000124">My
understanding is that negotiations on this regulation of electrical
installation started in 1995 following a recommendation from the
construction industry deregulation taskforce. That led eventually to
the Part P regulations. It would be helpful, as the noble Baroness,
Lady Tonge, asked, if the Minister could clarify the reason for
reviewing Part P now to make the changes that we are seeing. On page 18
of the impact assessment, there is a summary of costs and benefits of
the current operation of Part P that appears to show a significant net
benefit of more than £75 million. The analysis also suggests
that these benefits would build up over time, although that cannot be
accurately measured. The Minister, Don Foster, told the House of

comprehensive and has changed over time. However, in the absence of
that information, the Government’s own impact assessment says
that Part P has prevented more than 2.5 deaths each year from
electrical shocks, 30% of mains wiring incidents and 15% of portable
appliance incidents. With that number of deaths and that number of
incidents being prevented, it is a very serious matter that the
Government wish to remove that protection.</hs_para>

building control bodies expressed most concern and were most strongly

Foster, conceded that the safety implications would be reviewed after
two years. I am amazed that that has not already been agreed, given the
seriousness of these issues. He also asked the committee for advice and
help in putting forward indicators for measuring the effects of the
changes. Therefore, the Minister admitted to the Select Committee that
the Government did not know what they would be looking at when he
agreed to review this policy after two years. Will the Minister confirm
that the review will take place after two years and that there will be
a debate on its findings?</hs_para>

have two further brief issues to raise. The first is the changes to the
local authority building control system. Is the Minister really
confident that the changes proposed to that system will not lead to a
lowering of standards? The Explanatory Memorandum refers to the
probability of a risk of non-compliance with building regulations, but
that risk is lower when builders and developers know that that work
will be subject to inspection by local authority building inspectors.
Was any evidence sought about whether there are different risks of
non-compliance in different areas or with different builders,
contractors or kinds of properties, or will it now be for local
authorities to choose when they make inspections at different stages
depending on where they consider the risk is in each development? That
seems quite an ad hoc approach. It gives no certainty to developers and
builders that their work will be inspected and it will not be
comprehensive.</hs_para>

interested in the consultation responses from local authorities and
their building control departments and in whether the LGA raised any
concerns. One of the issues is resources. The Minister will
be  
<?notus-xml column=432?>aware that, with cuts to local authority finance, there is huge pressure
on local authorities. The Minister and I have previously discussed this
at the Dispatch Box. Have the Government undertaken any analysis of the
capacity of local government building control departments to meet this
new approach?</hs_para>

the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, and I pose a number of questions to the
Minister. The key issue is the Government’s confidence that
these measures do not undo the progress that has been made by having
far better safety in the home and in having electrical installations
that do not increase risk. The Government say that the changes achieve
a reasonable balance of risk, but the question is whether that is a
price worth paying. These regulations were brought in for a reason. We
have heard that they have saved lives and have made safety in the home
significantly better, yet the Government are relying on evidence from
the consultation, which the scrutiny committee found is not as clear
cut as it is in the Explanatory Memorandum, to make significant
changes. I hope that the Minister can give us some reassurance and
information today that justifies the approach that the Government are
taking.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_18_PT_1/F6F0F5FE22C88F217C56250EF2D35F2C0876249C" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 March 2013">Monday,

update the House on this important issue and to deal with the many
questions, or as many of them as I can, that have been raised this
afternoon. Noble Lords may also wish to note the important report from
the Communities and Local Government Select Committee, which was
published last year in the other place and which has been referred to,
and that on 11 February my right honourable friend the Building

are relatively few building regulations in total. Last year the
Government publicly consulted on changes to them in England and on
associated technical guidance in the approved documents. Prior to that
the Government asked the building industry and other interested parties
to share their ideas about what needed to be improved or extended,
where it would be possible to reduce the regulatory burdens, and how
even better levels of compliance might be delivered. Having sought
these views, and taking account of the responses to the Your Freedom
consultation and my department’s Cutting Red Tape websites, a
range of proposals were developed and subjected to a further, detailed
consultation. I can now confirm that those consultations and changes
were discussed with building control systems and local authorities. The
changes are expected to deliver an even better and more cost-effective
way of ensuring that buildings remain safe.</hs_para>

to the specific issue of electrical safety.
Discussions with trade bodies within the electrical installation
industry and with individual electrical contractors show that they
continue to value the national minimum standards provided by the
building regulations. However, where there are concerns, we ought to
address them. Part P of the building regulations, which deals, as the
noble Baronesses said, with electrical installation in dwellings, has
come under some criticism for its procedural complexity and
bureaucracy. In fact, some respondents called for the provision to be
completely revoked. The question that needed to be addressed was
whether Part P could be simplified while retaining the safety benefits
that it has undoubtedly brought
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000141" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000141">Currently,
home owners can face building control fees of upwards of £240
for simple electrical work, such as putting an additional plug socket
in a kitchen, approved by a local authority. In practice, such fees
also prove a strong disincentive to those carrying out these small
jobs—including home owners, who often do it themselves—to
inform the local authority that the work is being carried out in the
first place. Even for the majority of work that is carried out by
electrical installers who are registered to certify their own work,
notification imposes additional bureaucracy, as they have to tell the
local authorities about the work they have been doing. This leads to
consumers, who themselves are not competent in electrical work, relying
on somebody else who may not follow the notification rules. Therefore,
the scope of notifiable work has been changed, but otherwise this is a
reduction in the amount of red tape. By law, all electrical work must
still be safe, and this is most easily demonstrated by following the
British Standard for electrical installations—BS7671—and
the Institution of Engineering and Technology’s wiring
regulations.</hs_para>

notification requirements focused on higher-risk jobs such as the
installation of new circuits or work undertaken in the vicinity of
showers and baths. The noble Baroness rightly drew attention to the
problems caused by mixing water and electricity. This reflects the
additional technical requirements applied by the British Standard in
bathrooms and the skills required for working inside a consumer
unit—that is a fuse box, for novices. In kitchens, notification
will be necessary only when a new circuit is provided from the fuse
box. When notification is not required, we would expect the work to be
carried out to the appropriate safety standard, which I have just read
out. Quite simply, it still needs to comply with
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000143"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Tonge" PimsId="4873" UID="1303189000334" xid="1888" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000334">Baroness
Tonge:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for giving way. I think
there is some confusion because, at the moment, there are statutory
requirements in regulations for electricians to do things safely. What
the Minister is referring to are advisory guidelines for electricians
to work, which happened nine years ago, before Part P came in. The
guidelines may be there but they do not have to follow them. This is
the problem: we are going back to the old days. They do not have to
follow the guidelines because they are just
guidelines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T15:56:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000144"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hanham" PimsId="3741" UID="1303189000335" xid="1742" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000335">Baroness
Hanham:</Member></B> I shall pursue my speech and make sure that we
cover those points when I get to the end. The previous regime of
notification tended to 
<?notus-xml column=434?>penalise the competent, conscientious installer with additional
paperwork, while the unscrupulous installer could
ignore these procedures with impunity. The changes that have been made
reflect a more pragmatic approach. However, while the notification
requirements are being reduced, the department will work with the
registration scheme providers and trade bodies to raise general
awareness of the safety issues and legal requirements, and how to meet
them. Promotion of the competent person schemes, to which I do not
think either noble Baroness referred, is now a requirement imposed on
scheme providers by my department. My officials are working with the
forum of competent person scheme operators, including the Electrical
Safety Council, to see how the marketing message can be improved and
co-ordinated. We will monitor the impact of the changes to Part P to
make sure that we are better informed about how this work is
going.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000145" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000145">The
competent person schemes now have around 40,000 registered electrical
installers. Professional electrical installers will stay with the
register. It is still in their interest to be able to self-certify
their work as compliant with building regulations and not have to pay

householder. Whenever a registered electrical installer is used, they
also benefit from the knowledge that the work has been carried out to
standards of quality and safety. The new Part P will retain the core
benefits that have been achieved while keeping administrative costs and
burdens to a reasonable minimum. The indicators that can help identify

P regulation has done an enormous amount of good for the electrical

is being introduced to replace will be any less extensive. We have not
been given any figures and I do not see how the challenge panel and the
monitoring will be less expensive than the existing system. I thank the

conclusion of 70 years of inaction, despite seven major reports. It is

what the people of this country
want.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000163">In his
report, Lord Justice Leveson proposed a framework that provided for the
continuation of self-regulation by the press, but with a legal
guarantee that self-regulation would be effective, independent and
continue to meet high standards. However, the role of the law, the
legal underpinning, was to be limited to setting up a body whose task
would be to recognise the self-regulatory system and check it once
every three years. Lord Justice Leveson said that that was essential to
ensure that, despite all the protestations of a willingness to change
and countless expressions of good intentions, the press did not once
again slip back into their old ways, as they have done after all the
other inquiries and
reports.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000164">There
is no doubt that some parts of the press are attempting to derail these
proposals, despite the fact that they deliver the Leveson principles,
ensure that those who are wronged have an effective and cheap route to
redress, and ensure a free and vibrant press. However, implementing the
Leveson proposals does not censor the press. There is no recommendation
for pre-publication regulation. It would not create “a slippery
slope” to “a government-controlled press”. It
would not restrict reporting or investigative journalism in the public
interest. Quite the reverse. As Nick Davies, the Guardian investigative
reporter who largely uncovered the phone hacking story, wrote after the
report was
published:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1303189000193" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000193">“From
a reporter’s point of view, there is no obvious problem with the
core of Leveson’s report, his system of ‘independent
self-regulation’ ... There is a nightmare here, but it is for
the old guard of Fleet Street. To lose control of the regulator is to
lose their licence to do exactly as they
please”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="1303189000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000165">The
families who suffered press intrusion and gross violations of their
privacy have been pressing for the changes that will in future protect
people from what happened to them. The harassment and character
assassinations laid bare before the Leveson inquiry were not mere
technical breaches of the rules or victimless crimes. For many of the
victims, appearing at the inquiry meant reliving the pain and trauma of
their abuse by the press, but they did so with enormous courage and
determination; and the stories they told made many people feel moved,
incredulous, appalled and very, very angry. They included people such
as: the McCanns who were falsely accused of murdering their missing
child; the parents of Milly Dowler, who were given false hope that
their daughter was still alive; John Tulloch, the 7/7 bomb survivor who
was tricked into giving an interview; Christopher Jeffries, who was
falsely accused of the murder of Joanna Yates; and the noble Baroness,
Lady Hollins, whose daughter Abigail was hounded for stories following
her tragic stabbing while out walking with her son.</hs_para>

is important to remember that the voices heard in the
inquiry represented just a small sample of press harassment
and misrepresentation that became commonplace, week in and week out,
for those struggling with tragedies in their lives who never sought to
become the story. We should also remember that the public
overwhelmingly support the establishment of an independent regulator,
backed by law. That was borne out by a series of polls conducted prior
to the publication of the report by the Media Standards Trust, Hacked
Off, the Carnegie Trust and the IPPR. YouGov’s latest survey for
the <I>Sunday Times</I> finds that 90% want a system that forces
newspapers to print corrections when they say things that are not true.
A smaller but still substantial majority wants to punish newspapers
that opt out of a new system of regulation; and 62% want
such papers to face damages of up to £1 million when
they are found guilty of
libel.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303189000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#1303189000167">The
sad fact is that the Leveson inquiry should never have been necessary,

pointing out that while my amendment ensures that Ministers cannot
tamper with the new system—for example, by watering it down

Soley:</Member></B> I do not wish to delay the House very long but I
have a very long history as regards this matter. I want to make only
three brief points. First, as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, has said,
this is a compromise. It was not the first that I would have come to
but the negotiations have led to it being much better. I certainly do
not want to make the best the enemy of the good. This is good. That
leads me to my second point. It is profoundly important that all
Members of both Houses give the agreement as much support as possible
in order to convey to the media that this is the will of the people of
this country speaking through their
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:50:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031819000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#13031819000020">As
the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, has indicated, it has been the job of the
press to hold power to account. But one of the things that have gone
wrong over the past 40 or 50 years is that the power of the press has
been abused in too many cases. They have done some wonderful work and
there are some wonderful journalists but some journalists have betrayed
that trust. Some editors and owners have also betrayed it and it became
the abuse of power. That abuse of power had to be held to account. I
have given evidence to many committees and I produced my own Bill some
20 or so years ago, which tried to draw attention to this issue.
Getting to this point has been a long, hard journey and we should all
be

final point is the most important. I would almost plead with the press
to recognise that this is an opportunity for a change in the culture of
the press. What let the press down was an acceptance of standards,
attitudes and values within the press that would not have been
tolerated outside the press. They let themselves down in that way and
not enough of them—although, very credibly, one or two
journalists have been particularly outstanding—challenged it.
Now, we need to put that behind us and to say that the culture of the
press can change.</hs_para>

which allowed people to meet together and to put

“press barons” came in somewhere around the end of the

it returned to public debate via the anachronism of the royal charter.

congratulate the leaders of all three parties on reaching an historic
agreement to put the building blocks in place to enable the
establishment and recognition of an independent and effective press
regulator.
Before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:53:40"></hs_TimeCode> Lord
Justice Leveson reported, many people assumed that he would recommend a
statutory body to hold the press to the standards they profess to
believe in and statutory compulsion for newspapers to join it. However,
Lord Justice Leveson did no such thing. Instead, he recommended that
the press be given yet another chance to set up their own voluntary
self-regulator. Some victims were taken aback but accepted this as the
result of careful and diligent public inquiry. The only thing he did
ask—perhaps it is the very least he could have asked—was
for a body to be set up in law which would from time to time scrutinise
whether the industry’s new body met certain tests of
independence and effectiveness. He said that those news publishers that
met those standards should have benefits in law to give newspapers an
incentive to join. He carefully set out some recommendations to ensure
that any new body was a real regulator and not just a beefed-up version
of the Press Complaints Commission—a new body that would be
independent of those it regulates and committed to upholding standards
for the benefit of the public. These recommendations now seem to be
faithfully reflected in the royal charter, as they are in the amendment
in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, and in the amendment in
the name of the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, which may not now be
needed. The issue of exemplary damages will also need to be dealt
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031819000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#13031819000025">Some
editors have argued at every opportunity to weaken these requirements.
However, as set out in these amendments, if the industry sets up a
regulator that meets Lord Justice Leveson’s criteria, the
recognition body would recognise it. If it does not meet the criteria,
it would not be recognised. It is as simple as that. I have no doubt
about the sincerity of those who said that the Press Complaints
Commission was effective  
<?notus-xml column=444?>or of those who say that a new regulator could be
established without this mild level of scrutiny. But the time for
take-my-word-for-it regulation is over.</hs_para>

Lordships know that my family was deeply affected by the unrestrained

been hesitant about speaking out on this issue for fear of the

I can regale my grandchildren about for some time to come. A royal
charter is, of course, a sovereign prerogative. How far can that

me test my doubt in this way. The creation of Peers, as we well know,
is the prerogative of Her Majesty the Queen. Any decision taken by
either House to circumscribe that authority to the slightest degree

to this situation equally so? In other words, any decision by both

radical changes and may well emerge in a completely different form. The

time. Perhaps we could have an explanation of how it will work in
practice. Our understanding, gained from student days, is that no
Parliament can bind its successor. If another Parliament, by a simple

raise a rather more down to earth and practical question for the
Minister to respond to. I imagine that I am not the only
person who has not been able to pore over the detail of the proposed
royal charter, but I am aware that two of the things that Lord Justice

that it should be both independent and effective. I wish to address the

Wheatcroft:</Member></B> My Lords, this compromise is to be welcomed,
and I suspect that the majority of newspaper groups will take the
differing interpretations being offered to enable them to sign up to
it. It makes no difference whether it is underpinned by statute or by a
royal charter protected by statute. Whether it is a dab or a little bit
of statute, a workable compromise is being offered, and I welcome it.
As somebody who spent a long career in newspapers, I have been appalled
to learn—and it has been a process of learning—just what
terrible things went on. We should remember that many of the worst
things that newspaper groups got up to were criminal. What was wrong
was not just their behaviour, but the failure of the police to deal
with those crimes. What is going on now is far too late. It was the
very close relationships between newspapers and some sections of the
police which allowed things to fester for far too
long.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031819000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#13031819000054">It<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
may well be that the climate has now changed, but it is not Leveson
that will deal with that. Leveson—or the royal charter and the
regulatory bodies that will come about as a result of that—will
deal with a much greater wariness on the part of the press as to what
and what not to write. That is not a bad thing; a degree of care beyond
that which has been exercised in the past would be welcome. Although
the damages may well be exemplary in some situations, believe me, what
will frighten the press more than anything is the prospect of being
directed to publish an apology or a correction 
<?notus-xml column=449?>with exactly the same prominence as they gave the original story. That
will really make people think very hard. My question regards the
internet, because what goes on in the media now, as Lord McAlpine would
vouch, what goes on in the media now is far more online than it was
even 10 years ago, and the trend is moving very fast. Can we expect

tabled today. In other words, I hope that this amendment will be passed
by this House today, and then by the House of Commons, by simple
majorities. It is therefore open to any future Parliament, if it has
the guts or is foolish enough to do so, to bring an amendment to repeal
it on a similar basis. The effect of this is simply to safeguard that
which is in the royal charter, which is protected. However, of itself,

is difficult to think of a better solution that would be more viable.

support the amendment and the course of action which is enshrined in

Reid of Cardowan:</Member></B> Before the Minister sits down, let me
just say that I am absolutely sure that the questions that have been
asked by noble Lords are predicated on their desire that this will be
successful. 
<?notus-xml column=453?>However, they are also asked in the context, as the
noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, pointed out, of those who may well decide that
they wish to oppose applying the rules of this charter. Therefore, it
is absolutely essential that this is thought through in fine detail. If
we do not know whether it applies to Scotland—where,
incidentally, one of our highest-selling newspapers is printed and
published—if we are not sure whether we can bind successive
Parliaments and if we are not sure whether constitutionally we can
constrain the sovereign through a royal charter, it seems that,
although we have absolute agreement on what we want to do, we may not
have the nuts and bolts firmly pinned down. The reason why this is
important is that, if there is any lacuna or window of opportunity
through which people can remove themselves from the process, we should
understand that some people will do so. I hope that, before this
returns to us, the Minister will make sure that every single dot and
comma is bolted down so that we have confidence not only in the will of
the people and the will of Parliament, but in the fact that we have
produced something that is operationally
effective.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#13031837000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness O'Neill of Bengarve" PimsId="2185" UID="13031837000180" xid="1372" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#13031837000180">Baroness

replies, like many other noble Lords I have been trying to clarify
where we are. I think that it is the case that the detour through the
royal charter, which is where the two-thirds majority is mentioned,
means that an ordinary vote in both Houses of Parliament would not be
sufficient. This royal charter is an instrument of the Privy Council.
We are not voting to create a royal charter, as that is beyond our
powers. It is the Privy Council that will create it. We are indicating,
as it were, a mechanism of access to that which it is intended the
Privy Council will create at a future

question that the industry could indeed side-step the whole of this

protection—namely, you cannot amend and you cannot
dissolve—could be rendered nugatory by the industry simply
saying, “We are going to set up a parallel, separate

made by noble Lords obviously need to be picked up and looked at by the
Minister. He has promised several letters, so I will not try and
anticipate them, but I think that several of the questions bear on a
point that was made earlier, which I would like to endorse. What we are
looking at today is, of course, a compromise. It is a compromise in the
best interests of the country. Indeed, it led my noble friend Lord
Lipsey to say that this was a good day for democracy, not just because
this was a step forward in the right way but because it was something
in which we could perceive, behind the appurtenances of government and
opposition, a real willingness to try to work together to create
something that will last and will be substantial in addressing problems

although they can work, will often leave one or two things unsettled.
My noble friend Lord Reid and others have pointed out one or two that
we really have to address. That is something that we can do, although
time is short. The rationale for attempting to amend this Bill, and
hopefully successfully doing so, was such that it was too obvious for
us to ignore, but it raises questions of timescale. In order to get the
Bill processed and brought into law, so that it underpins the work in
the royal charter, we have to adhere to the timetable. I accept the
points that have been made. I think that the Minister will take them
away and do what he can with them. There are simple answers to a number
of the points that were raised, but it will be important for those to
be available to us as we see the process of the Bill going forward.
There will be opportunities for that to be
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#13031837000013">I would
just like to say three things. First, I feel bad at not having thanked
a number of people for the work that has been done in bringing forward
the arrangements that we are considering today. Primary among these,
the noble Lord, Lord Fowler—we should have acknowledged this
when he was speaking—has been an inspiration to many of us. I
pay tribute to him and the constant work that he has put in to get us
to where we are today. We have learnt a lot from him and we hope that
he will see us through to the end of the
journey.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#13031837000014">The
noble Lord mentioned—I echo his support—the work done by
Hacked Off. The organisation started off as a rather odd collection of
people but it found a rationale in that it provided two things that
were really important. The first was that it recognised early on that
the people who had the most of a lock on this process were the victims,
but that they did not have an organisation. Hacked Off has provided
that for them in a positive and supportive way, which was not to shut
off the words that we wanted to hear from those who had been so badly
affected by this whole process but to encourage and empower them to put
across their points of view in such an extraordinarily effective
way—we heard a small part of that from the noble Baroness, Lady
Hollins, today. Hacked Off should be given a huge amount of support for
what it has
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#13031837000015">It is
also important to mention that, although this has largely been a
creature of the major parties, the minor parties, from which we heard
some evidence, were a key part as well. We would not have got to where
we are today if they had not registered firmly in the last 48 or so
hours that they had strong views and that they needed to be part of the
solution and not ignored. I say thank you to all
those.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#13031837000016">Secondly,
as part of the process, we should also acknowledge the work of many
journalists. The noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, spoke up for many of
them and I salute what she said. She also gave us a helpful insight
into possible behaviours by those with whom she used to work and
perhaps still does. How sad that we did not hear from or have the
benefit of the advice of the noble Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord Black, who
I think appeared like ghosts at the Bar and indeed in the Chamber but
did not contribute to our debate. We are the worse off for that,
although we might speculate a little bit as to why that was the
case.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=455?><hs_para UID="13031837000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#13031837000017">My third point is simply
to say that we should recognise that in entering into this compromise
arrangement all parties have had to surrender a little bit, but in
particular we have committed to two things, which should be on the
record. First, during the passage of the Crime and Courts Bill, the
three main parties will vote together to oppose any Leveson-related
amendments unless they are agreed by all three parties. There are some
exceptions that have still to be dealt with, one of which was referred
to by the Minister. I put it to him that, as I understand it, it has
not yet been agreed that the status of the charter body should be such
that it would be outwith the responsibilities of the Freedom of
Information Act. That is very much a live issue and bears back to the
point made by my noble friend Lord Wills that it is rather odd to try
to exclude from that process a body that should be concerned with
information and information flow. Secondly, in an earlier debate, we in
this House imposed some amendments to the Defamation Bill and it has
been agreed that the clauses relating to the Leveson report in that
Bill will be removed, if necessary by all three parties voting
together. That will unblock the Bill, which, sadly, has languished and
has not been seen since we passed our amendments some time
ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0001.htm#13031837000018">I
conclude by thanking the Minister for his support on this amendment. I
have noticed that Ministers get quite attached to the Bills that they
have to deal with. The noble Viscount, Lord Younger, took over from the
noble Lord, Lord Marland, half way through the Bill and therefore
perhaps has less attachment than he otherwise would have. Nevertheless,
he has become a bit ferocious and protective of some things and I was a
bit scared that he might take that attitude to this amendment, but he
has not done so. He has been more than welcoming; he has been very
supportive and has spoken warmly in support of this amendment today and
I am very grateful to him for it.</hs_para>

debate about aspects of Leveson, not least because of the point raised
by my noble friend Lady Wheatcroft about the impact of the internet on
the provision of news in this country. Of course, it is broadband and
the technology on it that are driving forward that particular
phenomenon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000025">There
is an old joke about the man, normally in Ireland, who, when asked for
directions, replies: “If you want to get there, you don’t
want to start from here”. For me at any rate, this became a
recurring theme of our inquiry and I hope that my remarks will make
clear why.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000026">The
first reason is historical. The UK has various legacy communications
infrastructures that do not reach some areas, overlap in others, and
were built by companies, often for entirely different purposes, in
previously unconnected sectors such as telecoms, transport, energy and
cable television. There was no overall plan; none of them was conceived
and built as part of a general-purpose communications infrastructure.
This means that the UK does not start from scratch, as some other
countries have been able to. It has had to start from where, ideally,
you would not want to begin if you were setting out now to provide the
whole country with world-class, state of the art
connectivity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000027">The
second reason why the old joke chimed with me, if I might be forgiven
for labouring this old favourite, is that the Government’s
strategy started from the wrong place. We believe they did not ask the
right questions at the outset. This may have been due partly to the
context I have just described, and possibly to financial constraint as
well, but in our view, the Government’s strategy lacks just
that. There has been insufficient proper strategic analysis, which in
particular has led to a failure to recognise the real requirements of
rural and dispersed communities, which in many ways have most to gain
and hence the greatest need—but more of this
later.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000028">As your
Lordships will know, there is hardly an aspect of our daily lives that
is not touched in some way or other by the internet. It is simply
extraordinary, indeed almost miraculous, how in really quite a short
time the internet has utterly revolutionised “the way we live
now”. It has had a transformative effect on commercial and
social transactions, creating an information world sans
frontières. The possibilities seem limitless: from telemedicine
to the so-called internet of things, and everything in between. In
fact, I note that just today, speaking at a conference in San Jose,
Cisco’s Rob Lloyd, president of sales and development, 
<?notus-xml column=460?>stated that the company’s predictions indicate that the
“Internet of Everything” will create £9.6 trillion
of value for companies over the next decade, with the number of
connected devices predicted to rise to 50 billion by 2020.
In this regard, I welcome the news that the Universities and Science
Minister, my honourable friend David Willetts, has recently announced
that £6.2 million of government money will be set aside for a
competition focused on the “Internet of
Things”.</hs_para>

credit is due, the Government are to be congratulated on making
enhanced broadband provision a public policy priority. Progress is
clearly being made. Certainly it was a relief when, shortly before
Christmas, the European Commission finally granted state aid clearance
for the BDUK scheme. As I say, it is indisputable that, in many
respects, we are moving forward and more and more of our citizens are
able to access better broadband.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T18:51:35"></hs_TimeCode>, we
found during our inquiry that there is a very real possibility that
some people and businesses are being left behind badly and a digital
divide will ensue. Inadequate access to the internet and all its
benefits is causing great uncertainty, anxiety and frustration that the
benefits of the information revolution are not going to be available
for all.</hs_para>

contend that the Government have proceeded with a flawed prospectus and
that some of what looks like progress may prove illusory in the longer
term. As I have already said, we believe that there has been an
insufficient focus on rigorously thinking through questions of first
principle, and an absence of an overall vision and understanding of
pervasive broadband connectivity and its implications which are an
essential component of national infrastructure in the 21st century.
Broadband is not an optional extra; it is not a “nice to
have” luxury. It is essential and must be thought of in the same
way as we think about the road and rail networks as essential
components of today’s economy and
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000031">Government
policy appears to have become preoccupied with and derailed by the
almost mono-focus on the delivery of speed to consumers. The
Government’s specific target is to provide superfast
broadband—defined as 24 megabits per second, although that
figure has seemed over time to be a bit variable—to at least
90% of premises in this country by 2015, and to provide
universal access to standard broadband with a speed of at least 2
megabits per second by
2015.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000032">In our
view, this preoccupation has had a detrimental effect on policy-making
and the long-term national interest. I can readily understand that
committing to the delivery of certain speeds was an attractive way to
badge the policy with the public. However, in our view, the delivery of
certain speeds should not be the lodestar of policy. What is most
important is the long-term assurance that as new internet applications
emerge, everyone—and I mean everyone—will be able to
benefit, be they inhabitants of inner cities or residents in the
remotest areas of the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000033">In
our report we proposed an alternative vision for UK broadband policy
which is not target driven but identifies the establishment of the
national broadband network as a national strategic asset which has got
to be built in a way so that everyone can connect in different ways
according to their own needs and demands. This, we believe, should be
the policy’s focus.</hs_para>

believe that the Government’s strategy has focused on the wrong
part of the network—broadly speaking, the outer edge and margins
and not the centre. We argued that the Government should be
focusing on delivering a high-specification infrastructure which is
future proof and built to last. I refer, of course, to fibre-optic
cable, the most future-proof technology, which has got to be driven out
as close as possible to the eventual user. Once that has been achieved,
as well as mandating open access on fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory terms to this optical fibre from the
cabinet to the exchange, we need to ensure that there is the
same open access to links between the exchanges that feed the cabinets
and to the higher level links into national and global
networks.</hs_para>

as there is national planning for the national, regional and local hubs
of our transport network, so there should also be national planning for
a communications network of local, regional and national internet
exchanges, all linked by ample optical fibre that is open to use by
competing providers, on which different operators can site equipment
and exchange traffic and develop their own
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000036">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T18:55:04"></hs_TimeCode>
model that the Government have fixed upon for rolling out broadband has
led to BT dominance: it is now effectively the only show in town. This
lack of competition is a concern because competition is a driver of
value for money, innovation, excellence, and consumer services. Indeed
it surprised us that a partly Conservative Government have designed a
scheme which has led to so little competition. In saying this I hasten
to point out that I am not in any way chastising BT, which is a very
effective, sophisticated, world-class business which is behaving
exactly as you would expect such a business to behave. Indeed, it must
be commended for the investment it is making.</hs_para>

bit unfortunate that our report has been seen by some as an attack on
BT. This suggests that they may not have fully understood what we were
saying. No, our criticism lies with the Government’s strategy
and the way in which they have set up a framework insufficiently open
and available for competition of all kinds and have paid insufficient
attention to bridging the digital divide that is opening
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000038">Our report
has argued that broadband policy should have three key elements. First,
it should be driven, above all, by the need to arrest and ultimately
eliminate the digital divide. Secondly, it should also be driven by an
avowedly long-term, but also flexible view of the
infrastructure’s future. Thirdly, it should also strive to
reinforce the robustness and resilience of the network as a whole. The
spectre of a widening digital divide is a profound source of concern.
We believe that that obliges the Government to address their cause with
greater commitment and vigour than we believe is currently the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000039">As I
have already pointed out, our alternative vision is simple. It is of a
robust and resilient national network linked primarily by optical
connectivity, which in turn brings open-access fibre-optic hubs into or
within reach of every community. This would enable diverse providers,
both large and small, to contribute to the 
<?notus-xml column=462?>reach and resilience of our national connectivity and allow each and
every individual to benefit from services, both private and public
of whatever kind, which will run over it in time to
come.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000040">In
addition, in order to realise this vision, it is our view that the
country’s future broadband infrastructure should deliver the
following. First, every community should be within reach of an
open-access fibre-optic hub. Secondly, every such hub should be fed by
ample fibre-optic cable, providing open access to optical links back to
the exchange, and from it back to the public internet. This, of course,
will not be free, but it will be made available to all on fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, allowing anyone to build their
own local access networks out from the hub as long as they meet
appropriate technical standards, using whichever technologies they
choose. Thirdly, at the very least, we expect a hub to be able to
provide backhaul for a wireless network where there is demand. In this
way all premises would be able to gain access to a wireless internet
service from at least one of these hubs, assuming that they can afford
to do so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000041">The
Government set their course long ago but I hope that our model will
inform their plans for the future. The Government’s response to
our report was a disappointment; it did not, it seemed to us, engage
substantively with our arguments. I hope that my noble friend the
Minister can say something more
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000042">A
crucial point is why there seems to be more focus in government policy
on so-called superconnected cities at the expense of improving
broadband in rural communities. Let me make it absolutely clear: I am
not claiming that the superconnected cities programme is without merit;
and it is very important to recognise that there is some very poor
provision in some built-up areas, just as there is in rural areas. It
is, however, mystifying to us that superconnected cities appear to have
trumped improving provision in our remotest communities. Let us be
clear, businesses in rural communities could and would tap the enormous
opportunities presented by the internet and instant worldwide
communications. For many it would be a real game changer. This would in
turn contribute to economic growth generally, and more particularly to
the diversification and strengthening of the rural economy, which seems
to many to be being
marginalised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000043">I
read with interest the recent Institute of Directors’ survey of
its members about broadband, which makes for worrying reading. It found
a wide and real divide between rural and urban internet services, with
satisfaction rates significantly lower for IoD members in rural areas.
Only 34% of members in rural areas are satisfied with the speed of
their fixed-line downloads while 45% are dissatisfied; a mere 13% of

I have already said, fast, reliable internet connections are vital
these days for businesses, but clearly the existing infrastructure is
falling short. Of course I appreciate that there are difficulties in
reaching remote areas, that everything cannot be done at once, and that
the availability of public money is especially limited at the present
time. Nevertheless, public spending is a question of priority and I
hope that more attention can be paid to those parts of the country that
are missing out. In this regard, I am particularly interested to hear
the Minister’s view on the important role of fixed wireless in
areas where it is very difficult to get fibre-optic cable close to
people. In those circumstances, fixed wireless offers real
opportunities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000046">As
I mentioned, the Government’s specific target is to provide
universal access to standard broadband with a speed of at least two
megabits by 2015. To explain what that means, two megabits per second
is the speed required to watch the BBC iPlayer. There is some way to go
to achieve that. I urge the Government to go further as they ponder the
next phase of their strategy. They must ensure that nowhere in this
country becomes a broadband ghetto. The real risk is greatest to those
parts that are most marginalised now in the availability of public
services, and hence most vulnerable to further marginalisation. This
includes making rural Britain a priority. As a final thought, I wonder

is no doubt that fast broadband promises jobs, growth, new businesses
and new business methods—all things that we are trying to
achieve to get some life into the economy. There are also the social

cultural elements, entertainment, and, as the noble Lord, Lord
Inglewood, reminded us, news. It is the 
<?notus-xml column=464?>promise of this digital oxygen that makes broadband the infrastructure
of the future. But I have a nightmare: a nightmare that we will build
this infrastructure and then find that it is not used to its full
extent, that the promise falls short not only because of the

on high-speed broadband for Britain. The response was given by
vice-president Neelie Kroes, who is responsible for the digital agenda
for Europe at the European Commission. Incidentally, we were also
promised a response from the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport, but neither she nor somebody from her department turned up.
Vice-president Kroes told us that 98% of the population of Denmark has
access to fibre, but only 10% take full advantage. She contrasted this
with Estonia, where things are the other way round and the country has
gone completely digital. She told us that 40% of Italians never visit
the internet. I think that her message was that even if you provide the
broadband, do not assume that people will automatically take it up. It
needs a positive effort. I agree with her. Does the Minister agree? If
so, what are the Government doing to encourage the use of broadband so

Smartphones and tablets have made us demand better, faster and more

7.5 million taxpayers are still not online. Much of the

90% of homes with 24 megabits per second or greater. This is all
designed, in the words of the previous Minister, to create the best
superfast broadband network in Europe. However, the key question is
increasingly: can we provide adequate services for the last 10% who not

temptation to be self-congratulatory should be resisted. As my noble

ensure faster broadband infrastructure rollout with fewer planning
restrictions for five years, subject to new guidelines agreed between
local authorities and the digital stakeholders’ group. I also
welcome the Government’s acknowledgement that speed is not the
only factor; choice, coverage and price are important, too. There is
also the Law Commission review of the Electronic Communications Code.

welcome those developments. That said, there is a difference of
philosophy between the Government’s vision and the

believe would have the best chance of eliminating any digital divide
and delivering the final 10% more effectively through attracting
innovative solutions to delivering higher broadband speeds to rural
areas. Network access conditions do not by themselves go far enough.
The Government, in their response, talk about the expectation that
consumers will be able to benefit from competitors deploying competing
networks using BT’s ducts and poles, but this is only an
expectation. What obliges the opening up? Likewise, we believe that the
opening up of dark fibre is crucial and that the adoption of common

commercial approach will not work: it has to have an element of the
universal and social. Our committee heard too many stories of
difficulty in accessing such loan money as there is because of 
<?notus-xml column=469?>inflexible and arbitrary rules. It was alleged that Defra’s Rural
Community Broadband Fund was confused in ambit and that it requires
communities to spend on the network first and claim a refund later,
which is not a practical proposition. Reaching everyone in the most
far-flung corners would cost several billion pounds. There are
differing estimates about how much it would take for the national
provision of hubs and then on to the home. Whatever the sum, it will be
too much for the public sector to bear right now, and it is not
realistic to expect normal commercial providers to operate it because
of the risk. Rural deprived communities offer low financial returns
because of the sparse population and distances from existing fibre. If,
as our report suggested, there were to be open access fibre-optic hubs
within the reach of every community, local groups could access
broadband in the short term by their own organising and upgrade over
time to faster
speeds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000077">Our

give one small example. I am a governor of a school in Devon. I was
there for a governors’ meeting and, yet again, we were
discussing electronic communications, their use in the school and how
we could make sure that we had good services. In the morning, we went
to two lessons. In one lesson that I went to, the electronic side was a
key part. It was a history lesson looking at the rise of Nazism; the
electronic part was very cleverly integrated and used, and the
preparation would come in that format. That, therefore, is one example
of how it might be used in education, and there are endless other ways

must confess that when we first embarked on this I was not a little
alarmed. There was a whole range of jargon with which one had to become
familiar, such as “dark fibre”—which sounded
positively evil although it simply means that it is not being
used—cabinets, copper wiring and fibre-optic wiring. All this
became slightly clearer after we had paid a visit to a division of BT
where we saw an example of a cabinet—which looked like a
cabinet—copper wires and the amazing fibre-optic wires, which
are the size of a human hair. 
<?notus-xml column=470?>What one can get through them is beyond my real comprehension, but I
realised the immense capacity of this form of communication, which,

is why I am so keen, along with other members of the committee, that
the Government should embrace the idea of fibre-optic cabling and not

desire that fibre optics should be taken as near to people’s
premises or homes as possible, as a prudent way of developing
broadband<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T19:31:31"></hs_TimeCode>. In
connection with that, I hope that the Government will go so far as to
introduce regulations to require every new building to be given the

absolutely essential, and I hope that when the Minister answers tonight

best way to link fibre optic to homes is by using ducts, routed through
a multiplexer cabinet situated beside existing PCPs, which are the
green cabinets that we see on pavements. It is well known that the UK
has a well established underground duct network, and BT and other
utility providers also have extensive duct networks. If the Government

Westminster Technology Strategy Board and in collaboration with BBC and
British Telecom, in which white space spectrum was used on the Isle of

had almost no broadband access, download speeds of up to 14 megabytes
per second and upload speeds of 4 megabytes from a single mast with a

Earl of Selborne:</Member></B> My Lords, I join others in thanking the
chairman, my noble friend Lord Inglewood, for the way in which he
chaired the committee and introduced the debate today. From the
speeches that we have heard, it is clear without doubt that the future
of our economy will depend to a large extent on our ability to connect
to broadband throughout all communities and sections of the population.
It is not just about wealth creation and social cohesion. The 
<?notus-xml column=473?>ability to participate in healthcare and whole tranches of public
activity will depend on connectivity. The
Government must have a policy, and the Government are right to have a
policy, but perhaps, as we have said in our report, they have been
preoccupied by one aspect, which is to try to be the leader in Europe
on superfast
broadband<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T19:44:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000098">The
first priority has to be to achieve connectivity. If you have excluded
populations, you will have a social divide and a lack of social
cohesion. The Government need not worry about speed. That will follow.
There are not very often market failures when it comes to cities. I
therefore agree with those who have said that to spend money on
improving superfast provision in cities is not something that the
Government need to worry about if the market can do it itself. But
there will be market failure in remote areas, where the costs of
pushing out the broadband structure are too great. There will be market
failure where the incumbents have an advantage, which inhibits other
incomers who can help to provide some of the very many solutions that
will be required to get this connectivity to all parts of the
population. That is something that we are failing to harness—the
undoubted innovation and enthusiasm from local communities, small and
start-up companies, all of which would have a contribution to make. We
go into some detail in the report. It gets pretty dense, I admit, when
we talk about things such as passive optical networks and physical
infrastructure access. But this is the key to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000099">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T19:46:27"></hs_TimeCode>
the moment, we have what my noble friend Lord Inglewood called
“the only show in town” for many rural
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T19:46:06"></hs_TimeCode>. Whether
we like it or not, because it is in the very nature of broadband to
have high fixed costs, low marginal costs and great economies of scale,
inevitably the incumbents will have a strong advantage. I think that we
should be proud of what BT has done. It has improved enormously, by
technical innovations, the ability to provide broadband on the existing
infrastructure. Of course, it is rolling out broadband at great speed.
It says that it hopes to achieve 90% coverage by 2017, but
that immediately begs the question as to whether in national terms that
is a satisfactory objective. I would certainly say, particularly as I
am from a rather remote corner of the rural community and likely to be
one of the 10% left out, that it is not satisfactory. So let us see
what we can do to achieve that connectivity well before
2017<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T19:47:13"></hs_TimeCode>. I do not
think that anyone has mentioned yet the 4G mobile broadband technology,

enhanced mobile internet access to areas within adequate

are many different contributions to be made. The case for government
involvement and public funds to be deployed rests, as I say, on
achieving this reduction of the digital divide. The long-term solution
will, ultimately, be fibre to the premises and the home. As others have
rightly said, the cost of rolling out fibre to the home is exorbitant.
We have a temporary solution, and a good one—the BT solution of
fibre to the
cabinet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T19:48:10"></hs_TimeCode>. It
achieves the objective of reducing dramatically the costs. Usually, you
have copper or some other connection from that cabinet. But whether BT
likes it or not—it is in something like denial over
this—it has 
<?notus-xml column=474?>the disadvantage that it does not provide open access, as I would
understand it. In other words, as a local access
network provider, you cannot simply move in with a compatible bit of
machinery, stick it in there and do what you are trying to achieve. It
is not an open access hub, as we have tried to demonstrate. That is
where you come back to the technology of the passive optical network,
which is a bit of a fix, as those will know who have read the report

think that the Government should ask quite firmly that, for the next
tranche of money, which we hear will come in 2015, there should be
proper open access. It is not beyond the wit of man. Clearly, there is
no great financial advantage to the incumbents to roll out
proper open access, but that is what is needed. If it is what is

It must be future proofed. We know that the technology changes
dramatically fast. We know that some of the existing solutions,
including the cabinet, will not stand the test of time for very long,
but the fibre-optic cable will. Ultimately, it will be able to handle
this vast amount of information. Therefore, we must make sure that as
we improve the broadband infrastructure, we have the ability to upgrade
and upgrade. That is why I say that, frankly, the cabinets are not very
easily upgraded. You have to go back to the exchanges and think again.
That is why we should look on them only as a temporary
expedient<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T19:50:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000102">When
public money is distributed to extend the commercial network, as is
happening at the moment, the Government should insist on the long-term
solution. We took evidence from a particularly impressive consultant,
the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, who is setting up a community scheme in
Goudhurst, Kent. I think he was the first to put it to me how important
it was for local groups to be able to access the middle mile and to get
the backhaul back into the infrastructure. He said that the key to the
problem is the openness of the middle mile, which is the connection
back to the internet. If this can be designed in a way that gives each
community a chance to get to one of these community hubs, it would be a
massive leap forward. That is precisely what the committee report has
tried to promote. I think it makes a lot of sense. However, the
government response simply quoted a report which said that it was
unrealistically expensive to have hubs in every community, and so it
would be if you were to launch it all overnight. However, ultimately,
it would be no more expensive than the cabinets. It is the same
technology but it is a question of making sure that when you roll out
the hubs, you do what you are not doing at the moment with the
cabinets, and that is making them available to all. To say that they
will cost far in excess of the funds available to the Government at
present, as the government response does, simply misses the point. If
the Government can fund any hubs such as cabinets or exchanges, they
should be accessible to the community and to other providers. This
simply requires a change in specification, not a change in the scale of
funding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T19:52:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000103">I

few cotton mills in Derbyshire? Did Victorian society appreciate the
global impact of the Stockton to Darlington railway? Things could be
much greater than we believe them to be at the moment. I believe that

that something is working very well. E-commerce activity does not need
the top speeds that are recommended. It is flourishing at lower than
maximum levels. As we have already heard, what matters is to bring

such infrastructure must surely be broadband for all. We know that the

those of us who are not so expert in some of these issues to get a
handle on what the committee had been up to and how it was expressing
its concerns. I particularly enjoyed his jest—if it was

committee report, which is a very good read, and the government
response to it, which is not quite as good, raises some very good
points on the way in which broadband will influence society in its
broadest context, how coverage is perhaps more important than speed as
a basic understanding of what the aims and objectives should be, on the
problems of the rural divide and the very real difficulties of
exclusion that may follow from that and on the sustainability of the
initiatives that have been put forward, particularly whether or not
there will sufficient commercial competition to maintain the drives
that are required. The report also covered a question which was raised
by several noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord Haskel, about
whether uptake will be one of the biggest stumbling blocks. However,
there is general agreement that broadband infrastructure will drive
significant economic value for the United Kingdom and its economy and
is obviously central to our future prospects of
growth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031837000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031837000110">The
projected explosion of data consumption over the next five years
presents a huge challenge requiring large-scale investment to upgrade
the capacity of existing networks and deliver new connectivity. As we
have heard, consumers demand high definition video and audio content
both inside the home and on the move and are using all sorts of
devices. Those of us with teenage children will know how complicated it
looks when you are able to get inside the bedroom of a 19
year-old or 20 year-old and discover what exactly they are doing on all
the machines that they have. These are all consuming huge amounts of

consumers will be the driving force of that, and indeed have been
driving about a 30% increase year on year in terms of usage,
but how do we realise the demand for that and the economic value of it
if we fail to allow private network operators to commit large-scale
investment to increase the capacity that is required? These providers
are operating in a market where the dynamics of investment are
extremely finely balanced. Indeed, it is interesting that one of the
larger suppliers dropped out

the Government’s central objective for broadband interventions
in both rural and urban UK markets should be to create the conditions
in which private-led investment and innovation can flourish. Yet the
policy to date has suffered from what seemed to be fundamental
weaknesses. The rural broadband programme, to which the committee drew
attention, has failed to stimulate private, competing investment and
will be awarding £1 billion of public subsidy to a single
incumbent. The urban broadband fund risks critically undermining
continued investment in broadband 
<?notus-xml column=477?>capacity by overbuilding existing networks, and not enough has been

be a real concern that the Government have failed through their rural
broadband intervention to replicate the conditions of
infrastructure-based competition that have served the urban market so
well. Markets that benefit from infrastructure-based competition are
better served in terms of innovation and penetration than those in
which the incumbent is placed under no pressure to supply better,
cheaper products. Across Europe broadband penetration in markets with
infrastructure competition is nearly 20% higher than in countries that
rely on service level competition alone. This is something that the
Government must take into

two-thirds have a website and only one-third sell goods and services
online. The Government’s advisers suggest that the central
barrier to small businesses realising these benefits is a lack of
practical, digital skills and a shortage of resources to undertake
digital training. This is hardly referred to in the Government’s
response. Given the current economic climate, and a context in which
recent EU budget negotiations have cut broadband funding by 90%, it is

<?notus-xml column=480?>of us who hold rural Britain dear to our hearts feel strongly about.
Almost every noble Lord who has spoken has raised this
matter—and quite rightly so. The more remote and rural areas
must not be left behind when it comes to broadband access. Our aim is
for the investment of public funds to bring superfast broadband access
to 90% of UK premises, and a minimum of 2 megabits per second to
everyone else. Our approach is technology-neutral, and we expect to see
a mix of technologies including wireless, as mentioned by my noble
friend Lord Inglewood, and satellite solutions. Indeed, satellite
broadband is available now to anybody who wants to take it up, although
I acknowledge that it is expensive I am very conscious of what the
noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, said about Cornwall and the Isles of
Scilly. It is an encouragement to all.</hs_para>

is being made on the rural programme. Fifteen projects have now signed
contracts and are either in progress already or about to start work.
The remaining projects are entering procurements at a rate of one per
week, and all should have completed their procurement phase by the end
of the summer. I will indeed look at the particular counties that the
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson,
mentioned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T20:11:49"></hs_TimeCode>. My

delivering faster connections for consumers. Indeed, in December, North
Yorkshire saw its first active fibre cabinet and, at the end of
February, there was the unveiling of the first cabinets in Bangor,
north Wales. The devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland will all benefit from significant central government
investment in their broadband infrastructure, thereby delivering a key
part of driving UK growth and investment. Similarly, our £150
million urban broadband programme, by working closely with local
authorities and the private sector, will ensure that our cities can
compete with the best in the world. Tech City in London shows how
establishing a digital hub with world-class connectivity and expertise
can be so successful. It is an example for all rural and urban
Britain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031838000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031838000013">It is

Our aim is to remove the barriers preventing investment and innovation,

cannot allow rollout to be delayed by planning refusals, by confusion
when carrying out street works or by long-running legal issues over
access to private land. Our goal is to provide certainty to ensure that
the money invested in rollout is used to take superfast broadband

nine entering submissions. It was important to identify organisations
that could 
<?notus-xml column=481?>demonstrate the capacity and capability to deliver sustainable
commercial services for the wholesale supplier market and the retail
consumer services market. The framework agreement requires suppliers to
meet all these conditions. In addition, Broadband Delivery UK has
included price controls, clawback mechanisms and an independent audit

public sector is
maximised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031838000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031838000015">The

committed to ensuring that the market fosters competition, supports
multiple innovative providers, and results in greater consumer choice.
I know that my noble friend Lord Inglewood and the noble Lord, Lord
Stevenson, referred particularly to competition. We are already seeing
a healthy market emerging. Virgin Media has two-thirds of superfast
broadband connections, while Sky and TalkTalk already provide services
over BT’s network. I am mindful of what the noble Lord, Lord St
John of Bletso said about ducts, but BT is required to offer access to
its network on equivalent terms, and is required to offer access to
their duct and pole network. Any networks built using government funds
will be required to offer wholesale access. We are therefore are
starting to see genuine retail competition emerging at this early
stage. Ofcom continues to monitor this market and has already begun the
process for the next wholesale local access market review, which will
determine whether stronger action is needed to ensure greater
competition. Ofcom will publish a consultation later this year on this
matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031838000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-0002.htm#13031838000016">My

measures of inflation. The fees that have increased by more than 3%
include the following. First, the indefinite leave to remain fee is
increasing from £991 to £1,051. The right to stay
indefinitely in the UK is the most valuable entitlement provided by any
product offered by the UK Border Agency. It is right that the fee for

dependants applying to extend their leave in the UK at the same time as
the main applicant, their fees were previously set at half the main
applicant’s fees. We are reducing the concession on these fees

<?notus-xml column=96?>that those dependants will pay 75% of a main applicant’s fees.
This is consistent with our policy to better align fees for
applications made in the UK with those made overseas, where all

order, we are amending the way in which fees for applications made in

fee of £375 is payable, in addition to the relevant standard fee
for applications made in person. This replaces a large number of public
enquiry office fees in the existing regulations. The £375
in-person fee includes £100 payable for the arrangement of an
in-person appointment. The fee is being introduced to tackle abuse of
the public enquiry office booking system by organisations and
individuals who have been making speculative appointments but then
failing to attend. Such actions deprive genuine applicants of the

priority service fee of £275 for the expedited processing of
standard applications via some routes will also be charged within the

remaining temporary and permanent migration routes in future. In
response to requests for such a service from universities and colleges,

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall refer to the
applications-in-person fees that the Minister mentioned in his
introduction. The idea that an efficient service is being provided in
this case will, certainly in Cambridge, generate hollow laughter. I
refer him to the case of a colleague of mine who, as a tier 1 applicant
in person, has made a consistent series of applications for a personal
appointment in order to secure an extension of tier 1 permission in
good time so that she can attend important international conferences
that are fundamental to her career and to the performance of her
high-quality services here in the UK. Despite numerous telephone calls,
hanging on for over an hour on one occasion, she was unable to obtain
an appointment for a month. However, she was offered an appointment by
a person in Turkey for £3,000. The Minister referred to the
abuses that there have been in respect of applications in person, but I
ask him why we are imposing a fee of £375 on such applications
in person when the person making a profit of £3,000 will regard
this as a perfectly good bet.</hs_para>

we know, the UK Border Agency first conducted a full public
consultation on charging for immigration and nationality applications
in 2006, and that consultation led to the principle being established
that the UKBA should operate a flexible pricing approach to setting
fees for immigration services, to take account of wider policy
objectives while reducing the contribution made by the taxpayer. As the
Minister said, the regulations that we are considering today, which are
pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order 2011, come
into force on 6 April and replace similar regulations that have been
effective since April last year. They set out the changed fees to be
paid for immigration and nationality applications or services, which
will also enable a significant part of the costs to be
recouped.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031810000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000020">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T15:43:41"></hs_TimeCode>

start by saying that tax credits and child benefit provide valuable
support to millions of families, so the decisions to freeze child
benefit and tax credit rates or to increase them by less than CPI were
difficult. They will mean that the rates will reduce in real terms.

the largest deficit since the Second World

Government are committed to reducing the deficit. Around four-fifths of
the total consolidation in 2015-16 will be delivered by lower spending.

the unsustainable welfare budget is a key part of addressing our fiscal
challenge. From 1997 to 2010, spending on welfare increased by some 60%
in real terms, which is equivalent to an extra cost of £2,900
per household in Great Britain. It is an increase 
<?notus-xml column=101?>from 11% of GDP in 2007-08 to more than 13% today. Welfare now accounts
for £1 in every £4 of public spending. Tax credits have
significantly contributed to this increase. Under the previous
Government, spend increased an extraordinary 340% compared with the
benefits it replaced. Tax credits will cost around
£30 billion this year, and child benefit costs a
further £12 billion. Together, they make up over 40% of
working-age welfare
spend.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031810000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000037">Freezing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T15:55:08"></hs_TimeCode>
the basic and 30-hour elements for three years will save almost
£1 billion in 2013-14, while uprating the child, couple and lone
parent elements  by 1% saves £320 million, and
decreasing the income disregard will save £125 million in
2013-14. The three-year child benefit freeze will save an additional
£1.25 billion. If these savings were not delivered, this could
clearly put additional pressure on spending on public services. While
they are tough decisions, they are necessary and will be implemented
through these regulations.</hs_para>

Lords that while we are taking these tough and necessary decisions on
welfare, we are also ensuring that high earners pay their share. The
top 20% of households continue to make the greatest contribution
towards reducing the deficit. This is true both in cash terms and as a
percentage of their income and benefits in kind from public services.
Overall, the richest will pay more tax in this Parliament than under
the previous Government’s plans. As a result of this
Government’s actions, a high earner pays an additional
£10,000 on a £100,000 capital gain; pays an extra
£60,000 on the purchase of a £3 million house, and an
extra £300,000 if purchased via a corporate envelope; loses up
to £4,500 a year in entitlement to tax reliefs on annual pension
contributions, for an individual previously claiming the maximum annual
tax-free pension allowance and paying the additional rate; can no
longer benefit from tax relief on contributions to pension pots over
£1.25 million in value; and will no longer be able to use income
tax reliefs to reduce their tax bill excessively year after

have on child poverty. The Government are committed to tackling child
poverty and focus on interventions that transform lives rather than
push up benefit incomes to lift people just above a relative income
line. We already know that focusing on the relative income line alone
yields perverse results. In 2010, 300,000 fewer children were said to
be in poverty because the recession had caused median incomes to drop.
In other words, people were said to be pulled out of poverty not
because anything changed in their lives but because the rest of society

worklessness, educational failure and family breakdown. I re-emphasise
that one of the most important things that we can do to support
children is to tackle the nation’s debt and restore economic
growth. In doing so, we can create a future of prosperity and 
<?notus-xml column=102?>opportunity. I simply disagree that what is best for children is to

clear signal that we believe that work is the best route out of poverty

spending an extra £200 million to support families
with childcare costs, and for the first time this support will be made
available for families who work fewer than 16 hours per week. This will
mean that 100,000 more working families will be helped with their
childcare costs. Of course, we also provide significant support to
families through the National Health Service and schools, which, even
in these difficult economic times, we have protected the budgets
for.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13031810000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000098">4

why we need to reduce spending on benefits that support working
households. Of course, it is true that working tax credit is
for working families and that child tax credit and child benefit go to
in-work and out-of-work families. However, I have already said that tax
credits and child benefits are over 40% of working-age welfare, so it

is a more fundamental point here. I simply disagree with the concept

welfare bill, we are prioritising our resources towards measures that
really help working families. We are supporting working families
through raising the personal allowance. The largest ever increase to
the personal allowance, in April, will benefit 24 million people by an

for January means that it now costs £5 less for a typical family
to fill its car with fuel. We are supporting working families through
providing a further £450 million to help freeze

mind, I would be grateful if my noble friend would say, for the year
2013-14, what the savings will be from the freezing of tax credits and
from the elements that are before us in these regulations when they are

response to the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, who talked just now about the

therefore significantly increased its estimate of the take; I refer to

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and
Pensions (Lord Freud):</Member></B> My Lords, these
regulations were laid on 4 February 2013. I confirm that in my view
they are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. They
support the new powers introduced in the Welfare Reform Act 2012 to
enable HMRC for the first time to apply a loss of tax credit penalty to
fraudsters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031810000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000072">First
I will explain why we need these regulations. Benefit and tax credit
fraud has reached a level that is far too high. Around £1.9
billion a year is fraudulently claimed in benefits and tax credits, of
which £0.7 billion relates to tax credit fraud alone.
The Government have introduced a number of measures to reduce the level
of fraud, such as working with credit reference agencies and developing
screening technologies to check for potential fraudulent tax credit
claims. However, we now need to move towards improving deterrents in
order to stop in their tracks those who are thinking about committing
fraud. We also need to change people’s perception that tax
credit and benefit fraud is acceptable behaviour and worth the
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031810000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000073">Research
conducted by the Department for Work and Pensions shows that 41% of
benefit claimants believe that benefit fraud is “easy to get
away with”, and one-third thinks that the current penalties are
“not too bad”’. Therefore, we need to send a
strong message that fraudulent behaviour by tax credit claimants will
not be tolerated by the taxpayer or by honest fellow claimants. Our aim
is to provide even stronger deterrents to those who set out to defraud
the tax credit and benefit systems. We are therefore introducing
tougher penalties, increasing the length of penalties, and extending
their scope to include tax
credits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031810000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000074">The
Department for Work and Pensions has already introduced comparable
regulations that contain tougher powers to apply a loss of benefit to
those making fraudulent benefit claims. These were debated and agreed
by your Lordships’ House on 13 February. The draft regulations
before noble Lords today support the wider joint DWP-HMRC strategy to
reduce benefit and tax credit fraud, which was introduced in the
Welfare Reform Act 2012. Jointly they will send a clear message to
fraudsters that claiming benefits or tax credits to which they are not
entitled will have severe consequences. They will also tackle the
perception that tax credit and benefit fraud is too easy to get away
with. We also intend to ensure that those who commit the most serious
offences, such as organised or repeat offences, will receive the most
severe penalties: losing their benefits or tax credits for up to three
years. Most claimants are honest and abide by the rules, but to 
<?notus-xml column=109?>those who are not we want to send a clear message that if they try
fraudulently to claim benefits or tax credits, they will face the
consequences of their actions.</hs_para>

aware that tax credits comprise two elements: child tax credit and
working tax credit. Child tax credit provides financial support for
families with children whereas working tax credit provides financial
support for working families. The Welfare Reform Act 2012 enables HMRC
to withdraw payment of working tax credit for those who are convicted
or cautioned, or who agree to pay a DWP administrative penalty as a
result of a benefit offence. The 2012 Act also provides for the length
of the loss of working tax credit period, and the loss of tax credits
amount, to be reduced where there is an innocent party in a couple
claiming tax credits. Finally, the Act prescribes what constitutes a
benefit
offence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031810000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000076">The
length of time a loss of tax credit penalty is imposed will escalate
depending on the number and severity of the offences. It will be
applied for four weeks, 13 weeks, 26 weeks or three years. The 2012 Act
also introduced provision for an immediate three-year loss of tax
credit or benefit penalty to apply where a person is convicted of a
relevant offence. “Relevant offence” generally means an
offence of serious organised or identity
fraud.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031810000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000077">Although
the loss of tax credit penalty will be applied to working tax credit, I
reassure noble Lords that while child tax credit will be a
disqualifying payment from April 2013, it is not a payment to which a
loss will apply. In other words, although a fraudulent claim for child
tax credit will count as an offence, the penalty will be applied only
to working tax credit or another relevant benefit. I therefore reassure
noble Lords that child tax credit payments will not be reduced or
stopped for claimants who receive a loss of tax credits
penalty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031810000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000078">On
the detail of the Loss of Tax Credits Regulations being debated today,
the regulations prescribe that the loss of tax credits penalty will
begin from the 30th day after which HMRC is notified of the benefit or
tax credit conviction, administrative penalty or caution. The
regulations also provide for the payment of working tax credit to be
reduced by 50%, not 100%, where there is an innocent party in a couple
who have made a joint claim for tax credits.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T16:29:35"></hs_TimeCode>Where both
partners are subject to a benefit or tax credit offence, the deduction
would be 100% of the payment of working tax credit. This will include
any element of working tax credit to which a claimant would be
entitled, including childcare costs or disability elements. The
regulations provide that the loss of tax credits will apply only to an
applicable benefit offence that is committed wholly on or after 6 April
2013. It will not apply to offences committed before that date in
relation to which a conviction is obtained after 6 April.</hs_para>

to send a clear message to those who are thinking about committing
benefit or tax credit fraud, we have strengthened the loss of the
benefit penalty regime and expanded the scope to include tax credits
for the first time. The increase in scope and the length of penalties
reflect the seriousness of benefit and tax credit fraud, and aim to
provide an 
<?notus-xml column=110?>effective deterrent. These regulations were referred to the independent
Social Security Advisory Committee on 7 November 2012. I therefore seek
your Lordships’ support for the regulations here today, and

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for
introducing these regulations. Broadly, from this side of the
Committee, we support them wholeheartedly. However, they raise a number
of questions in my mind which I would be grateful if the noble Lord
could
answer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T16:31:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

broad-brush, question, the Minister referred to the scale of benefit
fraud as £1.9 billion a year. Can he tell the Committee how this
compares to the Treasury’s estimate of the losses due to tax
avoidance and evasion? I think he will find that the estimate of losses
in those areas is many, many times greater than that for benefit fraud,
even though there is, quite rightly, a condemnation of benefit
fraud<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T16:32:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031810000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000082">The specific measure,
as the Minister told us, removes benefit from those who have been
fraudulently claiming it. Has the department or the Treasury
investigated whether those people from whom benefit is being removed
actually needed the money, and whether there are those who did not need
the money? If a relatively wealthy crook is pursuing benefit fraud,
taking the benefit away from them costs them nothing. They have just
taken a punt on a particular scam and now they have lost out, so this
measure does not really matter very much. However, if they were people
who were actually impoverished but for some reason or other were not
adequately covered by existing regulations and were then behaving
fraudulently, they may not now have anything to live on. What are they
supposed to do? Do we have an estimate, among these fraudsters who are
depriving us of £1.9 billion, of those who needed the money and
those who did
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T16:33:41"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

particularly because the Minister’s welcome remarks on child tax
credit suggest that there is a feeling, perhaps not in the Treasury but
in the department, that people may need the money; the Treasury never
thinks that anybody needs any money. I am a bit puzzled as to the
nature of this penalty. Of course, if somebody is fraudulently
extracting funds from the Government, from the taxpayer, they should be
stopped from doing so. However, if it so happens that this person will
then be completely impoverished, we must ask what our society will do
about them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T16:34:31"></hs_TimeCode>. This
comes back to whether they needed the money. How many of these
fraudsters are in fact quite well off crooks from whom this is a
trivial change, and how many of them are people whose circumstances are
so desperate that they are willing to break the law? Of course we
should not allow them to break the law, but can we consider what the
circumstances of such families might be once the appropriate penalty is
applied?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031810000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000084"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T16:34:59"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord German" PimsId="5765" UID="13031810000136" xid="2039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000136">Lord
German:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, welcome these regulations, but
again they are a round two as they match the Social Security (Loss of
Benefit) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. I have a number of questions.
The first relates to what happens under universal credit to 
<?notus-xml column=111?>the various sets of regulations that we have been discussing today,
which also have their mirror in regulations brought forward by the DWP.
It may be  a bit of a heresy to say this, but if we are to have
separate regulations from separate departments, might it not be a
little more useful if we were to back to back them in the same slot so
that we could at least look at them together and perhaps save a fair
bit of time and effort? Universal credit gives us that opportunity,
since we will be looking at these regimes in the round.</hs_para>

relates to the three-year sanction, which is the heaviest of all the
sanctions, and the use of the words “deliberative or organised
offences”. Has that definition of what is a deliberative offence
and what is an organised offence been codified in the handbook and
regulations given to decision-makers—both those in the Treasury
and obviously those who are to be responsible for universal
credit—in order that the level of understanding is of a high
nature? When someone goes to court and gets a sentence, we can see that
being clearly identified. However, there may be occasions when this is
dealt with outside the court through an administrative procedure, in
which case there needs to be a clear understanding of when these
heavier sanctions will be applied.</hs_para>

decision-makers will also be given a level of discretion about the
boundaries between some of these sanction periods. Can my noble friend
say a little more about the nature of that discretion and whether a
framework will be given to the decision-makers in each of these cases,
so that we have some certainty that the worst and most difficult
offenders will be given the heavier sentences? Will there be any form
of appeal internally, apart from the normal tribunal case, where
someone has appealed against their sanction? Perhaps my noble friend
could give us some idea of how that mechanism will
work.</hs_para>

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, let me try to deal with the points
raised. There was a rather interesting question from the noble Lord,
Lord Eatwell, about the division between what I think he would call the
crooks and the desperate. The best way I can approach that is to look
at the way in which fraud develops. I think it is right to say that 80%
of the fraud develops out of people not informing of a change of
circumstance. There is a drift there that indicates that we are not
talking about that many who are desperate because, in one circumstance,
people were clearly functioning at a certain level of benefit or tax
credit. They then got supplemental income elsewhere and kept the extra,
to which they were not entitled. That is quite a typical fraud, so on
balance we are talking about crooks here. That is the best figure that
I can give the noble Lord. I certainly have not seen anything better,
and as your Lordships can imagine I see quite a lot of data.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031810000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000088">One of the points that
my noble friend made at the end of his last question was about
discretion. I must make the point that we are now talking not about the
conditionality sanctions, which this can often be confused with, but
about people who have committed fraud, have usually gone to court and
have had a punishment laid down by the court. There is no doubt about
that and it is not in the discretion of our decision-makers. 
<?notus-xml column=112?>That is not true at the margins, where people accept an administrative
penalty, which is at a much lower level. However, as you move up the
scale, with repeat offences and the serious offences that we are most
concerned about, it becomes a court matter and, to that extent, is not
a matter of our codification. The serious offences that I am talking
about are laid down in regulations. I speak from memory but I think we
are talking about £50,000 offences, serious identity fraud such
as trying to pass yourself off with a different identity: that kind of
thing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T16:41:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031810000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000089">On
my noble friend’s last point, we are bringing the regulations on
working tax credit closely together with what happens to today’s
benefit system, with a view to pulling both of those into the UC
sanction regime. They are being pulled together with a view to there
being relatively little change in the overall approach and amount when
UC comes into effect for particular
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T16:42:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031810000090" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031810000090">I
think that covers all the issues that have been raised. The amount of
money, £1.9 billion, is substantial, and we want to make sure
that it is fully realised that this is not acceptable or safe
behaviour. I do not have to hand a comparison with our estimates on tax
evasion and tax avoidance. Tax avoidance, as the noble Lord, Lord
Eatwell, will be fully aware, is a different matter from tax evasion,
but our concern about tax evasion is at absolutely the same
level—it is the same offence as defrauding the benefits

need to send out a strong message that this type of fraud is not
tolerated. We also believe that, although fraudsters must be promptly
and severely dealt with, innocent parties should be protected, which is
why this relates only to working tax credit and not to child tax

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, neighbourhood planning is a
vital part of the Government’s reforms to help local communities
play a much stronger role in shaping the areas in which they live and
work and  in supporting new development proposals. For
the first 
<?notus-xml column=113?>time, community groups can produce plans that have a real statutory
weight in the planning system. Neighbourhood planning is therefore one
of the most exciting innovations of the localism
agenda.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000002">We are
delighted that neighbourhood planning is taking off across the country.
Indeed, we are aware  of more than 500 places looking to bring
forward a neighbourhood plan and to shape the development and growth of
their local areas. More than 400 of these have taken formal steps to
have their area designated. Three plans have already passed the
independent examination stage, and the first to reach a referendum was
in Upper Eden, which saw 90% of local people, based on a turnout of
34%, voting in favour of the neighbourhood plan. This was a positive
result for the 17 parishes of Upper Eden that are now able to deliver
new homes on farms, houses for older people and more affordable housing
in a way that suits their local character and needs. Other areas are
hot on the heels of Upper Eden and we expect to see many more
neighbourhood plans in the very near future. Regulations governing the
conduct of neighbourhood planning referendums, of which Eden was the
first, were considered last year.</hs_para>

provided for some areas to be designated as business areas where they
are wholly or predominantly commercial in nature. In such areas,
non-domestic ratepayers will be able to vote in a business
neighbourhood planning referendum. This provides the opportunity for
businesses to take the lead in neighbourhood planning. We are already
seeing this happen in practice in central Milton Keynes, where it is
proposed to develop a dynamic city based on high-quality buildings and
spaces. Businesses are also taking the lead in areas such as Trafford
Park, central Ealing and Liverpool Innovation Park.</hs_para>

Planning (Referendums) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 amend the 2012
regulations to provide for the conduct of
“business referendums”, which will be required to be held

should come into force in a designated business
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000005">I shall
briefly summarise the main provisions of the amending regulations.
Regulation 4 requires a local authority to fulfil certain publicity
requirements relating to the referendum and imposes certain time limits
by which notice of the referendum taking place must be given. This is
56 days where a referendum in a designated business area is required to
be held, rather than the 28 days where a referendum is held
in the residential neighbourhood area. This longer period was the
outcome of discussions with the Electoral Commission and local
authorities and was considered necessary to allow for the effective
registration of non-domestic ratepayers.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031814000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000006">In a designated
business area, there will be two referendums, one for residents and one
for non-domestic ratepayers. Regulation 7 therefore provides for the
residential referendum to be held on the same date as the business
referendum. As with referendums more generally, a register of those
eligible to vote is required.  
<?notus-xml column=114?>In order to compile this register, a specific registration process is
needed. Schedule 1 provides for the creation of a business voting
register of all the non-domestic ratepayers who register to vote in a
business referendum, for the purposes of that referendum only. The
business voting register lists the names of all the non-domestic
ratepayers who have registered to vote and the addresses of the
premises within the referendum area on which they pay non-domestic
rates. In practice, a local authority will send a registration form to
each non-domestic ratepayer of which they are aware, and each ratepayer
will nominate an individual, which may be himself or herself—the
“named voter”—to vote on behalf of the
business.</hs_para>

detailed rules to be followed when conducting a neighbourhood planning
business referendum. This includes the rules in relation to the content
of ballot papers and other voting forms, the operation of polling
stations, the counting of votes and the declaration of
results.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000008">Schedule
3 applies, with necessary modifications to existing electoral law, to
the conduct of neighbourhood planning business referendums. In short,
the amended regulations will put in place the rules needed to ensure
the effective administration of neighbourhood planning referendums in
business areas, in which the electorate can have confidence. In large
part, they follow a tried and trusted practice. An external group of
interested parties has been used to help develop the amended
regulations in a manner that ensures that they can be effectively
implemented. This particular group includes the Electoral Commission
and the Association of Electoral Administrators, both of which have fed
into the process and commented in detail, in particular on the business
referendum registration forms. I take this opportunity to thank them
for their contributions in assisting us to develop these particular
regulations. In line with best practice, the registration forms have
been tested with business users for design, clarity and impartiality. I
am therefore confident that the amended regulations will ensure
efficient and effective administration of any neighbourhood planning
referendum in a designated business area. I commend the regulations to
the
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McKenzie of Luton" PimsId="1827" UID="13031814000143" xid="1824" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000143">Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I start by thanking the
Minister for a very full and clear explanation of the order we are
considering today. Like the Government, we very much support
neighbourhood planning and the engagement of business with that.
However, it is important that we do not make the process overly
bureaucratic and expensive. In introducing this, the noble Lord
referred to the fact that 500 places were developing a neighbourhood
plan. How many business districts have been created to date? I am just
trying to see the dynamics of that. Can the Minister tell us how the
timing works? If a neighbourhood plan is being developed but there is a
business district component, or a potential one, how does that all
work? If the plan is some way to being finalised, does that
preclude a business district coming in? Presumably the idea is to get
the business district there at the start. Given that nothing like 500
business districts have been created yet, how does that all work in
practice?</hs_para>

have one or two questions on the specifics of the regulations. It is
clear that there is one vote per business, however many separate
hereditaments are involved. How does that work within a group? Are
separate members of a group separate voters for this purpose or is
there some sort of aggregation of that for connected parties or formal
group companies? What happens if a business goes into administration?
Is it then precluded from participating? Presumably, that depends a
little on what stage the administration has
reached.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000011">In
Part 2, in Regulation 8(2)(c), there is a requirement to specify the
rateable value. Why is that? Presumably that itself is not relevant to
the entitlement to vote. What happens to a hereditament that is
entitled to 100% relief on one basis or another? Does that still create
an entitlement to vote under these regulations? I think the question
has to be the same for individual voters and a voter on behalf of a
business hereditament but perhaps the noble Lord could confirm
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000012">Obviously,
we broadly support the thrust of these regulations but I would be
grateful if the Minister could say a little more about the dynamics of
how these fit together, how that is working in practice with all this
activity in the development of neighbourhood plans and how business
districts so far are fitting into
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon" PimsId="5907" UID="13031814000144" xid="2117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000144">Lord
Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie, for his broad support. I am delighted that we are
putting forward these particular regulations. The noble Lord asked how
the two are linking up, at a very high level. It is very much the final
piece in the jigsaw of how neighbourhood planning comes together, which
is allowing neighbourhood planning referendums to happen up and down
the country.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031814000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000014">There were some very
specific questions and I will seek to answer each one in turn. If I do
not answer all of them, I will write to the noble Lord in detail on
those particular matters. He raised the question of how many business
districts have been created. Only three neighbourhood areas have so far
been designated as business neighbourhood areas but there are a number
of other neighbourhood areas that are seeking to be so designated. I
believe it to be at least another seven. There is a particular measure
or standard to be met for the designation—that the area is in
effect wholly or predominantly commercial—so there are criteria
in this regard. The regulations will also allow leading businesses and
neighbourhood plans to proceed towards examination and referendum, and
provide a powerful opportunity for local residents and businesses
to  work in partnership to attract investment and to shape the
future development and growth of their local areas.</hs_para>

how the timing works. As I indicated earlier, I believe that the two
referendums will work in parallel to ensure that the results, when they
are taken in, are consistent and the decision can be based on the
outcome of both together. One of the things I would raise that is
linked to that, which was a question I certainly raised when looking at
this, was what would happen if there was a variation between the result
of the business referendum and the residential one? Bearing in mind the
spirit of local neighbourhood 
<?notus-xml column=116?>plans, it would remain the remit of the local authority to adjudicate on
the difference between the two referendums.</hs_para>

asked about one vote for every business. That is true irrespective of
size. He raised a quite specific issue of registered groups of
businesses. Speaking with my business hat on—I will seek
clarification if what I say is not correct—if it is a separate
established entity within that local area, it would be one business,
one vote. If there is a single group with a single address then, no
matter how large the actual business, there would be one particular
vote for that business as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000017">The
noble Lord raised the issue of what happens if the business goes into
administration. It would depend on the exact situation and I will seek
clarification on that. I am being told that as long as they are on the
non-domestic rating list, they have a vote. However, that is a separate
question and, coming back to the issue of whether they have gone into
administration, I will clarify that point. If they are in a business
that has already gone into administration at the start of
that referendum process, I assume they would not be included.</hs_para>

McKenzie, also asked how companies that have 100% rate relief would be
managed. As long as they are on the non-domestic rating list they have
a vote as well. He also asked about how and when an area is designated.
When designating a neighbourhood area, local planning authorities must
consider whether to designate the area as a business area, which is a
neighbourhood area that, as I have already said, is wholly or
predominantly business in nature. These are areas in which an
additional business referendum is required to be held alongside the
residential one. He asked about the question that would be posed on the
business referendum and the residential one. As far as I understand,
bearing in mind that the results would need to be consistent, the
question posed would be the same as well.</hs_para>

course, write to him. However, I think I have covered, if not all, most

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> I thank the Minister, who has indeed
covered a lot of the questions that were posed, but would be grateful
if there was anything further that he could say about the dynamics of
business districts. If there are 500 neighbourhood plans on the way but
only there business districts, clearly business districts are not
leading the charge on this. Where a neighbourhood plan is being
contemplated by the residents of a designated area and then a business
district is created as part of that, which could happen, I am trying to
see how it gets its foot in the door in terms of participating in the
development of the plan. Is there a risk here, or could the
circumstances be such, that the neighbourhood plan is developed by the
residents of an area and a business district is created later? I think
that a referendum would have to take place at the
same time, with the same question, but is the
business district the business community’s
opportunity 
<?notus-xml column=117?>to engage in the development of that plan? Perhaps the Minister will
write if he is not able to cover that issue today. I thank him for his
other answers.</hs_para>

neighbourhood plans can be improved for each local area, needs to be
reflected and dynamic in its own nature. Based on the answers that I

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, these regulations put in
place the last elements needed for the operation of the rates retention
scheme in 2013-14. That scheme, as we have discussed previously, is
designed to deliver the Government’s objective of returning an
element of business rates to local control in a way that incentivises
authorities to work with their local business communities to improve
economic conditions in their local areas. It does so through a partial
redistribution of business rate resources, taking account of the
individual authority’s needs, in order to provide a fair
starting point for each local authority. That starting point is fixed
until the next reset of the scheme in 2020, and any growth in business
rates above this starting position is shared between central and local
government and can be used by authorities to support local services and
stimulate further
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:03:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000023">As
the Committee will appreciate from looking at these, and earlier,
regulations, while the principle of the rates retention scheme can be
explained simply enough, the mechanics needed to deliver it are both
complex and technical. Therefore, before turning to the detail of the
regulations, it may be helpful to the Committee if I first remind noble
Lords of the technicalities of the scheme and the mechanics of
establishing authorities’ starting
positions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:03:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000024">The
key to the scheme is the establishment for each authority of two
numbers: its baseline funding level and its business rates baseline.
Its baseline funding level reflects the level of resources that the
authority should have under the rates retention scheme, taking 
<?notus-xml column=118?>account of its needs and the availability of other resources such as
council tax. Its baseline funding level, together with the level of
revenue support grant that it will receive, the RSG, represents the
authority’s share of general government funding—the

second number, its business rates baseline, is the estimate of each
billing authority’s business rates income in 2013-14,
apportioned between that authority, central government and major
precepting authorities in accordance with the shares approved by
Parliament in the local government finance report. If the
authority’s business rates baseline is more than its baseline
funding level, it is required to pay the difference to the Government
in the form of a tariff. Tariffs are then used to provide top-up
funding to those authorities whose business rates baselines are less
than their baseline funding levels. Because of the way in which the
scheme is set-up, tariffs and top-ups sum to zero and, moreover, are
fixed for the duration of the scheme. This provides the fixed starting
position against which future growth can be measured and
retained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:05:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000026">However,
as we discussed during the passage of the Local Government Act 2012,
while incentivising growth is vitally important, we all recognise that
business rates at the local level are, by their nature, subject to a
fair degree of volatility. This is a key issue. As a result, if we did
nothing else, in any year authorities could see their resources fall,
perhaps quite considerably, and this could leave them with less money
than implied by their starting position. Reductions in income could be
because of changes to commercial property. To take an example that has
recently been in the news, one need only think of the impact on North
Warwickshire’s business rates of the closure of Daw Mill
colliery to understand the impact of such changes. I know that this is
a challenge for local authorities that find themselves in similar
situations. It could also be because of successful appeals against
rateable values, which lead to an authority having to refund rates in
respect of a number of previous
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:06:16"></hs_TimeCode>. For
whatever reason, we quickly concluded that the scheme needed some way
of mitigating the effect of local volatility. Having looked at this and
discussed it with the local government sector, we concluded that the
best way to do this was through a safety
net<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:06:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000027" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000027">Overall,
the rates retention scheme provides authorities with about one-fifth of
the general funding available to them through business rates, council
tax and revenue support grant. The safety net works by ensuring that
the one-fifth available through business rates can never fall by more
than 7.5% before the authority receives assistance. The safety net is
financed from a levy charged on the most highly resourced local
authorities when they see growth in their business
rates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:06:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000028">With
that preamble, I turn to the regulations themselves. These give effect
to the levy and safety net by reference to baseline funding levels and
business rates baselines that have already been set out in the local
government finance report, and which are set out for each authority in
Schedule 2. Importantly, Regulation 5 provides that the baseline
funding level is indexed every year so that the level of protection
available through the safety net keeps pace with
inflation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:07:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

for the calculation of levy rates and safety net thresholds in
Regulation 6. The safety net threshold is set so that no local
authority can see more than a 7.5% reduction from its baseline funding
levels. This gives force to the policy that I have just described and
ensures that authorities will have reasonable stability of income from
which to deliver important local
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:07:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000030">The
way that the levy is calculated means that only those authorities that
pay a tariff—that is, those that, at the start of the scheme,
have more business rates than their baseline funding levels—will
ever be levied. Authorities with relatively small business rates bases
will never be levied, and will be allowed to keep all of the growth
that they achieve.</hs_para>

authorities are able to receive a safety net payment on account during
the course of the year. The payment will be based on the
authority’s own estimates of the business rates income that it
seeks to collect. This provision ensures that authorities do not have
to wait for the final outturn figures before receiving safety net
assistance, and therefore do not suffer cash flow problems through
having to wait for
funding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:08:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000032">I
do not pretend for a moment that these regulations are not complex;
indeed, I said that at the start. However, they have been developed
with the working group that we set up to help us work through the finer
details of the implementation. They have therefore benefited from the
practical help and advice of those in local government finance
departments who will have to work with the scheme and with the
detailed regulations. We are confident that, with
their  input and the consultation that has taken place,
the regulations will deliver the policy to which the
Government are fully committed. I commend them to the

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
introducing these regulations. As the Minister said, they are quite
complex. Holding concepts such as business rates base line, base line
funding levels and retained rates income in one’s mind is a
challenge—certainly for me—as one goes through the

safety net system, but as we argued during the passage of the primary
legislation, we would wish to see the threshold at a level higher than
92.5%. Just as the noble Lord raised the example of the dire
consequences of particular closures on the finances of a local
authority, we argued when the primary legislation was being considered
that, when a local authority is faced with the prospect of the major
regeneration of an area, there ought to be arrangements in place so
that it would of its own volition see a significant drop in its
business rate base for the specific purpose of regenerating an area,
and hopefully building a much bigger rate base in the future. I do not
think that those circumstances are specifically catered for here. We
also anticipated the problem that a local authority might cope with a
7.5% fall for one year, but there is no additional relief should that
recur year on year. This may not happen in many circumstances, but the
cumulative effect is not catered for here.</hs_para>

estimate of levy amounts and safety net payments to be collected next

one or two other specific questions. On the safety net, why is the
schedule of payments cast in the way that it is under the regulations
and what is wrong with a Friday? Apparently, when a payment falls due
on a Friday, one is not permitted to send or receive it; one has to
wait until the next business day. I am not quite sure why that is. Can
the Minister expand a little on the types of adjustment that flow from
paragraph 1(4) of Schedule 1—for example, the effect of
adjustments made for amateur sports clubs and the circumstances in
which deductions are permitted or not? What are the criteria that
separate the different categories of arrangements? Subject to those
points, I have no further issues to

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, again I thank the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie, for his support for what the Government are
seeking to do. As a general point, I know—and I am sure the
noble Lord will share my experience—that when we were looking at
introducing the whole issue of business rates and the ability of local
authorities to retain the 50% business rate, it was done irrespective
of political affiliation. It has been campaigned for long and hard at a
local authority level. I am glad that a broad level of support has been
given.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031814000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000038">The
noble Lord raises some general points, particularly in relation to
places that struggle to attract growth, which is indeed a driver for
increasing the level of business rates. This system of tariffs and
top-ups is intended to ensure a stable starting point. There may be
some local authorities that fall from year to year below the 7.5%. For
them there is additional funding available—for example, the
efficiency support grant for those councils that face a loss of more
than 8.8% in their spending power.</hs_para>

this regard are index-linking tariffs and top-ups to RPI, which ensure
that councils with low tax bases and high needs see a major part of
their income uprated by RPI. Also, the concept of a safety net will
ensure that public service provision does not suffer as a result of the
local volatility mentioned in my opening remarks. A safety net
threshold of 7.5% is the most generous level consulted upon. As the
noble Lord acknowledged, this will guarantee local authorities a
minimum of 92.5% of their business rates
levy.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13031814000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000130">5.15

noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, mentioned the drop in income as a
result of major regeneration. Councils will be eligible for a safety
net if their income falls more than 7.5% and will continue to
receive safety net payments until the regeneration leads to
increases 
<?notus-xml column=121?>in business rates. The noble Lord also stated that councils should not
be left with the risk of funding the cost of mandatory reliefs. The
Government considered reliefs carefully during their extensive
consultation on the business rates retention scheme and we noted that
respondents expressed concern at the idea of local government sharing
half the cost of any increase in the cost of mandatory relief. However,
such a split is in line with the general principle of the rates
retention scheme. We have also confirmed that there will be no change
to the reliefs that are available. The noble Lord asked about small
sports clubs and so on, but there will be no change to reliefs that are
available to small business, charities et
cetera.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000042">The
noble Lord also asked a specific question about why we will not know
how much the levy and safety net will be until outturn figures are
available at the end of the year. He asked specifically about
estimates. On the basis of provisional estimates, we think that the
safety net payments may be in the region of £70

National Audit Office and others, the problem appears to be intractable

incoming new Labour Government were faced with cost overruns and delay
on the Eurofighter, Merlin and Tornado programmes, to name a few. So
the statement after the 2010 election about the budget deficit being so
big and it being down to the previous Government entirely is not quite

structure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:24:46"></hs_TimeCode> of
defence procurement is a wide area. The Bernard Gray report talks about
changing it. There were two possible models of procurement:
an executive non-departmental public body or a
government-owned contractor-operated organisation, commonly called a
GOCO. At a conference in March 2011, the author of the report, Bernard
Gray, said that
it,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13031814000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000122">“seems

the Government appear to have stopped all work on any other model and
are concentrating on GOCO. I thank the Minister for the briefing that
we had on that at the MoD. I now ask him where government thinking is
on this. What hurdles do the Government anticipate, and how do they
intend to overcome them when we are talking about our international
allies? How will our allies react to that change to a government-owned
but contractor-operated system? Defence procurement is an expensive
business, and getting more expensive. It is highly unlikely that any
one nation will be able to fund its own defence in future. In fact that
is already not the case today; we have to work in concert with our
allies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:26:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

asks the Government to target 2% of the MoD budget to be spent here in
the UK on UK-based research and development. What is the
Government’s response to that? Do the Government agree that we

the Statement on 14 May 2012, the Secretary of State announced that the
budget had been brought into financial balance. He also announced that,
for planning purposes, it had been agreed with the Treasury that a 1%

from 2015. Can the Minister confirm that this additional 1% in real
terms for the defence budget will be new money, not money that the MoD
has to find from its overall budget? Obviously, a large part of the
rest of the budget is  
<?notus-xml column=124?>personnel spend. Will that increase apply from 2015? In conclusion on
the defence budget, it seems odd logic that, whereas all
our non-allies—China, North Korea and other

will try to add a few things, having made notes as I have listened. The
sad fact is that defence procurement has for far too long been a drag
on our forces’ expenditure and national expenditure. Purchases
have proved sluggish and inflexible, delivering equipment and resources
late and over budget. That is not only the case now; it has been in the
past as well. That is why the coalition Government have been right to
challenge the way in which defence procurement has operated. As the
noble Baroness has just said, the Government have a full battery of
reviews to consider. She mentioned a couple: the Levene review, Bernard

will the Government respond to the broader concerns about the skills

engineering and project management? Above all, the skills of estimating
cost, both on expenditure and available resources, must be
strengthened. We are pretty weak in estimating the cost of the final
bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:31:25"></hs_TimeCode>. Overall,

it off the shelf. What of value do we have on our shelves and would we

spare parts for Harriers? The noble Baroness, Lady Dean, mentioned them
when she spoke. If we have spare parts for Harriers, perhaps we should
sell them off to the United States Air Force. When we spoke about

the Government go on even a moderate ordering or buying spree, all in
the correct defence of the realm, what work is done on estimating what
conflicts are likely? Procurement cannot be taken in isolation; it is
about estimating what is going to happen. I could give many examples
but I do not think you can divorce the discussion on procurement from
what is going to happen with Trident, which is a very expensive weapon.
I know that a review is being undertaken, supervised by Danny Alexander
MP, but the actual cost of Trident is going to weigh down on a lot of

Uniforms and other personal equipment are also part of our procurement

on television recently showing our forces training in Arctic
circumstances—or will they be needed in the desert? We may have
the horrible feeling that they are training in the Arctic, as I saw on
television, but the next conflict may be on sandy terrain. Perhaps we
need to know what equipment and uniforms they will need when a large
proportion of them will be based on Salisbury Plain. Salisbury Plain,
the Arctic, the desert—we have to make a good guess at where the

Touhig:</Member></B> My Lords, last July the Minister 
repeated a Statement in your
Lordships’ House in
which  the Government acknowledged the MoD’s
historical budgeting woes. By now, most who are familiar  with
defence procurement agree that the Government underbudgeted and
overassigned, that the Civil Service was challenged to manage such
complex programmes because of its lack of expertise and skills, and
that the policies of procurement unfairly burdened taxpayers. Clearly
the Government now want to correct these failings, and it would appear
that their preferred option is a privatised, government-owned
contractor-operated partnership, about which we have already
heard.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031814000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000072">When
one remembers the G4S security contract awarded for the 2012 London
Olympic Games, it would seem that the Government’s record on
privatised partnerships leaves much to be desired. I wonder also
whether the Olympics security project suggests that even stable private
partners struggle with assignments of unpredictable scale. The history
of defence procurement over recent years certainly shows that scale is
unpredictable. In an interview with the <I>Defence Management
Journal</I> on 28 January, ADS chief executive Rees Ward warned that no
country, and especially no military superpower, had adopted a
government-owned contractor-operated scheme for procurement. In
February this year, the Defence Select Committee in the other place
expressed worries about GOCO and stated that it was vital that we
consult our allies to ensure that there will be no 
<?notus-xml column=127?>adverse impact on co-operation. This point was made by my noble friend
Lady Dean. Indeed, the chairman of that committee, Mr James Arbuthnot,
said:</hs_para>

pursue this private partnership, that will require aligning with a
company or companies that can manage a diverse programme of
responsibilities and needs including armaments, supplies, training and
the welfare of our nation’s Armed Forces. The partnership will
certainly require invalidating or restructuring existing contracts,
negotiating new business procedures, determining the
Government’s ownership stake and rethinking the role of the
Civil Service.</hs_para>

strategy raises a series of questions that few in government appear to
have considered. For instance, do the Government expect to find a
private partner of equally diversified expertise in
infrastructure—one that can manage acquisitions for
Britain’s defence system? Can one partner reasonably manage an
entire nation’s defence or will the partnership mean multiple
private partners? Restructuring and managing Britain’s defence
procurement operations is a project of paramount scale and importance.
Considering the G4S summer Olympics embarrassment and the very costly
outcome it had for G4S, is defence partnership attractive to the
private sector or is the task simply too risky for investment? What
happens if the private partner falls short of its commitment, as G4S
fell short in 2012 at the Olympics? What happens if needs outgrow the
resources of the business partner or, worse, if the partner goes
bankrupt? Poorly thought out schemes are risky and the Government have
exposed themselves to scrutiny without supportive answers to encourage
taxpayers or potential
investors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000075">I
have three questions for the Minister. Will  the Government
consider wealth creation and job opportunities in awarding the defence
partnership? Will they maintain a golden share of ownership in any or
all of the companies included in the contract to operate the
partnership? Will they share a company’s financial burden in
partnership, and how will they scrutinise the spending of millions of
pounds of taxpayers’ money? The need to ask these questions
reflects the Government’s overall indecision and unpreparedness
on this matter. Until the Government prepare a more detailed position
on procurement, we are simply left with many daunting and outstanding
questions.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:42:07"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_18_PT_1/B748BFA20112D8DBC9FCEB078094BCE767780DBB" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 March 2013">Monday,

of the major outstanding procurement matters, as has already been said,
is a decision on the future of Defence Equipment and Support, on which
there appears to be some delay. The Government favour moving to a
government-owned, contractor-operated organisation, but have not
answered many of the points of concern that have been raised, including
those raised by the Defence Select Committee in the other place. The
opposition position is that private expertise should be integrated in
policy-making, since a partnership delivers positive policy outcomes.
We have, however, practical reservations about the GOCO model for
reform of Defence Equipment and Support. Accountability to
Parliament must be retained, and the reasons for outsourcing a
£160 billion equipment programme must be much more explicit than
is the case at
present.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000078">It is
not clear with a GOCO what risk is being transferred from the public
sector to the private sector. The risk lies with the body or
organisation that pays the cost in either financial or reputational
terms if equipment is not delivered to specification, to time and
within budget. Where that risk currently lies with the Ministry of
Defence in the public sector it is not going to be transferred to the
contractor-operated but government-owned organisation, not least
because no contractor would be prepared to take on such a risk.
It is difficult to see what risk at all would be
taken on by the contractor. Should the full burden of risk continue to
be with the Ministry of Defence, the benefits of the GOCO model and the
outsourcing of procurement decision-making become harder to
see.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000079">In order
to gain or retain an advantage over potential aggressors and enemies,
new defence equipment, by definition, will be at the leading edge of
technology. That can increase the likelihood of overruns, since new
ground is being broken, and, with it, the uncertainties that have to be
addressed and the unexpected that may well occur. In that situation the
risk has to be borne by the public sector since no company would be
prepared to take on such a risk that could well jeopardise their very
existence if it
materialised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000080">A
private contractor operating a GOCO is presumably going to achieve its
return through equipment that is procured rather than through equipment
that is not, even though in some cases dropping, or making significant
changes to, a project would appear the better option than continuing
with it. Under the GOCO proposal with the private contractor, how would
the contract incentivise or reward a project manager to meet time and
cost targets of a project if it had become clear either that the costs
would be well in excess of what had been estimated or, alternatively,
that the specification could no longer be met within the
timescale—or, indeed, adequately met at all? We need a broader
new culture, with the Government being prepared to return a project to
the main gate stage when forecast cost or 
<?notus-xml column=129?>timescales exceed set targets. Changing specifications and an acceptance
of missed targets should not be the
norm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000081">Presumably,
under the GOCO, many of the same people as now would continue to be
involved in defence procurement, as the TUPE arrangements would apply,
with those currently involved being transferred over to the new
organisation. If the argument is that a private contractor will somehow
be better able to buy in and bring in talented people, then why can the
Ministry of Defence not do this? We have a model of private sector
management operating an activity in the defence field at Aldermaston.
What exactly does the Ministry of Defence feel has been achieved from
this that has been beneficial in terms of cost and performance? What
experience do other countries have of outsourcing responsibility for
defence acquisition? Under the government-owned, contractor-operated
scheme, how would the Ministry of Defence retain overall responsibility
for UK defence acquisition? Would such a development in this highly
sensitive security field have an adverse impact on levels of
co-operation with
allies?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000082">The
greater the extent to which responsibility for UK defence acquisition
is outsourced to the private sector then the less knowledge on this
vital and security-sensitive area of activity is retained within the
military and the Ministry of Defence. There must surely be  an
argument for nurturing and developing these  skills within the
Ministry of Defence and providing opportunities for worthwhile and
satisfying careers within defence acquisition, rather than seeing
defence acquisition as a step on the ladder to another career within
the military field. This would help to ensure that the expertise and
knowledge are acquired to work with maximum effectiveness with both
manufacturers and suppliers, as well as within the Ministry of Defence
and the military. We need to be able to offer a permanent professional
career choice in procurement, ending two-year
stints.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000083">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:48:50"></hs_TimeCode>
is surely an area of activity where the Ministry of Defence must retain
real knowledge and expertise, bearing in mind the sensitive security
nature of defence acquisition, the sums of money involved and the need
for a defence industrial strategy which supports appropriate national
sovereignty. The House of Commons Defence Select Committee stated in
its recent report
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13031814000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000126">“the

power should be used to provide certainty, support supply chains,
increase transparency and establish an active industrial strategy in
partnership with business. Since the Government seem to regard buying
off the shelf as their default position, it is increasingly important
to give industry greater certainty—and that means being explicit
in the capabilities the Government intend to purchase off the shelf and
those they regard as
sovereign.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000085">When
an effective market exists, competition is the best procurement policy.
The reality, though, is that there is seldom a viable market for major
defence projects. There must be a case for considering how 
<?notus-xml column=130?>certain value-for-money tests might be taken into account, including
wider employment, industrial or economic factors. Given the social and
economic impact of defence procurement, it should be looked at on a
cross-departmental basis. Defence decision-making could be made more
transparent through the MoD publishing the cost-benefit analysis that
provided the basis for awarding contracts, while respecting commercial
sensitivities and any classified security issues. This would also add
greater accountability, something that was exposed as necessary during
the Department for Transport’s west coast main line franchising
debacle.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031814000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000086">I
hope that the Minister will be in a position to provide more
information on the Government’s intentions and reasoning on
future defence procurement. Defence procurement is technical, and
reform to Ministry of Defence internal structures is necessary, but we
should surely always remember that the goal and objective for
procurement is about delivering equipment when and where it is needed
on the front line in order that battles can be won, lives can be saved
and operations brought to a successful
conclusion.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_18_PT_1/AD6197A3C52A011A36CED10EC6E95D73F44D9A5C" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 March 2013">Monday,

many times in support of our Armed Forces and demonstrated her
steadfast concern for the welfare of our service men and women and
their families. I know that those concerns are also shared by other
noble Lords here today, so I start by paying tribute to the men and
women who serve in Her Majesty’s Armed Forces, who provide the
ultimate guarantee of our security and independence. That is also why
defence procurement, particularly defence equipment acquisition and
support, is vital. We need to be able to adapt and configure our
capabilities to address tomorrow’s threats and to build more
agile forces for the future. Support operations will always be our

acquisition is a key element in delivering military capability and
ensuring future operational success. The Government’s strategic
priority remains to bring the national deficit under control. In
defence, we must play our part in meeting that objective. However, we
must also meet the commitment in the 2010 strategic defence security
review to deliver well resourced and well equipped Armed Forces. To
achieve that, the Ministry of Defence is in the process of delivering
its largest and most far-reaching transformation programme. We are
reforming defence procurement to ensure that we do it better in future
and derive better value for money from the defence budget in so doing.
We continue to contribute to the goal of reducing the deficit by
looking for ways to conduct our business more efficiently, and expect
to make £30.5 billion of efficiency savings over 10
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031814000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130318-gc0001.htm#13031814000092">As

defence budget. Through implementing changes flowing from the SDSR, we
have brought the budget into balance. That means that, for the first

priorities and budgets for equipment procurement and support over the

core programme delivers the major force element set out in the SDSR.
This, with the headroom and contingency provision that we have built in

will seek to fulfil the UK’s defence and security requirements
through open competition in the domestic and global market and buy off
the shelf, where appropriate, to take full advantage of the competitive
international market. However, where capabilities are essential to our
national security, such as nuclear submarines and complex weapons, we
will seek to protect our operational advantage and freedom of action.
We will also maintain our investment in science and technology. In
taking this approach, we recognise the important part played by the UK
defence industry. Our policy, through the White Paper, is designed to
provide the catalyst for making UK industry competitive and therefore
able to win a large proportion of additional orders within the global
market through successful exports. A healthy and competitive defence
industry in the UK is able to sustain many UK jobs and thus make a
vital contribution to growth and a rebalanced
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:59:02"></hs_TimeCode>. We are

to the future, reforming the acquisition system is a key priority and a
core element of our work to transform defence. We will take a major
step forward in April, when the new defence operating model goes live

responsibility for setting equipment and support requirements. This is
an important part of our work to implement the recommendations of the

structural reform of defence equipment and support organisation is also
central to this process. It will ensure that we have the structures,

final decisions are made. A decision will be made shortly on whether to
move into an assessment phase. If agreed, this would see the GOCO model

compelling case had been made for reform. Proposals for an assessment

While child benefit and child tax credit are designed
to help families living in the UK only, the EC
social security co-ordinating regulations, EC Regulation
883/2004 and 987/2009, treat both child benefit and the child tax
credit as “family benefits”. Under these rules, such
benefits are therefore payable to nationals of the European Economic
Area (EEA) in respect of members of their family resident in another

regulations are directly applicable to all member states in equal
measure. Nationals of other EEA member states who are working in the UK
and paying compulsory UK national insurance contributions are entitled
to claim UK family benefits in respect of children living in another

security contributions in another member state are entitled to that

young people out of secure establishments and use a number of measures
