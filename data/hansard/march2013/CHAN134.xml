due to the failure in net exports. In our major export markets, zero

when there is an economic slump in the markets that constitute half our
exports, it is rather difficult to expand into them, despite the
competitive advantage that we have. There are deep structural problems.
Many exporters genuinely have problems in getting access to bank
finance or difficulties in getting access to trained workers. These are
long-term structural problems that we inherited and are now trying to
deal with.</hs_Para>

against this vile and abhorrent crime. He rightly points out the action
that the Government are taking on human trafficking. That is being done
in conjunction with BIS, but the Home Office is obviously the lead
Department on human trafficking. The Minister for Immigration has
rightly been taking the matter forward. Both he and I spoke at a
conference this week about human trafficking and the risks to the
hospitality sector in particular. We will continue to work with
business to raise the awareness of this issue and to clamp down on

help businesses in 2013, because they do not kick in for at least a
year, when what the economy needs is a stimulus now. What confidence
can we have that the Government will actually deliver? Let us take
Budgets

infrastructure plan, but two years on, less than 2% of the projects are
completed or operational and now he says that Budget 2013 will get
business investing. If that is the case, why, having accounted for this

Government’s objective and strategy in Afghanistan are
unchanged. We seek an Afghanistan that can maintain its own security
and that is not a safe haven for international terrorists. That

their national security forces, to make progress towards a sustainable
political settlement, and to build a viable Afghan
state.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000308" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0001.htm#13032161000308">Although
formidable challenges remain, there is progress to report to the House
on all three of those fronts. First, significant progress is being made
in building up the capability of the Afghan security forces. In the
past three months, insurgent activity in Afghanistan has followed the
historical cycle of winter seasons, with a reduced level of violence
nationwide. High-profile attacks have been limited over the period.
Recent attacks, such as those against the national directorate of
security and traffic police headquarters, have been largely dealt with
by Afghan forces, without direct support from the international
security assistance force. Afghan security forces are now leading 80%
of all security operations in Afghanistan, and are due to take lead
responsibility for combat operations across the country by this summer,
with ISAF taking an advisory role. More than three quarters of ISAF
bases have been closed or transferred to the Afghan Government, and the
ANSF is on track to assume full responsibility for security in
Afghanistan by the end of
2014.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000309" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0001.htm#13032161000309">That
progress is allowing the gradual redeployment of UK military forces and
equipment. The Prime Minister announced in December that our military
presence will be reduced by nearly half this year, and that the UK,
along with our allies, will move steadily towards a supporting role.
The role of UK personnel is changing from a combat role to training and
advising the Afghan security forces. In the short term, UK personnel
will continue to support Afghan operations through casualty evacuation,
air support and the provision of surveillance capabilities, while
working to help the Afghans to develop their own suitable capabilities.
In addition, UK personnel provide the infrastructure necessary to work
in Afghanistan, including food, medical care, welfare and
transportation. Although our focus is increasingly on supporting our
Afghan partners, we will maintain sufficient capability to project
military force if the conditions require it until the end of
2014.</hs_Para>

currently has more than 330,000 personnel and is progressing towards a
final number of 352,000. As those forces become more capable and
approach full strength, our mentoring has switched from company to
battalion level, and by the end of this year, our forces will no longer
need to mentor them below brigade level. The vast majority of training
is also now led by the Afghans
themselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000311" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0001.htm#13032161000311">Of
course, our task is still a difficult one. The Taliban will continue to
seek to undermine popular confidence in the Afghan authorities, and as
Afghan forces assume the lead in combat operations across the country,
they are likely to become the focus of Taliban attacks. Moreover, the
formation of professional armed forces takes time, and reducing
attrition rates and improving leadership across the Afghan forces will
be important priorities for years to come. The UK is therefore proud to
take the lead in building up the new Afghan national army
officer academy which will develop the next generation of Afghan
military
leaders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000312" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0001.htm#13032161000312">Secondly,
we continue to help drive progress towards a sustainable political
settlement and efforts by the Governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan
to strengthen their relationship. On 3 and 4 February, the Prime
Minister hosted a summit at Chequers with President Karzai of
Afghanistan and President Zardari of Pakistan. That was the third in a
series of trilateral meetings hosted by the Prime Minister in the past
year. The aim was to assist the Afghan-led peace and reconciliation
process, and strengthen joint Afghan and Pakistani efforts
to address extremism, and to advance regional peace and
stability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000313" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0001.htm#13032161000313">The
summit led to an agreement on co-operation between military and
security services, and strengthened co-ordination of Taliban prisoner
releases from Pakistani custody. It also led to a public statement
supporting the opening of a Taliban political office in Doha.
That sends a clear message to the Taliban that now is the time to take
part in a peaceful political dialogue. The UK will continue to support
this Afghan-led peace process and to facilitate improved relations
between the Afghan and Pakistani Governments, including supporting
further trilateral meetings in
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0001.htm#13032161000314">Thirdly,
we continue to work to help strengthen Afghanistan’s democratic
institutions. In just over a year’s time, on 5 April 2014, the
Afghan people will begin voting in the third presidential elections
since the fall of the Taliban. Elections to the provincial councils
will take place on the same day. These elections must be
credible, inclusive and transparent. All Afghan constituencies,
including women and minorities, must feel part of the electoral process
and have the opportunity to make their voices heard. Although it will
be Afghan-led, the UK will continue to provide support and
advice to the local authorities. We are lobbying the Afghan
Government to ensure that key electoral laws, which will underpin the
credibility of the 2014 elections, are passed by the Parliament and not
by presidential decree.</hs_Para>

growth is also vital if Afghanistan is to become a stable and secure

Afghan Minister of Mines, hosted a forum for representatives of the
extractives industry to help attract credible international investment

build a better future for Afghanistan, often in difficult and
dangerous circumstances. I put on record the shadow Foreign

the Government, we recognise that the transition period between now and
the full draw-down of NATO forces will be extremely testing, with
significant challenges for all. It is therefore imperative that the
Government ensure that the alliance keeps focused on the key
objectives.
First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T11:26:52"></hs_TimeCode>, they must
remain a key priority to ensure that the Afghan state is able to
maintain its own security and prevent the country from being used once
again as a safe haven for terrorists. The support being given to the
Afghan national security forces is vital, as is their increasing
capability, but can the Minister reassure the House that that is
sustainable, particularly as in the months ahead, as the Foreign
Secretary acknowledged in his statement, we are likely to see the
period during which in past years we have witnessed some of the most
intense levels of fighting and attacks? To what extent is he confident
about the internal cohesion of those Afghan forces and their
capabilities in the face of such sustained
pressures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T11:27:03"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0001.htm#13032161000326">In
light of the recent tragic reports of continued loss of life through
what are referred to as green on blue attacks, can he provide his
current assessment of the threat posed to our forces by such attacks,
and what steps are being taken to minimise the risks, as much as is
possible in the context? Given that British forces will remain in a
training role for some time in Afghanistan following the 2014
draw-down, can he provide us with reassurance about the levels of force
protection? Frankly, it will not be sufficient to state merely that
troops are not in a combat role. As I am sure he will accept, and as 
<?notus-xml column=1081?>soldiers know only too well, unfortunately it is primarily the enemy
that defines whether troops are in a combat role. Given that he rightly
stated that the insurgents remain committed to conducting a campaign of
violence in Afghanistan, what role does he see the UK playing post-2014
in preventing the return of insurgent dominance in regions of the
country? Will he also clarify whether the planned force reduction
figures from his last statement have altered, and, if so, how does that
align with wider ISAF withdrawal

to the issue of Afghan civil society and the protection of human
rights, will the Foreign Secretary set out what steps are being taken

with respect to women’s rights? I am sure the whole House will
want to join me in welcoming the news of Malala Yousafzai, the brave
young girl brutally attacked by the Taliban in Pakistan in October, who
this week went back to school—in Birmingham—for the first
time since the shooting, and her wonderful treatment at the Queen
Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham. In Afghanistan, despite similar
continued campaigns by the Taliban, it is worth repeating that
enrolment of girls in school has risen from 5,000 under the Taliban to

increased capabilities, including in their cohesion and ability to hold

<?notus-xml column=1083?>co-operate more closely together, including on their security, that the
whole leadership of Pakistan seeks stability in Afghanistan and that
Afghanistan knows it can have a successful peace process only with the
support of Pakistan—these things are increasingly clear

mainly for the illicit black market trade. Only a small proportion of
it would be for the objectives that my hon. Friend rightly talks about.
There was an increase in poppy cultivation in some areas last year,
brought on, it seems, by the high prices that were available in 2011.
Nevertheless, the Government of Afghanistan’s eradication
programmes have been expanded successfully. The total area under
cultivation last year was about 40,000 hectares less than at the peak.
It is therefore fair to say that some progress has been made, but we

the effort will be near Kabul. As I have said, we have made no
decisions about any other military presence apart from that after 2014.
We will make those decisions in due course, along with our partners in
NATO, and we will keep the House updated on that through further
statements. Of course, the transition is already taking place in many
parts of Helmand. Lashkar Gah, for instance, was one of the first
places to undergo 
<?notus-xml column=1085?>transition, and other parts of Helmand have been involved in tranches 2

was very much focused on Afghanistan rather than on anything
internal happening in Pakistan, which explains why I did not mention
that earlier, but I absolutely join in that tribute. It is an
important milestone in the democracy of Pakistan, which all parties
across the House strongly support, that a democratically elected
Government have served a full term and that another democratically
elected Government of whatever shape or form will follow; that has
never happened before in the history of Pakistan. The
discussions we have hosted between the Pakistani and Afghan
Governments have been broader than comprising just the
political leaders, as they have included the military and intelligence
leadership of those countries. Wherever possible, we have briefed
opposition leaders. Just last week, for instance, I had discussions
with the leading member of the opposition parties
in Pakistan, Mr Nawaz Sharif. If opposition parties come into
office, they will of course have to make their own

underlines the importance of building up the Afghans’ capability
to look after their own security and to develop their own
economy—that is the only sure answer to the excessive
interference by, or influence of, any other power in the region. It
also shows the 
<?notus-xml column=1090?>importance of supporting an Afghan-led peace process with the active
co-operation of Pakistan. That is the best hope of bringing about a
political settlement and a general peace in Afghanistan that would also
then minimise outside interference in Afghan affairs. So those are two

Government made a series of public commitments at the Tokyo conference
in July to uphold the human rights of all Afghan citizens. That
includes women, of course, and the promotion and protection of their
rights as enshrined in the Afghan constitution. It is vital not only
that human rights are upheld, but that human rights defenders are
defended and protected, and that the Afghan Government fully implement
their commitments on the law on the elimination of violence against
women and the convention on the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women. We will try to hold them to all those

rising—maybe there are more people in the country. Does she know

is groundhog day too because, as a result of the present stagnation,
the Chancellor’s fiscal plans are even more wildly out of
control than they were a year ago. No wonder his fiscal credibility is
in tatters. The Chancellor used to claim that the national debt would
start to fall in 2015 from a peak of 69.7% of GDP. He now expects it to
rise in 2015, to rise in 2016, to rise in 2017 and to hit a staggering
not 69.7%, but 85.6% of GDP. And the reason the national debt is rising
is that, as the OBR said yesterday, the Chancellor’s deficit
reduction plan has stalled. The deficit is now expected to be the same
next year as it is this year and as it was last year. It is not a
deficit reduction plan anymore. That is why the Chancellor is now set

and managed to say that borrowing this year is lower than it was last

one of the years leading up to the last year that Labour was in
government, when it was a staggering £158 billion? Under the
previous Government, the deficit increased in every single year after
2001. Will he tell me in which year his deficit was supposed to kick

only is the Chancellor pressing ahead with a tax cut for
millionaires<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T12:23:55"></hs_TimeCode>; it
now seems that his mortgage scheme announced yesterday will help
people, no matter how high their income, to buy a subsidised second
home worth up to £600,000. From what I have seen so far, the
Government are basically saying, “If you’ve got a spare
room in a social home you’ll pay the bedroom tax, but if you
want a spare home and you can afford it, we’ll help you
to buy one.” Are the Government really going to allow
millionaires, who will get a tax cut averaging £100,000 in two
weeks’ time, to get a taxpayer guarantee if they use that money
as a deposit on a house, a second home, or even a buy-to-let house?
That 
<?notus-xml column=1097?>is not just tax cuts for millionaires; it is subsidised mortgages for
millionaires—or should I say a spare homes subsidy? I will take
an intervention if the Chancellor wants to clear up the absolute
confusion and chaos over this policy. Surely people struggling to get a
mortgage—those who want to get their first home—should be
the priority for help, not the small number who can potentially afford
to buy a second home or a buy-to-let home. We will solve the housing
crisis and help first-time buyers only if we finally build the new
affordable homes that we said should be built but which he ignored in

Budget he has announced, as we saw a year ago. I ask him
again—is the taxpayer subsidy available for second homes to
people with incomes over £100,000 or for buy-to-let properties?
Yes or no? If he does not clear it up, the confusion and chaos will
continue. Does he want clarify it? Pasties, caravans, churches,
skips—and now subsidised second homes for millionaires. It is
not “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?”; it is “Who
Wants To Help A Millionaire?” It is not “phone a

me run through some of the variations that we have heard from the
shadow Chancellor over the past couple of years. He started with the
big stimulus to the economy that was going to come from the
bankers’ bonus tax, which would have imposed a £2 billion
tax on a tax base—a bonus pool—of £1.6 billion. He
had not realised that, since his time in charge of the City, the bonus
pool had shrunk from £14

shadow Chancellor then moved on to the five-point plan, which was
mostly pretty sensible. It included apprenticeships, which we are
already doing on a much bigger scale. He also wanted, I think,
£200 million for the regional growth fund. Well, we have given
it billions, not hundreds of millions. He then moved on to the
reallocation of the money from the 4G auction sale, but it had already
been allocated—I have already spent quite a lot of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T12:37:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

moved on to trying to understand what plan B actually means today. As
far as I can fit it together, it consists of several elements,

become heavily over-leveraged, managed in that period to acquire the
highest level of personal debt in relation to income of any country in
the developed world. He has to explain why a medium-sized bank in
Scotland was encouraged and actively supported by his Government in
trying to become the biggest bank in the world on the basis of dodgy
acquisitions and gambling in its casino operations. He also has to
explain why, when his former boss commissioned an excellent study on
the banking system in 2000, which explained why there was a cartel

Fiscal Studies made a thorough comparison between what is likely to
happen under the Government’s fiscal plans and what would have
happened under the so-called Darling plan. It was a bit perfunctory,
but it gave us a framework and concluded that in 2016-17 the level of

we achieve long-term change, develop an industrial strategy and change
the monetary and credit landscape, people have to have a sense of
fairness, which is why some of the basic changes, including taxation
reforms, are being made. I reminded the shadow Chancellor a few minutes
ago of my 13 years in opposition, pointing to the tax regime that
applied under the Labour Government, with lower income tax, lower
capital gains tax and more generous treatment of non-dom investors than
is occurring under this Government. The Opposition complain about a
millionaires’ tax break, but they should remember that in office
they created a tax haven for billionaires. That is the legacy that we
have had to deal with, and we are dealing with it at the top end of the
income and wealth scale, as well as at the bottom with our ambitious
proposals to lift low earners out of tax. In 2006, when I was shadow
Chancellor, I remember explaining these proposals for the first time,
and they were ridiculed by Labour as impractical, unaffordable and a
fantasy land. In government, we have now delivered them, and some 2.5
million low-paid workers, many of them women, will pay no income tax
when these changes are introduced. That is a major change in the
direction of providing incentives and fairness, and I am proud to be
associated with that and the other reforms that we are putting through

Wright</B> (Telford) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to follow the
Business Secretary. He is of course right that there is demand in the
economy: it is demand for change. It is significant that last year we
had the omnishambles Budget and this year we have had a Budget from a
Chancellor imprisoned by his own rhetoric and his own record. What we
needed this year was a bold Budget to break us free from the
Chancellor’s record of nearly three years of a flatlining
economy. We heard a lot about fuel yesterday, and slogans about driving
the economy forward. In 2010, the Chancellor said that the economy
would grow by more than 2% every year up to 2015, a steady drive on the
road to recovery. Well, he has failed. He has not got the UK economy
into gear. This debate is about growth. He has failed on growth, and
the triple A rating fell off the roof rack on the
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T13:19:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000541" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0002.htm#13032161000541">Budgets
tend to unravel as the details are revealed, and we have seen that this
afternoon. It is less than a day since the Chancellor sat down, and we
have already seen cracks appearing in the second homes subsidy and the
Budget as a whole, and I have no doubt that will continue in the coming
days. He could have kept it simple. The fact is that for most people
the standard of living is under severe pressure. Energy and other
everyday 
<?notus-xml column=1112?>household bills are rising, wages are stagnant, real wages
have fallen since the Government came to power, and those on the lowest
incomes and on benefits are seeing their incomes falling. That is bad
for them, obviously, but it also sucks demand out of the economy and
creates a crisis of confidence.</hs_Para>

priority of this Budget should have been a dash for growth to instil
confidence in the UK economy. We have already heard the Business
Secretary admit this afternoon that there was a split in the Government
on this strategy; a split that still has not been resolved. The
Chancellor has never admitted that he got his economic strategy wrong
in the way that the Business Secretary did this afternoon. The problem
is that the Chancellor is lashed to the mast of austerity. To break
free would be a significant admission of his own failure, so the only
cry we hear from the Chancellor is “O Canada!” He is
hoping that the new Governor of the Bank of England will adopt a
pro-growth strategy to dig him out of this hole with a new monetary
approach, because the Chancellor cannot come to this Chamber and admit
that he got it wrong.</hs_Para>

should dwell for a few moments on the geographical perspective to the
health of the UK economy. Within the M25 ring, the London economy is
the pretty successful. It is patchy in areas, but it is a major engine
for our economy. Outside of the M25, the situation is particularly
patchy. As a whole the economy is flatlining, but there are significant
regional and sub-regional problems that the Budget did not address at
all. Basically, the Government have binned their regional economic
development strategy—a comprehensive approach to renewing our
towns and cities and ensuring growth. Centre for Cities produced its
“Cities Outlook 2013” report recently. It
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13032161001002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0002.htm#13032161001002">“The
64 cities that Outlook assesses account for 53 per cent of businesses,

growth of the national
economy.”<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T13:22:26"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13032161000544" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0002.htm#13032161000544">Telford
is one of those 64 cities, and we need help. Unemployment in Telford is
stubbornly high at 7%, and a large proportion of the unemployed are
aged between 16 and 24. Median rates of gross weekly pay are lower than
elsewhere in the west midlands and England. The Budget did nothing at
all to help young people. I did not hear the Chancellor talk about the
problems faced by young people; it certainly was not a major element of
his Budget.</hs_Para>

are not sitting back and doing nothing in Telford. We are trying to
make a difference. The Labour council is leading a major drive on
apprenticeships, and Telford College of Arts and Technology is working
hard to offer training and development in local companies. We are
delivering new schools across the borough through the Building Schools
for the Future programme—the last great legacy of the previous
Labour Government—and providing new learning environments. We
are regenerating estates such as Brookside, and are making a
significant investment, in partnership with the private sector, in the

we need now is a Government who are as keen as our Labour council in
Telford and Wrekin to make difference. We need a city deal for Telford.
Twenty cities have been asked to bid in the second round of
“city deal”, in addition to the major cities that have
already 
<?notus-xml column=1113?>secured it. We need the flexibility to work with
Government to bring in investment. In Telford, Homes and Communities
Agency land has been sitting idle since the new town corporation was
wound down, and it is ready for development. We could be developing a
profit-sharing deal with the Government for those land sites, working
together to shift them off the Government ledger, getting investment
for housing and infrastructure into our town, and profit-sharing with
the Treasury. That would be good for the local community, good for the
Treasury and would get the economy moving. I call on the Business
Secretary to think about that. I hope he is willing to meet with
representatives, along with the Secretary of State for Communities and
Local Government.</hs_Para>

development agencies. I spoke to the business community in Telford

come on to. We are suffering from international gloom. Along with other
major economies around the world, such as France, Germany, Japan and
the United States, we are faring better, despite the problems of high
oil and commodity prices and the frustratingly slow resolution of the
eurozone crisis. That is thanks to the Government’s strategy of
monetary and fiscal responsibility, along with supply-side
reform.</hs_Para>

layman’s terms, monetary policies reflect the price the
Government pay to borrow money and the total supply of money itself. It
is thanks to our low interest 
<?notus-xml column=1114?>rates that the cost of borrowing for individuals,
banks and the Government is low. That helps to keep inflation low and
provides the stability that investors need for confidence in the
markets. On fiscal policy—how much money goes into the pot
through taxes, and what comes out to influence economic
activity—this Government are smaller than the previous
Government. They have cut waste and are costing the taxpayer less,
which is very positive. Indeed, the public sector borrowing requirement
is down by a third from its post-war peak, only three years ago, of
11.2% of GDP.</hs_Para>

essentially is a £700 tax cut for 24 million people;
the new £2,000 employment allowance; and a cut in corporation

very welcome. I particularly welcome the £3 billion
capital spending commitment and the £1.6 billion of

that under Labour, government was too big, too costly and too
inefficient. Labour allowed banks to lend money to people who could not

march with determination out of the rain. That analogy holds today, as
this Conservative-led Government lead Britain out of the economic

solutions whatsoever, other than to repeat past mistakes such as
encouraging spending of money we do not have. We will not stop
reminding the public of the last Government’s mismanagement of

only higher than rates in the rest of Scotland and the UK, but much
higher than when Labour left office. The same applies to the employment
count across Scotland. Today, there are 145,000 jobseeker’s

Dundee. This dole queue of people would reach from Edinburgh to
Glasgow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T13:37:18"></hs_TimeCode>. The

two-bedroom home to allow his child to visit him at the weekends, but
owing to his current situation he is now dependent on housing benefit
and has the choice either of not having his child stay overnight in
their own bedroom or being forced to move away from the area in which,
like me, he has lived his whole life.

my constituent
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T13:39:35"></hs_TimeCode>is not an
isolated one. The National Housing Federation has said that 2,000
people in my constituency are losing out from the bedroom tax. My local
authority of North Lanarkshire council has 5,500 tenants who will be
affected by it, but at the last count it had just 26 one-bedroom
properties available to rent. With those figures, where are those 5,500
people supposed to go? There is nowhere for them to go; they simply
face a painful benefit cut. This is an attack on our most vulnerable
and on many who are struggling with bills every month and with
under-employment, and it is resulting in millions of pounds being taken
out of my local economy.</hs_Para>

the Government really want to solve the problem, one of the things they
should do is build more houses. That would go a lot further to support
growth than the bedroom tax or the mortgage guarantee that was
announced yesterday, which is already falling apart at the seams. In
Scotland, housing makes up 40% of the construction sector. Every
£1 spent on housing generates £3 in the wider economy. It
is a no-brainer. Every new home creates two jobs in the construction
sector and four in the supply chain. When construction makes up a third
of the businesses in my constituency and around one in 10 jobs, hon.
Members can see why I was hoping that capital spending in Scotland
would be a bit higher than was announced yesterday. The Scottish
Government could also do a bit more with the money they already have.
Some 40,000 construction jobs have vanished in Scotland since the
Scottish National party came to power, and in December more than 14,000
construction workers were still on the dole.</hs_Para>

are things the Government could be doing. For example, my local
council—Labour-run North Lanarkshire—is working to help
to create private sector jobs through its youth investment programme,
which helps small businesses by paying 50% of the cost of employing a
young person for the first year. It also has programmes helping older
workers to return to work. I hope that the Government might go away and
look at that example—I am happy to provide more information on
it—to see how simple, practical support is making a difference
to help small and medium-sized businesses and create employment just
where it is needed.</hs_Para>

the cancellation of the planned fuel duty rise; the new measures to
counter tax avoidance, particularly the information-sharing agreements
that have been reached with the Isle of Man, Guernsey and
Jersey; and the abolition of stamp duty on share transactions on small
company growth markets, which will help to reverse the bias in the tax
system towards debt financing and improve the tax position of equity
financing. I also welcome the new remit for the Monetary Policy
Committee, which means it can issue guidance about future interest rate
expectations. Monetary policy is key to reviving growth, and the fact
that the monthly 12-month growth rate of M4—the broad money

all, I welcome the Government’s continued commitment to fiscal
consolidation and restraint in public
spending—policies that in my view have been remarkably
successful over the last three years in reducing the budget deficit
from a staggering £159 billion in 2009-10, or some 11.2% of GDP,
to £121 billion in 2011-12, or some 7.9% of GDP. There have been
two guiding principles to the Government’s fiscal
policy—the fiscal mandate—which says that the structural
deficit shall be eliminated within the five-year forecasting horizon.
As table B.6 on page 105 of the Red Book makes clear, the cyclically
adjusted surplus on current account—that is, the structural
deficit—will move into a surplus of 0.1% of GDP by 2016-17, a
year ahead of the five-year time horizon. The supplementary
target—that the Government’s total accumulated debt
should be starting to fall as a percentage of national income by
2015-16—will be met by 2017-18, with a fall from 85.6% of GDP in
2016 to 84.8% in 2017-18. That is two years later than the target;
nevertheless, it is forecast to be achieved. The fact that the
Chancellor has not tightened the fiscal position further in order to
meet the target by 2015-16 is evidence that the Government’s
economic policy is far more nuanced than critics

in total by 2017-18. I would also argue that the cuts in corporation

endured a double-dip recession and the economy shrank by 0.3% in the

sometimes wondered whether “To intervene, or not to

Government, the question needs to change from whether there should be
intervention to how that intervention can take place effectively. For

to 70,000. By 2003, an economic basket case with inflation of 1,000% in
1992 had spawned the invention of Skype. There are clear lessons to be
learnt from those northern neighbours, the most fundamental being that
if industrial policy is to work, there needs to be a broadly
“horizontal” approach. That does not mean being laid
back, but it does mean having a more laissez-faire confidence in the
ability of businesses to identify and satisfy customer demand—as
they are best placed to do—and providing the right foundation
for enterprise to flourish across the board, rather than backing
policies in the sense of picking winners. That is the course the

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000637" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0003.htm#13032161000637">We

allowance will help to spur growth and build on the Government’s
successful record of creating jobs in the private sector: the private
sector, not the public sector. In an enterprising constituency such as
Macclesfield, where an unusually high proportion of the population are
self-employed, reforms like those can tip the balance for sole traders,
encouraging them to incorporate themselves in businesses that can grow,

Elan Jones</B> (Clwyd South) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful to you, Mr
Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to speak in this important Budget
debate. I shall make a relatively short speech, because I know that
many other Members wish to speak. I make no apology for focusing on my
constituency, and on the people who elected me to be their
representative in
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000646" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0003.htm#13032161000646">I
do not think there is a single issue in my area that people care about
more than jobs, and I entirely agree with them. My constituents know
that without work, there can be no community and no prosperity. Much
concern has rightly been expressed about the fact that growth in our
economy now stands at less than a seventh of the amount that the
Chancellor anticipated in his 2010 spending review: 0.7%, rather than
the 5.3% that was forecast at that time. However, I believe that we are
right to be even more concerned about the fact that yesterday the
Chancellor, rather alarmingly, had to admit that the growth forecast
for this year had been cut in half, to just 0.6%. The forecast by the
Office for Budget Responsibility that borrowing will hit £114
billion this year, instead of the already immense £108 billion
that was previously forecast, should fill us all with concern, as
should the fact that yesterday’s UK unemployment figures were up
by 7,000 to 2.52
million.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000647" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0003.htm#13032161000647">It

country could never have stood against fascism. They are, I believe
wise and prophetic words for us today. That is why I believe that
discussions about unemployment affect us all, and why unemployment can
never be seen as a price worth paying. It is why I am deeply
disappointed that the Chancellor did not take the step yesterday that
my party would have taken by guaranteeing a job for every young person
out of work for a year or more and for every adult unemployed for more
than two years—funded by a fair tax on bank bonuses and changes
to pensions tax relief for the very richest. That would be a far better
investment than the subsidy on second homes. For Labour Members, it is

delighted to be a member of the party that proposed them. It is just
that, in the interests of fairness, growth and getting our economy
going again, I have to ask: if it matters so much to him, why will he
not do it now? Why does he think that excellent local small businesses

Budget provides £1 billion to support the development of more

certainty on social rents, which is left to the spending round in the
Budget book. On the right to buy, a great Conservative measure, we are
increasing the London cap to £100,000 and reducing the

the same. Unemployment in Feltham and Heston has risen by nearly l0% in
the past six months; the number of young people out of work is at its
highest level since March last year. During the Budget debate last
year, I spoke of how there were six people chasing every job in Feltham
and Heston. A year later, I am deeply concerned and saddened that I am

Budget, however, not one that takes action now. As John Longworth,
director general of the British Chambers of Commerce commented

the past two years, under this Chancellor, it has fallen by
£28.1 billion. The reality

businesses—our country’s wealth creators—are

employees. The Budget shows no signs of changing that.

me remind the House, particularly Opposition Front Benchers, of the
nature of the debt legacy we inherited. We started with the worst debt
to GDP ratio of any country in the western world, worse than that of
Greece and other economies that have been put into special measures by
the IMF. The annual deficit when we started was running at 11% of GDP
and is now 7%—that, for the benefit of Opposition Front
Benchers, is a reduction.</hs_Para>

£1 trillion—roughly £15,000 for every man, woman

baffled by big numbers, let me try to break it down. If it

truth is that we inherited not just an annual deficit but a structural
deficit. For the benefit of Opposition Members who are not aware of the
difference, the structural deficit is that bit of the Budget which,
even when the economy is growing, continues to haemorrhage money. The
biggest drivers of our structural deficit are pensions, benefits and
the NHS. The IFS pre-Budget briefing yesterday, which was made
available to all parties, makes it clear that the structural deficit
continues to put a black hole at the heart of our public finances. The
IFS forecasts that between 2011 and 2018 we will be spending an extra
£5 billion on pensions, £20 billion on benefits and
£15 billion on the NHS. That is after the sensible and pragmatic
reforms we have introduced. It is a legacy the Opposition should be

A sets out three key ways of dealing with that—tackling the
deficit, a fair burden of tax and a sustainable long-term platform for
growth. We have cut the deficit by 30%, from 11% of GDP to 7%, although
the shadow Chancellor seemed unable this morning to accept that that is
indeed a reduction. The IFS has made it clear that under the Labour
party’s plan B we would incur £201 billion more debt by
2016-17. Who on earth could think that borrowing another £200
billion, given that legacy, is the
answer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:40:55"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

part of plan A, the fairness of the burden of taxation, the
Opposition have been scaremongering about it and need to understand it.
First, the Chancellor has decided, rightly, to pay off 80% of the debt
through public spending reductions and 20% through taxation. The burden
of taxation is powerfully shifted towards those with the broadest
shoulders. I remind the House that 1% of taxpayers in this country pay
25% of all tax, and 50% of our income tax is paid by the top 20%. We
have taken 2 million people out of tax altogether. The £130
billion funding to help new homeowners is the largest package of
support—far larger than anything the Opposition were asking for.
The £6 billion relief on 
<?notus-xml column=1133?>fuel duty is a massive support for hard-working families, and coming
from a rural constituency I particularly welcome its effect on the
rural economy. The beer duty measure, too, is a substantial one for

families in my constituency will be hit by that policy, and many will

the catch is that there are very few smaller properties available for
those trying to move. City West housing trust told me that some 460
families have asked to downsize. However, it expects to have re-housed
only 43 families by April, and 260 more in 2013-14. The trust

wait two and a half years before they can get help with child care,
which is very expensive. That delay is bad enough, but, worse still,
the proposed child care scheme will give a tax break to families
earning up to £300,000 a year but offer no help to families on
tax credits, whose incomes are already squeezed. Once again, the

Although we welcome the fact that a cap is finally being set, having
waited more than a year for the announcement, we must remember that the
Dilnot commission recommended a cap of £35,000. Setting the cap
at that level would have offered the best protection to people on lower
and middle incomes. It is very disappointing, to say the least, that
the Government have ignored the advice of the experts whom they put
together in the commission, and set the cap at a much higher level
while also—this point tends to be ignored—making people
pay accommodation costs of £12,000 a year, the very top end of
what Dilnot recommended. People who need care when they are elderly,
frail or ill will continue to face the shock of large care bills.
Examples I have seen of the cap being set at such a high level show
that the reality is that often, people will have to pay for their care
for four or five years before getting any state help. Many fewer people

introduce the flat pension rate. For far too long, the option of
self-employment was penalised by the pensions system. The move to a

it is also difficult to then provide for a pension, because the

is worth remembering that in his June 2010 Budget, the Chancellor of
the Exchequer stood at the Dispatch Box and announced that the growth
rate for 2013 would be 2.9%. In his autumn statement, just a
few months ago in December 2012, he stood at the same Dispatch Box and
announced that the rate would be 1.2%. Yesterday, humiliatingly for the
Chancellor, he had to announce to the country that the Office for
Budget Responsibility’s own statistics show that the projected
growth rate for this year is a miserly
0.6<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:04:16"></hs_TimeCode>%. It does
not get any better, because the 2010 Budget’s projected growth
for 2014 was 2.5%, which was downgraded by the autumn statement to 2%,
and yesterday the Chancellor said that it would be 1.8%, which is,
frankly, optimistic. It is worth remembering that in 2010, actual
growth was 1.8%.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:04:58"></hs_TimeCode> is a real

the high level of debt we have and about the costs we will put on

would go up. That is the truth of the matter.” That is what the

more than £1 million from the regional growth fund,
which could create up to 50 sustainable, high-skilled

starting projects because they do not think that they will be able to

working with the grain of the aspirations of the British people to give

the backing of the Government to do so. The hon. Member for Worsley and
Eccles South (Barbara Keeley) said that the cap on the cost of
residential care—the implementation of the Dilnot
measures—was still quite high, but at least it is there now, and
we are saying for the first time that people who work and save all
their lives, who set up a business or buy their own home, will not have
all that taken away late in life. There will be a cap on their
contributions so that they do not pay through the nose for something
that other people get for free. That is part of supporting the

an alienation budget because the vast majority of our people are into

do anything about the 1 million people who suffered as a result of this

taken steps to assist the victims. In 2010, the coalition Government
honoured our election pledges to compensate the victims of that fiasco.

part of a single electricity market in Ireland. The effect of the price

a way that would have penalised business and consumers. I am therefore

already know that there is some confusion about aspects of the Budget,

has rightly raised some issues and questions about the scheme, but let
us be clear: whether or not it will support people with buy-to-let
mortgages, there is to be no income cap whatever on the people
qualifying for it. At a time when people here are all about the
“aspiration nation”, there are a lot of people out there
who just feel exasperation that a scheme such as this should come along
with no income cap. Meanwhile, they have suffered the loss of child
benefit, on which there is an income cap, starting at £50,000,
with payments ending completely at £60,000. Those people are
exasperated too when they hear, “Oh yes, child care benefits are
coming”—in two and a half

aspects of the Budget served notice of more pain to come. The
Chancellor spoke yesterday about changes that he will be making through
annually managed expenditure. That sounds like a dry, technical change,
but it will have a significant impact in relation to the controls that
are being placed on welfare spending. We have already had the Welfare
Reform Act 2012, which changed many of the rules, structures and
qualifying criteria for benefits. It was designed in such a way as to
allow for wide regulatory powers to place further changes and squeezes
on benefits without the need for further primary legislation.</hs_Para>

is clear that, by moving to change the rules relating to annually
managed expenditure, the Chancellor is trying to put in place more
fixed envelopes for welfare spending. That will have particular
implications for the way in which social security spend is
managed in Northern Ireland, because the money comes to Northern
Ireland not as part of the departmental expenditure 
<?notus-xml column=1149?>limit—the DEL—but as annually managed expenditure. If that
is now to be subject to some fixed-envelope procedure and capped in
advance, it will put serious stress on the Northern Ireland Assembly.
The Assembly is in the bizarre position of having to pass karaoke
legislation that has to be exactly the same as that passed here, but it
is notionally responsible for the administrative discretion on
delivery. That will be a fundamental challenge for us in Northern
Ireland, and we all need to wake up to that fact.</hs_Para>

that, but his rate of travel in regard to corporation tax UK-wide means
that, by the time any concession is delivered to Northern Ireland, the

me end by making a fundamental point. Every politician in the House
must recognise that our debt burden presents us all with a challenge to
do more with less. The answer is not to continue kicking the can down
the road. We must face up to our responsibilities, and we owe it to the
generations to come to do that quickly, while interest rates are low,
rather than waiting to see what—as was pointed out by my hon.

Shuker</B> (Luton South) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I am extremely grateful
not only to have been called to speak, but to follow the hon. Member
for Bedford (Richard Fuller), because I intend to use his speech as a
launchpad for my own. I have a great deal of sympathy with much of what
he said. In particular, I agree with him that the rising level of
private sector debt in the economy is worrying—much more
worrying than the rising level of public sector debt during the earlier

most important question for the House to answer is this. Given that
members of all parties know there is a massive problem in our
economy—the mountain of debt that is at this moment being added
to our existing national debt—why do Ministers refuse to
face up to it?</hs_Para>

would we have been, had the OBR’s initial assessment been
correct? By this point in the present Parliament, our economy would
have grown by 5% or 6%, there would have been a solid and recognisable
recovery, and further scope for a reduction in public spending as the
deficit went down. Instead, we have seen growth of between 0% and 1%,
and we know that, in this first quarter of 2013, we are a margin of
error away from a triple-dip recession—let alone the double-dip
recession that has already happened. There is clearly a lack of
confidence, not just consumer confidence but confidence among
businesses and elsewhere, preventing investment and the securing of the
growth we
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000805" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0003.htm#13032161000805">The
result of all this—the result of the halving of growth in the
most recent Budget assessment, and of the Chancellor’s having
not only to downgrade his own assessments of growth but to upgrade the
amount he will have to borrow every time he comes to the Dispatch
Box—is quite simple. We are adding an incredible amount of debt
to the economy, and the Government are giving no clear indication of
what they are going to do. The pain experienced by my constituents, and
by many of our constituents throughout the country, can be tempered
only by a sense that we are getting somewhere in sorting out the
problem that has been
created.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000806" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0003.htm#13032161000806">However,
the sad assessment is that we have wasted three years in getting there.
The debt has continued to rise. When Government Members say, “We
are paying down Britain’s debts”, either they are being
ignorant of the facts or something more sinister is going on. No debt
has been paid down by this Government. In their five years, this
Government will have borrowed more than was borrowed during the 13
years of the previous Labour Government, and that was true even before
yesterday’s horror-show figures. We know that at the end of this
Parliament the deficit will still be in the tens of billions of pounds;
I believe the figure will be £70 billion in the final
year of this Parliament. We know that last year, this year and next
year the deficit remains, in essence, unchanged, at about £120
billion.</hs_Para>

of us choose not to talk about this next issue. Many Government Members
would say privately that they are deeply concerned about the
Government’s economic strategy, but they will not talk about it
in this Chamber. The shocking thing is the effect that is having on the
general public’s perception of what is going on in the real
economy. All the polling shows us that only about one in 10 people
understands that the debt is going up, rather than going down or
remaining the same. The public believe, by and large, that these cuts
are productive. They confuse—possibly because the Government
themselves have confused—the debt and the deficit, but, believe
it or not, this Government will borrow more in their period in office
than the previous Labour Government did in 13 years. We need to call
them out on that as clearly as we can.</hs_Para>

a plan to work, it needs to be credible. What do I mean by that? First,
a proper plan is needed. This Government said that they had
one—Labour had one going into the last election. Secondly, the
belief is needed that the Government will see it through. This
Government say they will see it through, even though they are clearly
not keeping to the plan. We believe that the best way to make a
credible case for seeing it through would be an Act of Parliament
stating that the deficit will be halved in four years. The third test
of a credible plan is: does it work? I ask in the simplest way 

<?notus-xml column=1153?>I can: on what measure is the Chancellor’s economic plan working?
The answer is none whatsoever, and that presents real challenges to our
constituents and to our country.</hs_Para>

Tomlinson</B> (North Swindon) (Con):</Member> Given the time
constraints, this will, obviously, be a bit of a whistle-stop tour.
However, I will set out some of my Budget highlights and, with each
one, something on my wish list to try to be constructive for the
Government. First, I very much welcome the £10,000 personal
allowance. As we know, that is a tax cut for 24 million people and 2.7
million people will be completely taken out of paying income tax. This
is genuinely a reward for people doing the right thing.</hs_Para>

excellent work by the TaxPayers Alliance has highlighted a chronic lack
of understanding of the impact of changes to taxation in
people’s own payslips. In this week’s <I>The
Spectator</I>, I set out a request that when changes to pay-as-you-earn
made by any future Government, of any colour, kick in, they should be
explained on the employee’s payslip. In that way, we can get
greater engagement. I know through my work on the all-party group on
financial education for young people that because we now have so many
direct debits and standing orders, people are disfranchised from their
own bank accounts. Therefore, setting out the information I suggest
will help.</hs_Para>

welcome the various measures to support business, such as the 20p rate
of corporation tax and the £2,000 employment allowance. It will
make a huge difference in the south-west, as 85,000 employers will gain
and 40,000 will be taken out of paying national insurance altogether.
Some 1.25 million private sector jobs have been created and a quarter
of a million new businesses have started since we came to power. My
constituency has seen the fastest increase in the number of start-up
businesses in the south-west. It is also crucial that we continue to
support businesses looking to export to emerging economies such as
Brazil, India and China, so that we are not so exposed to the
turbulence in the European Union.</hs_Para>

also want more to be done to help promote young entrepreneurs. We all
support that principle, but young people face a challenge, as I find
when I talk to business students. I was the only one of the 350 who
studied business on my university course who ended up running their own
business and employing people. When I ask business students whether
they would like to run a business, all the hands go up and they are
extremely enthusiastic; they have been enthused by “The
Apprentice” and “Dragons’ Den”. When I then
ask how many will do it, all the hands go back down, because they
simply do not know how. When people choose to go to university or take
on an apprenticeship—the number of which has increased
massively—a clear, defined career path is laid out for them. If
they tick the box, get the grades and pass the application process,
that is what they will do. We need to do a lot more in that
regard.</hs_Para>

£711. One team was so successful that the

Public Accounts Committee, but one of my biggest disappointments is
that that happened 24 hours after Starbucks and Amazon had their
hearing. Amazon kindly came to meet me yesterday and it is fair to say
that we rowed. Its actions over tax and transferring money to
Luxembourg are disgraceful. The company is not operating on an even
playing field. We have to investigate some form of internet consumer
tax for such organisations, but with every single penny ring-fenced to
subsidise the business rates of the traditional high street. If the
high street struggles any more, Amazon will also struggle because the
high street is the shop window. I have spoken to a number of
independent retailers who provide the customer service—and
consumers then simply pick up the phone and order from Amazon. Let us

of my colleagues on the Opposition Benches—I will not mention

questions about mental health problems and the astonishing figure came
back to show that 32.9% of 16 to 25-year-olds have a mental health
problem. That may be just depression or stress, but the figure is
32.9%. When we look at those figures region-wide and overlay them on to

the same price at the pumps previously, crude oil was $140 per barrel.
So we have a false price. The weak pound is ratcheting the price up,

it does come, it probably is not going to where they want to go. I am
being slightly facetious, but the point is that bus services in many
rural areas do not stack up economically, however much subsidy we throw
at them, so fuel and cars are not a luxury; they are an essential.
Therefore, every time we raise fuel duty, we tax people’s means
of getting to work. That is why I congratulate the Chancellor on
freezing fuel duty. It is now 13p less than it was when Labour was in
power. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:14:00"></hs_TimeCode>I am also

plenty of evidence about how slowly they are benefiting
infra- structure and investment. The recent National Audit
Office report on the national infrastructure plan pointed out
that although developers notified the Government of 99
infrastructure projects under the plan, by December 2012 only three had
been determined, six were expecting a decision within three months, and
the remaining 90 were not even at a decision stage.</hs_Para>

example of announcements about infrastructure taking a long time to

announced in 2011 and announced again in 2012. The money for it will
probably start flowing through into carriages and stations from late
2014 onwards, until perhaps 2017 or 2018. It is obviously a very good
investment, but it will not have an effect on boosting the economy in
2013. It did not have that effect in 2012 or 2011, and it will not do
so until 2015 onwards. What can be said of that project is certainly

all want to see the encouragement of affordable, or relatively
affordable, housing for first-time buyers and people who cannot get on
to the housing ladder, and we certainly want to see the desperately
needed boost for the construction industry that would come from such
measures. However, it is a different thing to promote a scheme that
would apparently help anyone of any income to buy a house costing up to
£600,000 in any part of the country. That would inevitably run a
high risk of setting off an unsustainable house price boom, which, as
we have learned from previous experience, is precisely the kind of
thing that many parts of the country do not need. It also creates a
great danger of exacerbating some of the regional economic differences

the Secretary of State was asked about this measure, he told us, in his
usual emollient way, that the details are being discussed and that more
consideration is going on. Most of us in the Chamber could already hear
the gears crunching as the Government prepared another U-turn, or,
alternatively, the Secretary of State personally distanced himself from
Government policy. This policy is being spun in the media, no doubt by
someone in the Treasury. It is not so much about 
<?notus-xml column=1159?>helping people who need housing as trying to get a
housing boom in 2015, and it is the wrong approach. The Government say
that they are going to introduce a policy that would help people on
whatever income, in whatever part of the country, to buy houses costing
up to £600,000. That would particularly benefit people with high

that, during an April 2012 debate on the Financial Services Bill, the

local banks, greater ease of entry and greater ability to open a local

for the employer in meeting peak demand, and, of course, a person

as a result of the Budget is so far away from helping the problem that
I do not know where to begin. As I said in an intervention, those are
not really affordable homes—homes at 80% of market value are not
affordable to most people. If they become affordable for people on low
incomes, the housing benefit 
<?notus-xml column=1164?>bill will be ratcheted up, when the Government have told us for so long

ensuring that many of my constituents suffer a substantial cut in their
income from the bedroom tax to cut the housing benefit bill, but
another part is busily putting the housing benefit bill up. The policy
does not make sense. Last year, we were told that 100,000 people will
benefit from the help to buy scheme. The reality is that only 1,5000

insightful speeches from 30 hon. Members—although, with
the exception of the Business Secretary, no Liberal Democrats. All
those hon. Members brought to the debate their feelings about, and
analysis of, the impact that the measures in the Budget will have on
families and businesses in their constituencies and across the country.

of the debate, we heard a tour de force from the shadow Chancellor, who
exposed the complete confusion about the new help to buy scheme,
suggesting that we now have a second omnishambles Budget. We are
expecting a U-turn very shortly. It seems that the scheme will not help
hard-pressed families get a foot on the property ladder: it is actually
a bung, a spare-home subsidy for millionaires. That is not what the
housing market needs, and it is certainly not what the economy
needs.</hs_Para>

mention how important the credit rating is either, although

the start of this Parliament, the Chancellor said that the current
structural deficit would be eliminated by the end of 2014-15.
Yesterday’s Red Book, however, shows that the
Chancellor’s target to balance the books by the end of this
Parliament will be missed by three whole years. Public sector net
borrowing at the end of this Parliament is now forecast to be
approximately £96 billion—five times larger than the
Chancellor expected it to be in 2010. Every year, he comes to this
House and has to admit that borrowing is rising, and that the time

the Member for Luton South (Gavin Shuker) said that borrowing in the
five years of this Government is higher than it was in the 13
years of the previous Labour Government. The dramatic
deterioration in sentiment, even since Christmas, is striking.
According to Red Book figures, the Government now expect to borrow
£55.7 billion more in the next five years than they thought they

Chancellor assured us that, as a result of his policies, net debt would
be falling as a proportion of national income by 2015. That was one of
his fiscal targets. Judge me, he said, by my ability to get debt as a
share of GDP down. However, the Red Book reveals the true failure of
the Chancellor’s approach: net debt as a proportion of national
income is not falling but rising in every single year of the rest of
this Parliament and beyond, from 75.9% of national income this year, to
79.2% in 2013-14, to 82.6% in 2014-15, to 85.1% in 2015 and peaking at

direction in economic policy, as

the Member for Barnsley Central said. On every single test of economic
policy that the Chancellor has set himself and asked to be judged on,
he has failed, and because of those failures families in Britain are
struggling. Life is worse now and living standards are lower for
ordinary families than they were three years ago, and they will be
worse in 2015. The Chancellor is pursuing this course for reasons of
political vanity and ideological arrogance, rather than from economic
necessity. His incompetence and lack of judgment have meant that he has
boxed himself in. There is nowhere for him to go with any dignity and
he refuses, for reasons of pride rather than economics, to change
course. As Andrew Smith, chief economist at KPMG in the UK said in

diamond jubilee, the Olympics, the number

shadow Chancellor still does not accept that he spent too much and
borrowed too much. He cannot even admit that under Labour’s

higher. He really believes that we can borrow less by borrowing more.
This country will never forget that, true to form, Labour brought our
country to the brink of bankruptcy by the end of its term.
After 13 years, we were left with the largest deficit since the
second world war, the deepest recession of any industrialised

Department for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr

at Glasgow airport because his plane has developed engine trouble.
Obviously I am sorry about that, both for him and for me, but I suspect

am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter in an Adjournment
debate, although I very much regret that it has been necessary to do so
at all. It is unprecedented in all my 40 years’ parliamentary

representatives of a major section of the population who have, in their

31 January, I wrote to the Secretary of State asking whether a
delegation could meet him in his office to discuss the reforms that
urgently need to be made to the work capability assessments for
disabled people. I reminded him in my letter of the debate in the House
on Atos, which I initiated on 17 January. In my view, it was one of the
best debates I have experienced in the House for a long time. It was
free from rancour and partisanship, but it was critical, detailed,
passionate and well focused on the need for reform. Nearly 30 Members
spoke and, although Members on both sides of the House
acknowledged that there had been some improvements, they were without
exception deeply critical of the fact that the fundamental structures
remained deeply flawed. That, they said, was causing profound upset,
distress, indignation, anger and a real sense of helplessness, and was,
in many cases, making sick people even sicker as a result of anxiety
and fear.</hs_Para>

firm. <hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>It was for
those reasons that I sought the meeting with the delegation, and it
never occurred to me that it would not be readily and promptly granted
by the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, the hon.

hours, after waiting more than five weeks, I did receive a reply from
the Minister of State. It emerged when I spoke to the Secretary of

of State’s letter, which I have with me, bluntly
stated<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> that his
diary did not permit him the opportunity to see this delegation, which
I take to be “civil service-ese” for a flat no. 
<?notus-xml column=1172?>Frankly, I was taken aback, so I sought out the Minister in the Lobby
and, as soon as he saw me, he said: “I’m not seeing

unprecedented and totally unacceptable, he finally said,
“I’m not seeing Spartacus”—and repeated
that three times.</hs_Para>

provides the basis for my seeking this Adjournment debate today.
Spartacus is a group—initially hundreds but now
thousands—of sick and disabled people whose lives have been
dramatically affected by the welfare changes and who have come together
as a loose collective, call it what we will, to share their own
narrative with a wider public. Crucially, this work, which I have read
through in detail, is evidence-based, used the DWP’s own figures
and reports whenever possible, and has never been challenged on
accuracy either by the DWP or the wider public. Spartacus always aims
to provide a calm, credible and plausible response to the
Government’s proposals, highlighting where it feels the
proposals will have a damaging effect on sick and disabled people and
promulgating that to the wider public.</hs_Para>

movement crystallised initially around the so-called Spartacus or
“Responsible Reform” report, which set out an
evidence-based analysis showing that the DWP had misled the public by
claiming broad support for the abolition of the disability living
allowance and its replacement with the new benefit of personal
independence payments when there was, in fact, almost no public support
at all. On the launch day, literally hundreds of thousands took part
and the report trended at No. 1 or 2 on Twitter all day.
Since then, the report has been widely used and quoted by the Work and
Pensions Committee and the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and in
several parliamentary exchanges in this Chamber. I think that says
enough about the auspices and credibility of this
group<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T17:07:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032161000931" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/debtext/130321-0004.htm#13032161000931">In
addition, the Spartacus group has produced, as I said, a detailed and
lengthy review of the work capability assessment procedure based on the
lived experience— set out at great length—of 70
or more claimants, with additional comments from MPs, the courts,
professional bodies and medical professionals, along with the findings
of several freedom of information requests.</hs_Para>

the light of all that, I find it inconceivable that a Minister would
refuse to meet a representative or representatives from a group who
have a very powerful case to make—one that is strongly supported
by hundreds of thousands of sick and disabled people—and whose
records show, I repeat, that they have always argued their case with
evidence-based rigour and well documented analysis. It is not as if
Ministers have not yet met members of Spartacus. In the last year or
two, they have done so repeatedly. Kaliya Franklin, for example, one of
the people I named for the delegation, met the Secretary of State at
the Conservative party conference last year, and I understand that it
was a productive and courteous meeting, as I would have expected it to
be. Kaliya also met the Under-Secretary last year and I believe that
the discussions on disability and work were fruitful.</hs_Para>

together on 12 January. Both those disability activists had engaged in
debate with the former Under-Secretary of State, the right hon. Member
for Basingstoke (Maria Miller), numerous times on Radio 5 Live, Radio 4

set out to engage with politicians. That is what it wanted to do: to
create a movement with a credible voice that would be scrupulous in
aiming for reasonable change, setting out reasonable demands that it
believed were achievable. Yes, it does focus on the most damaging
aspects of welfare reform and explain why they are harmful, as it might
be expected to do, but it also offers alternatives which it believes
will work and which are costed whenever possible. For the Minister to

had been meeting Work programme providers in Scotland, when his plane
had to turn back because of engine problems. That is why he could not
be here, and he apologises for that. He very much wanted to answer this
debate, and I know that the Department, at his request, asked whether
today’s debate could be rescheduled so that he could answer it
himself. He was told that that was not possible. The only person who
could withdraw today’s debate was
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T17:15:31"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Oldham West and Royton, but he did not do so. I understand

of State engages widely and continuously with a range of people on the

people from a range of charities, including the National Autistic

Association for Mental Health, Citizens Advice, Scope and many others.
As I said, he was in Scotland earlier today meeting people from the
Work programme. He has also met people from a range of medical
organisations, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the
British Medical Association, and the president of the Royal College of
Radiologists.</hs_Para>

100 parliamentary questions from the hon. Gentleman, many on the work
capability assessment or Atos, over the past six months alone. We are
grateful for the hon. Gentleman’s interest and that of others,
and we are keen to maintain a constructive dialogue about how we might
further improve the WCA. Many meetings with stakeholder organisations
or individuals can be challenging; the WCA elicits strong views and is
not always fully understood. On occasion mistakes have been made, but
we are always open to constructive stakeholder engagement. Since taking
on his role, the Minister of State has engaged with organisations that
have been critical of the Department and has done so even if they have
intervened in judicial reviews against the Department—he has
still had those

McVey:</Member></B> I will address that point later in this debate.
What is key, and what the Minister of State felt was key, is a
constructive dialogue. He has consistently said several things about
the WCA since taking up his role. It has to be made clear—one
would not necessarily take this from today’s debate—that
he inherited the WCA from the previous Labour Government. We would not
necessarily know that from listening to this debate. We have been
committed to improving it. We want changes to happen, wherever
possible, in collaboration with the people who know most about it and
who are affected by it. The Minister of State made those points in the
debate on 17 January, but it is worth reiterating them today. They are
the core principles that drive much of the Department’s work on
the WCA and will remain so. Since taking office we have made the WCA
more sensitive and less mechanistic, successfully implementing a number
of challenging reforms to it.</hs_Para>

independent reviews of the WCA are obviously one of our key drivers for
positive change. Professor Harrington has had extensive interaction
with a wide variety of stakeholders, including individuals, lobby
organisations, MPs across all parties, and the staff in the Department
for Work and Pensions and Atos who are affected by the changes
resulting from his work. Professor Harrington listened to all of the
concerns raised and made recommendations based on the evidence
provided. His interpretation was that mental health conditions are
difficult to assess and he recommended the positioning of mental
function champions within Atos. We have listened and a network of
champions is now in place to provide advice and support to other health
care
professionals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T17:20:13"></hs_TimeCode>.

were to be constructive dialogue and positive outcomes from the

Meacher:</Member></B> We have finally got to the explanation. I could
have been given this a lot earlier. The Spartacus report is about 100
pages long—perhaps slightly under 100 pages. The quote that the
hon. Lady has given was one sentence in it. I agree that it is strong
language; it is the language of exasperation, hurt and anger, but the
idea that the Minister should refuse to see a delegation simply because
of the use of such language is absurd. Politicians are a bit tougher
than that. If he disagrees with it, he can speak his own mind to
members of the delegation directly. They have engaged constructively

Bayley:</Member></B> I stand corrected and congratulate  the
Government on moving in the right direction. The concern from the
International Development Committee was that it will mean a substantial
increase in spend  in this year. We were concerned about the
absorptive 
<?notus-xml column=334?>capacity, particularly in countries where we have bilateral programmes.

later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000017">The
International Development Committee has also voiced concerns about the
squeeze imposed by the Treasury on DFID’s administrative costs.
Like all Members I want to see every Government Department lean and
mean, but as DFID is unusual in having a sharply rising budget, we are
concerned that reducing the number of people DFID has on the ground
runs a risk of our aid spend being supervised and scrutinised less
closely, and possibly being less efficient as a result. That needs some
creative thinking.</hs_Para>

with the International Development Committee to DFID offices in the
field, it has occurred to me that it is now harder for DFID staff to
spend time away from the capital, looking at what is happening in
health clinics or schools. Perhaps DFID could contract out to
non-governmental organisations some of that work of checking what is
happening on the ground and delivering reports on whether the training
programmes for teachers in rural schools are delivering trained
teachers. That is just a
thought.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000019">Having
said that, I acknowledge that in the current economic climate it is not
an easy political decision for the Government to stick to the
commitment. Those of us who think it is the right thing to do have a
responsibility to make the case for international development,
in church halls and local newspapers up and down the
country. Although there is a strong constituency of support, often
church or faith based, for international development, and support from
many diaspora communities in Britain, there are also many people who
ask why we are increasing our charity abroad when we are not able to

Bayley:</Member></B> I agree strongly. If we can win the hearts and
minds of young people, we have a future on our side. The bold but right
decision made by the Prime Minister and Government to raise our aid
spending to 0.7% this year gives the Prime Minister great moral
authority when he is involved in discussions with leaders of other
countries. If the UK commits increased support to the world’s
poor, we are in a position to argue that others should do so as
well.</hs_Para>

Prime Minister to use that moral authority in the same way that Tony
Blair and my right hon. Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath
(Mr Brown), the former Prime Ministers, used their 
authority. They decided to lead internationally the argument for debt
write-offs, to increase aid substantially from 0.29% to 0.53% and to
win commitments from other global leaders to do more for the
world’s poor. It is particularly important for the Prime
Minister to use that moral persuasion in his capacity as co-chair of
the United Nations Secretary-General’s high-level panel, and in
the G8 summit that he chairs this summer.</hs_Para>

a little more about the parallel I see with the last time the G8 was in
the UK at the Gleneagles summit in 2005. The then Prime Minister Tony
Blair put global development and climate change on the agenda. Many
Members will recall the Make Poverty History campaign led by NGOs. It
mobilised hundreds of thousands of members of the public in support of
a demand to increase aid and make aid more effective. The
Government’s determination, together with that support from
civil society, led to a new partnership for Africa’s
development.</hs_Para>

hand, donors such as the UK committed to double aid to Africa. That
commitment was given by the G8 at Gleneagles and by the EU, which was
under the UK presidency that same year, 2005. On the other hand,
African leaders—led by Presidents Mkapa of Tanzania, Thabo Mbeki
of South Africa and Obasanjo of Nigeria—gave commitments that,
if the donors increased aid, leaders of African countries would do more
to use that aid effectively. They established a number of peer review
mechanisms—including the African Peer Review Mechanism—in
which officials from one African country would audit the effectiveness
of government expenditures and economic policies in other
countries.</hs_Para>

single most important point I want to make this afternoon is that deals
at international summits do not just happen. They do not happen because
G8 leaders feel in a benevolent mood on the day and decide to put their
hands in their pockets and double aid. It took two or three years of
political mobilisation and preparation to deliver the results in the
Gleneagles G8 and the British presidency of the European Union. That
probably began in 2001—I remember the year well, because that
was when Tony Blair sacked me from the Government. Rather nervously, he
called me in afterwards to talk to him, and he asked what I intended to
do. He had just made a speech about Africa and his commitment to do
more to seek to reduce global poverty, and I said that I would like to
do some work in that field. That was when, together with support from
colleagues from other parties, we created the Africa all-party
parliamentary group, and we worked closely with Downing street to
identify what the UK could do in policy terms to build a better

18 months or so before the Gleneagles summit, Blair created the
Commission for Africa—a team of eminent persons, the majority of
whom were Africans—to write a proposal for improving development
in the continent. They had a commission of some 36 people, headed by
Myles Wickstead, who currently advises the Select Committee on
International Development. They visited most countries in Africa and
certainly met, as it says in the introduction to the report,
representatives from 49 countries, as well as representatives from
every G8 country and every country in the EU. I believe that the report

anti-apartheid movement—the London-based solidarity
movement—that sought the overthrow of apartheid. By that stage,

order for the report to make a difference, simply publishing it and
hoping that all will turn out okay on the day is not good enough. You
have got to build a political campaign to win support from world
leaders, north and south, to ensure that it changes international
policy. You have got, for example, to get the Germans to pledge
something on  1 February, so that you can go to the French and
say, ‘Surely you can match that or top it.’ You have to 
<?notus-xml column=337?>programme a series of steps so that when you get to
Gleneagles, people know what the issues are. They will have talked with
their Finance Ministers, their Development Ministers—if they
have them—or their Foreign Affairs Ministers and will be in a
position to make the sort of commitment that you seek. Think of it like
one of our anti-apartheid campaigns. You do not get Barclays to
disinvest from South Africa by writing a good report suggesting that
that is what they should do. You have to organise a series of steps at
shareholder meetings or on the street, getting media coverage, in order
to get the change of policy that you

believe that the high-level panel has the potential to be a turning
point in international development that is just as significant as the

whether the key leaders of the panel, including the three
co-chairs—our Prime Minister, and the Presidents of Indonesia
and Liberia—see their task not only as writing a brilliant
report, like the Commission for Africa report, which I am sure they
will do, but as ensuring that a political process is put in train to
make sure that the report makes a difference. Many people can write
good reports—people at the World Bank and the United Nations
Development Programme can, as can academics at the School of Oriental

should not delegate the rest of the task. When it comes to getting on
the phone to President Obama or François Hollande and saying,
“What commitment are you going to make to the proposals in the

world leaders north and south? That depends more than anything else on
the work that the co-chairs do after they publish their report. I am
talking about their getting on the road, meeting other Presidents and
Prime Ministers, calling them up on the telephone, badgering them and
saying, “This is an issue that won’t go away.” I
think that if our Prime Minister does that, he will find his place in

of the first things that I think we need to do—I reiterate that
I am very much feeling my way here—is to ensure that there is
joined-up thinking on the other millennium development goals. For
example, I have been involved with a school in Tanzania for some
10 years. At the start, there were five primary-school
children, but today there are 400 children in the school, which now has
both a primary and a secondary element. The real challenge now is that
it is saying, “We have spent years educating these young people,
but where are they going to work? What employment will they go
into?” We must consider tertiary education in developing nations
and work so that there is a progression from the education that we are
providing. I totally applaud the support that DFID is giving in many
countries, such as through teachers’ salaries, but unless we
consider what will happen when young people come out of their school
environments, we will be failing them and, indeed, the communities in
which they
live<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T13:58:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000049">These
children have aspirations. During our recent trip to Ethiopia, we found
that many young children in remote villages wanted to be
doctors—they wanted to contribute to their communities and they
had ambition. Many of the young people I have met, for example in
Rwanda, are aspiring entrepreneurs. They want to develop businesses,
but we need to give them the tools to do that so that they can run with
the idea. At the moment, only 
<?notus-xml column=340?>5% of Africans are educated at tertiary level, although the global
average is 25%, so we need to consider, in the post-2015 MDG framework,
the importance of tertiary
education.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000050">Also

the Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy) and I had when we first went to
Rwanda in 2010, under the Conservative party’s Umubano project,
to teach entrepreneurs how to run their businesses. We went for a week:
on Monday, we taught how to write a business plan; on Tuesday, we
taught how to write a marketing plan; on Wednesday, we taught how to
set a budget; on Thursday, we taught how to recruit and interview
staff; and on Friday, we taught how to review it all. No
self-respecting management consultant would have entertained doing that
in a week. We taught 14 businesses, and after day one, we thought,
“If they’re interested, they’ll come back.”
They all came back day after
day.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000051">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:01:29"></hs_TimeCode>
the end of the week, the head of the Rwandan chamber of commerce came
to see us and said, “This has really been of interest. Could you
come back next year to teach some more businesses?” We said,
“How many more would be interested?” She looked at us and
said, “About 74,000.” They could not get basic help in
Rwanda about how to develop businesses, so there is real potential for
people in this country’s private sector to help to build
business capacity. People with experience of developing
businesses—perhaps those who are semi-retired or have taken
early retirement—could be matched with businesses in developing
countries and give them mentoring and support. Perhaps they could use
technology so that they do not need to go out there to visit. There is
a hunger for that kind of help,
however.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000052"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:01:34"></hs_TimeCode>Businesses
that want to create jobs in the developing world have problems
accessing finance. For example, on the International Development
Committee’s recent visit to Ethiopia, we met the Nile Edible Oil
Manufacturing Industry plc, which is a co-operative of about 32 small
companies that produce edible cooking oil, often in little more than
backstreet shacks. The group got together with some support from the
UN. It produced an action plan, formed a business association and found
a site where it wanted to build a business park, which would have
involved individual units and a central processing plant. The plan was
very exciting. Through the co-operative, the farmers had been helped to
produce better crop yields and the producers were enhancing their
productivity with better machinery and better technological support,
and they were all delivering to markets at a better price. The group
has a site for a business park and a plan, but it cannot get funding. I
am sure that that situation is typical of many companies, organisations
and associations in the developing world that cannot access finance. We
think that accessing finance it is difficult here, but imagine how much
harder it is there. As part of our job creation aspiration and
prioritisation for the developing world, can we look at access to
finance?</hs_Para>

wish to make a few additional points before I conclude. It is right
that there are many aspects to enabling businesses to work. For
example, there needs to be better land registration and security of
land tenure for businesses. If someone is setting up a business, they
want to feel secure, and we can help with that. Good community
governance is also important, because when 
<?notus-xml column=341?>a local community understands that if local businesses flourish, local
rates will improve, it is a win-win for the community’s support
for local businesses. That understanding still needs to be
developed.</hs_Para>

conditionality with regard to transparency, such as tax transparency
and so forth, would be helpful, as would support for developing a
“Companies House” in some developing countries.
Businesses could then be registered and they would deliver annual
accounts, which would lead to some sort of recognition in the business
community to help them to move from an informal to a formal footing.
Businesses should be given incentives to do that—whether through
advice, or access to funding or grants—to ensure that the
business community in developing countries has structural
support.</hs_Para>

I am sure some Members present will be aware, yesterday the President

Livingstone’s birth. I spent some time in Malawi, in a previous

historical links to Ekwendeni, in the north of Malawi, through the
Church of Scotland, so I was particularly interested in what President
Banda had to say about development progress in her country and her

is one of the less developed countries in southern Africa, and although
the millennium development goals have helped to focus attention on
access to basic services, President Banda made it clear that too little
progress has been made on tackling maternal mortality. A few years ago,
I visited health care facilities in Malawi. They were understaffed and
under-resourced. With nurses’ and midwives’
representatives, I discussed the immense challenges they face in
managing complications in pregnancy and childbirth that in this country
would be routinely dealt with—infections, high blood pressure
and conditions that should not still be killing women and can be
treated cheaply and effectively, but which nevertheless cause
unnecessary maternal deaths.</hs_Para>

also remember visiting schools in rural areas that had grass roofs, mud
floors and one textbook for a class of 100 children. During the rainy
season, lessons just have to stop, and the lack of toilet facilities
means that many girls are taken out of school as soon as they hit
puberty. President Banda touched on those issues yesterday too, when
she talked about the importance of ensuring that girls as well as boys
go to secondary school, and about her Government’s efforts to
ensure that girls are recruited in equal numbers to boys and are able
to return to school even if they have had children. There is a lot of
evidence that education helps to reduce the incidence of early marriage
and childbirth, and significantly boosts a family’s long-term
prospects, but we must look beyond counting the children in the
classrooms and emphasise the quality of the education, the length of
time during which kids receive it, and the equality of both access and
outcomes for
girls.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000065">All
of that highlights a key issue for us as we look beyond 2015, which is
that whatever the merits of the millennium development goals in
providing a focus for global political action, they have had serious
limitations as measures of poverty reduction and have, perhaps, not
reflected national and regional priorities in different parts of the
planet. They have also masked inequality in ways that can distort our
assessment of their impact, and that is particularly true in relation
to the women and girls who are often left behind when we measure
progress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000066">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:19:45"></hs_TimeCode>
point was brought home forcefully at a meeting I recently chaired, of

and the all-party group on water and sanitation in the third world,
where a high-level panel of experts raised similar concerns about the
patterns that emerge when we look at the millions of people around the
world who still do not have access to water, sanitation and hygiene.
Those left out of the tremendous progress that has been made are
predominantly women and girls in low-income households, and disabled
people, and it was pointed out that they  
<?notus-xml column=343?>are often the same individuals who have missed out on the progress made
towards other millennium development goals. They are the same women,
girls and disabled people who are missing out on access to education,
and the same people who are missing out on access to basic health care.
Given that 70% of the world’s poorest people now live in
middle-income countries, it is more important than ever that
development assistance addresses structural inequalities and recognises
human rights at the heart of the
agenda.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000067">In

Secretary of State for International Development on the importance of
addressing persistent gender inequalities, because that is absolutely
key to eradicating poverty. I have been heartened by her recognition
that gender-disaggregated impact assessment is crucial to ensuring that
the benefits of development are shared by women and men, and that is
something practical that her Department can do to strengthen its work.
Today, however, I want to go a bit further and emphasise the importance
of universal access to basic health care, water and sanitation as a
precondition for the kind of economic development that the Government
want to promote—as other Members have mentioned—and that
people in developing countries want to see. If poor women and the
poorest people in rural—or urban—areas do not get access
to clean water, sanitation and hygiene, do not get access to basic
health care and do not get a decent education, they will not get the
jobs we are talking about and their poverty will become more
entrenched, even as their countries enjoy unprecedented economic
growth. That is not a recipe for political stability or effective
governance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000068">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:13:18"></hs_TimeCode>
other set of challenges many countries face is in establishing a stable
political environment in which the state can function, investors can
have confidence and people can build sustainable livelihoods. My last
plea, therefore, is for accountability, and for support for elected
Governments in developing countries to build the institutions and the
infrastructure they need to function effectively. It is also necessary
to strengthen the ability of citizens to hold their Governments and the
international corporations that operate in their countries to account
for the impact they have on their
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000069">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:14:02"></hs_TimeCode>
leading the debate, the hon. Member for York Central talked about the
last G8 meeting in the UK and the Make Poverty History campaign in
2005. I have no doubt whatever that the political will that was created
at the time of that meeting was very much driven by civil society
action around the world, and here also. It was that action that created
the pressure on Governments, and the space for them to do the right
thing and pursue a development agenda. I was one of the 250,000 people
walking down the streets of Edinburgh that day, and it was a great
lesson in how peaceful civil society action can transform the world. If
that is good enough for us, it is good enough for developing countries,
and perhaps it is even more necessary in developing countries where
governance has historically been less embedded or robust, or is more
nascent, than in others. I therefore urge Ministers to put their weight
behind that issue in the talks that are coming up in the next few weeks
and
months.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_21_PT_1/AEADA596020C5E2EF77DBC3F53C58C055559E054" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="21 March 2013">Thursday

is a real pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Walker. We are
talking today about the post-2015 millennium development goals. The
MDGs were successful because they were simple and measurable and
countries were able to take responsibility for them. They were things
that people could understand, and there were not that many of them, and
it is crucial, as the International Development Committee’s
report states, that that should remain the case post-2015. We should
not end up with 15 or 20 MDGs; we suggest a maximum of 10, but that is
obviously open to negotiation. Nevertheless, however many we have, they
should again be simple, clear and measurable, and be ones that people
can buy into and take responsibility for. We should remember that it is
because they are simple and measurable that they have been so
successful. Let us not forget that 10,000 fewer under-fives die each
day than in 1990, 33 million more children go to school than 10 years
ago, and 12 times as many people have access to HIV/AIDS treatment as

send maize down from Tanzania as aid, to support people who were
running short of food. Now the country is food-secure, and that is down
to its Government’s development policy and the support of the

the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) covered the subject of jobs so
well that I will cut down my prepared remarks and avoid duplicating
hers. Jobs, whether in employment or self-employment, are absolutely
key to getting out of poverty and they link our economy with those of
developing countries: if those countries create jobs, we will, because
if they create jobs, people will be in work and will spend money,
creating markets for our

Member for York Central: agriculture. We have tended to view
agriculture as somehow being different, or rural development as being
something apart, with agriculture fitting into rural development.
Agriculture is business. Those involved in small-scale agriculture are
business women and men and should be viewed as such. SMEs is the
“buzz word” for small-scale farmers, entrepreneurs who do
fantastic things on almost no budget. We must help them or their
Governments to assist with the creation of markets, improvements in
productivity—irrigation, new seeds and fertilizer have already
been mentioned—and
processing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:24:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000083">Let
us not forget that the Netherlands, one of the most successful
economies in the world, was built on agriculture. Over the years, it
went from being a producer to being a producer and processor, and then
to being a producer, processor and trader and became the world hub for
flowers, which it used to grow but now mainly trades. A substantial
part of the Dutch economy is based on agriculture, yet it is not viewed
as backward. Indeed, one of its financial institutions, the Rabobank, a
co-operative agriculture bank, is one of the few banks to retain top
status with all credit rating agencies. Many institutions in our
country grew out of the agricultural sector and, unless I am mistaken,
the United Kingdom’s biggest single manufacturing sector remains
food and drink processing, based on the raw materials produced by our
farmers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:25:47"></hs_TimeCode>. We
should not move away from agriculture, but build on it as development

hon. Friend the Member for Congleton mentioned finance. DFID has
rightly begun to focus on different ways of achieving financial
innovation in the developing world. The financial deepening challenge
fund, with which I was involved some years ago, looked at different
means of offering finance, whether through micro-finance or investment
in small and medium-sized businesses. Sometimes, the problem is what we
in the UK refer to as the “financing gap”. Funds are
often available for micro-businesses and for large businesses, but the
problem is in the middle, where the costs of finance are
substantial—professionals need to be involved—and the
cost per transaction is too high to make the transaction viable.
Existing micro-businesses cannot grow into small businesses and then
into medium businesses, because they come up against that brick wall.
They can get the first $5,000 or $10,000, but the problem arises when
they encounter the big gap and need $50,000 or $100,000 to employ
substantial numbers of people. They are told to go to the banks, which
require security that they do not have, and the venture capital or
investment funds say, “$100,000 is too little for
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:27:39"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000085">We
are trying to crack the problem, but we have not done so yet. I believe
that solutions are available—for example, leasing, because often
a business needs equipment to create jobs, for which, although it can
provide the working capital, it requires capital investment. I
encourage DFID to consider that

us not forget that when we are discussing jobs, we are talking mainly
about young people. There are 3.5 billion people under 30 in
the world, 1.7 billion of whom  are aged between 15 and 24, and
they must be at the forefront of our mind. They can go
through their  
<?notus-xml column=347?>education and find that there is nothing at the end, which is very
dangerous. I urge that young people are placed at the forefront of

International, an international development organisation associated

organisations around the world are highly focused on the risk of
leaving young people out of discussions, which are all conducted at a
high level. It is great that the Prime Minister chairs a UN high-level
panel on young people, but we must ensure that that results in action,

health is clearly both a cause and an effect of poverty, so it is
crucial that we tackle it. Malaria can cost households 25% of their
income, not necessarily through mortality, but through morbidity, the
inability to work or lower productivity. The millennium development
goals have led to substantial improvements in the treatment of diseases
such as TB, malaria and HIV/AIDS. There have been improvements, too, in
child and maternal mortality, both of which are very much affected by
all those diseases. Malaria deaths have gone down by a third since
2000, but there are still far too many and the Prime Minister is
focused on the UK helping to cut that rate still further. We must not
forget that these are strong diseases, and they have a habit of
returning. In the 1960s malaria was almost eliminated from Zanzibar,
but people took their foot off the pedal and it came back with a
vengeance. Work had to start all over again, which is why the MDGs,
post-2015, must not lose their focus on those diseases, which can come
back to strike us very quickly.</hs_Para>

necessarily killers, although they can be, but they are disablers. They
strike the poorest and deprive them of their ability to earn a
livelihood. There are simple ways of tackling them; the drugs exist. It
is the distribution of those drugs that is the problem. We have seen
fantastic co-operation between pharmaceutical companies, which have
given many drugs for free, and Governments, as they tackle not just one
disease but three or four at a time.</hs_Para>

momentum to tackle poverty has made a big difference. In 2000, official
development assistance was $72 billion. Between then and 2009, it rose
to $128 billion. Although such rises cannot be put down to
the MDGs alone, they have helped to focus our efforts. The figures have
dropped in the last two years as a result of the global recession, so
it is particularly welcome that our Government are showing the way and
that the UK Parliament has backed them to send a signal to other
developed countries that such assistance is important to global health,
well-being and security.</hs_Para>

there will still be almost 1 billion people living on less than $1.25 a
day. Moreover, the maternal mortality ratio has declined by less than
1% since 2000, so while the MDGs have made a difference, there is still
a lot to be done.
What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:35:59"></hs_TimeCode> should we
be asking from the Prime Minister in his role on the high-level panel,
and what should the focus be? One of the interesting issues is around
inequalities, because while the millennium development goals focused
rather a lot on averages, those averages can mask inequalities. An
average reduction can mask a lack of progress among the very poorest

Members have discussed the key matter of local participation and
empowerment. Development must involve working in partnership with
countries, rather than being something that is done to countries. The
all-party group on global health produced an interesting report about
empowering health workers. It is important that, as well as passing on
useful lessons to other countries, we learn lessons for our own
national health service. In Malawi, for example, we see a desire, with
strong political leadership, to increase the number of midwives and
reduce maternal mortality. Wherever we are in the world, we can all
learn from that driving political force. Many countries produce
policies out of necessity. Lower level health workers are therefore
empowered, trained and supported to provide early interventions that
can save lives, whereas we tend to follow a more hierarchical model,
notwithstanding some of changes that have been made in recent years to
empower our nurses. We must learn from each other and not be seen to be
doing things to other
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:38:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000100">Agriculture
is important—I will touch on that in a bit more detail in a
moment—and integrating climate change policies into the
development goals is critical. In Nigeria, for instance, the Government
are parcelling up areas for private companies to deliver to the grid,
which will provide a welcome boost to the power sector, but if that is
not done in a green way, we will be shooting ourselves in the foot as
we try to maintain our commitment to international climate change
obligations. The Prime Minister must consider such matters as he leads

of development agencies and others with an interest in this area. The
event was standing room only in one of the larger Committee Rooms in
the main House, and we heard a long list of suggestions for new MDGs.
The Prime Minister’s challenge is to ensure that the list of new

to hide behind what they are doing rather than what they ought to be
doing. That will be the political challenge, but it is not an easy one

fear that health issues are unlikely to be as prominent in the headline
priorities of the new MDGs as was the case with the original MDGs, when
of course they constituted three of the eight goals—on child

people continue to make the case that global health issues should not

need a joined-up approach to improve health. The many single
disease-specific goals in the MDGs were successful at focusing global
attention on critical areas that might otherwise have been neglected,
such as malaria. However, they also were in danger of creating silos of
activity that were a barrier to building strong overall health systems,
so the post-2015 agenda should correct that by emphasising the need for
joined-up, holistic health services, in addition to placing a stress on
the importance of programmes to prevent people from becoming ill in the
first
place.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:41:54"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

course, those aims are also important for reducing poverty, because
those in poor health will be poorer. For instance, if we look at just
the impact of polio alone, a disabled child in Africa is a burden on
their family as they will be unable to work and support themselves, and
that of course affects their life expectancy considerably.</hs_Para>

must be central to development. Good health is critical to achieving
the other development goals, so it must not be neglected. Healthy

believe that we will end up with one stand-alone post-2015 goal for

involve universal access to health care. It came out strongly from the
meeting of the all-party group on global health that was held before
Christmas that that goal would suffer from focusing on a process rather
than an outcome, and would be in danger of diverting attention towards
addressing the financial barriers that stop people from receiving
health services, rather than the quality of those services. In
addition, it could ignore the wider determinants of health in
society.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000110"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:43:10"></hs_TimeCode>Arguably<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
a better goal would be on improving the life expectancy of the bottom

those in greatest 
<?notus-xml column=351?>need and ensure that we did not water down the aims on which there is a
fairly strong consensus—certainly in this
House and among a lot of the groups that came to the all-party
group’s meeting and submitted their thoughts. That goal would
have the advantage of focusing on outcomes, addressing the critical
issue of health inequalities, and being equally relevant—this is
a very important point for the post-2015 agenda—for high, middle
and low-income countries. It could be applied across the board, and it
is important that we look at the post-2015 MDGs in that
context.</hs_Para>

are the greatest priority for improvement. We can consider the Malawi
situation in that context, and there are interesting challenges in
different parts of Nigeria, which is, of course, a federal country in
which there are big differences between states. For instance, the
transmission of HIV and AIDS is affected by the multiple marriages in
parts of the country. Sadly, other parts of the country are still
affected by polio. I visited Niger state about a year ago and met the
governor, who has determined that every child in the state will receive
a polio vaccination. However, not every governor in the country takes
the same approach. Indeed, such a policy is a challenge for governors
in many states, including Niger state, because of their rural
districts.</hs_Para>

visit the Minna teacher training college in Nigeria. In parts of
Nigeria—not all parts, because it is such a diverse
country—not enough girls are going to school. In recognition of
that fact, with support from Save the Children and other NGOs, girls
are being educated to become teachers, because in some rural areas,
girls were not going to school because there were not enough female
teachers. I met a number of young women at the college, many of them
mothers themselves, and in many cases with their babies, who were
training as teachers. They were in a separate compound from the rest of
the college with barbed wire to protect them so that their fathers,
brothers and husbands could be sure that they were safe and in an
acceptable environment for a young Muslim woman. Having gained that
education themselves, the idea was that they would go back to their
villages and then more girls would go to school there.</hs_Para>

then had the privilege of visiting a village school. Parents had formed

parent teacher 
<?notus-xml column=352?>association in Hackney, because the parents in Nigeria were equally
focused on and proud of their three-year-old who could count, or
equally determined that their under-five would receive some support or

to? One of the really interesting issues in Nigeria, as in other parts
of Africa, is agribusiness. I am delighted that our Prime Minister and
President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria have signed a bilateral
agreement to double trade from its level a couple of years ago by 2015.
That is a very big challenge, but it is also a important issue, partly
for this country—we need to create jobs and opportunities for
our own businesses—and also because there is a very young
population in Nigeria that needs work and opportunity. We already have
interesting bilateral arrangements for skills development. Highbury

convinced—perhaps the Minister will comment on this—that
the British Government have “got it” on the issue. Do we
have the skill base to export as a business, in terms of food
processing, development and so on? In one state in Nigeria, Zimbabwean
farmers were brought in to help to improve the agricultural process and
build it up. There are some excellent resources in Nigeria—land,
people and produce—that could be developed, yet Nigeria is

Mark Williams</B> (Ceredigion) (LD):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Mr Walker. I will not take 12 minutes and will
avoid repetition, because there have been some strong messages from
hon. Members of all parties, often tempered by our own experiences in
Ethiopia, Tanzania, Malawi, and Nigeria, for example. I will mention
Nigeria as well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:51:37"></hs_TimeCode>.
I co-chair the all-party group on global education for all, and part of
that work took me to Nigeria a year ago, focusing on education. We were
delighted to see other projects, including in schools in urban and
rural settings, near Abuja, the capital, and Lagos. I shall talk about
education, although not
exclusively<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:52:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000128">The
second millennium development goal called for all children to be able
to complete a full—I emphasise
“full”—course of primary education. Yes, there is
great cause for celebration in what has been achieved so far, as we
have heard, in the past 13 years. None of us, wherever we come from,
are under any illusion. There is much work to be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:52:36"></hs_TimeCode>. Some 61
million primary schoolchildren remain out of school and 250 million
children are unable to read and write by the time they should be
reaching stage 4 at school. If we are to reach the goal, we require
another 1.7 million teachers, 1 million in Africa alone.
Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:53:03"></hs_TimeCode> 775 million
adults are illiterate, two thirds of those being
women.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000129">Education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:53:08"></hs_TimeCode>
is widely recognised as one of the most effective development
interventions. Equal access to education for all reduces inequality and
poverty and increases empowerment. I was struck by the case for
community empowerment made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:53:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Congleton (Fiona Bruce), in terms of business and enterprise and
getting community engagement in projects.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:53:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

visited a school-based management committee  in Lagos. It was
particularly inspiring to see people  who have not been engaged
in education in any way at all—traders and local people from
various backgrounds— 
<?notus-xml column=354?>coming together on a committee to demand the rights that are enshrined
in Nigerian law at federal level, right the way through to provincial
level, although often ignored by governors. The school I visited lacked
a tin roof and the school-based management committee got together and,
by weight of numbers, forced the governor to invest the money that was
required. That is real empowerment, and also, critically, it is
educating parents about the value of education as well. It is not just
about the
practicalities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:54:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000131">There

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:54:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy) said in terms of health, we have to
reaffirm our commitment to the simple, clear, concise goals. But the
education goal must be at the
forefront<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:55:03"></hs_TimeCode>.
Inequalities in education are a huge barrier. We have heard about the
gender issues. Although education for girls is being addressed, it
still remains a fundamental issue for many
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:55:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000133">We
visited a school in Nigeria with a sound DFID-sponsored scheme,
promoting girls’ clubs in schools. Challenges, such as parents
being unwilling to send their children to school, and issues to do with
sanitation, water supply and hygiene, could be tackled by the girls and
talked about with them, in a spirit of solidarity, and sometimes those
issues were taken to the schools’
management<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:55:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000134">There
is a huge disparity in some countries between rich and poor. Globally,
in the poorest fifth of households, less than two thirds of all
school-aged children enrol in school, compared to 90% of children from
the richest families. In Nigeria, there could not be a starker contrast
between the rich families who have benefited from Nigeria’s
economic prosperity, in some urban areas in particular, and those in
rural
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:56:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_76fChair UID="13032160000006" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000006"><SmallCaps>[</SmallCaps><SmallCaps>Mr

in rural areas who live in informal settlements also face difficulties
in accessing education and if they do so it is of poor quality. We
heard an encouraging story from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:56:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hackney South and Shoreditch about a teacher training college. But
when we were there we heard that the majority of children in Nigerian
primary schools are being taught by teachers with fewer qualifications
than the children aspire to. That was a real worry. I used to be a
primary school teacher in this country and it was a joy to go back to a
classroom and teach in a Nigerian school, I hope with some experience
and knowledge to
impart<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:56:48"></hs_TimeCode>. The
teachers were enthusiastic and they have strong teaching unions behind
them that are enthusiastic on their behalf, to get proper recognition
for the teaching profession. Hearing that some teachers in some states
in Nigeria had not been paid for several weeks, if not months, hardly
inspires people to enter the teaching
profession<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:57:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000136">Disabled
children and those with learning difficulties in many countries that we
are talking about face huge barriers to accessing education. Being
disabled more than doubles a child’s chance of never enrolling
in school, in some countries, and primary school completion and
literacy rates for disabled children are consistently below those of
non-disabled children. Certainly, in the 
<?notus-xml column=355?>schools we visited there was no evidence of differentiation in what was
taught, to use teacher speak—what teachers are
delivering—or what was learnt and little recognition of the
facilities required for children with special educational
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000137">What
should those goals be and how should we reaffirm them, post 2015? Of
course, all countries need urgently to try to achieve MDG 2 by
2015—all children having access to primary education, a basic
necessity. The UK plays a key role as a world leader and provides aid
for education. Like everybody, whatever our backgrounds, we hon.
Members welcome what was said yesterday. We wish the Prime Minister
well in the leadership role that he will be pursuing on our
behalf<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:58:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000138">Some
would argue that MDG 2’s scope had too narrow a focus, compared
with the education for all girls scheme, agreed in Dakar in 2000. This
has led us to focus on access rather than completion; on getting
children into primary schools, in particular, rather than keeping them
there. We have heard about the transition to secondary school and then
on to tertiary
education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:59:05"></hs_TimeCode>. That
needs to be dealt with. The primary education that we are striving to
get for each child needs to be completed and needs to be worth
completing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:59:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000139">We
need to focus on quality as well as quantity and look at provision of
teacher training across the board. We must also concentrate on teaching
materials. We need more teachers to deliver a better quality of
education.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> It
would be fair to characterise most Nigerian education as “chalk
and talk,” with someone standing in front of a blackboard and
addressing the class. We got rid of that in this country in the 1960s,
but whether that was a good thing or a bad thing is for another debate.
I am a former teacher, and I would like to think that I was
progressive. Chalk and talk does not always get the best results from
children, and it needs to be
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:59:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000140">As
every previous speaker has said, we need to aim for a more
interconnected set of goals. We need to recognise that nutrition and
hunger affect education. Children must be nourished to concentrate on
learning. When I was a teacher, this country debated whether children
should have plastic bottles of water on their desk to avoid being
dehydrated so that they could concentrate better and gain more from
lessons. At the school I visited near Abuja, the bore hole had long
since dried up, so there were 600 children with no water supply
whatever<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:00:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000141">We
must ensure that both boys and girls are able to access education, and
significant progress has been made on that through MDG 3. Skills and
employment have already been mentioned, but fundamentally we need to
consider equality so that wealth, location and disability are not an
impediment to accessing
education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:00:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000142">Measurement
of those goals is important. Groups such as Results UK, ADD
International and others have called on DFID to ensure either that
separate indicators are included in future development goals or that
standalone goals are established for things such as disability. The
Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend
the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone) met
representatives at an early stage to discuss those matters, which is
important.</hs_Para>

using polite muscle and friendly dialogue with other countries. From my

start by reflecting on some of the positive stuff that has happened,
partly through the millennium development goals. According to the World
Bank, the poverty target will be met, with the population share of
extremely poor people in developing countries falling from 29% in the
baseline year 1990 to 12% in 2015. The target of halving the proportion
of people without access to improved water sources has been met, and

by more than 30% over the same period. Secondary school enrolment grew

hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy) rightly pointed out
that the simplicity and focus of the millennium development goals has
been instrumental in helping to forge a shared vision and in mobilising
the world around those goals. Obviously, in formulating  the
next set of objectives, the world collectively needs  to learn
from that, but I am afraid it will be quite a challenge when we
consider all the different bids that people have made for things that

all such discussions the different levels of aspiration are often

the current millennium development goals, and in most of the material I
have seen from NGOs and others—I am not an expert on this,
unlike so many of the Select Committee members who are
here—those different levels of aspiration get grouped together.
People need ideas for where they are going at each level, but in a
sense, it is mentally useful to separate the levels and know where the
real focal point is. I suggest that the real focal point should be at
the middle level—in other words, the essentials of building a
good, effective society and economy. When the Prime Minister talks
about the golden thread of development, I think he is talking about the
middle level. We need to do that in parallel with programmes that are
focused on the essentials of life, which are health, education and
nutrition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:07:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000156">We
are talking about human life, and it is difficult to talk in such

danger is that, most of the time, debates such as this are between
people who agree on the most important aspects of the subject. I am
sure that everyone in Westminster Hall today agrees that although
charity might begin at home, it certainly does not end there. We have a
shared humanity and a moral obligation to the poorest people in the
world. However bad things might ever be in Britain, they will not be as
bad as they are in Bangladesh or Burundi. The second thing that
everyone participating in this debate probably believes is
that  
<?notus-xml column=358?>official development assistance plays a key part in addressing the
entrenched problems of poor parts of the world, but it is clearly not

the question of why do it at all, to some extent the agenda is just
something that we feel, rather than something we can argue, debate or
explain. However, we need to spend more time explaining to the public
some of the successes in development. In the public street and the pub,
the conversation is often about the hopelessness of Africa and the idea
that however much money we throw at the problems, things will not
materially improve. However, that is clearly not true, given some of
the statistics that I and other Members have given.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:09:58"></hs_TimeCode>I would also
argue—this is perhaps slightly more controversial—that we
can tie our explanation a little more to the national interests of this

second thing someone might say is, “Okay, you’ve
persuaded me that we should spend money on helping the poorest people
in the world. That’s fine, but go and do that with your own
money. Why do it out of general taxation?” Answering that
question is a harder sell, not least because the British public are
extraordinarily generous off their own bat. We have to explain that
official development assistance can do things that private charity
cannot, particularly by leveraging what other countries do. From the
point of view of the recipient nations, there is also the
predictability and long-term nature of such development and
aid.</hs_Para>

most fundamental issue, however, is the free rider problem, which we do
not talk about enough. If the 0.7% target was working perfectly and
everyone was meeting it, it would be precisely the vehicle to help us
get around the free rider problem. The free rider problem is this: if
I, as a country, spend a load of money helping poor countries to
develop their economies and societies, that will benefit the world to
some extent, but I will never notice the benefit that I get as a
nation; but if everybody does the same, I will get a big benefit. As
long as everyone else is pulling their weight, therefore, it is
perfectly rational to spend quite a lot of money on overseas
development; but if I am going to be the only one spending a lot and
nobody else is going to, it is not. That is why I said that if the 0.7%
target works well, it is in everybody’s interests. However, we
need to demonstrate to the public that even though most countries have
not, sadly, reached that target, they are making progress towards it.
While it is right for us to be proud of our leadership position and of
reaching that target first, some of our constituents would, in many
ways, rather prefer that we were joint first and that there was more

to all this is the need to emphasise the ways in which foreign aid is

the United Kingdom, but all wealthy nations, although this happens to

support for what the Government do on overseas development, at least a
subset of the goals focused on after 2015 should talk about the
world’s shared interests. Of course it is right that the
headline focus must be on the poorest people and the poorest nations,

are four groups of key development deliverables—things that

direct benefit to the rest of the world. The first area is the most

things happen in a properly inclusive way, they will benefit the

UK exports came from countries classed as low and middle-income,
excluding countries such as India, large parts of whose population are
very poor. Government projections show that, over the next 10 years,
today’s major aid recipients will contribute about £3
trillion to the global economy, accounting for 11% of global growth. If
we look at a bar chart showing where global growth comes from today
compared with in the 1990s, we see that the pattern has changed
substantially, from being focused on richer countries in the 1990s to
being focused on middle and lower-income countries today. Eventually,
of course, low-income countries become middle-income countries and then

second area is population. We talk a lot these days about food
security, about oil and energy more generally and about the resulting
strains. While a growing world population is only one of the pressures
on food—people who move into the middle classes and who have
higher incomes tend to demand different sorts of food—the sheer

population is at a sustainable level.</hs_Para>

that the more 
<?notus-xml column=360?>likely a mum is to see her children grow into adulthood, the less likely
she is to have more children. Another clear, although even more
indirect, relationship relates to the fact that, as nations get richer,
mothers tend towards having two children in the very long term, and it

Horwood:</Member></B> The Minister confirms that it is the 2013
calendar year, which is very reassuring. Our original commitment in the
coalition agreement was that we would introduce legislation in the
first term of this Parliament. Although it is far more important to hit
the target than to legislate for it, we should manage in what will now
have to be the last two Sessions of this Parliament to put our
commitment into legislation. It is a very proud thing to have hit the
target. People have challenged me about why the figure is 0.7%, and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:19:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for East Hampshire made similar points in his speech. It is to some
extent an arbitrary figure—there is no denying that; but I think
it was chosen because it was an achievable, and therefore realistic,
goal for countries to 
<?notus-xml column=361?>share, but was also ambitious. It pushed the quantum of overseas
development assistance beyond what was being achieved 30 or 40 years
ago, when the target was set. Most
importantly—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:20:28"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for East Hampshire made this point too—it was a
benchmark. It was something that enabled countries at whatever level to
measure and compare each others’ performance.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:20:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

final meeting of the high-level panel, in Bali, is imminent and the
Secretary of State for International Development will stand in for the
Prime Minister. It is perhaps a little disappointing that the Prime
Minister will not have made it to all the meetings, but the Secretary
of State will do a fine job; she has been a strong supporter of the
high-level panel process. The UN General Assembly’s open working
group met recently for the first time, and I gather that a high-level
event is planned for September. Apparently everything is still in train
for a decision in 2015, which we all expect. In the meantime one more
initiative requires comment, and although it is not the most
significant it is a rather good one: the Secretary of State last month
launched a competition in which UK schoolchildren are invited to submit
ideas to the Prime Minister; 150 schools have already signed up. I am a
little disappointed that I discovered that only while researching for
the debate, so perhaps we need to publicise it more widely; but part of
the way in which we shall garner support for the 0.7% figure and the

original millennium development goals, as many hon. Members have said,
have widely been regarded as successful and effective. That is not
because every one has been achieved; rather it is because quite a lot
of the targets within the MDGs have been achieved by some countries.
Also they have helped to highlight some of the failings in
development—particularly the way in which conflict has resulted
in many fragile states achieving none of the goals. The MDGs have
contributed to the amount of direct aid towards social spending, and to
the significant rise in spending at national level by developing
Governments. That, among other things, has meant that each day 10,000
fewer children under five die than in 1990; 33 million more children go
to school than a decade ago; and more than 12 times more people are now

Perhaps I may gently rebuke
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:23:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Beckenham (Bob Stewart), who is no longer in his place: I do not
think that DFID, the United Nations or international
agencies—including voluntary ones—that support
development have ever really said that aid was all that people should
rely on to make progress with development. That has always been about
trade, tackling issues such as debt reduction, and encouraging private
sector investment and activity and economic growth. A strength of the
MDGs was the fact that they related to a wide range  of
topics<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:24:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

of State recently got a little bit of stick from Labour party Members
for referring to the importance of the private sector in development. I
thought that was unfair, because she was not saying that overseas
development assistance should be diverted to the private sector; she
was simply underlining the importance of the sector. I come from a
development agency background, where that has always been understood.
The impact of aid is dwarfed by the impact, for good or ill, of the
private sector and business decisions. For instance, mining
companies’ ability to go into an area and act insensitively, or
to wreck the environment and impoverish future generations by not
behaving properly, is of massive significance. A good company that does
the right thing—British extractive industries have a good record
on that generally, although occasionally some companies, such as
Vedanta Resources, have been picked up not doing the right
thing—helps empowerment and wealth creation. That can be a very
positive thing.</hs_Para>

Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham) referred earlier to Green Fuels,
and the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:25:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for York Central (Hugh Bayley) raised the question whether
biofuels were always a good, sustainable thing to invest in. He was
right: if business does the wrong thing in relation to biofuels, that
can increase demand for land, leading to more incursions on rain
forest, and can damage the environment. Green Fuels is a
Gloucestershire company and I know it well; it uses surplus waste
cooking oil. That is what it is encouraging in Indonesia. It takes
surplus cooking oil from hotels, which would otherwise be poured into
watercourses, polluting them, or go to waste; or, possibly worse still,
be sold to street vendors to be put into their cooking oil and used for
street food. If cooking oil is overused it can be carcinogenic, so

wider context includes organisations such as the International Finance
Corporation, which has made an enormous contribution to development,
leveraging and investing billions in developing countries and paying
attention particularly to what it rather euphemistically calls frontier

exciting and not just dangerous. The idea is to take investment and
leverage business in places where at other times investors might fear,
slightly, to tread. If there is a plea to be made to the high-level
panel about the post-2015 millennium development goals agenda, I would
ask that that agenda be inclusive, and spread beyond aid to include the
private sector and international agencies such as the
IFC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:27:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000180">Some
weaknesses in the MDGs have been highlighted. Those include the way in
which they hid inequality; the fact that they perhaps neglected issues
such as joblessness, which is an acute contributor to poverty; and the
fact that they may have missed the very poorest people in some
countries. By using averages and country totals they perhaps did not
spot some pockets of extreme poverty. That is among the things being
discussed at the high-level panel. It has also been suggested that the
goals did not, in addressing environmental sustainability, give it the
centrality that they could have. When we debated that in October I made
a plea for the importance, among all the various issues such as health,
education, social justice and disability that might be included in 
<?notus-xml column=363?>any future set of sustainable development goals, of the central idea
that growth and development should come within planetary boundaries. I

also talked in October about whether the next set of goals should be
global and include all countries, not just the poorest, so that some
developing countries might have the toughest targets for jobs,
agriculture and gender equality, whereas for countries such as ours
there would be quite a lesson, and a set of targets to be met, on
resource waste and unsustainable consumption. We talked about the
ambitiousness of the goals and the idea that, as with the UN framework
convention on climate change, they should impose common but
differentiated responsibilities, and be sensitive to different
countries’ circumstances. DFID’s latest report on the
high-level panel’s progress says that it is considering a single
post-2015 development agenda, which I assume means bringing together
the continuing progress on the MDGs with the new sustainable
development goals. If so, that is welcome. It is focused on poverty
reduction and inclusive growth, “embedded” in the
“principles of sustainable development”—I have
never seen anything embedded in a principle before, but there is always
a first time. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:35:04"></hs_TimeCode>

also reports a clear focus on eradicating extreme poverty, with a
strong human development emphasis, which is obviously welcome. The new
framework should also include income, poverty, health, education and
equality for girls and women—all welcome as well—although
I am again a little concerned that resources and the environment are
not included in the list. I hope that the Minister will be able to
reassure me that sustainability in environmental terms will remain
central to the
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:30:32"></hs_TimeCode>. DFID
further reports that the high-level panel has talked about the building
blocks being tackled, including strong institutions and the rule of

process, however, should not be simplistically about economic growth,
so I will draw attention to three areas that I want the Minister to
take on board and comment on, all of which were highlighted by an
excellent organisation, Development Initiatives, which is one of the
best sources of data and information about development that I have come
across. First, responsibility: who is responsible for delivering the
goals? That might seem rather obvious, but it has never been spelt out,
and the debate about whether the private sector should play a role is
relevant here. As I said, the private sector’s role in
delivering development is crucial, and international actors such as the
IFC and the World Bank should have specific responsibilities in the
process, as should national Governments, not only the ones meeting the
0.7% target but the ones that are not yet meeting it; they should be
given a responsibility to step up to the plate. People involved in
remittances, who are acting privately, as individuals, also play a
part, because “private” refers not only to big companies
and investors but to private individuals. Some of them are very rich
private individuals, the Warren Buffetts and Bill Gateses of this
world, who are making a valuable contribution, but Development
Initiatives spelt out to me that if we look at the overall
resource flows into developing countries,
overseas development assistance is only a small part of
those flows. ODA is 
<?notus-xml column=364?>dwarfed by remittances and by foreign direct investment, as well as by
debt, which the hon. Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) termed better
as “finance”. A great deal of the resource going into
developing countries is way beyond and above
ODA<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:32:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000184">My
second point, therefore, is that it would be good  if resource
flows were brought into the framework. We should measure and look at
resource flows into developing countries and perhaps consider setting
specific development goal targets to do with reducing barriers to
things such as foreign direct investment, or limiting or tackling
outflows of illicit finance, which is a serious problem for some of the
developing countries in the greatest
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:33:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000185">My
third point is about reporting and measurement, which should be open,
transparent and as complete as possible. The way in which data are
being used in our information age is enormously advanced. I can look at
an app on my iPhone and tell Members that 7% of our energy in this
country comes from wind power—as of now, because I have a live
app that tells me the exact amount of energy coming from that source. I
could look at other sources and know that 2% is coming from the Dutch
interconnector and so on. If I can have such information at my
fingertips, we ought to be able to look at the development goals and
see exactly the flows of resource into a particular developing
country—how much from the private sector, how much from
ODA—and any mismatches between the levels of poverty and of
resource going in. Such imaginative but open and transparent
information is important, and organisations such as Oxfam make the
point that it increases the power of people on the ground to know how
much money should be coming into their country and where it should be
spent and to hold individuals accountable for the
spending<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:34:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000186">In
summary, the new sustainable development goals should be global,
including all countries. Sustainability is absolutely key, because
climate change will ultimately impoverish us all, even in developing
countries. The goals should be transparent, and measurement should be
as complete and timely as possible. They should include some attention
to overall resource flows, and not focus only on development
assistance. Above all, who is responsible for delivering the goals
should be clear, and we should welcome the private sector into the
process while emphasising the specific responsibilities of
international agencies, Governments and others, whom we can hold
accountable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:35:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_21_PT_1/34A4A66BC7464A0416BF7A9A3DD4A37F711E9D03" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="21 March 2013">Thursday

existing millennium development goals focus primarily but not
exclusively on health, education and related matters, and rightly so.
The goals have not all been met, but we are undoubtedly much nearer to
meeting them than we were when they were established, 
<?notus-xml column=365?>and very much because they were established. We should not abandon the
objectives, which will remain important to ensuring our
further progress on those fronts; we should,
however, now be looking beyond 2015 to set goals that will help
countries to achieve self-sustaining growth, so that they will in the
long run be able to finance their own health and education endeavours

co-chair of the all-party group on trade out of poverty, I argue for
the replacement goals therefore to centre their focus on creation of
the opportunities for developing countries, the least developed and
poorest in particular, to trade out of poverty. That should be a
central focus of the goals, which should apply as much to the developed
world, to create those opportunities, as to the developing world, to
seize the opportunities as they become
available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:37:38"></hs_TimeCode>. Aid
and debt relief can and have helped to relieve poverty, but only trade
can enable countries to leave poverty behind. Virtually all the
development success stories, from Korea and China to Mauritius and
Vietnam, have involved countries trading out of poverty, orientating
their economies towards trade with their neighbours and countries
overseas. By contrast, most of the remaining, poorest countries are the
least orientated towards trade. The poorest countries contain a fifth
of the world’s poor people and of its population, but they only
account for one 50th of world trade, so they are hugely
under-represented in
trade.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000190">By
taking advantage of extremely low labour costs,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:39:30"></hs_TimeCode> early
starters such as the Chinas or Korea, which decided to develop through
trade, were able to break into the markets of developed countries such
as those in Europe and America. The late starters, the countries that
have not yet taken off, are finding it harder to do so because although
they have extremely low labour costs, they are competing not only with
the high labour costs of the indigenous population in Europe and
America but with the still quite low labour costs of the Chinas and so
on, which are now able to deploy a considerable agglomeration of
industrial wealth and capacity as well. It is all the more important,
therefore, to give priority access to our markets to those from the
least developed and poorest countries. The good news is that countries
that some people had rather patronisingly written off as being
incapable of starting the process of self-sustaining development are
doing so. Six of the world’s fastest-growing economies in the
past decade are in
Africa.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000191">When
I started my career or, as my mother still says, when I had a proper
job, it was as a development economist working on aid and development
programmes in Asia and Africa. I used to get angry with people who
assumed that those countries were incapable of development. Everything
I saw taught me that people in the poorest countries have the same
number of grey cells as those in the richest countries, the same desire
to improve the lot of themselves and their families, and the same
capacity for enterprise and so on. They started from a different point,
but I was sure that, given the opportunity, they would be able to
develop. It has taken a long time, but perhaps that is because they did
not always have the opportunities they should have had. It is important
that we give them those
opportunities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000192">How
do we do that, and what should be the components of the targets that
the world should set itself post-2015? First, we should aim to have
duty-free, quota-free access for goods from not just the least
developed countries, 
<?notus-xml column=366?>but all the low-income countries of the world, to the markets of
certainly all OECD countries if not more widely. That should be
unconditional. We should not insist that they reciprocate, open their
markets and remove all their obstacles and tariffs on our goods. It is
for them to make the decision. If they think it appropriate to pursue
the free trading route, let them do so; if they want tariffs and
protection for infant industries, let them try that. The least bad
argument for protection is the infant industry protection rule and we
should not deprive them of that opportunity if they want it, but we
should open our markets to
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000193">Most
tariffs have come down during my lifetime, but the highest remaining in
international trade are those on the sort of goods that the least
developed countries are most likely to produce, such as
labour-intensive and agricultural products. For example, the average
European Union tariff on agricultural products is 14%. On textiles and
apparel, it is more than 5%, and those are typically products that
countries produce in the first stage of development. On other
manufactured goods, the European Union tariff averages less than 2%.
Tariffs in Japan are even worse. They are nearly 30% on agricultural
products, 9% on textiles and apparel, but less than 0.5% on other
manufactured goods. Bizarrely, the tariffs we retain are most
discriminating against the sort of products that are most likely to be
produced by countries to which we should be giving opportunities to
trade out of
poverty.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000194">America
has some very good policies, but they are narrowly focused on Africa.
It levies seven times as much tariff on imports from Bangladesh and
Cambodia as it gives to them in aid. It even levies more tariffs on
imports from Cambodia and Bangladesh than those from France and the
United Kingdom despite the fact that we export six times as much to the
United States as those countries. The tariff structure in the world is
absurd and it should be the objective of future world development
policy to right that
wrong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000195">Whenever
I mention such facts in Brussels, EU officials preen themselves and say
that we offer tariff-free, quota-free access to Cambodia, Bangladesh
and the least developed countries through the Everything but Arms
agreement. Fine; good; but we established that agreement at the same
time as America established its African Growth and Opportunity Act,
since when our imports of apparel and garments have declined slightly
and they have increased dramatically in America. America’s
imports from those countries were slightly higher than ours, but are
now twice as high. Why? Because of the second thing we should focus on:
the rules of origin. It is not a sexy subject, but extremely important.
Countries that may have no tariffs on imports from least developed
countries, none the less have rules of origin saying that goods will be
defined as imports only if they have a certain amount of value added.
If they are buying textiles from China and converting them into apparel
it will not be allowed in tariff-free unless there is some value
added.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000196">The
Commission for Africa calculated that the very process of complying
with those rules of origin, even if they can be complied with, is
roughly equivalent to the cost of a 10% tariff. We have created a
system that is still hindering the growth of imports from developing
countries. As world trade becomes increasingly complex value chains, it
is all the more important to liberalise and make more generous the
rules of origin that we apply to imports from developing
countries.</hs_Para>

that we must look at closely is export subsidies.
To the extent that Europe and other developed countries subsidise their
export of agricultural surpluses, they damage developing
countries’ potential to trade in agriculture, which in their
initial phases they can most readily do. It is scandalous that America
spends about $2.5 billion a year subsidising cotton produced by about
25,000 people in the States when it could be more economically imported
from countries in west Africa where millions of people directly or
indirectly depend on the cotton trade. I hope to go to America one day
to persuade them to spend that $2.5 billion on paying off the farmers
with lifetime annuities, so that they can move to more productive
activities for their own economy while giving opportunities to those in
Africa.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000198">An
outline agreement was pencilled in during the Doha round, which even
the EU had signed up to, to abolish all export subsidies by the then
distant target date of 2013. Unfortunately, as the Doha round got more
and more mired in the mud, that was withdrawn, but clearly there would
be a genuine possibility of reaching agreement if we had the collective
world will and the political will to head in that direction, even
without reviving the whole Doha
round.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000199">The
worst barriers facing many developing countries are not imposed by the
developed world, onerous and unjustifiable as they are, but by their
equally impoverished neighbours. South-south trade barriers are often
much higher than north-south barriers. In Africa, exports of
agricultural products to neighbours bear a tariff of about 34%, and the
tariff is 21% on other products. The reason is easy to understand.
Import duty is one of the easiest taxes for a developing
country to impose. The oldest tax authority in this country is Customs
and Excise, and we used to rely heavily on it. Such duty obviously
inhibits the growth of trade, and we should help countries as much as
possible to wean themselves off over-reliance on high tariffs by
developing domestic and internal revenue sources.</hs_Para>

obstacles to trade develop between neighbouring countries on the back
of high tariffs, such as rent-seeking, corruption, delays at borders
and so on. The result has been that whereas 75% of exports from
European countries typically go to neighbouring European countries,
only 10% or less of exports from African countries go to neighbouring
African countries. If we can help southern countries remove the
barriers between each other, the scope for growth of trade is enormous.
Already south-south trade is growing rapidly, but so far 80% of
south-south trade is internal to Asia, 10% to Latin America and only 6%
to Africa. The scope for improvement and growth there is
enormous.</hs_Para>

area where we need to refocus our aid and development effort is the way
in which the aid budget is deployed. Over the past couple of decades,
the proportion of aid that has gone to financing infrastructure and
economic development in developing countries has declined by about
three quarters. Yet, if they do not have the infrastructure—both
physical and institutional—to get exports to market, they are
not going to be able to  take advantage of opportunities that
may open up in neighbouring or more distant markets. It is essential
that we help developing countries through a refocusing of a proportion
of the aid budget to build up suitable infrastructure.</hs_Para>

area that we need to look at, because time is running out, is the
treatment of medicines. There has been agreement under the TRIPS regime
for advantageous access of medicines and drugs to developing countries.
It is important that that is perpetuated, so that developing countries
have access to the cheapest and, where possible, generically priced
medicines, while leaving incentives for the pharmaceutical industry in
the developed world to develop patented medicines, primarily getting
rewards in their own developed
markets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000203">We
also need to look at the availability of trade finance—whether
it can be made more accessible and lower cost for those countries. We
also need to focus on corruption and rent-seeking, and the extent to
which that inhibits trade and development. I hope all those areas will
be considered very seriously by those looking at the pattern of
development goals that should be set for the future. I know the Prime
Minister is very seized by the importance of trade as part of
development strategy, as is the Minister who will respond to the

Ali</B> (Bethnal Green and Bow) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr Brady. I will be as brief as possible
so that we can hear from the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for
York Central (Hugh Bayley), who I congratulate on securing the
debate.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032160000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000206">The
millennium development goals have provided huge momentum in addressing
some of the most pressing challenges facing developing countries. As
many hon. Members have said, admirable progress has been made. There
has been a significant reduction in extreme poverty and infant
mortality, and there is access to primary education for children. There
are improvements in the living conditions of slum dwellers, as well as
major advances in the fight against disease, which was highlighted by
the hon. Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy) and my hon. Friend the
Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier).</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032160000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000207">While
progress has been made, most of the current MDGs sadly will not be met.
We know that, despite the achievements, inequalities between and within
countries have continued to grow. There needs to be renewed focus on
inequality as well as poverty, as hon. Members have highlighted.
Critically, we need to ensure that we redouble our efforts on tackling
issues affecting women, such as violence against women, as has been
highlighted by the One Billion Rising campaign, which has cross-party
support. We also need to focus on the continued plight of people in
conflict-affected and fragile states, as the hon. Members for Banff and
Buchan (Dr Whiteford) and for Ceredigion (Mr Williams) mentioned. There
has been a failure to meet the goals in those countries, and it is
critical that we focus on them as we move forward to build on the MDGs,
if we are to see progress.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032160000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000208">I want to
highlight some of the points mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for
York Central, including the achievements under the previous Labour
Government. I am pleased that the current Government have stuck
to  
<?notus-xml column=369?>the 0.7% of GDP commitment, and we support them in increasing the aid
budget to that amount. I am glad to hear that the target will be met
this year.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032160000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000209">My hon.
Friend mentioned the important international leadership role played by
former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:49:04"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown). The current
Prime Minister also has an important role to play. My hon. Friend the
Member for York Central
highlighted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T14:49:04"></hs_TimeCode> the
fact that this is a great opportunity for Britain to lead the way, as
it has done in the past, and to show the world that we are with
developing countries and some of the poorest people in the world
through the tough times, as we were in the good economic times when we
made great strides to reduce poverty in those countries.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032160000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000210">Between 1990
and 2005, the poverty rate fell from 46% to 27%, which represented 400
million people lifted out of extreme poverty. We know that recent
economic difficulties have affected people in developing countries, as
millions have fallen back below the poverty line. We have an important
role to play by continuing our focus and being resolute in working with
the international community to ensure that countries do not give in to
pressure from sections of the media by reneging on the promise to
increase aid to some of the poorest countries in the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000211">We
face huge challenges, particularly in relation to how economic
development is taking place in middle-income countries. As hon. Members
have mentioned, such development is, of course, vital to lifting people
out of poverty, as we have seen in countries such as China. The right
hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr Lilley) highlighted the
importance of economic trade and growth for lifting people out of
poverty but, on its own, that is not enough, as we see in countries
such as India. We need to ensure that our aid effort supports the
poorest in middle-income countries. We need a clear narrative that is
sharply targeting our aid efforts to lift people out of poverty in
middle-income countries. We should work with those countries’
Governments, as well as those in the poorest and fragile
countries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000212">I
welcome the “Enough food for everyone IF” campaign, which
has cross-party support, that highlights the fact that almost 1 billion
people still go hungry in the 21st century. That is why it is so
important that the international community looks at post-2015
development goals. We need to recognise that much more has to be
achieved if we are to protect people in the poorest
countries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000213">We
must also address climate change and the need for sustainable
development goals. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:59:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) and others
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:09:37"></hs_TimeCode>pointed out, it
is important that the sustainable development goals are closely linked
to the millennium development goals and that they sit together, because
as we look to the future, climate change and development will become
ever more interconnected. We need to ensure that the goals are working
in sync to address future
challenges<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:59:49"></hs_TimeCode>.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T15:59:49"></hs_TimeCode>Urbanisation is
a major issue around the world, and we need to ensure that there is a
continued focus on that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032160000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000214"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:00:07"></hs_TimeCode>I
quickly want to pick up on several points that have been made. Economic
opportunities are vital, particularly with regard to jobs and growth,
and the point has been made about ensuring that people have
opportunities when there is growth.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:00:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stafford highlighted the importance of the private sector. We 
<?notus-xml column=370?>welcome the private sector’s role in generating self-sufficiency,
and trade and job opportunities, but that has to be done transparently.
We need to ensure that taxpayers’ money is spent appropriately.
Just as we would expect transparency in the way in which NGOs spend
British taxpayers’ money, we need to ensure that the same
happens when we release funding through the private sector. The roles
of the private sector and foreign direct investment will be vital, as
we see in many countries. Good governance will be critical, and such
issues need to be at the centre of debates as we move forward the
post-2015 agenda.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032160000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000215"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:01:12"></hs_TimeCode>Countries
such as Brazil highlight important examples of how economic growth has
gone hand in hand with social development and Government intervention.
We need to ensure that lessons are learned from countries in which
poverty alleviation has been achieved alongside economic growth. I hope
that that the UK Government will prioritise ensuring that we stand up
for social justice and responsible trade and capitalism, and that we
take a strong line against companies that are evading or avoiding tax.
I welcome the commitment of the Government—and particularly the
Prime Minister and the Chancellor—to take action to tackle tax
avoidance, and I hope that there will be substantial attempts to change
how poor business practices are denying tax revenue to developing
countries, as well as our own country. While we welcome the statements
that have been made, people will rightly say that they want action, not
rhetoric, so I hope that that will happen.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032160000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000216"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:02:31"></hs_TimeCode>In
conclusion—I am sticking to the time that the Minister has
informally suggested I should take, and I look forward to hearing his
answers—I hope that the post-2015 framework will genuinely be
about partnership between developing and developed countries, and
between civil society organisations and Government. I also hope that
civil society organisations, charities and NGOs will, as they rightly
should, play an important role in keeping the pressure up on our
Government—as the IF campaign and others are doing—as
well as on other international agencies, multilateral agencies and
other Governments.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032160000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000217">Labour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:03:14"></hs_TimeCode>
has called for a new social contract without borders. That is rooted in
three key elements, one of which is social justice. That is about
tackling inequality as well as poverty, and about having a strong focus
on human rights. I hope that the Government will emphasise that, not
only in developing countries, but at the European level, and through
how we practise empowerment, human rights and women’s rights in
our country. We have a lot to learn, as well as a lot of expertise to
share. In that spirit, I hope that we will work together with our
partners in developing countries to come up with a new framework about
not only inclusive growth, human rights, empowerment and tackling
poverty, but good governance and tackling corruption. That applies not
only in developing countries, as we would expect that when we give
money to those countries, but to the way in which companies behave. It
is also important that there is transparency around how NGOs operate,
as is ensuring that power relationships are firmly based on empowering
the citizens we seek to help, not the institutions that are meant to
help. Sometimes that debate tends  to be missed, and there is
too often a tendency to do development to people rather than with
people. We need to learn that important lesson from our previous
experience.</hs_Para>

look forward to hearing the Minister’s response. We will,
of course, support the Government in areas in which
we will be able to work together on this important agenda. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:05:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for York Central stated at the start of his speech, this is
a unique opportunity for the Prime Minister to lead the way on tackling
global poverty and inequality. It is vital that he uses his influence
on other international leaders, as his predecessors did, to ensure that
we genuinely achieve the aim of ending poverty over the coming decades
so that we can, in the years to come, be proud of the fact that both
this and the previous Government took the lead in the international
community on ending global poverty and
inequality.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:05:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for York Central (Hugh Bayley) for securing the debate. The post-2015
agenda is a priority for the whole of the Government. Ensuring that we
have an ambitious, poverty-focused post-2015 agenda is a top priority
for my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, for all of us in DFID, for
much of the House of Commons, and for the development community as a
whole. We all welcome parliamentary engagement on the issue.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032160000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000220"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:06:18"></hs_TimeCode>I
have spoken in previous Adjournment debates on this fast-moving agenda,
but now is a good time to take up the topic again, because the
high-level panel will meet once again next week in Bali. The
debate is also timely given the recent inquiry into the post-2015
development agenda by the International Development Committee. The
Government’s response to that was published yesterday, in which
we welcomed the constructive contribution from the Committee and
explained our thinking so
far<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:07:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000221">Let
me start by saying that the post-2015 process should absolutely not be
at the expense of continuing to work to deliver the existing MDGs
between now and 2015. The UK will continue to lead the way on
supporting developing countries to attain those goals. We have seen
remarkable progress around the world since 2000. The proportion of
people living on $1.25 a day since 1990 has been halved, as has the
proportion of people without access to drinking water. Primary school
enrolment has increased by 89%. Those are just a few of the successes,
but there are many areas in which progress has been weak, such as on
maternal mortality and the quality of children’s education.
Additionally, more than 1 billion people are still living in extreme
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:07:54"></hs_TimeCode>. We
still have a world in which people die unnecessarily every day. They go
without education and go to bed hungry at night. That is why the
Government are upholding their commitment to delivering 0.7% of our
national income in
aid<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:08:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:09:37"></hs_TimeCode>,
but that is only part of the answer, and it is in that context that we
will look ahead to the period after 2015. We need the new development
agenda to reflect the fact that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:09:37"></hs_TimeCode> world has
changed greatly since 2000. Indeed,
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:09:37"></hs_TimeCode> the period
since I last spoke in an Adjournment debate on this subject, a lot has
changed. The discussion has moved forward in leaps and bounds, but a
lot remains to be
agreed.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:08:40"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032160000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000222">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:09:37"></hs_TimeCode>
we last discussed the post-2015 agenda in such a debate, the ambition
for the new framework was not really clear. Would we, for instance,
tweak the current  
<?notus-xml column=372?>MDGs to update and adjust them a bit, or would we revamp the whole
framework and address completely new challenges and issues?
Now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:09:06"></hs_TimeCode>, five months
on, let me be clear about the ambition of the high-level panel, which
my right hon. friend the Prime Minister co-chairs. The new framework
should maintain a resolute focus on eradicating poverty, but to do
that, it will not be enough to address human development issues such as
health and education. Addressing the symptoms of poverty will also not
be enough. We need to address the root causes of poverty, and that
means going further than just a tweak to the old
framework<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:00:26"></hs_TimeCode>.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:06:24"></hs_TimeCode>

dealing with issues such as education and health, we need to include
the building blocks of sustainable prosperity, such as open,
accountable governance,
jobs—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:09:52"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)
referred<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:09:52"></hs_TimeCode> to that
in detail—and the sustainable use of natural resources, all of
which were mentioned in this
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000223">Those
are all challenging issues, and the discussion about how the global
community should work together to achieve the mammoth task of
eradicating poverty for ever is full of intellectual and conceptual
challenges. Various countries and organisations, such as businesses and
civil society, have different views about what our priorities should be
and how we should achieve our aims, so let me lay out a few of the core
challenges that we will be working to
resolve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:10:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000224">One
lively topic of debate has been whether a focus on poverty eradication
can be married with the need to promote global sustainable development
in the post-2015 agenda that we are trying to design, or whether a
wider view on sustainable development would dilute the focus on
poverty? Should the post-2015 framework tackle issues such as climate
change, or should they be separated into a distinct set of
goals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:11:05"></hs_TimeCode>? In our
view, the case for integration is clear. Integrating social, economic
and environmental issues in a framework focused on poverty is the only
way to make the ending of poverty irreversible. If we do not manage to
do that, resource scarcity and environmental degradation have the
potential to unpick years of economic progress, so the Prime Minister
and the Government as a whole are committed to securing a single set of
goals for the period after
2015<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:11:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000225">Another
conceptual challenge facing us as we look to 2015 is the role for the
vital conditions for eradicating poverty and pursuing prosperity.
Accountable institutions —we have heard about accountability
today—transparent governance, the rule of law and the absence of
conflict are just some of the building blocks of sustained prosperity
that the Prime Minister calls the “golden thread” of
development. Only when people can get a job and a voice can they take
control of their own destiny and build a future for themselves that is
free from
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:12:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000226">Not
everyone agrees with the view that I have just outlined, however. Some
believe that actively promoting good governance and the rule of law is
going too far. They say that those things are sovereign—that no
one is entitled to impose them on someone else—and anyway they
do not believe that it is possible to quantify or measure something
such as the rule of law or an effective judicial system. However, we
believe that they can be measured. Indeed, we have done a lot of work
on just that, and we are not alone in our
belief<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:12:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

themselves regularly identify honest and responsive governance as one
of their top priorities for 
<?notus-xml column=373?>the new framework. That is what we seem to be hearing from the MY World
global survey that we have been supporting. Fragile, conflict-stricken
countries also agree. For instance, Emilia Pires, East Timor’s
Minister of Finance, has been vocal on the panel about the need to
establish robust institutions as part of tackling conflict and
insecurity. Graça Machel, Nelson Mandela’s wife, has been
another influential advocate. As the debate continues in the
international community, we will be working with partners to make that
a priority for the new
framework<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:13:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000228">Let
me talk about “universality”. That is the current
buzzword defining the debate, yet various people are giving very
different meanings to that word. To some people, universality means
that the new framework must reach people regardless of whether they
have disabilities, whether they are male or female, whether they live
in a city or a village and whether they are old or young, and whatever
religion and ethnicity they are.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:14:12"></hs_TimeCode> the MDGs, we
said that we would halve poverty, so for some people, universality
means that this time we must reach everyone and get to zero
poverty—that we must reach the poorest and most marginalised,
which is the approach urged on us by the hon. Members for Banff and
Buchan (Dr Whiteford) and for Hackney South and Shoreditch. It is, in
essence, the issue of reach, in as much as the average is an
inadequate measure of the depth of progress that we want to
see<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:14:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000229">However,
some people <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:14:31"></hs_TimeCode>mean
that the framework should apply, as they put it, as much in East Anglia
as in east Africa. They believe that all targets should apply to all
countries, which is something that we have heard about in the debate.
It is an interesting suggestion, but what would it mean in practice for
the UK? Would targets on getting kids into schools or access to clean
water have any meaning here? Perhaps not, although any targets relating
to boosting the numbers of women CEOs or MPs might. We
probably need to be cautious about losing the focus on eradicating
poverty by casting our net too wide and rendering the sharp focus of
intended action dangerously meaningless. The framework needs to deal
with real fundamentals. Frankly, countries in which only half of all
kids go to school, or in which corruption is rife and blocking growth

the success of any post-2015 framework will rest on its simplicity. It
should be short, compelling and easy to understand. That was the great
strength of the millennium development goals. What we cannot have is a
long shopping list of issues designed to satisfy everyone. A lot of
development issues have been raised during today’s debate and I
recognise the importance of many of them, but a new framework with
hundreds of goals addressing every single point would be useless.
The  core challenge ahead of us is how to distil them into a
few really fundamental issues. That will mean that
not  
<?notus-xml column=374?>everyone is happy—some people will not see their favoured issues
reflected—but we need to aim for our highest
common ambition, not the lowest common

we know, the Prime Minister, along with the Presidents of Indonesia and
Liberia, is a co-chair of the high-level panel on what we will do after
2015. It has met three times and, at the fourth meeting next week,
needs to continue to make progress. That meeting will focus on global
partnerships, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be
demonstrating the clear vision and leadership for which the UK has
become known on the

the panel has a fantastic opportunity to provide leadership at the

will be using our influence and expertise to lead the political and

is vital for the post-2015 agenda. That is one of the reasons why I
welcome today’s discussion. I am glad that it has attracted such
widespread interest—from Parliament, NGOs, businesses, local and
national Governments and, we hope, through what we have arranged, from
our schools as well. Only this morning, the Prime Minister’s
special envoy for post-2015 development, Michael Anderson, a senior
DFID official, updated the all-party group on the United Nations on the
panel’s progress. At this very moment, a seminar is taking place
in the House of Lords, bringing together NGOs, academics and
parliamentarians to discuss the shape of the agenda that they want to
see.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0001.htm#13032160000235">As
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:19:04"></hs_TimeCode>I said, the
voices of poor people themselves must be at the heart of any new
framework. That will be crucial to developing a framework that ends
poverty, for ever, in our generation. DFID has been supporting a number
of initiatives to drive engagement with marginalised groups. One of
those is MY World—an online, offline and SMS survey to ask
people all over the world what they would like to see reflected in the
framework. I expect that many of our constituents will be keen to get
involved and will be filling that out
online<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:19:43"></hs_TimeCode>. Today,
my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State sent a letter to all MPs
that outlines our thoughts and actions so far on the post-2015 agenda.
A point it makes forcefully is that women and girls must be included in
the framework, which must also include an aim to eliminate violence

Bayley:</Member></B> I thank everybody who played a part in the debate.
One or two Members have thanked me for securing it, but it was not by
any means my initiative. It was a conspiracy—a joint
effort—behind closed doors from, I think, 17 all-party groups to
approach the Backbench Business Committee jointly. Such was our
strength in numbers and unity of purpose that the first time we
approached the Committee and explained that this week was a
particularly appropriate week to hold a debate of this nature, it gave
us the
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0002.htm#13032160000239">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:21:32"></hs_TimeCode>

Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier), who turned up
with me to make the case to the Committee, and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:22:44"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr Lilley), who played as big a part
as any of us in securing the debate. He made my point that politics
does not just happen; it is organised, so I thank him for getting on
the phone to colleagues to ensure that they turned up and made
speeches. A former Cabinet Minister playing such a prominent role in
debates and policy in the House, and of course in his party, is a
tremendous boost to this area of policy. I very much welcome what he
has done with his all-party group on trade out of poverty and his more
general writing, thinking and leadership on international
development.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032160000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0002.htm#13032160000240"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:23:39"></hs_TimeCode>It
would be presumptuous of me to respond to the debate on behalf of a
disparate group of Back Benchers, but I shall tell the Minister that I
agree strongly—I think all those I spoke to when trying to
initiate the debate agree strongly—that, first, the Government
and Prime Minister are right to seek to integrate goals that unite
social, economic and environmental actions and progress. Secondly, our
Prime Minister is right to stress the “golden thread” and
say that we can do development without democracy, the rule of law,
accountable institutions and transparency, but we are likely to do it
better and involve all people, including the poorest of the poor, if we
subscribe to those principles. Above all, Government and government
institutions, such as courts, need to be accountable to the people, not
a weight bearing down upon
them.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:24:48"></hs_TimeCode> In
relation to the Minister’s point about whether we should seek
universal progress, it is important that when we measure progress, we
disaggregate the data, so that we can spot whether particular
communities are being left out—if women are falling behind or if
particular tribes or ethnic or racial groups in a country are being
left
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0002.htm#13032160000241">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:21:32"></hs_TimeCode>
is also important that we learn one lesson from  the millennium
development goals, which have been a great success in mobilising world
opinion and action by 
<?notus-xml column=376?>Governments in developing countries: it was too much of a top-down
process. They were agreed at the UN General Assembly and then rolled
out as if through  a mangle. That is why we
get the oddity of universal targets—what is appropriate in
relation to clean water or school enrolment in east Africa, might not
be appropriate in East Anglia. I hope that the new approach will set a
global framework that will leave individual countries—and in
more populous countries, individual states—the task of setting
the development strategy and determining how to measure
progress.</hs_Para>

have had very good comments. As somebody who we all know of, although
we may not all have been in the House with—a former Member for a
Durham mining constituency—would have said, “Well guys,
this has been a really rich and valuable discussion and it will take
the debate forward,” and I agree. Every Member made comments
that I scribbled down and have learnt from, which will help me to work
out what we need to do to create conditions that will relieve the
burden of poverty from some of the poorest people in the world. The
private sector certainly has to be a driver and our development
strategy must enable that.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:27:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

micro and small businesses to raise capital when they have no

hon. Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds) started by saying that he
did not know much about this field, but he made a really powerful point
that in order to keep the House behind the Government and the public
behind our parties, which espouse the cause of global development, we
must address the question of why we do it at all and why Government
have to play a part. We received answers to those questions in a number
of the comments, and, indeed, some are not entirely new answers. It was
back in the late ‘70s, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:27:47"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Hitchin and Harpenden reminds me, that a former Conservative
Prime Minister, Edward Heath, served on the Brandt commission, which
made the then revolutionary proposition that we get involved in
international development because it is mutually beneficial. One thing
that the Brandt commission said was that it promotes
trade.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032160000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/halltext/130321h0002.htm#13032160000244">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-21T16:21:32"></hs_TimeCode>
live in an increasingly globalised world and if we simply close our

support. We are behind the Prime Minister and his initiative. We want
him to be a big player and drive forward a global agenda, so that the

performing by putting collision and casualty numbers into context. By
setting those numbers against population, traffic levels, road length
and authority spend we have produced a set of indicators showing
performance over the last seven years and where that authority stands
against others. The site also provides a mapping facility that can be

is expected that there will be an increase in the availability of
biogas from anaerobic digestion. Whilst there were 54 plants in mid
2011, now there are 106 anaerobic digestion plants (and about 150
dealing with sewage sludge). The Government estimated in the Anaerobic
Digestion Strategy and Action Plan that about 5 million tonnes of food
waste might be available for anaerobic digestion by 2020. The
Department of Energy and Climate Change review of the generation costs
and deployment potential of renewable electricity technologies in the
UK estimated that the current feedstock for anaerobic digestion in the
sewage sector is 1.37 million tonnes dry solids. (Estimates for sewage

for the prevailing levels of support available to anaerobic digestion
(AD) generating stations accredited under the feed-in tariff (FIT) and
renewables obligation (RO) schemes. Biomethane generation is not
classified separately from other forms of AD generation and so the

Barker:</Member></B> Biomethane is almost pure methane which is
obtained by cleaning up the biogas generated by anaerobic digestion
(AD). Biomethane is typically used to generate heat or as a transport
fuel. It is not typically used to generate electricity because it is
much cheaper to generate electricity directly from the biogas. However,
if a generator wished to use biomethane for electricity generation,
such generation would be eligible for support under the relevant AD
band in the renewables obligation (RO) and AD tariff in the feed-in
tariff (FIT) scheme. The incentives available through the RO and FIT
for AD electricity generation have been revised following comprehensive
reviews of those two schemes. The details were published in July
2012<Sup>1</Sup>. DECC has not assessed the availability of support for
biomethane under the renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO) as
responsibility for that schemes rests with the Department for
Transport.</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13032187000460" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/text/130321w0001.htm#13032187000460"><Sup>1</Sup>https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/supporting-large-scale-renewable-electricity-generation</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13032187000461" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/text/130321w0001.htm#13032187000461">https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/tariffs-for-non-pv-technologies-comprehensive-review-phase-2b</hs_brev><hs_8Question UID="13032187000009" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/text/130321w0001.htm#13032187000009">Cheaper

has—together with international partners—undertaken
interventions to address the problem of HIV/AIDS which can have such a
devastating impact on those infected. Programmes have specifically
included empowerment of girls and South Africa now has the largest
anti-retroviral programme in the world. The Department for
International Development has been active for a number of years in
funding interventions designed to change behaviour. A new programme has
been agreed to fund operational research on how best to prevent
adolescent HIV infection in the region which has some of the highest
rates of HIV infection in the world. This programme will operate in
several countries in southern Africa and aims to elicit better evidence
about the most efficacious and cost-effective methods of limiting the

routinely measures excess mortality during the winter period in England
and Wales, as it is usual for mortality during the winter months to be
higher than mortality during the non-winter months. The majority of
excess winter deaths are from respiratory diseases or circulatory
disease, not hypothermia. This measure, known as excess winter
mortality, is based on the difference between the number of deaths
during the four winter months (December to March) and the average
number of deaths during the preceding four months (August to November)

Timpson:</Member></B> New qualified teacher standards came into effect
in September 2012. These have a sharpened focus on meeting the needs of
children with special educational needs (SEN) and disabilities. The
Government have also strengthened initial teacher training and
continuing professional development provision through the publication
of additional online training materials for teachers of pupils with the
most common and complex special educational needs, such as autism and
Asperger's syndrome.</hs_Para>

have provided funding to train all new school SEN coordinators so they
can better advise their colleagues on how to meet children's needs.
That training includes training on particular types of need, including
autistic spectrum disorders. The Government have funded training for
almost 10,500 SENCOs so
far.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032191000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/text/130321w0002.htm#13032191000036">The
Government have also provided some £1.3 million funding to the
Autism Education Trust over the last two years to provide training and
training materials for school and other staff. The Department will be
letting a contract to provide specialist support in autism provision
from April. The Autism Education Trust has put in a bid which proposes
to extend their existing training programme beyond March 2013, and also
expand coverage more widely throughout England and to cover early years
and further
education.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032191000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/text/130321w0002.htm#13032191000037">Asperger's
syndrome is commonly diagnosed later than classic autism as children's
difficulties may only become apparent when they are introduced to a
social environment such as a school. The measures the Government are
taking to spread training in, and understanding of, autistic spectrum
disorders will help to improve the early detection of Asperger's
syndrome.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032191000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/text/130321w0002.htm#13032191000038">Local
authorities have the same duties to meet children's special educational
needs and to make special educational provision when carrying out their
duty to secure that there are sufficient primary and secondary schools

that eligibility for an EHC plan remains the same as it is now for a

Children and Families Bill proposes that an education, health and care
plan be based on a co-ordinated assessment across a young person's full
range of education, health and care support needs. We have set out more
detail on the requirements for education, health and care plans in the
indicative regulations and outline SEN code of practice, which were
recently made available to Parliament. The outline SEN code of practice
makes clear that, for those in post-16 provision, local authorities
should consider the individual's needs and provide a package of
education provision, support and independent study that covers five
days a week where that is appropriate to meet the young person's needs.
This provision will not necessarily all come from one provider. For
some students, FE courses normally delivered in three days could be
spread over four or five days a week to enable the young person to
maximise their learning outcomes. Local authorities will need to work
with FE providers in delivering this.</hs_Para>

Timpson:</Member></B> At present the needs of pupils
with SEN but without statements are addressed under the guidance on
School Action and School Action Plus as set out in the current SEN code
of practice. It is clear, not least from the results of the Lamb
inquiry and Ofsted's 2010 report on SEN, that this system is not
working well. It emphasises labelling children's need according to how
appropriate support is to be provided, rather than the outcomes sought
for the child and how to reach
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032191000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/text/130321w0003.htm#13032191000162">That
is why we proposed in the Green Paper, ‘Support and
Aspiration’ to replace the current approach with a new single
early years and school-based SEN category, providing clear guidance to
settings and schools on the appropriate identification of pupils with
SEN. We shall develop this as part of the new SEN code of practice. The
aim will be to identify needs as early as possible when they manifest
and to focus on providing support to have an impact for the individual,
rather than how children access support according to a category they
have been fitted
into.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032191000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130321/text/130321w0003.htm#13032191000163">This
will be supported by maintaining legislative duties in relation to this
group of pupils which require schools to use their best endeavours to
secure special educational provision, to have an SEN co-ordinator, to
notify parents of such provision or to publish information on how it is
implementing its policy on SEN and disability. It will also be
supported by the new local offer provisions in the Children and
Families Bill. The local offer has a real potential to make the
specific support available locally more transparent and easier to
access to the benefit of all, including for pupils without education,
health and care
plans.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_21_PT_1/5967A1CD282ADF8E71718B1DEE95056CE1FECEEA" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="21 March 2013">Thursday

Ministry of Justice (Ministry of Justice Headquarters, HM Courts and

the Public Guardian) currently makes a limited number of subsidised
places at a school holiday scheme located at a number of sites around
Westminster. Employees using the scheme are billed by the playscheme
for the full amount less a 50% subsidy, paid direct by MOJ. This
subsidy is currently £16.50 per child per day. MOJ employees
including NOMS have access to a salary sacrifice scheme for child care
vouchers. A small number of MOJ staff on legacy terms and conditions
are additionally eligible for employer paid child care vouchers, I am

determine where the remains should be laid to rest. The licence

buried remains for archaeological purposes. There is no requirement for
the Ministry of Justice to notify anyone on receiving an archaeological
