who asserts a right cannot just stand on that right and say
“That’s my right”. The courts need to look at the
wider circumstances of the case, including at the person’s
conduct, to establish whether they come to justice, as it were, with

a characteristically forceful argument. For too long, human rights have
been interpreted under the convention in what lawyers have called an
“objective test”. It asks people “Do you have a
family?” and “Do you have a right to family
life?”—and if the answer is yes, end of story. The
British common law way, however, asks people “Do you have a
family?” and if the answer is yes, it says it is important to
preserve it, but it also asks whether they have acted in such a way
according to a subjective test to establish whether that right should
be allowed as far as that person is concerned. That is a key point,
which goes to heart of why human rights are in such crisis in Britain
today, and it is a key plank of the change I am seeking to make through

establish the cornerstones and foundation blocks of a uniquely British

British people would consider entirely perverse. What I have sought to
do with the settlement proposed in the Bill is take the European
convention out of the UK legal system so that it is not directly
effective, and need not be applied by UK judges day in, day out. As my
hon. Friend says, if we remain party to the convention, on a

it has not kept up with or changed with our times. Europe has moved on,

legislation under which it is made does not prevent the subordinate

That is why the question of whether we should remain part of the treaty

legal system so they would not be able to stand on those European
rights before UK courts or seek relief before the UK courts unless they
had British rights under the British settlement. That is the key part
of what we might call the dualist approach and obviously the Strasbourg

not be used to prevent public authorities from taking action in
relation to a person to uphold national security or public safety when
the authorities reasonably believed that a clear and present danger to
national security or public safety was presented by that person,

important point that goes to the heart of the Bill is that rights must

a right. In other words, if they have broken their half of the social
contract, that will go against them when they seek to assert the part
of the social contract or rights on which they want to rely. It is
right that judges and the courts should be able to consider the case in
the round to determine whether a person can avail themselves of those
rights. As I have said, someone should not be able to use the right to
family life to stay on the run. That is a basic part of the subjective

might be tempting to say, as some lawyers do, that the British public
are not focused enough on the moral details and the legal details of
the case, and to trivialise their objections. This would be unfair,

a sense of what human rights are. Let me politely challenge slightly
the definition of human rights put forward by my hon. Friend, without
calling into question his overall point, which is that we are now in a
mess. It seems to me that we can begin with a definition of human
rights that would state that to say that somebody has a human right is
to say that anyone, anywhere, treated in this fashion is wronged, and
that their possession of that right is not relative to the costs or
benefits of upholding it in any particular case. That sounds very

our moral intuition is that a particular act is unacceptable. At
another level, at the level of a million, our moral intuition is that
it might be acceptable. This is a very difficult point. The point that

the current system? It seems to me that there are four possible answers

Friend the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)
has<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T10:59:52"></hs_TimeCode> raised,
relates to the question of sovereignty. The first possible answer on
what is wrong with the current settlement on rights is that there is a
problem of parliamentary sovereignty. The notion, which we could
explore in greater depth, is that Parliament is sovereign and that the
European Court of Human Rights, by overruling the decisions of the
British Parliament, is not acting in accordance with the British
constitution.</hs_Para>

second argument that could be made is that a question such as whether
prisoners should have the right to vote—a recent and difficult
case—is purely relative; that it is culturally relative. It
could simply be argued that the reason the European Court should not
get involved in prisoner voting is not because of sovereignty, but
because the question is culturally relative—I say
“tomato”, you say “tomayto”. These things
are purely subjective and based on a particular cultural or historical
context and the Court should not be fussing about them. The British
think one thing, the Spanish think another. There is no way of
resolving it, because it is purely
relative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T10:53:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0001.htm#13030165000186">The
third argument is that we are dealing with subjects that are purely
trivial, the argument being that voting rights for prisoners simply do
not matter. There might theoretically be a moral solution to the
question of whether prisoners should be able to vote, but it is a
trivial issue and not something the European Court should be dealing
with. Instead, it should be looking at more important issues.</hs_Para>

me to expand on those four arguments in more detail. The first argument
is about parliamentary sovereignty, which
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T10:54:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North East Somerset dealt with so eloquently. It is of
course true that traditionally within the British system parliamentary
sovereignty was supreme. Although Dicey talks about parliamentary
sovereignty and the rule of law, it is quite clear that what he means
by the rule of law is not what Lord Bingham means by the rule of law.
In other words, in the conventional British interpretation, the rule of
law is not something equivalent to the US constitution. It is not an
independent body of law against which parliamentary statutes can be
judged. It was not the case in Britain that an Act of Parliament could
be struck down by a court on the grounds that it did not accord with
the rule of law. That notion, which is of the 15th and 16th centuries,
that there was an independent common law that trumped the actions of
Parliament, was put aside. Essentially, for the past 300
years we have believed that Parliament is sovereign.</hs_Para>

interpretation, the European Court cannot possibly be engaged in trying
to subjugate Parliament. At the very best, all it is engaged in is an
international treaty obligation through which the British Parliament
has voluntarily determined that it wishes to accept the rulings of the
Court but can choose to ignore them if it so wishes, and in doing so it
would not be breaking British law but would simply be in breach of its
international treaty obligations.</hs_Para>

deep is that belief in the British mind that we are now the only

situation in which,
as<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T10:56:05"></hs_TimeCode> my hon.
Friend the Member for Dover has so eloquently explained, our
constitution shifts continually over time and, at its worst,
“bends like a reed” in the wind. It is theoretically
possible, in a way that it is not in any other advanced democracy in
the world, for a simple majority in Parliament—a majority of the
people gathered here today, for example—to change the
fundamental constitution of the British
nation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0001.htm#13030165000191">Every<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T10:57:36"></hs_TimeCode>
other advanced democracy draws a distinction between constitutional and

special procedure. In northern European countries there is generally a
demand for a two-thirds majority in Parliament, and in southern
European countries there is more of a focus on a referendum. In some
countries, such as Italy, there is interest in an intermediate vote, so
the Parliament must be dissolved and the proposed constitutional change
put to the electorate through a general election. That is all designed
to make it very difficult for a Parliament to change the constitution.
The idea—not a British one—is that a Government or
Parliament are temporary, but the people are public, and the
constitution exists to protect the people from the

all important respects equal in dignity and in rights. That is an
insight of logic and of human consciousness and a basic commitment to
the notion that, although we might feel that we are special and the
only people who exist, as we become adults we acknowledge that other
people, too, are independent moral actors who possess exactly the same
dignity. The inviolability—the rights of the human

mean that they are relative. This is an important distinction. The

“relative”. The notion of “relative” that
my hon. Friend is rehearsing simply says that rights and moral values
evolve in a historical context. As he says, it is simply a matter of
historical fact that different cultures at different times have taken
different moral positions. Aristotle, alongside his other great
observations, believed that women and slaves lacked souls. Today we
realise not merely that he thinks one thing and we think
another—that it is relative—but that he is wrong. He is
wrong because moral language is implicitly not relative; it is, in its
very structure, absolute. Moral language does not say, “I
don’t happen to like you killing someone, but if you want to
kill someone that is up to you.” In other words, it does not say
that killing someone or not doing so is like you liking chocolate ice
cream and me liking strawberry ice cream; it says that it is wrong and
ought not to be done. Moral language is about questions of
“ought”, not questions of
“is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T11:03:46"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0001.htm#13030165000201"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jacob Rees-Mogg" PimsId="5628" UID="13030165000716" xid="1186" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0001.htm#13030165000716">Jacob

Stewart:</Member></B> I will try again. The central point is that the
notion of moral obligation—the notion of what ought or ought not
to be done—relies on two conflicting principles that connect at
the moment of the threshold. Those two conflicting principles are, on
the one hand, the notion of the inviolability and dignity of the human
being, and, on the other, a consequentialist or utilitarian argument of
the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Philosophically, the
origins of these two types of argument are entirely distinct. One is a
deontological argument that simply states the dignity of the human
being and their inviolability; the other is an instrumental argument
based on consequences or results. Our legal system, and indeed our
moral intuitions, combine these two, which meet at a point of the
threshold. This is what we mean by “ought”. We mean
exactly what my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T11:04:59"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset suggests: that the
individual ought not to be treated like this except in very extreme

circumstances in which our moral intuitions in terms of human rights
shift to moral intuitions in terms of a consequentialist world view in
which we say, “One person might be killed for the benefit of a

is an exact example of where our moral intuitions collide. My instinct
would be that neither ourselves nor a German legislature would be
comfortable with the decision either way. These are terrible, terrible
decisions involving two very deep moral intuitions. The first of those
is that individuals should be treated as ends in themselves and not
means to an end. As my hon. Friend so rightly points out, the German
supreme court holds that a plane could not be brought down in those
circumstances because it feels deeply that that would be to treat the
people on it as a means to an end rather than an end in themselves. In
effect, it would be doing to them something similar to killing one
person in order to harvest their organs to benefit five others. The
calculus is that five having benefited is not enough to outweigh the

some form of immunity? Is there some magic in this Chamber that allows
the legislators in it to do whatever they want? Is it the case, as Lord
Hoffmann suggested in his judgment, that if this Chamber wished, it
could simply flout human rights? Is that a statement about political

every reason to be proud of the performance of this Parliament.
Although theoretically, constitutional anxiety leads us to believe that
this Parliament could do truly barbarous things, as a matter of fact it
has not. In fact, consistently this Parliament has shown itself very
respectful of the unwritten laws of the British constitution. When
Parliament has attempted to fundamentally change the constitution of
the United Kingdom through a simple majority in the House of
Commons—as, indeed, it did with the proposal to abolish the
House of Lords—it refused to take that opportunity. It backed
away from it. Parliament’s reluctance, innate conservatism and
caution with regard to issues relating to the constitution have meant
that, from 1911 to the current day, people pushing for a written
constitution or more formal constraints on the power of Parliament have
not

is good and it shows two positive things. First, it shows the important
principle of common sense. Everyone in this Chamber agrees that we do
not want to live in a world of technocrats. We like the fact that the
British public have a say and that their common sense permeates this
Parliament. At our best—we are not always at our best—we
are a lens that connects the Executive to the voting public. We act as
a mediator between public opinion—the sentiment, imagination and

second reason to be proud of the sovereignty of Parliament is that it
reflects a culture, but the question for my hon. Friend, who is one of
the great supporters of untrammelled parliamentary sovereignty is this:
do we have the confidence that the unwritten rules, the culture of this
House and the deep understanding of the history of the British
constitution—which meant in 1911 that Members of Parliament were
very cautious about changing it—still hold, or did our vote on
the House of Lords Reform Bill take us close to the brink? Is it
possible that we are suffering from collective amnesia and that one can
no longer say that the British Parliament is so deeply entrenched in
its constitutional history that it can be guaranteed never to change
fundamentally the British

we are moving into a world that takes us into that danger zone, I
believe that we need to follow the example of every other advanced
democracy in the world and separate constitutional and normal law, and
say that, in order to make a fundamental change to the constitution,
which would affect the rights of citizens—this is why this is
relevant to the European Court of Human Rights—we must ensure
that special procedures are followed. The special procedure that we
have tended to develop through precedent over the past 40 years is, of
course, a referendum. We may not want a referendum to be the
fundamental means by which we change the constitution. We may want to
adopt a different procedure, such as a two-thirds majority or a free
vote in the House—which, of course, is what the previous
Government used to deal with the issue of the House of Lords—but

reason why that is relevant to this debate is that the question of
parliamentary sovereignty and its relationship with the European Court
is the nub of the issue. The argument against the European Court cannot
simply be that Parliament is sovereign, absolute and always right and
that it should never be challenged. We have developed a doctrine of
international intervention with regard to the notion that sovereignty
does not confer immunity—that the rights of a country’s
individual citizens can trump the sovereignty of a

second argument—moving on from sovereignty, with apologies for
having paid so much attention to it—is about the question of
moral relativism, although my exchange with my hon. Friend may have
covered this issue adequately. The idea of moral relativism states that
the question of prisoners voting is purely relative. I like chocolate
ice cream, Mr Deputy Speaker, but perhaps you like strawberry ice
cream—that is a question of taste, not of moral decision. The
Spanish believe that prisoners should have votes and the British do
not, but to argue that such things are purely relative and that there
is no way of resolving them is very dangerous, because all these
questions about rights are fundamentally issues of morality. Moral
language is a statement about what is right and what is
wrong—what we ought to do and what we ought not to do. It is not
a statement of personal taste akin to saying, “I like red, you
like blue, 
<?notus-xml column=598?>and that’s the end of the discussion.” What one says is,
“You are wrong.” We must believe it is possible to
resolve the question of who is right and who is wrong on the issue of
prisoners voting and to do so through moral investigation and
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T11:18:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0001.htm#13030165000218"><B><Member ContinuationText="Charlie Elphicke" PimsId="5713" UID="13030165000724" xid="1061" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0001.htm#13030165000724">Charlie

indeed, the same as that made by Lord Hoffmann, who says that universal
rights, such as those under the European Court of Human Rights, are
simply aspirational and that any universal code is aspriational, but it
is always national in its application. The argument made by Lord
Hoffmann and my hon. Friend is that the European Court of Human Rights
and the convention are purely aspirational: they are a good way of
encouraging people to behave better, they are a good way of doing
political lobbying and they are a good way of applying pressure, but in
their application, human rights can only be national. The notion is
that human rights are relative to a particular historical or political
context. In the view of Lord Hoffmann and my hon. Friend, but not in my
view, the question of whether prisoners should vote should not be
determined by moral debate because it is specific to a particular
historical or national context. For them, the real answer to whether
prisoners should vote depends on the difference between Spanish culture
and British
culture.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0001.htm#13030165000220">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T11:20:25"></hs_TimeCode>

that one’s possession of rights is relative to the circumstances

somebody lives in Saudi Arabia means that they have fewer rights as a
woman. It cannot be the case that the mere fact that somebody lives in
Taliban Afghanistan means that they do not have freedom of the press.

one, is

although at a theoretical level it may be possible to resolve whether
prisoners should vote, as a practical point, the issue does not really
matter. It is subsidiary—that is, it should be left to
individual countries—because it is just too disruptive to the
international system to try to impose, as my hon. Friend puts it, a
one-size-fits-all approach. The argument is that trying to resolve the

is a strong intuitive argument and one that we might have a lot of
sympathy with in this House as politicians. It is obviously not a moral
argument, because Lord Hoffmann’s argument does not hold water
as a moral argument. It cannot be the case, as a question of ethics,
that nationality is the prime determiner of one’s rights.
However, that may be true as an issue of practicality. We might want to
allow some flexibility in the process for the sanity of the
international system. Although that is really tempting, the reason why
we should not go down that path is
twofold.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0001.htm#13030165000225">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T11:23:14"></hs_TimeCode>
a legal system, the question of triviality cannot be relevant. It is
not possible for a judge to determine a case simply on the basis of
whether they think that the question of prisoner voting is important in
the grand scheme of things. The judge is there to make a decision on
the basis of the law. That is why we often get frustrated and often

classic example, which is something that I hate about the European
Court of Human Rights, is the case that was brought by the man who did
not want to give his name when he was caught speeding. That case went
all the way up through the courts system. The man argued that he should
not have been obliged to give his name when spotted by a speeding

It is a minor speeding fine, so we’re not interested.”
The case went all the way up to Lord Bingham who, at great length and
with enormous politeness, explained to the gentleman that his right to
silence did not extend to not giving his name in relation to a speeding
fine. At that point, the gentleman applied to the European Court which,
perhaps to the delight of speeding motorists, seemed for a moment in a

newspaper and they may be anxious that if they pass a judgment that is
objectionable to the public, it will undermine the legitimacy or
reputation of the judiciary, but those cannot be formal considerations

very nature has sanctions, can consider whether making a certain
decision is disruptive to the international system or undermines the
legitimacy or

we feel, for political reasons, that this is not the appropriate moment
to raise it because it would cause too much disruption and
unhappiness.” However, at the point at which the issue is raised

the three arguments about the European Court that we have considered

moral principle, as opposed to a statement of constitutional fact, that
is objectionable. The current evolution of British culture and the

philosophical sense. The contention is that moral arguments are simply
a question of, “You think this and I think that,” and
there is no way of resolving them, as if they are just a question of
taste, as in the trivial example that I gave of one person liking

inviolability of the prisoner’s status as a moral
actor—as a human—requires them, always and in all
circumstances, to have a vote or not. Personally, I do not find that
argument convincing. A prisoner is not entitled, as a fundamental

argument we are rejecting is that it is simply inconvenient to talk
about such matters and that it disrupts the international system. That
is a tempting argument, because we set up the Court; David Maxwell Fyfe
essentially drafted this document and steered it through. Britain is in
the rather unfortunate situation of embarrassment. We were proud of
this Court, and if we wished to tease ourselves a little bit, we could
point out  
<?notus-xml column=601?>the fact that for 40 years we rather enjoyed the fact that the Court
told other countries how to behave. We felt—probably
intuitively—that the point about the Court was that it would
hopefully drag others up to what we rather pompously felt was
“our level”.</hs_Para>

became anxious about the Court only once it turned round and started
telling us, as opposed to foreigners, what to do—a difficult and
embarrassing situation. We liked the Court when it did a good job of
insisting that countries in southern Europe should have habeas corpus
and no detention without trial. We became anxious only when the
countries that we had cheerfully made accord with British legal norms
for 40 years, turned round and tried to demand that we accord with
their legal norms on prisoners voting.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T11:30:37"></hs_TimeCode>There is a good
reason to feel politically and institutionally, in terms of public
opinion, that we do not like that idea and would allow subsidiarity
simply to avoid political embarrassment. However, as I have argued,
that is not a moral or legal position; it is purely a question of
expediency and convenience, and no moral principle can be based on
expediency.</hs_Para>

fourth and concluding argument concerns what we should do about the
European Court. We should not give up the notion that there are
inviolable and universal human rights, or that the sovereignty of
Parliament must respect the rights of the individual. We should not
give up the notion of moral absolutes or accept the notion that
political expediency can override moral or legal principles. We must
return to the fundamentals and challenge the moral and legal
argumentation of the European Court, and we would do that in exactly
the way that my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T11:31:57"></hs_TimeCode>

my point of view, my hon. Friend is not producing a measure that would
lead us to leave the European convention, but he points out that the
Court’s current operations are resulting in absurd, surreal
consequences. The way to address that problem is to look again at the
European convention on human rights, and consider how it was drafted in
1950, what ingredients lie within it and how much latitude that gives
the Court. A Court that one year ago had 100,000 cases waiting to be
heard—an absurd number—needs to say no to far more cases.
The Court must understand that the 1950 drafting of the convention
allows it very little latitude, and that it is currently engaged with
many issues that are outside the purview of the original convention on
human rights.</hs_Para>

classic example of that is prisoners voting. The point is not that the
question of prisoners voting cannot be resolved legally or
philosophically but that it cannot be resolved on the basis of the
European convention on human rights. Nothing in the convention provides
sufficient detail or cogency to allow a judge, purely on the basis of
the nostrum of a democratic society, to derive from that vague and
abstract principle the conclusion that prisoners should have a vote.
Such a thing could be done, but not by the European Court. It could be
done by the British Parliament or by a British court, because it
requires a much deeper background of legislation. In our case it would
require the corpus of the common law; in Spain it would require the
corpus of its continental legal system. To reach such a conclusion
requires far more than the brief statements in the European convention
on human rights.</hs_Para>

does not mean that the European convention on human rights is
useless—far from it. The convention with its fundamental
principles is an incredibly useful, dynamic document that is
unambiguous and clear—as it should be—on questions of
torture. It makes every sense for the European convention on human
rights and the European Court to rule on the protection of fundamental
political rights of the sort contained in that document. It is not that
torture, genocide, arbitrary arrest and arbitrary imprisonment are the
only issues that matter. Many other issues of human rights also matter,
but those are the only issues covered in the convention and on which
the Court should be ruling. That is why the Brighton declaration
brought together by this Government as the President of the European
Council—the statements by the Secretary of State and the Lord
Chancellor—are correct.</hs_Para>

signatories to that declaration of human rights. We were the first
signatories to it in 1948 and it is the precursor to the European
convention. We have signed it and we should respect it. Should we
establish a court to uphold the information in the UN universal
declaration of human rights? I think we should be very cautious of
doing that. The UN declaration includes many elements that would be
difficult for a court to rule on and that would be difficult to apply
to the 200 members of the United Nations. For example, the declaration
includes a right to paid holiday. That is difficult to imagine in Chad,
Mali or the Congo. It is difficult to imagine what would be involved if
somebody in a developing country who lives on a dollar a day asserted
their right to a paid holiday, and it is therefore difficult to imagine
an international court that would rule on that kind of
information.</hs_Para>

of an individual Parliament or country does not trump an

question. The answer of course is that when David Maxwell Fyfe, of whom
Conservatives should be proud, and Hartley Shawcross, of whom the
Opposition are equally proud, brought the convention together, the
objective was to spread it as widely as possible. Indeed, for more than
60 years the British Government have had as their policy an attempt to
push it as far as possible, which is why the European convention now
extends a long way beyond the boundaries of the European Union and
takes in countries such as Russia. That is because we believe that the
ingredients of the European convention on human rights are basic,
inviolable and universal dignities. If anybody wishes to sign up to the
European convention, we absolutely encourage them to do so. Any country
that wishes to join, to sign up to the declarations and to be held to

them. I believe that clear moral absolutes are established by the
Church, but the state is something very different, 
<?notus-xml column=605?>and pressures on it mean that the moral absolutes have to be dealt with
in the context of the time. An obvious example is the definition of a
just war. As we know, the definition, from Thomas Aquinas, sets out
three conditions for a just war to overcome the problem of how states
can deal with a threat to their existence against the Christian
teaching that we should turn the other cheek. We find that a moral

next generation. An act of attainder was something that was an
immediate political issue when the American constitution was being

the Member for Penrith and The Border is the overwhelmingly important
point—that the legitimacy of the political power that is making
these decisions may then be altered by a subsequent political power.
The next two points, on the issues of triviality and inconvenience,
were arguments set up to be knocked down—they are clearly
wrong-headed. It is absurd to say that some aspect of law is so
unimportant that somebody should not have the right to bring a case on
it. Equally, it is absurd to say that if something is inconvenient
Governments can just override it because 
<?notus-xml column=606?>that would leave us with no rule of law at all. Therefore, the first
point and last point are essential. The fourth point is the question of
whether there is an essential morality that we can bring into our
legislative system or whether it is, in fact, a matter of political
legitimacy. In answer to that, I would say that it is a matter of
political legitimacy.</hs_Para>

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T11:51:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friends
the Members for Penrith and The Border and for Dover (Charlie
Elphicke), have both referred to the Magna Carta, and said that we have
had 800 years of these rights. Actually, the Magna Carta was a
confirmation of rights that it was thought we already had. In 1685,
habeas corpus was brought in as a confirmation of a right that we
thought that we already had. The Bill of Rights itself is about
confirming rights and stopping abuses of those rights. The approach has
been to use the development of powers within this country—the
barons in 1215, and Parliament in the 1680s—to assert these
rights against an Executive that were abusing them.</hs_Para>

That is the great safeguard of our rights and of our liberties. For a

habeas corpus as one of the most important rights that we all have to

the question of whether it is an absolute right that can be enshrined,
or whether it is fundamentally arbitrary because once the threshold has
been negotiated, the absolute quality of that right disappears. In that
case, it is not an absolute moral right; it is part of our ancient
liberties of which we are justly proud—and it is important that
we should maintain it—but it is a liberty that can, in certain
circumstances, be suspended. The question then is: whose judgment is
legitimate during that suspension? In my view, the only possible
legitimate 
<?notus-xml column=607?>authority for suspending that liberty has to be the body that represents
the democracy that is at issue. It cannot be a foreign body or an
overseas democracy; it has to belong to the people who are affected by
it.</hs_Para>

yes, in a religious context, there are absolute morals, and they may or
may not be judged by a higher court at a much later stage in our lives,
but they are not easily convertible in a temporal, secular society that
has to deal with the immediate issues of the day. Our ancient liberties
are a crucial way for us to defend ourselves against arbitrary
government, and our constitutional settlement has been a great
protector of those rights, in spite of the ease with which our
constitution can be changed. Indeed, it is a greater protector of those
rights than exists in all those countries with careful constitutions.
Let us take the example of the arrangements at Guantanamo Bay, which
the US Government have managed to say are constitutional. If a
Government can find in their detailed constitution a legitimate way of
doing something that is in fact outrageous, they can do that because
they can say they are following the letter of the law. In our nation,
however, we are always following the spirit of the unwritten
constitution, which politicians have to abide by. We cannot get away
with doing something outrageous by claiming to the electorate that we
are following the letter of the
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000267" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0001.htm#13030165000267"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T11:56:45"></hs_TimeCode>The

We have introduced measures of an incredibly arbitrary and unjust

own judges. They replaced measures that were actually much fairer, in
that, under an Act of the British Parliament, a foreigner living in
this country who we did not want to live here could either leave or
stay in prison. That seemed to me to be a perfectly reasonable thing

It was one of the areas in which the Conservatives and the Liberal

in opposing it. When we in Britain are in a minority opposing a
judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, we do not feel that
that there is such legitimacy or that the majority that has overruled
us has a proper authority to do so. When our courts come out with a
judgment that does not relate to human rights, we may rail against it
and be cross about it, but we accept it as legitimate. When Parliament
passes Acts that we as individuals do not like or that minorities

to the European people, “We created the European Court of Human
Rights 60 years ago, and we—Conservative and Labour
Governments—spent a long time saying that it was a great force
for civilisation and progress. We sent some of our most distinguished
barristers and judges to the Court. We celebrated its judgments. We
used it to put pressure on eastern Europe and Russia. But now we have
decided that it was all a terrible mistake. We will leave, and we will
encourage other countries to leave as well. The whole European Court
system can collapse, and the consequences for our commitment to human
rights, and our attitudes towards eastern and central Europe and
Russia, can take their own course.” Is that a rough version of
what he would say?</hs_Para>

celebrated very strongly the European Court’s rulings on the
issue of habeas corpus, of which he is, rightly, so proud. We took
enormous credit for the fact that the European Court introduced
elements of habeas corpus, the notion of no detention without trial,
and the prohibition on torture, which has transformed the political
economy and human rights of southern Europe. We were immensely proud of
that, and it was part of our foreign policy and our contribution to our
own security. Are we now moving away from all of that, or are we saying

other countries cannot remain part of it. The key reason why it is so

England and Wales, we have, under the common law, the right to do
anything that is not specifically proscribed by law. That is a very
different system from the continental system, under which people have
the right to do what they are allowed to do. For a European system,
therefore, a detailed list of rights setting out what people can do is
needed, whereas here people only lose rights when Parliament, through
its democratic process, has decided that they need to be taken away in
the interests of the state. That might be someone’s right to
liberty for having committed a crime, or it might be their right to
vote because they have committed a crime and lost their liberty, but
those decisions are made under the common law by Parliament. It is not
a question of having a list of rights defining what people can do and
then assuming anything not on that list is not allowed. Our system of
rights, in common with that of the Americans, produces a much freer and
better system—which protects ancient liberties, which I hold
very dear—than a system of specific rights, where anyone who
comes into contact with them may be provided with a judgment, as
opposed to being free to do anything that is not specifically not
allowed.</hs_Para>

am, of course, in favour of some aspects of the convention. I do not
want us to pull out of it and then start torturing people, but it is
worth bearing in mind why the common law did not have torture, and how
our system developed without torture whereas the continental system
developed with torture. It all goes back to 1215, when, interestingly,
we get Magna Carta and they have the fourth Lateran Council, which
states that trial by ordeal cannot be supervised by the Church, and
because the Church cannot supervise it, it cannot be the will of God,
and therefore in a continental system someone can only be found guilty
if a confession is extracted. Hence, for very good reasons—for
moral reasons—the fourth Lateran Council gets rid of trial by
ordeal, and the law of unintended consequences means it results
in  
<?notus-xml column=612?>torture being routine in the continental judicial system. By chance and
good fortune, at the same time, because the barons have come up against
the King, we get the rights of liberty preserved and the continuation
of the development of the jury system as a means of getting to truth,
while also dropping the right to trial by ordeal because then, in
pre-Reformation times, we were still tied up to the doctrines of Rome.
That demonstrates that our systems diverged very sharply. Of course
people living under a system in which torture forms an instrumental
part need rights to be defined more carefully, and they have not had
them before, so they needed them to be
imposed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T12:13:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000292" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0001.htm#13030165000292"><B><Member ContinuationText="Rory Stewart" PimsId="5667" UID="13030165000753" xid="1225" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0001.htm#13030165000753">Rory

hon. Friend spoke very well about the notion that deeply rooted in
Magna Carta is a British immunity to any of these temptations. The
problem, however, is that we are facing very difficult kinds of
challenges today. It is very difficult to believe that the kinds of
mechanisms my hon. Friend is talking about, which are primarily to do
with the expression of a Back-Bencher’s opinions in the House of
Commons and elections to this place, can have a fundamental effect on
issues such as predator drones. How would he deal with the question of
predator drone assassinations? How would he explain how British tacit
participation in and knowledge of assassination by predator drones has
continued for three years without this Parliament touching on it at all
and, as far as I can see in my junior position as a new Member of
Parliament, without having any intention of touching on it in the next
few years? In the absence of any code of rights—in the absence
of anything to which one can appeal in order to protect

Rees-Mogg:</Member></B> That is essentially a matter of politics and
the doctrine of the just war. If we are involving ourselves in predator
drone strikes, we must ask ourselves whether the three criteria of a
just war are met. Is there sufficient cause? Are we a legitimate
authority? Is there is a reasonable prospect of success? It is for the
Government to make that case and if they cannot do so, Parliament will
ultimately have to decide. However, I would certainly not put the
safety of the nation in the hands of a bunch of judges
overseas—that is the worst possible example for my hon. Friend
to use, even though I am sympathetic to his basic point that using
drones is not something with which the British should be involved. The
decision on that—the decision on our own national

liberties and freedoms of our citizens have been undermined. We do not
need an overseas court to do that. Indeed, to the extent that an

mind is taken back to the run-up to the last general election, when I
detected two common themes that were brought up on the doorsteps, in
street surgeries and when I chatted to people on the phone. I am not
saying this to be directly critical of the previous Administration;
this is just a fact and how I found it. First, people were concerned
about what has been described as the “something for
nothing” culture. I will not go down that avenue, because it has
nothing to do with today’s proceedings. Secondly, they were
concerned about the whole arena of human rights and the way they had
been enforced in the years following the passage of the Human Rights
Act. There was a feeling that we had somehow been dragged down a road
that meant that criminals—I will hopefully have an opportunity
to explore this in more detail later—are the one group in
society who have the time to analyse in depth the detailed provisions
of human rights legislation. That group, spurred on by lawyers, seem to
have adopted the whole field as a lucrative source of income while
incarcerated in one of Her Majesty’s prisons. That, above all,
is what has caused my constituents, at least, to feel that somehow the
system is letting them down. To put it in a nutshell, that is bringing
the whole field of human rights into
disrepute.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-01?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_01_PT_1/4FCB52C70BF39A27DEA8370AB932F6822B8A9230" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="1 March 2013">Friday

is nevertheless absolutely a step in the right direction. In common
with my constituents, I am far from satisfied that the current position
is acceptable, and what the Bill proposes would be far preferable. It

intervention, because he hits the nail on the head. Part of the problem
with the whole arena of human rights legislation is that, as the years
have passed, particularly as the process has speeded up since 1998, we
have ended up in a situation where because of judicial activism there
is almost no end to the triviality of the cases that are being brought
before the Court. I have some figures on that to which I may refer

also behind the iron curtain. My right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor
said in an article in, I think, <I>The Daily Telegraph</I> before
Christmas that anyone who is concerned about human rights should be
aware of what Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote in his portrayals of the
brutality of the Soviet gulags under Stalin and his successors. Local
Communist party members were sent to labour camps without trial for
crimes as trivial as being the first to stop applauding at the end of a
meeting. Peasant farmers were driven off their land and literally
dumped at the end of a railway line in the heart of Siberia and left to
fend for themselves or die. People were tortured to death in the

signed in Rome back in 1950. It set out the fundamental rights regarded
as the absolute basis for a democratic nation at the time, such as the
right to life, the right not to be tortured and the right to a fair

lawyers who appear to do very little else but engage themselves in

taxpayers’ expense, thanks to the availability of legal aid. I
would be interested to know—perhaps the Minister will be able to
tell us this—how many of the claims relating to human rights
legislation that go through the courts are funded privately. I venture
to submit that there are very few indeed and suspect that the majority
are funded through legal aid, a no win, no fee agreement, or charity

fact, it is probably a triple whammy, because as well as paying the
legal aid bill and any damages awarded, we also have to pay the costs
of those Government lawyers and civil servants who defend the case. As

the House is aware, that was not the only case to hit the headlines. A
case with an even more substantial effect, certainly on proceedings in
this place, was that of Hirst, which was, in effect, the leading case
on prisoner voting rights. In 1979, John Hirst used an axe to kill his
landlady in her own home. In the following year he was convicted of
manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and sentenced
to life imprisonment with a tariff of 15 years, after which he could be
released on licence. In fact, he was not released until May 2004
because of concerns that he might present a danger to the public; for
example, he was found guilty of an offence under prison rules when, in
1998, he slammed a van door against a female prisoner
officer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T12:56:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000335" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000335">Mr
Hirst used his time in prison to teach himself law. He became a student
of human rights legislation and a serial litigant against the
authorities. There is no time this morning to go into his various
cases, but suffice it to say that in one of them the court ordered that
the Government pay Hirst £1,000 in damages and a further
£7,500 in costs. That was before what we might call his cause
célèbre—Hirst <I>v.</I> United Kingdom (No.

is illuminating to consider how Hirst built on the previous
Mathieu-Mohin case. It shows how rights are developed incrementally,
case by case, salami-slicing common sense and gradually moving away
from what most people would think article 3—in this

prisoner voting, the Court ruled that this issue had not been
considered here. I submit that it was considered in section 3 of the
Representation of the People Act 1983. It may not have been debated
specifically—I was not here at the time—but presumably
that was because both sides of the House took it for granted that
prisoners would not have the vote. That was accepted by the whole

will not detain the House for much longer on the prisoner voting case,
but it strikes at the heart of the issue. The Court is, in effect,
saying that this House cannot decide for itself what to do and who it
can allow to vote in our elections, and that somehow people such as
Hirst, a convicted axe killer, should be allowed to vote and decide who
has the right to sit in this Chamber. Most of my constituents would
say, without hesitation or doubt, that that cannot be right, and it is
because of such cases that it is right for us to consider the Bill

problem with the European Court of Human Rights is that 47
nations—it is not the same as the European Union, which has 27
members, shortly to be 28—have signed up the European convention
on human rights. With a population of some 800 million, any one of whom
can choose to bring a case at any time, it is unsurprising that an
avalanche of cases has been brought before the Court. The evidence of
the Court’s statistics calls into question how genuine some of
those cases are. I looked briefly at the Court’s website, which
lists of what it calls “rule 39 requests” granted in the
past five years for all 47 countries. That gives us an idea of how many
countries out of the 47 did not have any cases against them at all. One
would have thought that, if the convention were really dealing with
serious breaches of human rights, the odd case might be brought before
the Court from somewhere in Europe, bearing in mind that all the
countries concerned are democracies that operate under the rule of law.
One might expect the odd case, here or there, to be brought before the
Court.</hs_Para>

fact, only Andorra and Montenegro had zeros beside their name on that
list. At the other end of the scale, the United Kingdom soared up to
the top with 
<?notus-xml column=621?>5,176 cases. Using that yardstick, one would assume that we had a worse
human rights record than any other country, but that makes no logical
sense. I believe that those figures are, in fact, attributable to the
assiduity of our human rights lawyers in bringing cases to the
attention of our courts and then taking them to appeal in Europe,
particularly since the passage of the 1998 Act, rather than
to any failing on the part of our Government or, to be fair, the last
Labour Government. Yet anyone glancing casually at those figures might
assume that those Governments had been going around inflicting
atrocities on people.</hs_Para>

was made earlier of the Brighton declaration, and I believe that the
Government have done good work in that regard. It was entirely right
that we should use our presidency of the Council to try to bring some
common sense to the system and to reform the way in which the Court
operates, but I am not sure that that endeavour has met with a great
deal of success. I looked at the latest figures available, which
represent a snapshot taken on 31 January this year. That makes them
quite up to date in terms of Government and international statistics.
They showed a total of 126, 850 outstanding applications to the Court,
including 3,250 from the United Kingdom. We were not top of that
particular chart; other countries had far higher numbers than us.
Russia, for example, had 27,450 pending cases. This demonstrates the
fact that, with 800 million people entitled to bring their cases before
the Court, there is a huge backlog.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Dover has done a wonderful job. Much more
could be said on this issue, and I fear that the time available today
does not enable us to do it proper justice in many respects. I would
have liked to deal with how we could withdraw from the European Court

my hon. Friend’s Bill, which has much to commend it, were to
become law, all we would be doing—unless we withdraw from the
convention, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:10:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley said in an intervention some time ago—is
creating another hurdle. As long as we are signed up and as long as
people have the ability to go to Strasbourg, we will not solve the
problem. Equally, as long as we are members of the European Union and
as long as it has the desire to sign up to the European convention of
human rights and to build on what it calls fundamental rights under the
European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, which we briefly
discussed here a few days ago—and make no bones about it, this
is where the leadership of the EU would like to go—we will not,
frankly, solve this problem.</hs_Para>

me finish with two points. First, in yesterday’s by-election,
the majority of votes were cast, if not for parties, for candidates who
believe as I do that we would be better off out of the European Union.
Part of the reasoning is that we would free ourselves from the risk of
being tied in to the European convention on human rights by the back
door that would result from 
<?notus-xml column=622?>our membership of the EU. Finally, one problem with having this debate
today is that it is the final Friday for private Members’
business in this Session. I only wish that this Bill had been able to
be considered on the first and not the last Friday, so that it would
genuinely have stood a chance of having further consideration in

article 3 rights might be affected—not, of course, because of
his argument or his oratory, but because I felt that we had been here
before. We have, in fact, been here before, as recently as last
December, when the hon. Member for South Norfolk (Mr Bacon) presented a
ten-minute rule Bill that proposed the abolition, or repeal, of the
Human Rights Act. It was defeated by, I believe, 196 votes to 72.

that occasion—it was not the only occasion on which the House
has discussed these matters—because I suspect that,
notwithstanding the considerable effort that has gone into this Bill,
it was born of frustration rather than a belief that it would ever
reach the statute book. Under the coalition Government, there have been
two consultations and a commission report. I think it is
accepted on all sides that the resolution of the issue that the
commission was set to consider is going nowhere, certainly during the
current Parliament. That is clearly frustrating for some Conservative
Members, but perhaps it is not surprising, given that in their
respective manifestos one of the coalition parties promised to replace
the Human Rights Act and the other promised to protect it. That is one
of the clearest contradictions between the

do not know. The point is that, as was made pretty clear by the right
hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke)—the former

asked to pronounce on the subject, nothing will happen during the
current Parliament. He is a supporter of the Human Rights Act. Indeed,

members of all parties today, apart from the four who have spoken so

fair to say that it was under Labour Governments that the principal
advances were made, albeit with the support and encouragement of senior
members of the Conservative party—none more senior than Winston
Churchill, who, as early as 1943, proposed the foundation of the
Council of Europe, and none more so than David Maxwell Fyfe, who was in
large part the drafter of the convention. Although it came into effect
in 1950, it was not until the late 1960s that British citizens had the
right to go to the European Court, and not until the enactment of the
Human Rights Act that human rights issues could be adjudicated in the
British courts. All of that seems to me to be sensible progress,
undertaken in a considered way that even, perhaps,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:19:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North East Somerset would approve of, as it took us some 40 or 50
years to decide how to address human rights. This has not been rushed
into; it has been considered over a long
period<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:19:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000358" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000358">The
whole purpose of the convention’s incorporation into English law
is to give direct access to British judges and British courts, rather
than matters having to be 
<?notus-xml column=624?>dealt with in Strasbourg. In fact, only about 10 judgments a year now
come from Strasbourg. We intended that British citizens should be able
to bring human rights cases to British courts in front of British
judges, and I think we achieved that in the Human Rights Act. The Act
enshrined in domestic law most of the rights contained in the
convention, and it also included two additional clauses to underline
the importance of freedom of conscience and religion and a free
press.</hs_Para>

Act was deliberately crafted to ensure British courts were not merely
an echo chamber of the European Court of Human Rights. It took the
rights of the convention but allowed our judges to interpret them as
they saw fit, meaning that while UK courts have to take account of
Strasbourg case law on cases relating to a convention right, they do
not have to incorporate it and can depart from it where appropriate.
That was made explicit by the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, when
he said domestic courts must be allowed “flexibility and
discretion” in developing human rights law, which is precisely
what the Human Rights Act gives.</hs_Para>

is for those reasons that we find it perplexing that Government Members
find incorporation of the convention and having a British Human Rights
Act to be less acceptable than the previous situation. As has been
said, there are absolute rights, limited rights and qualified rights.
Crucially, the Human Rights Act maintains parliamentary sovereignty and
the supremacy of Parliament as the only law-making authority. If a
British court finds that our legislation does not comply with the Human
Rights Act, it cannot use the Act to force Parliament to change the
law. Instead it will issue what is known as a declaration of
incompatibility, and it will then be up to Parliament and Parliament
alone to decide the best way to respond. It may choose not to respond
at all. There are sufficient safeguards in respect of the margin of
appreciation and other measures to permit the Act to function in the
organic way

is true that there are problems with the exercise of jurisdiction by
the European Court of Human Rights, and that it is an unwieldy body

hear many stories—often apocryphal, exaggerated or only partly

vulnerable people in respect of domestic violence, disability, mental

discrimination, maintaining a private life and maintaining the right to
protest. There have been landmark cases in all those areas. I will not
go through them case by case, as they are a matter of public record. It
remains the fact that this is a valuable addition to English law. It is
not an alien creature. It is an important check on Executive and state
power<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:24:07"></hs_TimeCode> in the

the right to fair

ways to expand and extend the rights of individual citizens, and that
is exactly what the Human Rights Act did. As I said, Labour Members are
extremely proud of that legislation. We do not say that it cannot be
improved, but we do say it is wrong-headed and misconceived to think
that by repealing the Act and trying to invent something in a unique
way, separate from that which has been established, primarily through
the agency of British lawyers and British politicians, over a period of
60 years, we are going to get a better deal. That is a fantasy on the
part of some Government Members. They are not going to get their way in
this Parliament and I hope that they will not get their way in any

I start by congratulating
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:25:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke), not only on the powerful case
he made in his introductory speech and on choosing such a central and
serious issue for his private Member’s Bill, but on the depth of
the Bill itself.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:26:14"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bury North (Mr Nuttall) made the point that
this Bill is different from some of those debated here on a Friday
morning, in that a huge amount of thought has clearly gone into the
detail. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:26:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Dover is to be congratulated on that and on
framing his speech in the way that he did. It was instructive that his
speech and this Bill provoked the speech made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:26:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart) and the modern
version of a Socratic dialogue between him and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:26:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg). A Friday morning
when this House is forced to confront the difference between
deontological and utilitarian responses to the moral consequences of
our actions cannot be described as a Friday morning wasted. I think we
all felt better educated and informed at the end of that dialogue, and
that was even before
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:27:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North East Somerset added to the philosophical wisdom we
had from my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:27:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

Bill would make significant changes to the existing UK human rights
framework to attempt to address a number of concerns that have been
expressed throughout this debate. Those changes include: repealing the
Human Rights Act; having the UK still bound by the European convention
on human rights but with the convention no longer forming part of the
UK legal system; and the creation of a new set of UK rights, which add
to and alter the existing rights in the European convention. That
would, for example, remove the possibility of using the right to family
life as a means to avoid
deportation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000366" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000366">It

under orders. It is another unusual experience in this House to find
someone under orders to speak for less time than they would like rather
than for more, which is the normal Whips’ instruction, in my

Government remain committed to the European convention on human rights
and to ensuring that those rights continue to be enshrined in UK
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000367" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000367">However,
we are also closely involved in the process of reform of the Strasbourg
Court and we must ensure that it can focus more quickly on the cases
that need its attention. I hope that there is agreement across the
House on the need to reform the Court, and that the Brighton
declaration, which I shall come to later in my speech, is testament to
our hard-won efforts in realising the Government’s pledge to
reform that Court. We must recognise that much more needs to be done,
however. The achievement of the previous Lord Chancellor,

agree with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:30:36"></hs_TimeCode> my
hon. Friend the Member for Dover that one of the biggest problems is
the misrepresentation of the Human Rights Act and public bodies
misapplying the concept of human rights or using them as an excuse for
bad decisions. That has been at the root of many of the problems in
this country with judgments of the Court, some of which have been
brought up in the course of the debate and with which I shall deal
later.</hs_Para>

other main changes that the Bill would make include ensuring that
legislation passed by Parliament can only be changed by Parliament and
setting out in statute a list of individual responsibilities that would
not impose direct legal obligations on individuals but would be taken
into account when courts were considering the application of the new UK
human rights. The issues raised by the Bill inevitably attract a wide
range of views, although the House should note that most of the views
expressed in the debate were supportive of my hon. Friend, and the
debate has been helpful in airing them.</hs_Para>

coalition’s programme for government was clear about the
importance we as a Government attach to the question of civil
liberties. Human rights are an essential element of any wider
consideration of civil liberties in a modem democratic society. My
ambition in the course of the debate, which will clearly go on for a
number of years and, conceivably, into future Parliaments, is to
reclaim human rights from the position of being almost a
“boo” phrase. There is something absurd about a situation
in which people can regard human rights and support for them from
Parliament or the courts as leading to bad consequences. Something has
gone seriously wrong when we reach that stage and we need to reclaim
human rights so that they are, as they ought to be, the motherhood and
apple pie of politics. There is no reason for anyone to object to human
rights being applied to as many societies as possible throughout the
world. Nevertheless, we are where we are and the legislative framework
for human rights in the United Kingdom is a subject on which there are
strongly held and often conflicting opinions.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:35:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Dover in his introductory speech. He explained that one
of the 10 pillars of his Bill is that freedom of thought, conscience
and religion should be protected to a greater extent than they
currently are. He further explained that this greater protection is
necessary because of the attitude to religion and belief. I am sure
many will agree with him on that. He may be aware that the Strasbourg
Court recently gave judgment in four cases concerning article
9—the article that deals with freedom of thought, conscience and
religion—and that in each of those four cases the applicant was
Christian.</hs_Para>

outcome of those cases confirmed that, for example, our law allows
people to wear crosses at work, and that British employers are
generally very good at being reasonable in accommodating
people’s religious beliefs. We welcome any reasonable steps that
employers can take to accommodate the wishes of their Christian
employees or of those who hold a different religion or belief. Under
the Equality Act 2010, employees of all religions and belief are
protected against discrimination. Employers can lawfully stop their
employees wearing jewellery, including a religious symbol, at work only
if they can show that their policy does not disadvantage people
belonging to a particular religion or belief or, if it does, that it is
a proportionate means of achieving a

hon. Friend the Member for Dover also raised a point of
debate—one of continuing importance—on the balance
between rights and responsibilities, arguing that the possession of
rights must inevitably entail some responsibilities. The commission had
points to make on that as well. It concluded that rights should not be
made conditional on the exercise of responsibilities. It concluded that
a Bill of Rights may allow the courts, when awarding damages, to take
into account the conduct of the applicant, but my hon. Friend’s
Bill would go further in incorporating the notion of responsibilities
in 
<?notus-xml column=629?>determining whether a right has been breached. It concluded that any
provision on responsibilities should only be
declaratory.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000385" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000385"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:42:07"></hs_TimeCode>I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:41:46"></hs_TimeCode>

the Member for Bury North made in his thoughtful speech. He said that
the Brighton declaration had not been successful, but I must part
company from him on that, because I think that the declaration is a
substantial package of welcome reforms. Their implementation is being
negotiated in Strasbourg. No changes have yet been made to the text of
the convention, but once the reforms are realised we expect their net
effect to be that more cases will be resolved at a national level and
fewer will go to Strasbourg. The European Court will be able to focus
on the more important cases, which is what it was originally set up to
do, and, equally importantly, to do so more
quickly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000386" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000386">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:41:46"></hs_TimeCode>
am conscious that in previous debates on the subject, particularly
those relating to individual cases, and often those involving
extradition, including from this country to the United States, Members
on both sides of the House have expressed understandable frustration
about the delays in the legal process. That is because British citizens
have been kept in British jails for many years not because of delays in
the British legal process—of course, there are also delays in
that process—but specifically because of delays in the European
Court. The measures that will follow the Brighton declaration, which I
think will lead in the long run to cases appearing before the Court
more rapidly and, therefore, more rapid decision making, will have a
direct effect on individual human rights, because they will mean people
spending less time in

hon. Friend also made the point about rule 39 applications about the

in this regard. Under rule 39 of the Strasbourg Court, the Court may,
on application, advise a stay of deportation, for example. This is
about indications, not violations per se, and the Court has become
stricter about granting such requests. As a result, fewer than one in
20 requests made for interim measures against the UK are now granted.
In real numbers, that is only about 30 or 40 requests a year.</hs_Para>

would recognise that the strength of feeling in this country is clear,
and we have been clear in our view that it should be a matter for
national Parliaments to decide. The Government are under a legal
obligation to bring forward legislation. We have therefore published a
draft Bill that presents a range of options, including banning
prisoners sentenced to four years or more from voting, banning
prisoners

suspect that a Committee considering such legal matters would benefit
from having a mix of legal experts and people who are not legal experts
but are capable of asking simple but important questions. The interplay
between legal expertise and the lack of legal expertise can often
result in good and practical legislation. As a final thought on this, I

tribunals, as I have said, to take into account rulings from Strasbourg
when determining a question that has arisen in connection with a
convention right. Clause 2(1)(a) to (c) lists a wider range of sources

consideration needs to be given to whether the courts need to be
conferred a discretion in legislation in order to take into account the
sources listed in clause 2. Courts already cite judgments from other

There is a history in our courts of granting damages that are entirely
run-away. The one area in which most of us can agree with the European
Court of Human Rights is in its more level-headed and sanguine awards
of damages, because it is taxpayers who have to foot the bill. That is
the one area where the jurisprudence of the European Court holds some
water<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T13:58:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000411" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000411"><B><Member ContinuationText="Damian Green" PimsId="3546" UID="13030165000789" xid="236" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000789">Damian

struck that the Strasbourg Court had a more sensible

wish to say a bit more about what will happen now because, as I have
said, a twin-track approach is needed and we must know what will happen
during the rest of this Parliament. As several hon. Members have said,
the United Kingdom played a pivotal role in shaping the original human
rights framework in which the rights were, literally, fundamental.
Indeed, then hon. Members from across the House, including David
Maxwell Fyfe and Hartley Shawcross, were architects of what was at the
time a document that everyone in Britain was very proud of.</hs_Para>

convention was designed to address terrible abuses of human rights in a
fractured continent.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:01:56"></hs_TimeCode> have all read
in history books about the state of post-war Europe, and it is
important to put this debate into an historical context. Today we talk
about European rows and problems, great though they are, but just 70
years ago—it is not ancient history—the continent was
completely fractured. We now have a Europe in which we can argue about
how human rights are best enforced, rather than a Europe in which we
have to enforce basic human rights. The situation is immeasurably
better now than it was, and that change has taken place during our
lifetimes. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:02:05"></hs_TimeCode>
have come a long way from the time when the convention was absolutely
necessary, but not everything has changed and our concern
then—as now—was to give those who most needed protection
from the excesses of state power a clear understanding of the rights
and remedies available to them. That means that the human rights
framework must be accessible and proportionate in its
application.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030165000417" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000417">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:03:20"></hs_TimeCode>
convention should be used to defend the most vulnerable, but because of
the way some articles in the convention have been interpreted by the
Court, people do not feel that that basic fairness is being applied any
more. Indeed, the desire to ensure that the mechanisms in place to
protect the most vulnerable exist for that reason and no other was at
the heart of the programme of reform that turned into the Brighton
declaration, just as it is at the heart of our calls now for further
reform of the Court of Human Rights.</hs_Para>

Court is important for the protection of human rights from Iceland to
Turkey, but as I have said it faces a huge backlog of nearly 130,000
applications. Some of those may include examples of the type of
fundamental abuses that Maxwell Fyfe and others sought to remedy back
in 1950 and in a very different world. However, if the Court is to
retain its legitimacy—this point has rightly been raised in the
debate—it must focus on its core functions. The UK helped draft
the convention and there is no controversy about its values,
which  
<?notus-xml column=634?>everyone still supports, even those most sceptical about the value of
the Court. Many more people are extremely sceptical about the

repeated too often that the convention has contributed to important
changes for the good in many countries across Europe; for example, the
decriminalisation in many countries of homosexuality, or the
recognition in former Soviet countries of religious freedom. Given our
discussions today, and the frequent public discussions, about the
necessity of protecting people’s capacity to express their
religious views, it is worth remembering that in other countries the
convention has been extremely helpful in allowing people to express
their basic
freedoms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:05:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000420" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000420">There
are other examples. Legal systems and police behaviour have been

sometimes
interpreted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000421" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000421">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:05:54"></hs_TimeCode>
concerns about the Court bring us back to its fundamental role; it is
supposed to focus on the most egregious violations of human rights
throughout Europe. We might think that the UK would rarely, if ever, be
found in breach, and I am happy to say that is the general situation.
Last year, the Strasbourg Court ruled against the UK in only 10
instances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:06:11"></hs_TimeCode>. The
underlying question we need to consider is whether those cases, and the
apparent breaches, were of a magnitude that the founders of the
convention would recognise. We have to ask ourselves what we expect of
the Court today and how we can help to restore its
legitimacy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:06:39"></hs_TimeCode>.

now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000422" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000422">We
would like the Court to have the following priorities, particularly
after the Brighton declaration. First, it should not involve itself in
cases that national courts have already decided properly. In this
country, one would expect that to be so more often than not. Secondly,
the Court should focus its resources on the most deserving cases; on
the surface, a backlog of nearly 130,000 suggests that is not
happening<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:07:09"></hs_TimeCode>.
Thirdly, the Court should not delve into our own legislation without
very good reason. The margin of appreciation must be observed.
Fourthly, judges adjudicating serious cases must be of the highest
quality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:07:28"></hs_TimeCode>. Each of
those priorities would involve a big programme of reform for the Court,

the central question of whether there should be a UK Bill of Rights, a
majority of the commission concluded that there is a strong argument in
favour. That was on the basis that any such Bill would incorporate and
build on all the United Kingdom’s existing obligations under the
European convention on human rights, and that it would provide no less
protection than is contained currently both in the Human Rights Act and
in the devolution settlements. This was in line with the
Commission’s terms of

the majority who favoured a Bill of Rights felt that any new Bill could
usefully define the scope of some rights more clearly and adjust their

identified issues that would need careful consideration before a Bill
of Rights was introduced. Given the ongoing human rights debate, it is

concept of responsibilities as well as rights in any new legislative
framework<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:11:05"></hs_TimeCode>. The

should like to begin by commenting on the Minister’s typically
generous and reasonable speech. He talked about the universality of
human rights, and about how we must concentrate on defending the most
vulnerable people in our society. In relation to the Commission on a
Bill of Rights, he argued that the time was not now right for this

being expressed in Scotland and those in the rest of the United Kingdom

Brighton declaration is being carried forward by means of draft
protocol 15 to the European convention on human rights. From my
perspective, one of the most important parts of that draft protocol
will be its amendment to the convention’s preamble, emphasising
the importance of having a system that introduces proportionality as
well as subsidiarity into the Court’s decisions. But if I look
at the opinion of the European Court of Human Rights on draft protocol
15, I detect a lack of enthusiasm for the part of the protocol that
will mean changing the wording of the preamble. I hope I am not being
unduly sceptical in wondering how keen the Court is on the principle of
emphasising the subsidiarity and the doctrine of the margin of
appreciation, as reflected in the outcome of the Brighton
conference.</hs_Para>

that context, some people believe—I have heard judges of the
Court themselves expressing this opinion—that it does not make a
ha’porth of difference what is in the preamble, as it is only
the actual text of the treaty that makes a difference. That reminds me
of the importance of how these treaties are interpreted. One problem at
the moment is that the treaties are being interpreted by the Court in a
way that it is out of tune with the specific wording in the Vienna
convention, which says that there should be a strict interpretation of
treaties rather than allowing them to be interpreted in an expansive
way over time.</hs_Para>

way to change the wording of a treaty, as is now being proposed, is to
introduce a protocol to that treaty. The way to introduce a requirement
that there should be prisoner voting would be to amend article 3 of
protocol 1 rather than to try to do it by the back door by using
judicial legislation—effectively what the Court has been doing.
This is where the great frustration arises  
<?notus-xml column=639?>among the public when they see human rights that they all believe
in—the right to life, the right not to be tortured and so
forth—losing direction under the Court. The universality of
human rights is important, as reflected in the debate between two Old
Etonian Members earlier. We should be talking about the universal
declaration of human rights, rather than trying to use the European
convention and the EU legislation that incorporates it as a means of
trying to impose on individual sovereign Governments and Parliaments a
set of rules that do not accord with the culture of those individual
countries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000456" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000456">Let

in the next Session of Parliament, either my hon. Friend or a colleague
who is successful in the ballot will present the Bill
again—perhaps taking into account some of the points made by the
Minister—so that by the time of the next general election,
Conservative Members are clear about where we want to go and what
legislative change we want to make. We shall then be able to respond to
public concern, rather than saying that it is far too early to do

McDonagh</B> (Mitcham and Morden) (Lab):</Member> Like many Members, I
have a lot of concerns about what is going on in the NHS at present. My
local NHS has to save £370 million a year and two out of five of
our general hospitals are about to lose both their accident and
emergency and maternity units. I am sure I will want to raise my
concerns about that in the future. The long-promised reopening of
Mitcham’s local Wilson hospital as a local care centre has still
not happened, even though it is in the Merton ward with the lowest life
expectancy, while the redevelopment of the Nelson as a local care
hospital in neighbouring Wimbledon, one of the wealthiest places in
south-west London, is under way. Also, after one of the biggest
top-down reorganisations in NHS history, GPs are being forced to become
managers rather than clinicians, so I think it is fair to say I have a
lot of concerns.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030165000488" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000488">In the case I
am raising today, however, the problem is much more fundamental. It is
about the price of a man’s life. Is £5,000 too much to
pay to keep someone going? It is also about a controversial drug and
the terrible way the NHS deals with patients who slip between the gaps.
In a small way, it is about how NHS managers avoid their
responsibilities and ignore elected representatives such as me. But
most of all it is about my constituent, Mr Liakuat Aziz, and whether he
should be allowed to have the treatment he desperately
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:34:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000489" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000489">Mr
Aziz is 61 and lives in lower Morden. In December, he came to my advice
surgery. He is a nice man who has worked hard, and he has a family. He
has been through a lot, and just at the point he thought he was making
progress, he has hit a brick wall. His story touched me straight away.
Mr Aziz explained that he had had numerous long-term health conditions,
although when I saw him he seemed well. In 1995 he had a coronary
artery bypass graft. After the operation, he had numerous setbacks and
developed severe lung injuries. He had a tracheostomy and was found to
have significant restrictive lung disease. He also suffers with
ischaemic heart disease and underlying emphysema. He underwent right
heart catheterisation, and he had significant pulmonary
hypertension<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:35:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000490" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000490">Fortunately,
Mr Aziz was placed under the care of some amazing doctors. In
particular, he is being treated by Dr Stephen Brecker, Dr Phil Marino
and by one of the leading practitioners in this field, Professor
Brendan Madden, at the St George’s and Royal Brompton
hospitals’ joint pulmonary hypertension clinic. Despite all that
treatment, Mr Aziz was still in a very precarious condition, with
severe pulmonary hypertension group 2 and group 3 disease.
In addition, he had long-term lung fibrosis from cardiac surgery,
ischaemic cardiomyopathy and a biventricular implantable cardiac
defibrillator in place—that is not very easy to say, let to
alone live with. By January 2011, his condition had
worsened. He suffered from breathlessness and he could not get around.
His doctors decided to try a new
treatment—sildenafil.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000491" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000491">To
you and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, the word “sildenafil” might
not mean very much, but we have probably heard of its other
name—Viagra. Most people think of Viagra 
<?notus-xml column=643?>as a fun drug or as a relatively trivial treatment for erectile
dysfunction. I do not want to go into the rights and wrongs or the
merits of Viagra today. It is well known as a sex aid, but what a lot
of people do not know is that Viagra is also a very effective treatment
for pulmonary hypertension. It is not the only treatment, and for many
patients it will not be suitable or cost-effective, but given Mr
Aziz’s numerous lung and heart conditions his doctors thought
that sildenafil was a solution. Indeed, numerous medical studies have
shown that it has a role to
play.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030165000492" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000492">Professor
Madden himself conducted one such study in 2006, with Allenby, Loke and
Sheth. After looking at the evidence from a group of patients, they
concluded:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13030165000574" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/debtext/130301-0002.htm#13030165000574">“Sildenafil

patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Every one of their

Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology, and the European
Respiratory Society, endorsed by the International Society for Heart

Viagra. He needs it not for recreational purposes, but to stay alive.
My local NHS would rather let him suffer than allow him the only drug
that works on him. It would cost thousands of pounds a day to look
after him in hospital, but they will not provide £5,000 to keep
him out. They have behaved appallingly to him and treated me and my

life-saver. The medical consensus is clear that in exceptional cases,

hon. Lady will know that PCTs have been around for some time. One of
the reasons why the Government were so keen to introduce the Health and
Social Care Act 2012 was to abolish PCTs and have exactly these sorts
of commissioning decisions, which have frustrated so many Members on
both sides of the Chamber, made by those best placed to make them:
clinicians, effectively through GP-led clinical commissioning groups.

hon. Lady started her speech with a political point, so I will make a
political point as well. We wanted to get rid of PCTs because too often
they are overly bureaucratic and they are certainly not accountable. It
was our desire to change that by taking the decisions away from
bureaucrats and putting them back in the hands of clinicians. That was
one of the fundamental underlying reasons why we were so keen to get
the Act through this place and on to the statute book. Far from
damaging the NHS, and far from denying patients medications and,
perhaps most importantly, explanations, the Act will ensure that these
types of problems no longer exist.</hs_Para>

there is a chance that they may be watching this debate. If so, no

not, then frankly they should be, if the hon. Lady is accurate in her
description. I think that she must be, because I too have a copy of the

that person with care and compassion. That means that they should sit

is important to explain that National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence provides the NHS with evidence-based guidance on the
clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of drugs and other
technologies. NICE, as an independent body, makes the decisions on
whether a particular drug has a clinical or cost-effectiveness basis on
which it should be prescribed. Where treatments have been positively
appraised by NICE, PCTs are legally obliged to provide funding for
them. However,
NICE<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:59:23"></hs_TimeCode> has not
issued any guidance to the NHS on the use of sildenafil nitrate for the
treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-01T14:58:09"></hs_TimeCode> is the
problem. It is because NICE has not given that advice to the NHS that
the treatment is at the discretion of the PCT and we are in difficult
times. There were difficult times under the previous Administration.

of the clinical commissioning groups will lead, I hope, to a far better

accountable than primary care trusts have been. Every CCG will have a
representative on the upper-tier local authority’s health and

codes of practice provide important information to migrant workers and
their sponsoring employers. They set out which occupations are skilled
to the necessary level to qualify for tier 2 of the points-based
system, minimum appropriate rates of pay, and how employers should
carry out a resident labour market test to determine whether suitable
settled workers are available before they offer a job to a migrant
worker.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13030170000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/wmstext/130301m0001.htm#13030170000154">Last
year, the Government commissioned the Migration Advisory Committee
(MAC) to review the codes of practice. The MAC published a detailed
report on 17 October 2012. Today we are setting out the
Government’s response to the MAC’s recommendations. In
general we have accepted the MAC’s recommendations, although
there are some additional details which have resulted from developing
the proposals. Taken as a whole, the changes are intended to update the
system and make it more user-friendly, rather than significantly change
the policy.</hs_Para>

lists of skilled occupations, as advised by the MAC, we are updating
the codes of practice from the old SOC 2000 classification system to
the new SOC 2010 system. Transitional arrangements will ensure that no
migrant worker is unable to continue working in their current job as a
result of the
reclassification.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13030170000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/wmstext/130301m0001.htm#13030170000156">On
minimum salary requirements, we are updating the minimum appropriate
rates for each occupation in line with the MAC’s recommendations
and to reflect changes in pay for settled workers. We have accepted the
MAC’s recommendation that the minimum should generally be set at
the 25th percentile of wages in that occupation. We are introducing
alternative rates for new entrants. These will be set at the 10th
percentile of wages in each occupation. After three years the new
entrant—usually these will be those aged 25 or under—will
have to be paid at the experienced worker rate. In addition, we are
updating the minimum pay thresholds which exist across tier 2
(regardless of occupation) in line with wage inflation for settled
workers.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13030170000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/wmstext/130301m0001.htm#13030170000157">On
the resident labour market test, we are, in line with the MAC’s
recommendations, simplifying the current rules to give employers more
freedom to advertise in the media they think are most likely to be
successful for their sector. This will mean settled workers looking for
jobs in that sector will be better targeted and will have more
opportunities to apply for skilled jobs. We will still require most
jobs to be advertised via a Jobcentre Plus online service (or JobCentre
Online, for jobs based in Northern Ireland), but we will keep this
requirement under
review.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13030170000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/wmstext/130301m0001.htm#13030170000158">The
changes will be implemented on 6 April and we will lay changes to the
immigration rules nearer the time to bring them into effect. The Home
Office is publishing a statement of intent today, in order to give
employers and applicants as much time as possible to review the changes
we are making and prepare for them coming into effect. I am placing a

Javid:</Member></B> Air passenger duty (APD) is intended to be as
simple as possible to administer. For this reason the distance-based
banding within it generally reflects international aviation codes used
by the airline industry. These codes are based on national territories,
and as such it is straightforward to base APD on countries, using
capital cities as a proxy. In the case of Russia, codes do distinguish
between the Eastern and Western halves of the country, and the tax has
therefore been designed to incorporate
this.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030166000276" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/text/130301w0001.htm#13030166000276">Changes

a separate harbour

revision orders conflict with each other. In addition, following an
accident, consideration of the two harbour revision orders was deferred
while the Marine Accident Investigation Board investigated the

the jurisdiction of the harbour authorities. Since then the
consideration has had to be prioritised alongside other work and the

During construction of HS2 at Euston there will inevitably be some

disruption to services during construction is minimised and what

which Grade A is ‘no litter or refuse’ and Grade D is
‘heavily affected by litter and/or refuse with significant

maintained to Grade A level although it recognises that this level
cannot be maintained at all times. It also recognises that it may not
be practicable to remove all litter items from some softer or

Barker:</Member></B> The scientific evidence for man-made climate
change is considerable and continues to grow. Global near-surface
average temperatures have increased by about 0.8°C since 1900.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fourth
Assessment Report in 2007 concluded that it is very likely that
greenhouse gas emissions from human activity have caused most of the
warming we have experienced since the mid 20th century. Subsequent
peer-reviewed studies and assessments have provided further evidence of
the growing influence of human activities on climate, including for
example, the National Academies of Science 2010 report on Advancing the
Science of Climate Change<Sup>1</Sup>, the Stott et al 2010 review of
climate change from a regional perspective<Sup>2</Sup> and the Bulletin
of the American Meteorological Society's 2012 Special Report on extreme
events and their

global temperature record shows that long-term warming is continuing;
the last decade was the warmest in the instrumental record (since 1850)
and each of the last three decades have been significantly warmer than
the preceding one. The joint warmest individual years in the record
were 2005 and 2010. Over the past decade the rate of warming has been
less than in the preceding decades, however, such variations are to be
expected because of natural fluctuations within the climate system.
Over the same period other aspects of the climate system have shown
considerable change including for example: a dramatic decline in Arctic
sea-ice in summer; continuing global sea-level rise; continuing retreat
of most glaciers worldwide; and accumulation of heat in the world's
oceans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030166001186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/text/130301w0002.htm#13030166001186">There
have also been a number of detailed studies which have shown how the
likelihood of some extreme weather and climate events has been
increased due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, including,
for example, the Texas heat wave in 2011, unusual warmth in England in
the autumn of 2011, the UK floods in autumn 2000 and the European hot
summer in
2003.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030166001187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/text/130301w0002.htm#13030166001187">In
the absence of measures to significantly reduce global emissions of
greenhouse gases global temperatures are projected, as best estimates,
to increase by 1.8°C (for a low emissions scenario)
to 4.0°C (for high emissions) by late 21 century
(IPCC, 2007), leading to further ice loss and sea level rise and
increasing the frequency and intensity of storms, floods, droughts and
heat-waves. The risks of rapid and irreversible changes in parts of the
large-scale climate system are also expected to
increase.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030166001188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130301/text/130301w0002.htm#13030166001188">In

Green:</Member></B> Based on an examination of time spent on patrol
over the course of a two week period, officers in the West Midlands
spent 16% of their time on patrol in 2007-08 (the last year for which
data is available). The measure of patrol refers only to time when an
officer is patrolling but engaged in no other duty. Activity, such as
advice to a member of the public, carried out whilst on patrol is
recorded separately. Therefore, it can be misleading to look at this
element in isolation from other activities. Equivalent figures at
individual town or city level are not held centrally by the

with that for men in 2018. On the LFS the identification of
respondents' eligibility for the state pension is based on their age at
the time of interview. During the survey period for October to December

has developed a framework for measuring national well-being following a
six-month national debate. The framework consists of 10 areas or
'domains', including areas such as Health, Education and What we do;
and 40 headline indicators of well-being, for example, the unemployment
rate, satisfaction with our health, or levels of crime. These
indicators and others have been used to describe life in the UK, under

decision to select individuals for redundancy is based upon an
assessment against their performance, potential and wider employability

length of service of an individual, nor the pension scheme to which

proximity to pension point, or end of engagement, would stand to

‘Reducing cancer inequality: evidence/ progress and making it

had been linked to cancer registration data had at least one record of
their ethnicity in HES. Working with the NCEI, the National Cancer
Intelligence Network (NC1N) now routinely links ethnicity data to the
national cancer data and has used this information in a range of
analyses and reports including ‘Mortality from Prostate

the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another SHA/PCT

increase in the number of records where the PCT or SHA of residence was

HES out-patients figures are available from 2003-04 onwards. Changes to
the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of
improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier
years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity
(particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example,
changes in activity may be due to changes in the provision of

service patients for prescriptions are retained by dispensing
organisations, which include hospitals, community pharmacies,
dispensing general practitioners and appliance contractors. When
prescriptions are dispensed in settings other than hospitals the
retained charge is then offset against the payment made from primary
care trust budgets to the dispensing organisation (administered by the
NHS Business Services Authority). Therefore, while not technically
ring-fenced, the income raised from prescription charges is

managed through the Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme (PCRMP).
Since 2002, the PCRMP has been in place to ensure that men over 50
without symptoms of prostate cancer can have a prostate specific
antigen (PSA) test free on the national health service after careful
consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of PSA testing and
after a discussion with a general practitioner (GP). The patient
information sheets on PSA testing in the PCRMP packs make it clear that

the OFT's compliance review which is due to publish its final report
shortly. We are also strengthening OFT enforcement powers with a new
power to suspend a business' credit licence with immediate effect, or
on a date specified by the OFT. This will be used by the OFT where
considers it is urgently necessary in order to protect the interests of
consumers and prevent serious actual or potential consumer detriment.

Government welcomes the agreement in the MFF for a two year salary and
