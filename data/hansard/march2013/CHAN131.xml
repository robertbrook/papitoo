companies come to visit Telford, they do not want to see Traveller
encampments all over our industrial estates. There is a mixed land
ownership pattern, with some owned by the local authority, some
privately owned and some Homes and Communities Agency land. Will the

Gentleman. As he knows, I have a soft spot for Telford. I spent a lot
of time during the last election trying to unseat him, without any
success. The point about industrial land is a good one. Telford is
clearly a key strategic location and, subject to the consultations, the
announcement that we may or may not be about to make will help with
that process. We have issued guidance to local authorities, but if my
sitting down with him and local authorities to try to work
something out would help, I am happy to do

hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine

Shelter shows that rents have gone up in 83% of areas. In my community

approximate, because nobody entirely knows yet. He knows that any

Leslie</B> (Nottingham East) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> The terms of the
Cypriot bank bail-out are extremely concerning, and the market reaction
today may be only the beginning of the fallout. While it is, of course,
important for the Cypriot banks to be put on a secure footing, it is
extremely dangerous to wider economic confidence for the fundamental
trust of retail depositors to be undermined in such a way. This was a
very risky decision, and we would expect the British Government to
caution against such a sequestering of the funds of ordinary bank
customers.</hs_Para>

so-called bail-in of banks in jeopardy does not always need to punish
savers and depositors in this way. It is essential that the
trust and confidence of ordinary bank customers across the European
Union is immediately restored, with guarantees that no future bail-in
arrangements will operate in this way. Surely one of the lessons from
recent history is that rock-solid guarantees for depositors are a
prerequisite to stability and recovery. EU Finance Ministers would not
have countenanced a move such as this in larger members of the EU, yet
somehow it is acceptable for smaller ones. It is never a good message
to send to the public in any country that they would have been better
off keeping their life savings under a mattress than in a
bank.</hs_Para>

specific questions. First, were the UK Government made aware of this
proposal beforehand and, if so, when? Was the Chancellor consulted and,
if so, what view was expressed? The UK 
<?notus-xml column=619?>may not be able to attend the meetings of the
Eurogroup of Finance Ministers in a non-voting, observer capacity, but
any informal decisions taken there still need referring to ECOFIN, so
would it not be sensible, in future, to secure a right for observers,
including the UK, to attend such crucial decision-making meetings,
given the ramifications of eurozone decisions for the whole
of the
EU<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T15:41:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031811000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0001.htm#13031811000207">The
Opposition welcome the decision to compensate UK armed forces personnel
stationed in Cyprus who are affected, but can the Minister set out the
estimated cost to the Exchequer of that policy? Are British consular
officials providing assistance to other affected UK nationals? What is
the Government’s estimate of the number of UK nationals affected
by this decision in Cyprus? What will happen if the Cypriot Government
and Parliament do not actually go along with this proposal? They are
obviously between a rock and a hard place, as the further two days of
impromptu bank holidays go to show, but surely such public brinkmanship
by the EU and the IMF just creates even more uncertainty. What is the
extent of British banking exposure and British business exposure to the
Cypriot banks? How much does the Treasury estimate that UK investors
will lose under this arrangement?</hs_Para>

EU citizens expected that their deposits were guaranteed up to

directive, but we now learn that there was a caveat excluding special
taxes such as this one. Should consumers be aware of any other aspects
of the small print in the deposit guarantee scheme? Does this whole
episode not show that we should clarify our own banking bail-in rules
in this country as soon as possible, rather than, as Ministers are
saying in the Banking Reform Bill process, waiting for the European
Union to draw up the bail-in directive in several years’ time?
Waiting years for the EU to tell us how a bail-in arrangement might
operate suddenly looks like an unwise course to take. Surely we should
get these issues sorted out here at home as soon as possible. This is
not a matter where the UK Government can just sit on the sidelines,

Gentleman is quite right that it is necessary at both a

situation in which the Government of Cyprus, as I understand it, faced

deliver for victims and meet the principles set out in his report. This
system will ensure up-front apologies, million pound fines, a

me set out for the House the significance of the decision to go with a
royal charter instead of a statutory approach, and give details of the
deal that has now been agreed. First, however, let me remind the House
of the two key recommendations that Lord Justice Leveson made. First he
said there should be a new powerful self-regulatory body that the press
themselves had to establish—he was very clear about what that
should involve and that the press had to establish it. Secondly, and
crucially, in order that the press do not mark their own homework, he
said there should be a recognition body to oversee the new system of
press self-regulation.</hs_Para>

House will recall that Lord Justice Leveson’s own proposal was
that legislation would give Ofcom the power to act as that recognition
body. I said to the House on the day the report was published that I
had serious misgivings about passing detailed legislation on press
regulation. I also had grave misgivings about that task being given to
Ofcom, which is already a very powerful body. I was determined to try
to find a better way of establishing a tough regulatory body to enforce
Lord Justice Leveson’s principles, and a different way of
establishing the recognition body to check it was doing its job
properly. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T16:22:56"></hs_TimeCode>That
is what the royal charter does, without the need to write down in
legislation the title, definition, functions, power, rules or
composition of a new system of regulation—it puts
those in place in a royal charter rather than in legislation and, as a
result, it does not cross that Rubicon of which I

me remind hon. Members why I felt that a full legislative response to
Lord Justice Leveson’s report would be the wrong approach. I
stated that there would be problems of necessity, practicality and
fundamental principle. As I believe we have shown today, statutory
regulation of our media, and statutory regulation to create a
recognition body, is not necessary to achieve the Leveson principles.
We can do it—indeed we will do it—via a royal
charter.</hs_Para>

reasons of practicality. If we are to have a system of voluntary
self-regulation, as Lord Justice Leveson specifically proposed, it is
vital that those who are being regulated participate in it. In my view,
there was a danger that, if we pursued a detailed legislative approach,
as Leveson recommended, we simply would not establish a regulatory
system in which the press would take part—we would have been
part of an exercise in grandstanding and something of a charade, rather
than something that will actually deliver for
victims.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031811000301" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0001.htm#13031811000301">Most

Prime Minister:</Member></B> Two important but relatively small
legislative changes need to be made. Let me explain what they are.
First, Lord Justice Leveson said—the Government agreed at the
time—that, in order to create an incentive for newspapers to
take part in the system, we should establish a system of exemplary
costs and damages that would not apply to newspapers that take part. We
have accepted that recommendation and will be legislating for
it—it can be done only via
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031811000304" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0001.htm#13031811000304">I
will come on to the second change we are making, but we are not
embedding the charter in legislation or legislating about it; we are
simply repeating the words of the charter. The charter says
clearly that it can be changed only if there is a vote of two thirds of
this House and two thirds of the House of Lords. Why have we put that
in the charter? We have put that in the charter because we want to make
it difficult to change the charter. We will repeat exactly that point
in legislation in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill. The
legislation is to protect the royal charter; it is not legislation to
recognise the royal
charter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031811000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0001.htm#13031811000305">I

free speech or a free press in that way. As Winston Churchill

by rejecting statutory regulation but being in favour
of a royal charter, the House has defended that principle. I very much
welcome the agreement that we have on the withdrawal of amendments from
the amendment paper that would have created a new press law in our 
<?notus-xml column=634?>country—the amendments will either be withdrawn or, if they are
pressed to a Division, we have agreed that we should all oppose
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031811000307" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0001.htm#13031811000307">Let
me set out for the House the cross-party agreement on the royal
charter. As I have said, the new system of press regulation will
deliver Lord Justice Leveson’s principles, including up-front
apologies and £1 million fines. As I have just explained, we
will use the Crime and Courts Bill to table the minimal legislative
clauses needed to put in place those incentives, which Lord Justice
Leveson regarded as important. They will give all newspapers a strong
incentive to participate in the voluntary scheme of
self-regulation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031811000308" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0001.htm#13031811000308">Exemplary

position consistently, because we do not want a situation in which
politicians can meddle with the system. That is why we have agreed the
no-change clause in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill, which
will be debated tonight in another place. The measure will have the
effect that the charter, now that it has been so carefully agreed, can
be amended only if the process contained within it is followed. As I

Prime Minister:</Member></B> On my hon. Friend’s second point,
the whole point about what we are establishing is that there will be a
free arbitration service that victims can use—that is vital. The
key point about the difference between a royal charter and setting out
in legislation what a press regulator needs to look like, is this: if
we pass a law in this House on press regulation that says, “This
is what the recognition body has to look like; this is what the press
regulation has to look like; this is what the fines are like; this is
what the processes are like”, we cross the Rubicon. It would
give the House and future Governments the ability to legislate in a
totally illiberal way and to restrict freedom of the press. At the time
of Leveson’s publication, I said that that was not an acceptable
approach and that we should not take it. I said that we would consider
alternatives, and we have found one—a royal charter—that
means that we are safeguarded from taking that step.</hs_Para>

me conclude by saying a word about the process by which the agreement
has been reached and about the next steps. The royal charter agreed
today has benefited hugely from hundreds of hours of detailed
negotiations with representatives of victims, all main political
parties and the press themselves, and has been further improved by the
hours of discussions between the parties this weekend. I am grateful
for the spirit of give and take on all sides. We stand here today with
a cross-party agreement for a new system of press regulation that
supports our great traditions of investigative journalism and free
speech and protects the rights of the vulnerable and the innocent. If
this system is implemented, the country should have confidence that the
terrible suffering of innocent victims, such as the Dowlers, the
McCanns and Christopher Jeffries, should never be repeated. My message
to the press is now very clear: we have had the debate, now it is time

we break the pattern of decades and decades of politicians promising to

ask why we are here at all, given the many pressing issues that the
country has to deal with. My answer is simple: because I do not want to
live in a country where sections of the press can abuse their power to
wreak havoc on the lives of innocent people and, equally, because I
want to live in a country that upholds the rights of a fearless, angry,

new regulator will be independent of the press. Secondly, it is a
regulator with teeth, with the powers to direct apologies and
corrections of equal prominence. That matters because we know the
history: a front-page story that turns someone’s life upside
down, followed by an apology buried in the small print on page 36.
Thirdly, this system will endure, because of the statutory underpinning
being considered in another place today, which will protect the system
from being tampered with by Ministers or watered down. It is important
that this underpinning has been endorsed by the Prime Minister and

understand the heat and passion that this debate has aroused, including

Lord Justice Leveson published his recommendations, the Liberal

politicians, the public and the press, I said at the outset that we
should not become fixated on the means of change, but stay focused on
the end we all seek: an independent press watchdog in which people can

and thirdly, they must strike the right balance between protecting the
great tradition of a free press in this country and also protecting
innocent people from unwarranted intimidation and bullying by powerful
interests in our media. Let us not forget that the hacking scandal was
caused by some of our biggest newspapers, but it was still a minority
of newspapers and certainly not the local and regional press, which
must not pay the price for a problem they did not create. A free press
is one of the most potent weapons against the abuse of authority in our
society, holding the powerful to account. Equally, however, the media
must not abuse their own power at the cost of innocent
people.</hs_Para>

hurdles that we have all had to overcome has been the polarisation of
this debate, with the idea that someone is either for a full statute or
against it, and that they are either on the side of the victims or on
the side of the press, when in reality most people are on the side of
both. We have not succumbed to those false choices, however.</hs_Para>

have forged a middle way with a royal charter protected by
legislation—a system of independent self-regulation, a voluntary
system just as Lord Justice Leveson outlined—but with
two specific statutory provisions. First, there will be a legal
provision to ensure that if a newspaper is signed up to the regulatory
regime, judges will be able to take that into account when awarding
costs and damages in the courts. Newspapers will be rewarded for
playing by the rules, and I very much hope that the newspaper groups
will now see the logic of that incentive and get behind the
reforms.</hs_Para>

there will be an entrenchment clause to prevent future Governments from
chopping and changing the royal charter on a whim. I have been pushing

proposed. Without it, the royal charter would leave the door open to
political meddling by future Governments, and that is a risk that we

those who have already congratulated the leadership and members of all
three parties on achieving at the eleventh hour an agreement on a way
forward. It is now more than six years since Clive Goodman and Glenn
Mulcaire were convicted of unlawful interception of communications. The
reverberations from that are still continuing, but what we know for
certain is that the initial claim that it was one rogue reporter was
completely untrue. We now have evidence to suggest that the claim that
it was one rogue newspaper was also untrue. We await further
developments, but we are now on the point of getting what was needed
for at least that six years or, arguably, for far longer—a tough

want to make sure that the House does not lose sight of the fact that
although there have been terrible abuses committed by the press, we
still need to recognise the vital role that the press play in a
democratic society. The press have also been responsible for uncovering
acts of corruption and abuse of power, and that does not apply only to
the broadsheet newspapers: some tabloids have an equally honourable
record in conducting such campaigns. As I think the Deputy Prime
Minister said, we should recognise the vital importance of local
newspapers, and ensure that whatever system we introduce does not add
to the burden on them at a time when they are experiencing very
difficult economic circumstances.</hs_Para>

morning for agreement to be achieved on what might appear to be a very
small issue. However, I commend the Prime Minister for his recognition
of the fact that even a small amount of legislation could—I
repeat, could—be very dangerous. Certainly the suggestion of
statutory underpinning caused real concern, and not just among people
who were singing to the tune of the press. Organisations that are

had a bit of a debate in this place and in the media about what the

self-regulatory system, and that that should be underpinned by statute.
He made that explicitly clear and today, in a clever but appropriate
way, we have ensured that there is a charter at one remove from
legislation through which we can guarantee the new system and that is
locked in by a legislative safeguard. I commend those who thought of
the idea and I think it gets the balance right. There is underpinning

today is that we liberate the Defamation Bill and enable it to

It has fallen into disrepute and one of the things that we will have
done—I was going to mention it—is make sure that we do
not clog up other legislation on which both Houses have worked very
hard, and prevent it from becoming law—the Crime and Courts
Bill, the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill and the Defamation
Bill. I hope we can now go on to get the legislation as right as is

Gerald Kaufman</B> (Manchester, Gorton) (Lab):</Member> For me, this
day marks the end of a journey that began 21 years ago when I
became Chairman of what was then the National Heritage Committee. Our
very first inquiry was into privacy and media intrusion. At that time,
we were particularly concerned not so much about what the press does to
public figures—although sometimes what it does to public figures
can be cruel and unjustified, but we are in the game and we know what
we face—but about what the press does to private individuals who
have never had any experience of a journalist knocking at their door or
coming through their garden gate, and who suddenly, through no fault or
initiative of their own, find themselves hounded and harassed by the
press. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:18:30"></hs_TimeCode>
referred in that inquiry in particular to families of murder victims.
We referred to families of soldiers who had been killed in action. They
could neither control what had happened to their families nor in any
way respond or cope with journalists looking for a story.</hs_Para>

made a recommendation that the remedy should be a privacy Act with a
public interest defence. We were looking at parallels with the United
States constitution, which defended the freedom of the press while at
the same time defending the freedom of individuals. It is very sad that
although the remedy that we proposed might not necessarily have been
the most effective or the most appropriate, nothing was done.
Nothing was done by the Government who were then in power; nothing was
done by the Labour Government who succeeded it. We are having this
debate today only because of the exposure of the scandal of phone
hacking, particularly concerning the Dowler family, but also relating
to a considerable number of victims of intrusion into
privacy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:20:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031811000410" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031811000410">I
congratulate all involved in arriving at the solution that has been put
before the House today. When the Prime Minister made his initial
announcement, I made clear, as I did in the subsequent debate, my
opposition to statutory regulation of the press. I was a working
journalist for nine years on Fleet street, and I was proud of the
privilege of working in communications, establishing facts and
investigating wrongdoing. Whatever we might think of some of the worst
excesses of the press, a free press is indispensable to a free
democracy. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that if the choice were
between a corrupt and irresponsible press or a state-regulated press, I
would—obviously with great reluctance and while biting my
tongue—opt for the irresponsibility and corruption. I want a
free press in this country, and I want it to be able to do what it does
without fear or favour. Today we are getting the possibility that that
can be achieved while protecting decent, innocent people from
intrusion.</hs_Para>

the press in some form or in some law, because I thought that a free

worry when <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T17:26:55"></hs_TimeCode>we

amendments on the Order Paper and we talk about having to pass this

halfway through the debate as it is handed round. We have manuscript

have tended either to chase or to run as far away as possible from a

enough, or been too cowardly, in matters of press regulation. We let
the victims of crime become the victims of the press as well,

Peter Lilley</B> (Hitchin and Harpenden) (Con):</Member> I congratulate
my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on preventing us from going
down the route of full-scale statutory legislation of the media.
Undoubtedly, what he has achieved was the best possible measure that
could command a majority in the House. I urge the House, however, to
remember that when Members on both Front Benches agree, we invariably
make our worst blunders because the normal adversarial process of
criticising measures is put aside. I hope we will consider what may be
wrong with this measure, as well as what may be right.</hs_Para>

Leveson inquiry was set up because of phone hacking and libel, both of
which were and are against the law, and neither of which is tackled by
this royal charter. Those who always—rightly or
wrongly—wanted to legislate to control the press have seized on
the abuses of hacking and libel to propose legislation that tackles
quite other problems that they see and have always wanted to deal
with.</hs_Para>

sympathise with those who have been victims of press abuse—I, my
family and relatives have probably been subject to more defamation and
intrusion than almost anybody else in this House. Only last month I
sent another cheque for 20 grand to a charity in my constituency after
the latest offensive defamation. I do not think, however, that we
should automatically presume that those who have been victims of abuse
have great expertise in legislative matters, or grant those of us who
have been victims a licence to legislate without criticism. That is
simply mawkish sentimentality and it has led the House to focus
exclusively on the legal framework we are establishing—a royal
charter versus statutory regulation —and not on the powers we
are giving the regulator, or that the regulator will be able to give
itself.</hs_Para>

asked the Hacked Off lobby group, which was lobbying me and saying that
it was keen to answer my questions, what powers to prevent or require
publication the regulator will be given by this royal charter, what

what limits there are to the sorts of material it could prevent or
require publication of.</hs_Para>

inspection, it appears that the charter can require prominent apologies
for abuse of individuals. If that were all it could do, I would be fine
with it. In my time, I have had a banner front-page headline
apology—I forget which newspaper it was, but the bottom banner
headline on the front page was, “We apologise to Peter
Lilley”. I hope others get the same when they are similarly
abused.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000007">However,
that is not all the charter can do—the powers go beyond that to
enabling the regulator to do other things, such as requiring those who
subscribe to publish a factual correction. That is a pretty dangerous
step. We are giving a body the right to decide what is fact and what is
true. At best, that is a recipe for multitudinous time-wasting
complaints that something is factually incorrect; at worst, it will
establish a mini, self-appointed “Ministry of Truth”,
which can decide what is true and must be published and what is false
and must be
withdrawn.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000008">We

Friend raises an important point about the wording of the document. The

any case, since the regulator can offer advice to editors of
subscribing publications on how they should best comply with the code,
and punish editors with fines of up to £1 million if
they subsequently do not follow such advice, it effectively means that
the regulator has the considerable power to prohibit or discourage
publication.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000016">The
final question I asked Hacked Off was whether there were any limits in
the measure as to how far the body and the code can go in future when
it is annually reviewed. Each time it will be made more intense and its
scope will be extended because that is how regulators work—they
always increase their powers. As far as I could work out from Hacked
Off’s rather incoherent reply, there are no limits to the powers
that the body can grant itself or the extent to which it can

right that we remember what has brought us to this point: the terrible

have to go through what they went through. As a result of the action
taken today, we hope that such abuses will not happen, but that if they
do there will be appropriate, speedy and fair mechanisms in place to
deal with them. Many hon. Members have referred to laws that are in
place, in both criminal and civil law, to deal with such
abuses. However, the law of defamation and the ability to take action
in the civil courts for libel are not available to many people, because
of the punitive nature of the costs and the fear that they may end up

does he agree that the press itself sets up the regulatory arrangements
and the press itself sets up the appointment panel? The only

are independent of the industry, whatever that means. Must we not be

that today’s provisions, and Leveson himself, propose a means of
independent self-regulation. Some of the hyperbole and over-the-top
commentary has been deeply counter-productive and simply wrong. The
idea that there should be nothing in legislation is deeply flawed. How
else will we properly apply the issue of incentives and disincentives
unless we pass something in this House that deals with exemplary
damages and cost? There has to be legislation. I welcome statutory
underpinning—for that is what it is—to non-interference

Dodds:</Member></B> No, because the system put in place for
appointments to the regulatory body makes it very clear how that body
should be populated. The terms of the royal charter are very clear that
appointees will not be drawn from the political classes, will
not be parliamentarians, and will not be involved in government or
legislating. That is very important. Of equal importance, and why my
party supported the version of the royal charter proposed by the Leader
of the Opposition and the Deputy Prime Minister, was the issue of the
press industry having a veto over who could be appointed. We believed
that that was wrong and would not be tolerated in any other walk of
life. It is absolutely proper and fair that there should be an
appointment system that is not populated by the political classes and
that is not capable of being vetoed by the industry. It was important
for us that the regulator should have the power to direct apologies and
corrections, including where they should be printed. That was
recognised in the alternative version of the royal charter published on
Friday, and we welcomed that. I therefore welcome its adoption in what
is being presented to the House this evening.</hs_Para>

support what has been done: we welcome the fact that the royal charter
has been changed for the better by cross-party agreement. I understand
fully and endorse the reasons for proceeding by means of a royal
charter as opposed to legislation. However, there is an irony in that
we are now saying that the proper and best recourse is to proceed on
the basis of a very antiquated means that is not subject to
line-by-line scrutiny by elected Members of Parliament, or in any way
subject to amendment. This is being brought forward on the basis of a
draft by Her Majesty. Now, as a royalist and a monarchist I am all for
that, and have no difficulty with it. However, in the modern,
democratic world in which 
<?notus-xml column=658?>we live, it is ironic that we have decided that this is the way forward,
rather than saying that the people’s representatives should have
the opportunity to discuss, amend and vote on it. I understand the

of the debate we have had—not this afternoon, but in the course

Lord Justice Leveson never recommended statutory regulation of the
press. Just as there has been inaccurate criticism of what he
recommended from the more hysterical commentators in the media, so
there has been equally inaccurate and exaggerated criticism from the
other end of the market. I suspect that what we have managed to do
today is to come down sensibly and gently into the middle, which is
probably where we would have been in the first place if we had all read
the Leveson report carefully. But there we are and here we are, and

hugely complicated issues involving disputes about whether the
sting of a libel or the words complained of

of documents exchanged on disclosure, which can be done by a judge and

point about exemplary damages, as set out on the amendment paper, would
incentivise people to join the scheme, although as I understand the
amendments—I might have misread them—they do not mean
that if someone is in the scheme, they will be immune from exemplary
damages, and that if someone is outside it, they will always be milked
for them. The old rule in Rookes <I>v. </I>Barnard and so forth would
still apply, insofar as it is relevant nowadays, but, as the Defamation
Bill will make clear, juries will be taken out of exemplary damages
cases, which will be decided by a judge alone. To that extent,
exemplary damages will play a part in the proposals, but in my

Prime Minister whether a system of compensatory payments would be

punishing the respondent newspaper or media organisation. If a victim
of newspaper misconduct required compensation, would they have to go to
the courts to settle or get an agreement from the respondent, or would

therefore be susceptible to the jurisdiction of the body, failed to do
what the body commanded, it would be in breach of contract, and
arrangements would be put in place to ensure either that the contract
was complied with or that damages were payable for breach of contract.
Someone might have to litigate the breach of contract, but the system
might contain fail-safe measures allowing the independent body to
revisit the matter and deal with the malefactor in some preordained,
but sensible,

Leveson’s report stated that statutory underpinning was
necessary in order to set up a statutory recognition process and to
provide for costs and damages incentives for publishers who subscribe
to a recognised regulator. The Government have at least seen the merits

Brian’s report recognised that publishers would need to be
incentivised to sign up voluntarily to recognised 
<?notus-xml column=665?>regulators. He also recognised that there would be circumstances in
which a court would determine that a publisher must give a claimant
exemplary damages, albeit rarely, as a result of reckless behaviour.
The cross- party amendments to which I initially put my name

to which I was a co-signatory, and which were due to be debated today
and have now been withdrawn, would have ensured that any new commission
that was established, as well as any regulatory body, would have been
subject to freedom of information provisions. That is a crucial
provision that would have ensured greater transparency in the new
bodies, and I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister, or the Minister
responding to the debate, will be able to give us an assurance that
that will still be the

I welcome the assurances from the Government that any arbitration
service will be free for claimants to use. I am pleased about
that. Another amendment to which I had put my name would have placed a
duty on courts to take account of a defendant’s means, including
readership and assets, when awarding exemplary damages. I welcome the
fact that the proposals fulfil that requirement. Although the proposals
do not meet every recommendation made by Lord Justice Leveson, I
welcome the fact that the House has been able to reach a compromise,

not being recommended. Rather, Leveson was recommending a system that
was about self-organised, voluntary regulation, to which news
publications would be encouraged to subscribe voluntarily. He
recommended statute to do two quite simple things. One was to establish
the right incentives to join such a body, and that is the protection
afforded through exemplary fines and costs; I am delighted that those
will be debated later today. The second was simply to establish an
independent public body that would judge a regulator—not every
week, every month or every year, but every two to three years—on
whether it was working effectively and meeting a certain set of
criteria<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T18:33:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000101">This
may appear a rather ancient device to achieve what we want, but it is
undoubtedly the case that a body established by royal charter is an
independent public body that can perform the task equally well. There
is one important advantage of establishing the body in this way, and
that is that the press are more comfortable with it. Before people say,
“Well, we should not be doing what the press want,” it is
important to realise that in Lord Justice Leveson’s own plan he
said that this would be a voluntary system. If we want publications to
join something voluntarily and to seek recognition under a system,
there will be a benefit in their being comfortable with
it—provided, of course, that we get the detail right.</hs_Para>

picked up on some detailed points that I would like to touch on. He
said that all the crimes committed related to defamation and breaches

those problems. That is not right, because what we have before us

newspapers to make corrections and put right errors, but in all the
difficult negotiations we have had the press did not raise this as a
problem; indeed, it is what the PCC already does. There is nothing new

pre-publication advice is simply that—just advice, with no

backstop power if there are really serious breaches, but what we are

it has caused us several days of anxious scurrying around to get an
agreement, the Prime Minister was right, in my view, to bring the
matter to a head, so in some ways that was a relief to us. A number of
us have spent week after week in very difficult negotiations trying to
reach a conclusion. I remember one particularly dispiriting moment at
the end of a meeting with some of the campaign group Hacked Off when we
thought that after three and a half hours we had identified the
six key things we needed to put right and one of the campaign directors
said, “Shall we now move on to the next set of 20 problems that
I have?” I am therefore very pleased that we have all been put

is important to note, too, that the last few days have not been in
vain, as some important changes have been made to the charter. The
first change is that it is now clear that the board of the regulator
will be independent and that there will be no press veto. That is an
important step forward. Secondly, it is clear that where the
investigations take place, there must be a simple and clear process so
that there is no chance of a regulator putting up all sorts of barriers
to make sure that it does not happen. The third point is that when the
press code is written, there will be a role for working journalists for
the first time. It will no longer be just an editor’s code. That
is important because we need younger journalists with a stake in the
future of their trade or profession—however they choose call
it—to have a role in writing the code. It will be an important
step forward and breath of fresh air to get working journalists, not
just editors, involved in the code.</hs_Para>

John Leech</B> (Manchester, Withington) (LD):</Member> I add my
congratulations to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and
the Leader of the Opposition. I am delighted that we have reached the
position where there is agreement between the three main parties on a
royal charter, backed up perhaps by just a small bit of legislation to
ensure independence and to avoid political interference by future
Governments.</hs_Para>

Liberal Democrats have said from the outset that we support a strong
and independent press regulator, free from political interference, that
would protect the innocent victims of media abuse. What has been agreed
over the last couple of days achieves that: the press remains free from
political interference and able robustly to challenge politicians and
expose wrongdoing, including wrongdoing by politicians. At the same
time, however, 
<?notus-xml column=669?>those innocent victims of press abuse will have a robust regulator to
hold the press to account when they have got it wrong.</hs_Para>

already gone on record as saying that, in my view, the Prime Minister
got it wrong when he decided to pull the Conservatives out of the
all-party talks. Significant progress had been made, with both the
Liberal Democrats and the Labour party giving ground on the royal
charter and with only a few areas of disagreement remaining—in
relation to an industry veto on membership of the regulator, changes in
the code of conduct, the nature of apologies, third-party complaints,
and political interference with the royal charter. I pay tribute to the
Prime Minister for returning to the talks, and I am pleased that the
party leaders were able to reach an
agreement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000113">We
had argued that the press should not have an industry veto over members
of the regulator, while the Conservative position had been that any
industry representative on the appointments panel should be able to
veto any nominee for the board of the regulator about whose
impartiality that representative was concerned. Schedule 3 of the
agreed royal charter ensures that there will be no industry veto. That
change was essential if the regulator was to have real power over the
press, and I welcome the concession that it
represents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000114">We
proposed that the regulator, not the press, should have the final say
on changes in the code of conduct. The Conservatives proposed that the
press should be able to recommend changes in the code, and that the
regulator should be obliged to accept them. That, too, would have
limited the real power of the regulator. Schedule 3 of the charter
states that the code</hs_Para>

too often, victims have received apologies that have been hidden
between other stories rather than given the prominence accorded to the
original, offending stories. A number of Members have mentioned that.
We propose that the regulator should be able to able direct newspaper
apologies when mistakes are made. The original draft charter stated
that the regulator should be able to tell a newspaper to apologise, but
should have no say over the manner of that apology. It seems obvious to
me that a regulator of the press should be able to influence the manner
of any necessary apologies to bodies within its remit, so I am pleased
to note that schedule 3 of the charter states that the regulator will
“direct”, not “require”, remedial action
and
apologies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000118">We
proposed that the regulator should have maximum discretion when
deciding whether to accept complaints from third parties. The
Conservatives proposed that the regulator should accept such complaints
only when there had been a “serious” breach of the rules,
and when there was “significant” public
interest. In schedule 3(11) the word “substantial”, which
was used in the original charter, has been eliminated, which gives the
regulator discretion to decide whether a third-party complaint is
appropriate.</hs_Para>

the question of political interference, we argued that there should be
a clause in legislation making it much more difficult for future
Governments to amend or abolish the royal charter. Under the agreement
that has been reached, the Government will insert a clause in the
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill in the House of Lords, which will
prevent future Governments from amending or abolishing the royal
charter without consulting Parliament. That is fundamental to the
future of press regulation, protecting the press from the clutches of
future Governments while also ensuring that the regulator cannot be
watered
down.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000120">We
can argue about whether this amounts to statutory underpinning of the
royal charter—we would argue that it does, while others might
argue that it does not—but that really does not matter, as long
as it does its job and protects the new independent regulator. No doubt
all the political parties will want to claim the agreement as a victory
for them, but the real winners are the innocent victims of press
mistreatment. The press have nothing to fear from the royal charter,
but when they get things wrong, the innocent victims of their mistakes
can be confident that there will be a robust system in place to put it
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000121"><B><Member PimsId="-1" UID="13031836000289" xid="-1" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000289">Several

is not a day for euphoria, and it is certainly not a day for
self-congratulation, but it might, just might, mark a welcome new
chapter in the life and role of the press in our society. It is clear
why Lord Justice Leveson had to embark on his 15 months of work. Let us
not forget the reasons, which have again been outlined eloquently in
the House today. If we stay true to the reasons why the Prime Minister
rightly set up that inquiry, we must recognise that it was inevitable
that we, as a House of Commons, would have to reach the
decision—a tough decision—to make a change, and we 
<?notus-xml column=671?>have reached that decision today. We have broken the logjam of
generations of politicians who have gone before us and who have said
much about the need for reform, but have done precious little. There is
a moment, perhaps, for just a bit of quiet pride in the fact that we,
as a Parliament, are able to make that
break.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000126">Many
speakers have rightly expressed concern, and want to understand more,
about the nature and meaning of the royal charter, but let us not
forget that this document is not the constitution of the regulator. It
sets out, in clear terms, what a regulator should look like according
to the recognition body, which is why it includes terms such as
“should” and why it is exhortatory rather than
prescriptive. That has to be right. Some of my right hon. and hon.
Friends have asked what is the full ambit of the regulator. My answer
is simply this: it is an independent body and a voluntary body,
but, for the first time, we are to have a body that can be
periodically assessed in relation to objective criteria. That is what
the schedules to the royal charter are all about.</hs_Para>

down to watch the wonderful Six Nations victory by Wales in the match
against England on Saturday, I donned my anorak and spent a few hours
comparing and contrasting the royal charter published by Her
Majesty’s Opposition with the one published by the Government. I
came up with very few differences. Most involved a word here and there,
but I considered one difference to be important. It related to the
power of any new regulator either to “require” or to
“direct” appropriate remedial action following a breach
of
standards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000128">We
have heard a great deal about the difference between the meaning of the
word “require” and the meaning of the word
“direct”. I must admit that before I looked at the
wording carefully, I did not think that there was much of a difference.
However, I think it right for us to put the position beyond
peradventure and include the word “direction”, which
implies an order, a mandate, a compulsion for the member of the body to
right the wrong that it has done. That could lead to the printed
apologies on the front page, and to the remedies that actually mean
something to those who have been affected by wrongdoing. That may sound
boring, but it is very important to those concerned. It is the job of
the House of Commons to do the boring but important things. That is why
I think it is vital for us all to consider the detail of this important
document as carefully as we
can.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000129">Much
has been made about the use of statute, but I think it was inevitable.
There had been a hope, at one stage, that the civil procedure rules
that govern the way in which civil trials are held in England and Wales
could be amended to allow for the regimen of aggravated damages and
costs that is now in statute. That proved not to be the case, which is
why, sensibly and inevitably, it has to be in statute. As for the
entrenchment clause, whether we call it underpinning or supporting
matters not. The point is still well made that this charter should not
be subject to the whim of the Executive, to be amended by them at their
pace, in their time and in their way; it should be for this House to
consider any amendment. The role of the politician in the new system of
regulation should and must stop there. This system is not about
politicians interfering with the life and work of journalists; it is
simply an important and significant step along the road to make sure
that all the work of decent professional 
<?notus-xml column=672?>journalists, who spend their lives investigating wrongdoing and exposing
that which should not be secret, is supported. So it will be good for
them, just as it will be good for those who have been and those who may
still be the victims of wrongdoing.</hs_Para>

years ago, my profession, the legal profession, went through a similar
process, and we now have an overarching body, the Legal Services Board,
which recognises independent regulation. There was a worry that that
would interfere with the independence of the Bar and solicitors, but
the truth is that solicitors and barristers go about their daily work
without having to look over their shoulder at a recognising body. In
fact, that body is enshrined in statute and has a wider remit that
anything I have read about in this royal charter. For those reasons, we
can confidently support the agreement that has been reached between all
parties in this House and look forward to a time when the victims of
wrongdoing will receive a fairer deal.</hs_Para>

that he has been here throughout these proceedings, which is more than
I have been here for. So I congratulate him on what he has done, as
well as the Leader of the Opposition. He has not been able to be here
the whole time because he has had other things to do, but the Prime
Minister has shown his commitment to trying to resolve this
matter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000134">It
is very important that we hold fast for a moment and remember that we
did not create this crisis in the first place—it was created by
others. It was created by a total failure of self-regulation over
decades, by a failure to implement the findings of successive inquiries
and by serial criminality in the press. The only point I would make to
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T18:53:44"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr Lilley) is that
although these were criminal offences and they are now going through
the courts, this serial criminality betrayed a corruption at the heart
of our media—if not condoned, this behaviour was certainly
overlooked. So the hysterical response to much of what we have been
saying has been out of place. The day after 44 of us signed a letter to
<I>The Guardian</I>—this is the only time I have knowingly
signed something for <I>The Guardian</I>—<I>The Daily Telegraph
</I>had half of its page 2 saying, “Tory MPs tainted by scandal 
<?notus-xml column=673?>in bid to end free press”. What sort of responsible press is
that? I hope that <I>The Daily Telegraph</I> is taking note, but of
course I will be denounced for this tomorrow as being “Closetly
determined to end a free press.”</hs_Para>

wish to make three brief points. First, it is good that all three main
parties, and indeed the minority parties, have agreed this outcome. It
would have been bad news if there had not been agreement. We would have
seen divide and rule, and acrimony, so those from all parts of the
House who participated in bringing this about deserve our
congratulations. It is also important to put on the record the fact
that it is the historic duty of this House to remedy
injustice—that is not the job of the European Court of Human
Rights; it is the job of this Parliament and this House—and in
seeking to bring about this change, we have sought to do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000136"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T18:55:30"></hs_TimeCode>My
second point is that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T18:55:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Sir Edward Garnier) is
absolutely right to say that we should not set too much store by what
has been achieved today. A huge amount of detail still has to be worked
out and it will require a lot of good will on the part of all the media
and the regulators to bring that about. May I just indulge the House
for a moment on a slight word of caution to those who wish to see their
apologies on page 1? When I sued <I>Private Eye</I> for
libel—sadly, my hon. and learned Friend was not my
Queen’s counsel at the time—we had agreed the damages,
the apology and everything else, but the late Mr Peter Carter-Ruck said
that it would not agree to put the apology in a box. <I>Private Eye</I>
had agreed to put it on the same page as the offending article had been
but would not agree to a box. I insisted that I could not possibly
agree without having my apology in a box. Eventually <I>Private Eye</I>
agreed, so on the day of publication I went down to the news stand and
turned to page 4 or whatever it was. Sure enough there was the apology
in the terms agreed—absolutely wonderful—and it was in a
box. And so was every other story on the page! So we must beware what
we wish
for.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T18:56:55"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0002.htm#13031836000137">My
third and final point is that this approach should be seen on all sides
as an opportunity. It is an opportunity for a free press to move
forward and to act fearlessly but to remedy the wrongs that they have
recently perpetrated. It is an opportunity to ensure that ordinary
people are given a fair crack of the whip and that we do not see a
repetition of the kind of dreadful character assassination and misery
caused to ordinary people, who have no remedy and have no voice in this
House. If we achieve that, we shall have strengthened the British press
and made them an example for the rest of world, and we shall have done
a great service to the citizens of these
islands.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_18_PT_1/2CC185781C13C81977F66E4AED63FD058A142B35" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="18 March 2013">Monday

Rees-Mogg</B> (North East Somerset) (Con):</Member> May I join in the
praise of the Prime Minister, which has become commonplace in this
debate, although I do so for a different reason—not for this
royal charter, but for accepting the constraints of collective
responsibility? He has fought a valiant battle for the freedom of the
press but, unfortunately, the Liberal Democrats do not believe in it
and we therefore have the restriction on the freedom of the press that
we find with this royal charter and this debate. Collective
responsibility required that 
<?notus-xml column=674?>the Prime Minister should lead a united Government on this and I think
he was right to do so, because the alternative was to have the
Lib Dems with us in the Division Lobby one day and with Labour the
next, and that is not a Government; it is, as I believe Palmerston put
it, a mere coalition of atoms.</hs_Para>

is a free press important? Why is freedom of speech important? Why is
it a right that this House demands as an absolute? Since the Bill of
Rights was introduced, we have been free here to say anything that we
like. We can cast aspersions upon anyone we want, powerful or weak; we
can make them up. The only constraints we have—not to be rude
about the royal family, about judges or about ourselves—are
those that the House itself has imposed. We have those freedoms
because, as my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T18:59:11"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Sir Gerald Howarth) said, we
recognise that the way to redress grievance is by being free to do so
and having no constraint on what we say in this place. As soon as a
constraint is imposed, we find that the Crown, as it used to, will use
its powers to suppress a free press.</hs_Para>

Bill of Rights, what happened? MPs who said the wrong thing got sent to
the Tower. The Prime Minister might think that that is an attractive
option to have at his command, but freedom increased the power of the
people against the Executive. We see that with newspapers: they hold us
to account; they expose wrongdoing, corruption and criminality; and as
they do it, they upset powerful people. Indeed, many Members of
Parliament were upset over the expenses scandal—a scandal that
was revealed only because a brave press was willing to use stolen
information.</hs_Para>

am concerned about deciding to license the press—and that is
what we are doing. If newspapers do not sign up to this agreement, they
risk paying a high level of costs on any occasion when they are sued
for libel, and that will be introduced by statute. If they do not sign
up to the agreement, they risk punitive damages. Members of the House
who are interested in their history will know that the law of criminal
libel was used to put down the power of those who criticised
Governments. Why was John Wilkes arrested? It was for a criminal libel.
By increasing such powers and the viciousness of the laws against those
newspapers that will not be registered and licensed by the state, we
undermine our freedoms.</hs_Para>

the sovereign’s mere motion, those who regulate the
press are to be chosen, appointed and selected. It is the state that is
taking on this power, with some minor protections against its being
changed—but, oh, how minor those changes are! We hear that there
will be three lines of legislation—three lines—to prevent
the charter from being changed. Three lines of legislation can be
repealed by one line of subsequent legislation; there is little
protection in that. The motion of one charter may be created with
further charters. It might perhaps be hard to alter it, but there is
always the possibility of new charters to come.</hs_Para>

the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) and I concur with
every single word he said. I want to speak briefly from a
journalist’s perspective, as I was one for 17 years, working for
the local and national press and for BBC television and radio. In that
time, 99% of those with whom I worked were decent, honourable people
whose sole task in life was to hold the powerful, the corrupt and
others to account and to stand up for the small man and woman. They did
and they do. Regrettably, a tiny minority has ruined the barrel for the
majority of the press, who in my view do an extremely good job and have
held many people in this House to account. Some in this place have had
to leave and have even gone to jail because of the press’s
research and diligence. We risk treading on that power at our
peril.</hs_Para>

meeting held behind closed doors and was introduced to us today. If the
hon. Gentleman was correct, the information reached us only just after
the debate had started. There will be no further debate and for
something so serious, which is fundamental to the freedom and democracy
of our country, to be swept through by a small minority of highly

Yes, they make mistakes—of course they do. When I joined, an
editor said to me, “Richard, accuracy is key. If in doubt, leave
it out.” That is a very good bit of advice. The blame lies with
the independent editors. They are the chief executives, they are the
commanding officers—call it what you like, it is they who have
failed in many cases to command properly the men and women in their

already. We have hacking and libel laws to protect people who suffer

not need any more laws. When I heard about the royal charter, I was
informed by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister’s office
that there would be no statute and I agreed to support it. There is now
a smidgen of statute—just a little tiny bit—for which the
support of two thirds of this House or the other place is required to
effect change. Today, we will agree—regrettably, in

Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes), that this is
only one part of what Leveson discussed. There is obviously the
relationship between the police and the press. That needs to be put
right, and new rules are being put in place. We need to get the
relationship between the politicians and the press right, and there are
new rules and new transparency in respect of that. There is the issue
of press ethics, and I believe we have made some real progress
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T19:13:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031836000160">A
number of hon. Members made the point about how much time there had
been to study the royal charter. Obviously, in its final incarnation it
has been produced only today, but the first version of a royal charter
was published on 12 February, so there has been time for people to make
points and to consider how it would work. A number of Members pointed
to the irony of using a royal charter, even pointing out that some of
the language in it is on the flowery side. Yes, it is perhaps ironic,
but there is a real purpose. I believe that if we opted for
legislation, even about the nature of the recognition body, we would be
taking a bad step, so 
<?notus-xml column=678?>it is better to use the royal charter, which allows us to set up an
independent body without using statute to describe its
purposes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T19:14:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031836000161">I

the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

made by my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for South Dorset (Richard Drax) is correct: this is a
voluntary system. What Leveson said we should establish is an
independent self-regulatory body that the press have to set up. They
then apply for recognition, if they want to, to the recognition body,
and it is the recognition body that the royal charter establishes. I
think there has been some misunderstanding about that point in the
debate. The royal charter does not set up a self-regulator; that is for
the press to do. We urge them to do it, and to do it rapidly. I know
that work is already under way. It is our task, through the royal
charter, to set up the recognition body. The press can decide to seek
recognition from it, and then they get the advantages in terms of the
exemplary costs and damages, which the House will debate a little
later<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031836000162">A

not a panacea, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North Thanet (Sir Roger Gale) said. Those who will be
responsible for making the self-regulation work will be the press. They
have to set up their self-regulatory body, make sure that it has teeth,
make sure that it can seek recognition, and then put in place something
that we can be proud

the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)—it is now
closing time in the last-chance saloon was the phrase he used. The
point that I would make in commenting on that is that we are not
replacing a self-regulatory system with a statutory regulatory system.
We are trying to replace a failed system with one that will work
because, crucially, it has real independence at its heart.</hs_Para>

number of Members referred to the fact that the regulatory body will
have an independent board. Crucially, not only is it independent, but
it will be properly overseen by the recognition body, and crucially,
that oversight is established in a way that does not endanger a free
press or give Parliament a locus endlessly to interfere. That is
important. Of course we all have strong views about the press, press
freedom and press regulation, but it would not be right for Parliament
to pass laws and then go on amending laws and making changes to laws
about what the press should and should not do. It is important that the
method that we have chosen means that not only will we not be able to
do that, but the royal charter specifically says that it cannot be
changed unless there is a two-thirds motion in both Houses of
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031836000165">In
a way, this is what the whole debate is about: Leveson gave us the
architecture, the independent self-regulatory body, and the recognition
body to make sure that the press was not marking its homework. My right
hon. Friend the Minister for Government Policy played a key role in
providing the solution that I think is best, which is using a royal
charter so that we do not cross the Rubicon of writing all the rules
into the law. I commend the leaders of the Labour party and the Deputy
Prime Minister, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, on all the work
that they have done to choose to work together to try to deliver
something that is practical. It is notable 
<?notus-xml column=679?>that, when those talks broke down on Thursday, they chose to come up
with a royal charter which was workable, rather than for us to get back
into the trenches and have a fight over whether we should write these
changes into law. I am pleased that everyone has taken the opportunity

point previously. I simply say that it is an inflexible approach. It is
our intention to assist the House in the way we structure programme
motions, and that is precisely why this programme motion has been
constructed around extending two hours beyond the moment of
interruption. I emphasise that we are now four hours and 40 minutes
away from the closure of the debate. If a normal Report stage falls on
a Monday, it is not unusual for there to be two statements or an urgent
question and a statement, which takes the House from 3.30 pm to about
5.30 pm, at which point we are four and a half hours away from the
moment of interruption on that day, so I stress that we are not an
unusual length of time away from the moment of interruption for a
debate on

of the most important that we could be debating, given the interest out
there among the public and in the House. That is the difference, and we

today’s consideration is in addition to what was originally set

Clearly, the House is having to deal with an unusual situation, because
the Bill has become a vehicle for implementing the Leveson proposals on
press regulation. The fact that it has evolved in this way has
certainly made for some unusual processes that would hardly be

must.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031836000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031836000195">We

that would have allowed some new clauses relating to the Leveson report
to be taken ahead of some other parts of the Bill. We withdrew the
amendment following an assurance from the Minister of State, Home
Department, the hon. Member for Taunton Deane (Mr Browne),
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T19:33:24"></hs_TimeCode> changes to

on Thursday the Prime Minister decided to pull the plug on the
cross-party talks and table his own amendments to the Bill, which did
not comply with the Leveson principles. Consequently, a raft of
new amendments was tabled seeking to implement Leveson with statutory
underpinning and other safeguards of independence. Today’s
debate was looking as though it would offer a straight choice between a
Leveson-compliant and a non-Leveson-compliant approach. However, as we
have heard today, overnight a cross-party agreement was reached that
will put in place an enduring solution, protected against pressure from
the press, or indeed from Ministers in the Privy Council.</hs_Para>

therefore, the programme motion before us ensures that the Leveson new

note, in passing, that some of the amendments to be considered are
manuscript amendments and that the House will have had only a short
time to examine them before they are debated. It is undesirable in
principle to have manuscript amendments, but it is inevitable in the
context of the fast-moving cross-party talks on Leveson, which
continued into the early hours of this morning. The House has to be
flexible and its procedures have to enable agreements to be enacted if
the circumstances are exceptional, as I believe they are in this

motion. For example, new clause 12 has been signed by 57 Members,
mainly Opposition Members, and relates to the provision of
intermediaries for very vulnerable witnesses. New clause 14
has been signed by 110 Members, mainly Government Members and also
relates to very vulnerable witnesses. New clause 13 will probably never
be reached, but it relates to exceptions to automatic deportation and
has 104 signatories from both sides of the House. Those are important
new clauses, which we will either not debate at all or to which we will
give very little and totally inadequate attention. This is not the way
that this great House of Commons ought to
behave<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T19:57:36"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, it would not behave in this way if we had the business of the
House committee that Her Majesty’s Government promised they
would deliver by

the Member for Wellingborough would be to extend tonight’s
sitting, but, unusually for my hon. Friend, that is not the case. If
the manuscript amendments are passed, tonight’s main debate
would finish at 10.21 pm. If the Government’s programme motion
is passed, we will be here until midnight. Members should not turn
around and blame 
<?notus-xml column=691?>my hon. Friend or me when they are moaning about being here at midnight.
What the two of us want to see is another day given for discussion of
the Bill’s important extra clauses. What is unreasonable about
that? All we want is for this Chamber to scrutinise those
clauses and come to a decision on them. It will not be able to
do that in the 40 minutes that the Government feel are
adequate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T19:58:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031839000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839000036">It
is a great shame that the Leader of the House did not go into any
detail about possible alternative days to discuss these issues. We
finish our main business on a Tuesday at 7 o’clock. We have had
exceptional circumstances today and everybody understands that. I think
that most Members would be supportive, given the
circumstances, of staying longer tomorrow night. Were the Government to
extend tomorrow’s sitting to 10 o’clock, we could
probably deal with the extra new clauses and amendments, but the Leader
of the House has not made any such suggestion. Next Tuesday, we have a
Back-Bench afternoon. The Government could have replaced that with the
remaining stages of the Crime and Courts Bill.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T20:00:01"></hs_TimeCode> could
therefore wrap it all up before the Easter recess in a perfectly
satisfactory way, with proper scrutiny of all the new clauses and

that kind of imaginative thinking does not seem to come from the
Government, which is a great shame. The Prime Minister, the Leader of
the Opposition and the Deputy Prime Minister have been innovative today
in knocking their heads together and agreeing on this Chamber’s
response to the Leveson report. Most Members would agree that that is a
good thing. But now, we are being let down by Her Majesty’s
Government, who refuse to extend that innovative thinking into ensuring
that this House scrutinises legislation properly. That is a great

the Leader of the House made an announcement last week about
rescheduling the business for today, naively, given my 21 years’
experience, I presumed that a good part of the crime and courts work
would be taken elsewhere. For the past few months, we have been
treading water. There have been many Opposition days and Back-Bench
business days flying around. That is not a bad thing and I am not
running those things down, but there has been plenty of slack in the
system and there remains slack in the system.

are we dealing with at the moment? An Executive who are treating this
place with contempt. Earlier, we were all back-slapping and grinning,
and saying that we were doing something about Leveson and getting stuck
into doing something for the public. The public should know that
conscientious parliamentarians, such as those who have spoken today,
are being denied the opportunity to scrutinise important legislation,
such as provisions on the all-important European arrest warrant,
exceptions to automatic deportation and provisions to deal with
vulnerable witnesses. As a lawyer, I find it abhorrent that we are not
able to discuss provisions that deal with vulnerable

This section applies
where—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) a relevant

defendant was a relevant publisher at the material
time,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) the claim is related
to the publication of news-related material,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(d) the defendant is found
liable in respect of the
claim.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) Exemplary damages
may not be awarded against the defendant in respect of the claim if the
defendant was a member of an approved regulator at the material
time.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) But the court may
disregard subsection (2)
if—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the approved
regulator imposed a penalty on the defendant in respect of the
defendant’s conduct or decided not to do
so,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) the court considers, in
light of the information available to the approved regulator when
imposing the penalty or deciding not to impose one, that the regulator
was manifestly irrational in imposing the penalty or deciding not to
impose one, and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) the court
is satisfied that, but for subsection (2), it would have made an award
of exemplary damages under this section against the
defendant.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) Where the court
is not prevented from making an award of exemplary damages by
subsection (2) (whether because that subsection does not apply or the
court is permitted to disregard that subsection as a result of
subsection (3)), the
court—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
may make an award of exemplary damages if it considers it appropriate
to do so in all the circumstances of the case,
but</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) may do so only under
this section.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) Exemplary
damages may be awarded under this section only if they are
claimed.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) Exemplary damages
may be awarded under this section only if the court
is</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>satisfied
that—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the
defendant’s conduct has shown a deliberate or reckless disregard
of an outrageous nature for the claimant's
rights,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) the conduct is such
that the court should punish the defendant for it,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) other remedies would
not be adequate to punish that

marks a turning point. We can move on from simply talking about Lord
Justice Leveson’s report to starting to act on it, with a new

a new royal charter, as announced by the Prime Minister earlier; a new

I discuss the Bill, I should like to make clear what we are not talking
about. The Prime Minister said to the House on the day the report was
published that he had serious misgivings about statutory press
regulation. He—I agreed with him—was determined to find a
better way of establishing the recognition body that would oversee the
tough self-regulatory body that Lord Justice Leveson envisaged. That is
what our royal charter
does.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031839000632" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839000632">Our
proposals will provide the toughest system of regulation that this
country has ever seen. The system will protect the public and ensure
that the freedom of the press is not undermined. Alongside our
proposals, we will include a three-line clause that reinforces the
language within the charter and says that it cannot be

tough set of incentives for publishers. There are two such

regulatory regime, providing strong new incentives to relevant press
publishers to join the press regulator. When they choose to join the
press regulator, they will receive a series of benefits on costs and
damages. However, those that choose not to join the regulator will be
exposed to the tough new regime, which includes payment, in most cases,
of the costs of people who bring claims in the courts against
publishers on civil media laws, regardless of whether those people win
or lose; and exposure to a new exemplary damages regime—we are
introducing a new punitive damages regime for breaches of those

first group of amendments relates to exemplary damages. It will perhaps
be helpful to the House to explain their effect. Exemplary damages are
already available, as I am sure hon. Members know, under common law.
They are, however, very rare, and reserved 
<?notus-xml column=700?>for the most serious cases. They are designed to punish only where there
is no alternative. That general position will not change, but the new
scheme will change the position for relevant publishers in certain
types of cases relating to the media, namely: defamation, misuse of
private information, breach of confidence and harassment. They would
give effect to the recommendation in Lord Justice Leveson’s
report that exemplary damages should be put on a statutory footing for
media cases, with the aim of incentivising publishers to join the
regulator.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031839000642" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839000642">New
clause 21A incentivises publishers to join the regulator by making it
clear that a court may contemplate awarding exemplary damages only in
cases where a publisher has not joined the regulator, with very limited
exceptions, on the basis that a publisher joining the regulator will
already face the prospect of regulatory fines of up to £1
million, as set out in the royal charter. This approach, therefore, is
designed to incentivise publishers to join the regulator by offering
them protection from the award of exemplary damages. However, the
clause also provides that if a court feels that a regulated publisher
has acted in a way that would lead the court to award exemplary damages
but for their membership of the regulator, and that the regulator has
acted “manifestly irrationally” in its approach to
sanctioning that conduct, then the courts may, in exceptional
circumstances, make an award of exemplary damages in that

will get back to him with all the details. Clearly, if somebody is not
a relevant publisher then they are not drawn into the self-regulatory
scheme. They would not be subject to exemplary damages or be
eligible for the scheme. Therefore, they would not be caught within
this remit. We have so drawn the definition of “relevant
publishers” to ensure that the scheme does not catch people we
do not need to catch, and that is why we have been careful to set out

the award of costs should be another tool to encourage publishers to
join the regulator. The new clause would provide a clear presumption
that where a claimant took a publisher inside the regulator to court,
even if the claimant was successful, the normal rule that their costs
would be met by a losing publisher would not apply. In other words, a
defendant publisher that had joined the regulator should only pay a
claimant’s costs in limited circumstances—if

Harriet Harman</B> (Camberwell and Peckham) (Lab):</Member> I rise to
support the Government new clauses in the group and the manuscript new
clauses standing in the name of the Prime Minister, the Secretary of
State, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the
Opposition. The manuscript new clauses arise out of the cross-party
talks, into which I thank the Secretary of State for inviting us. That
explains why hon. Members have not, I am afraid, had much time to look
at them. We all want to be sure that hon. Members have the opportunity
to scrutinise provisions in advance, but because we worked late into
the night in attempting to agree them, they have been brought before
the House with inadequate notice. I offer my apologies for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T20:52:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031839000677" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839000677">I
hope to add to the points made by the Secretary of State, with which I
greatly agree. Also, because hon. Members have not had much chance to
look at the manuscript amendments and consider what they mean, I shall
try to explain my understanding of how they sit with the new framework
set out in the royal charter.</hs_Para>

the Secretary of State has said, the choice Leveson made was not to
impose direct regulation on newspapers as a complaints system, but to
invite them instead to set up their own regulation system and to
encourage subscribers to it, not only because it is a good idea as the
framework is fair and reasonable, but because incentives and
disincentives have been provided. That, of course, leaves the choice to
them—the point of incentives and disincentives is that they
incentivise and disincentivise—but encourages them to go into
the new regime.</hs_Para>

is also crucial—this is a major change—that a new
arbitration system is being set up. Over the years, people have wrung
their hands about how inaccessible the courts are to people who have
been defamed, while newspapers have wrung their hands about being tied
up for ages with the enormous costs that can arise if some oligarch
takes a newspaper to court. Importantly, therefore,
arising<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T20:51:42"></hs_TimeCode> from the
Leveson report is not just a new complaints system but a new
arbitration system. Media torts, defamation and privacy claims that
would otherwise have gone to court will instead go into the arbitration
system. The manuscript new clauses on cost will incentivise not only
newspapers but individual complainants to go into an arbitration system
and not straight to court. There is an incentive for a complainant who
wants to bring an action against a newspaper that is a member of a
regulatory body to agree to arbitration, which will be available to
members of the body and which will be run inexpensively. A complainant
who does not want to go to arbitration, who says “I will take my
chances in court” and who then wins the case will not win the
costs, and costs may be awarded against that complainant. Arbitration
will involve no cost to complainants, and they will benefit from a
top-rate, legally kosher procedure without having to go to
court.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031839000680" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839000680"><B><Member ContinuationText="Guy Opperman" PimsId="5666" UID="13031839001369" xid="1230" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839001369">Guy

the current system, people involved in arbitration can appeal against

high?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031839000684" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839000684"><B><Member ContinuationText="Ms Harman" PimsId="847" UID="13031839001372" xid="254" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839001372">Ms
Harman:</Member></B> The royal charter requires the regulator to
provide for an inexpensively run arbitration service which will impose
no costs on complainants. As the hon. Gentleman will know, things can
happen further along the chain after arbitration has been agreed to,
but the essence of arbitration is that both sides embark on it agreeing
that the arbitrator will settle the issue.</hs_Para>

this will be a great step forward, because it will deal with the
problem of inaccessibility. Most people who are defamed, or whose
privacy has been invaded in what is termed a media tort, would never
dream of being able to go to court, although many lawyers are prepared
to act on the basis of conditional fee arrangements. A free-to-use
arbitration service is therefore an important component of the Leveson
package contained in the royal charter. It is good news for claimants,
but it also means that newspapers will be well and truly incentivised
not to remain outside the regulatory body. If they are not in the
regulatory body and arbitration 
<?notus-xml column=707?>is therefore not available to those who may complain about them, it is
possible that when the case goes to court, costs will be awarded
against them even if they win.</hs_Para>

seduce ourselves into thinking that arbitration is some magic answer,

Harman:</Member></B> I am well aware that many arbitration cases are
incredibly complex—for example, those in the
construction industry. However, one thing that the recogniser
established under the royal charter is charged to do is to see that the
regulator, which is coming forward to seek recognition, has an
inexpensive arbitration system. Obviously, it is not automatic that an
arbitration system will be inexpensive—it could be very
expensive—but the regulator, seeking recognition, has an
opportunity to put forward a brand new system that starts off by trying
to be as inexpensive as possible; it is free of cost for the
complainant but there are the costs of running it. I apologise for my
slightly waspish response to the hon. and learned Gentleman’s

deals with the point about arbitration and costs, and I now wish to
deal with the issue of exemplary damages. Obviously, the bar for those
is set very high and they are rarely awarded. As hon. Members will
know, they occur where the court wants not only to quantify the
compensation for the claimant’s suffering and
loss—mental, physical and financial—but to teach the
defendant a lesson. Sometimes called punitive damages, exemplary
damages are awarded to make an example; they are like a public policy
intervention that gives a good bonus to the claimant, because the court
wants to teach the defendant a lesson and so imposes extra
damages.</hs_Para>

“We are setting up a system and we are passing a law to make all
the newspapers be in it.” The newspapers have a choice as to
whether or not the enter the system. However, the point is that we are
incentivising them to enter it and disincentivising them from staying
outside. They could make a judgment that they want to stay outside.
They could decide that they do not want to go to arbitration and that
they will take their chances with the court. They might decide that
they will be so careful that they will never commit a media tort, and
even if they did, that they would never get anywhere near the
“outrageous” behaviour that would justify exemplary
damages and so would not need to worry about that. I hope that they
will not take the view. I hope they will think that, even if they are
not behaving outrageously, they would want to shelter themselves from
the prospect of exemplary damages. I hope that they will go into the
system willingly. Exemplary damages will still be available to the
courts to award against people who are in the regulator, but it is more
or less a presumption that those people will not be in it. That is a

and the Deputy Prime Minister all acknowledged that successive
Governments have not taken action to put in place a proper, sensible,
reasonable complaints system, not because of the regional or local
press, but because of the power of the national press, particularly the
monopolistic power of the national press. We will have to move on to
the question of monopolistic ownership, but not now because we are
exhausted. However, the regional and local press have nothing to fear
from having good standards and having a complaints system. One of the
reasons why we worked to narrow the arbitration system was the great
fears of the regional and local press. We know that they are facing
very tough times so we do not want to do anything to make matters more

them<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031839000710" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839000710">I

not subject to scrutiny. It does not go before a Committee or to the
House of Lords. It drifts by in a flash, then it is up to the Privy

crawling over legislation that applies to the press, which makes the
press feel very uncomfortable and makes the Prime Minister apparently
feel neuralgic. I do not have the same sensitivities, but apparently
the Government do. We can avoid that through the royal charter process,
in which case there is no parliamentary scrutiny. We cannot have both,
and the choice has been to have a royal charter and a self-regulatory
system, without parliamentary scrutiny of it, beyond the discussion
that we have

that respect, I shall mention one issue which is not the subject of the
amendments but which comes into the question of the charter. I refer to
conscience clauses for journalists. Many journalists gave evidence to
Leveson and said, “We knew that we were being asked to do things
that were in breach of the code and we wanted not to do them, but we
feared that we would be sacked if we said, ‘We won’t do
this.’” Journalists talked of being asked to do
outrageous things but because it is so difficult, and fearing that if
they lost their job they would never get another, they never dared
speak up.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T21:14:00"></hs_TimeCode>Lord
Justice Leveson proposed that the industry and the 
<?notus-xml column=711?>regulatory body should consider encouraging conscience clauses in
journalists’ contracts. The relevant new clause has not been
selected, so I will not mention it because that would be out of order.
However, in schedule 2, on page 13 of the charter, which hon. Members
have had scant opportunity to look at, there is what the Foreign Office
calls a brush past. Basically, this is mentioned in paragraph
4.</hs_Para>

finish on the question of Hacked Off, because people have accused the
Labour party of being its political wing. I would say that they should
think for a moment about what it must be like to suffer the
disappearance of one’s child, as happened to Milly
Dowler’s family and the McCanns. Those people had never had any
exposure to or relationship with newspapers, but found that they were
dealing not only with the most horrific personal tragedy but that their
lives were turned upside down by the newspapers. People should think
about the absolute sense of grief and the inability of every family

together the victims of this awful press abuse, Hacked Off enabled them
to support each other, to be in a network with other people who had
some sense of what they had gone through. It enabled them to move from
being just victims to people who were able to speak at the Leveson
inquiry, which took the most enormous courage. If the thing that one
wants most of all is not to be in the newspapers, stepping forward into
the spotlight and giving evidence at such an inquiry was an incredibly
brave thing for the Dowlers, the McCanns and the Watsons to have done
and, indeed, for people such as J.K. Rowling and Charlotte Church.
Hacked Off enabled them to be not just victims, trying to cope with
their lives, but agents for change, to improve public policy. As the
Leader of the Opposition said, I do not think we would be here today if
they had not had that courage and bravery. Hacked Off helped them play
that role, so I make no apology for our relationship with Hacked Off,

was interested in looking at some of the new clauses and new schedules
to see that the statutory framework that seems to have been set down
for the Crime and Courts Bill makes some changes to the law, but only
up to a point. If one looks at new clause 21A, provision is made for
the award of exemplary damages unless the defendant was a relevant
publisher. But that is cancelled because the court can disregard
subsection (2), and that is cancelled because under subsection (4) the
court is not prevented from making an award of exemplary damages for
other reasons. It rather disappears up its own grammar—I was
about to use a rather unparliamentary term. We might need at some stage
to reconsider the English used in the new clause if it is to be
understood by the people we wish it to
attract.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031839000718" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839000718"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T21:19:56"></hs_TimeCode>The

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T21:20:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman) and I were discussing only a
moment ago—is that we must be careful not to set up two regimes
for exemplary damages. There already exists a common law regime for
exemplary or punitive damages. Broadly, it is available where a state
actor has behaved in an unconstitutional or high-handed fashion, for
example when the police or the Prison Service grossly misbehaves in
relation to someone in custody. That example is perfectly easy to
describe: the court will award punitive and exemplary damages to mark
society’s disapproval of the behaviour of that arm of the
state<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T21:20:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031839000719" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839000719"><B><Member ContinuationText="Guy Opperman" PimsId="5666" UID="13031839001388" xid="1230" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839001388">Guy
Opperman:</Member></B> Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that there
appears to be, in effect, almost a mirror image of the common law
system of exemplary damages? Under the present system, which he rightly
describes, for an unlawful arrest involving a police officer verballing
an innocent defendant, for example, a judge would give exemplary
damages. Surely that would be mirrored in exactly the same way in the
provisions proposed in the new clause. All that might be good, but
surely those provisions would apply on an ongoing basis in any event.

damages does not necessarily change the common
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T21:21:36"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031839000720" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839000720"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sir Edward Garnier" PimsId="3388" UID="13031839001389" xid="221" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839001389">Sir
Edward Garnier:</Member></B> I think that I largely agree with my hon.
Friend. The first limb relates to unconstitutional state behaviour,
which he described and I mentioned, but the second limb relates to
situations in which, under the common law, the defendant has calculated
that the gain he could make from the civil wrong he commits will lead
to greater profit for him than any potential damages he might have to
pay as compensation to the wronged person. The court can recognise that
by punishing the defendant, and deterring others from doing the same
thing, through the separate and additional award of exemplary damages.
Those two limbs of the exemplary damages regime are well described in
the 1964 case of Rookes <I>v</I><I>.</I> Barnard, but I will bore the
House no further on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T21:22:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031839000721" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839000721">What
we are creating is a regime that will be similar to the common law
regime but not exactly the same and that will be limited to
“relevant publishers”. We need to think carefully about
whether we are setting up two systems that are close, but not quite
parallel, for securing 
<?notus-xml column=713?>exemplary damages. While we are legislating to adjust exemplary damages
for the perfectly sensible and understandable motive of encouraging
newspaper publishers, or those who will become “relevant
publishers”, to enter a scheme under a regulator, I wonder
whether we ought to bring together everything relating to exemplary
damages under one statutory umbrella. I say that not simply because I

clause 27A on the award of costs mirrors the arguments about exemplary

sensible. However, we are in danger of misleading ourselves if we think

newspaper, or any other newspaper, that would lead to a dispute

it has a spurious attraction: “Let’s mediate,

a matter of theory, that is a jolly good idea, but disputes come in
different shapes and sizes. One can have the simplest possible dispute
that does not require evidence or looking at complicated documents. I
give the example of the meaning of words. If an article is defamatory
on the face of it, a professor of English does not need to come and
give a lecture about what this word means or that word means. The
judge, if he is the arbiter, or the arbitration panel can say,
“This, in its natural and ordinary meaning, bears the following
defamatory meaning”—end of story. Then the defendant, or
the respondent to the arbitration, can say, “Okay, I accept what
you say and I apologise—I didn’t mean that.” If
meaning is the only question that has to be considered, some form of
early, non-court dispute resolution, assuming that the panel is
competent, would be a perfectly sensible way to do
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031839000729" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031839000729">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T21:34:27"></hs_TimeCode>
us assume, however, that four contended meanings can be derived from
the words under discussion. The defendant newspaper, be it a relevant
publisher or otherwise, may say, “We don’t think that the
words have those two highest meanings, but we do think that they have
the two lower, less serious and less defamatory meanings. In so far as
those meanings are to be derived from the words, we say they are true
and we intend to justify them. We will also go further by saying that
those meanings are not only true as a matter of fact, but that, in so
far as they comprise or include comment, they are honest
comment.” That will require the proposed system’s
mediation procedure to go into all sorts of complicated questions with
regard to the disclosure of relevant evidence, documents and so

see whether that leeway is justified. We are asking for a new way of

clause 27A(5) leads me to my main point. It refers to the Courts and
Legal Services Act 1990. The point about the Act is that its writ does
not run in Scotland. I am a Scottish Member of Parliament. The writ of
the royal charter runs to all of the United Kingdom, which I welcome,
but we have a difficult conundrum in Scotland at the moment. The
Scottish Government set up their own inquiry and asked Lord McCluskey
to look at the proposals that might be relevant in Scotland. The
clauses and amendments we are considering all contain the term
“exemplary damages”, but exemplary damages do not exist
in Scotland—I am also told that “aggravated
damages”, which are also referred to, do not exist in Scottish
law. First, we are passing amendments that are to do with England and
Wales, and possibly Northern Ireland, but not with Scotland, which has
a separate legal system; and secondly, the measures do not even use
terms that would be recognised in Scotland. We have a real problem
because this, surely, is a charter for the whole of the United
Kingdom—for my constituents, and all constituents in Scotland,
as much as anywhere else. We have to find a solution in Scotland that
puts into law the same protection for victims, which is the intention
of the amendments. I believe they are good amendments, despite my
reservations, because they will provide access, protection and redress
for those who find that self-regulators are breaking the
self-regulating code.</hs_Para>

worries me is that there are no Scottish National party Members here at

had discussions today with members of the Scottish parliamentary Labour

Scotland states clearly that we will have to table amendments in
Scotland to ensure that this will cover everyone in the United Kingdom,

the royal charter rather than trying to draft their own legislation

we achieved a solution by all parties coming together, I hope that in

in Scotland to introduce the same rights, access and compensation for
the people of Scotland that will not be available through these
amendments 
<?notus-xml column=720?>because they will not apply to them. That is what I hope will happen. We

an all-party solution. I hope that those solutions will be translated

good thing is that, without anybody, including the Secretary of State,
pretending that the drafting is perfect for all time, those of us who
were involved in the discussions have sought to strike a balance: if a
publisher is part of the system, the presumption—I use the word
in a non-legalistic way—will be that it will not be subject to
exemplary damages, but if it is outside the system, the presumption
will be that it could be subject to them. It is not quite that
straightforward, but that was the general idea—and it was a good
idea. It is an incentive-disincentive system, which was what everybody
was working towards, so I join others in calling on the press to join
up. If they do, there will be a system ready for them to make. This is
not a pre-made system. The starting point is the existing code, but it
will be up to the press to make the system work, and we all encourage
them to do that.

want to make three final points. First, I understand that further
amendments might be necessary. The House of Lords has that opportunity,
and the Liberal Democrat team is certainly willing to collaborate with
Conservative colleagues, Labour colleagues and colleagues from
elsewhere to ensure that we get it right, if we need to make further,
more technical amendments in the Lords. We have time to do it.
Secondly, I join others in thanking Hacked Off, which became the
assembly of people speaking on behalf of victims. It was hard work at
times, as all of us who were in the negotiations know, but it had a
justified case. Its job was to remind us why we went down this road
and, rightfully, to hold our feet to the fire and ensure that we did
not forget why we were doing this. It is about the lives of people not
in the public
gaze<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T21:58:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303197000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0004.htm#1303197000031">Finally,
we have referred to people—the McCanns, the Dowlers and others
have been cited—who suddenly find themselves unexpectedly in the
public eye. The 
<?notus-xml column=722?>other people referred to by at least one colleague are those who become
part of the public commentary simply by their association with somebody
who is in the public eye. That is equally unacceptable. It is the
children, the mother, the elderly parent, the former wife, husband or
partner, the friend or the associate—those people often get
dragged in completely unwittingly. Perhaps they happened to be in a
photograph or were at the house when somebody knocked on the door. We
have to have a system that understands that if there is due cause for
complaint about a politician, a sports celebrity or a business person,
that is fine, but that does not mean that anyone has a free rein to go

my hon. Friend to Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry—to the
evidence he took and the commentary he made in his report. He made the
case that people who are associated with others can get swept into the
press’s undermining or attacks entirely unjustifiably. The
example given by one of our Friends was that of an elderly mother who
is nothing to do with the individual concerned—she lives
somewhere else, in another house—but is pursued by the press,
who go after her, knock on her door, go up her drive, sit outside her
house and have cameras focused on it, drilling her with questions and
trying to get things out of her. We are talking about people who are
totally ill-equipped and unprepared for that degree of exposure and who
never asked for it. Obviously

something more specific, but I understand the negotiations that had to
take place. We will need to return to this issue in the coming months.
As the board of recognition panel is established, the regulator then
applies for recognition. Consideration of whether the regulator has
taken the recommendations into account is critical. One of this

the idea of a conscience clause was introduced into the debate by
Leveson, there seemed to be cross-party support for it. Certainly the
Deputy Prime Minister made a statement in support and the Prime
Minister said he would consider the matter. Since then, the NUJ has
been invited to go off and negotiate a conscience clause with
individual employers. Unfortunately, that has not been taken seriously
by a number of the employers. Negotiations have not proceeded and so
far a conscience clause has not been inserted into a single contract.
This is therefore an important factor to be taken into account by the
recognition panel, and the regulator needs to put it firmly on the
agenda for the future. A conscience clause would be an additional
bulwark of support in establishing the point that we should not go
through this cycle again and that there is a standard of journalism
that we do not expect any journalist, editor or publisher to resile
from. This will be beneficial in the long run. It will not impose
onerous conditions on employers or publishers, and it should be
welcomed as it will ensure a level playing field and a high standard of
journalism right across the profession.</hs_Para>

abuse the innocent, but that exposes the wrongdoer, the charlatan and
the fraudster. I pay tribute to the work of Lord Justice Leveson, and
to the people who have given evidence. Anyone who has ever given
evidence or conducted legal proceedings will know that giving evidence
is a traumatic and upsetting process, and to give evidence to the
Leveson inquiry was a brave thing to do.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T22:05:49"></hs_TimeCode>Credit must be
given to the Prime Minister for setting up the inquiry, and to all the
parties for reaching some sort of agreement. However, it is a truism in
legal circles and certainly in parliamentary circles that last-minute
law is normally bad law. It is a matter of concern that the provisions
have been produced overnight and that, even today, we are receiving
manuscript amendments—only 
<?notus-xml column=724?>in Parliament are manuscript amendments typed—on important issues

hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg).
However, on this point I would disagree with him, because although the
charter has to be brought into fruition through this House, it is clear
that it is part of the common law. Its ongoing interpretation will be a
common-law interpretation by a variety of High Court judges, who will
spend a lot of time decoding, interpreting and attempting to fathom the
provisions not only in the manuscript amendments but in the original
proposals for the charter and the subsequent amendments that we
received overnight. So, on this particular point, I disagree with my
hon. Friend.</hs_Para>

suggest that this is a pragmatic resolution of a difficult
parliamentary dispute. It is an all-party solution that accepts the
fundamental principle that the Press Complaints Commission was patently
not fit for purpose and was clearly letting people down. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T22:08:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Sir Edward Garnier) made
clear in his well thought-out and eloquent speech, the PCC was unable
to handle the large disputes of fact and law pertaining to the serious
libels and slanders that take place in the media. It was extremely good
at dealing with the local press and with low impact resolution-type
cases such as those involving £10,000 payable for defamation,
for example, but it struggled desperately to cope with the large media
organisations and the particularly malign and difficult cases that,
sadly, had to go to court.</hs_Para>

brings me, in the limited time I have, to the issue of costs. It fusses
me tremendously that the position of an individual litigant in a case
will not change that much. The royal charter might introduce a free
process, in the sense that there is no claim form, unlike in normal
litigation, but it will be free to those who are successful, because
they will have some form of protection.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T22:09:30"></hs_TimeCode> problem is
that an individual litigant without means who lives in a suburban
street in Hexham, for example, will still be unable to bring a course
of action against a large media organisation. Contrary to the best
efforts of those on both Front Benches, arbitration is still a complex,
expensive and difficult process through which to navigate. It is also
the case that while simple arbitration can and will be resolved on a
relatively speedy basis, for the large cases that so concern
us—everything from the Dowlers downwards—arbitration will
take months at the very least, if not years, and will cost
money.</hs_Para>

brings us back to the point of whether an individual who is so maligned
by the press will be in a position to bring a course of action against
a newspaper on the present basis of financial support. If that is
lacking to such an individual, I struggle to see that happening. The
individual would have to go to organisations such as the Free
Representation unit or the Bar Pro 
<?notus-xml column=725?>Bono unit. I suppose I should make a declaration not only that I was
involved with those organisations as a mediator, but that, statutorily
speaking, I am still owed money by the Government for the work I did on
behalf of the Government over the past days. That is, however, a side
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T22:10:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303197000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0004.htm#1303197000046">Finally,
speedy laws done at the last minute—despite the massive efforts

always need improvement. The improvement ability of this royal charter
is exceptionally difficult and, as was explained earlier, is part of
the problem of having a royal charter. The difficulty is now passed to
the House of Lords, which has a solitary day to consider all the
provisions in the charter, the amendments and the manuscript
amendments in circumstances in which, I suggest with respect, there
cannot be reasoned debate or reasoned assessment. If we could address
that particular problem, things would improve massively. The reality in
the end will be that High Court judges will assess the royal charter on
a common-law basis and interpret it as best they can—with all

Front-Bench team on this particular measure, which will not be a great
Act that will bring new liberty to the country. It describes itself as
a royal charter presumably in the hope that it will gain the respect
that other royal charters have. One effective example is the one under
which the BBC operates. At one time in my life, I had duties as a
member of the Broadcasting Council for Wales to decide on political
balance in broadcasts. Everything was decided on the basis of ensuring
that those broadcasters who had air time represented the views of the

hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty) rightly
raised the issue of Scotland. The charter is capable of applying to
newspapers in Scotland that wish to be recognised under the system, and
I have had discussions about that with Scottish Ministers. Lord
McCluskey has now reported, and we wait to hear how his proposals will
be dealt with. Like the hon. Gentleman, I hope that attention will be
paid to the views that have been expressed in the debate.</hs_Para>

for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) raised the issue of a
conscience clause, as he has done previously. I think it important for
newspapers and the journalists who work for them to abide by the
standards code of the industry self-regulator. I know that the hon.
Gentleman has a long-standing interest in that. I can tell him that
Leveson said that it was an issue for the industry itself to consider,
and not something that the recognition body should require. As my right
hon. Friend the Prime Minister himself said to the hon. Gentleman in
November, the press do not have to wait for any further discussions or
for the charter, but can start putting the system in place
immediately.</hs_Para>

thoughtful contributions were made by learned colleagues, and of course
we will pay great heed to the advice and thought contained in those.
Although the discussion of these provisions on the Floor of the House
may be somewhat brief, it clearly cannot be said that these issues have
not been given long consideration, because they have been. More than a
year of evidence was given to Lord Justice Leveson as part of his
inquiries and since his report was presented to the House last November
it has had some three months of consideration, on a cross-party basis
and involving other groups, including those representing people
affected by the problems of the press.</hs_Para>

have before us an important set of real incentives that have real
effect to make sure that we can move forward, with today as a turning
point where we stop talking about the theory of Leveson and start
putting the practice of Leveson out for everybody to benefit from it.
The provisions are a crucial part of this new tough regulatory regime
and I commend them whole- heartedly to the
House.</hs_Para>

to legal aid is a fundamental part of our legal system. However,
difficult decisions relating to how the legal aid budget should be
spent are made every day. We must remember that legal aid is not free
and that we do not have unlimited resources. As such, we need
to ensure that the limited funds are used effectively and directed to
those who really need
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031912000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0004.htm#13031912000060">At
present, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 prevents restrained funds being
released to a defendant for legal expenses in relation to the offences
to which the restraint order relates. Before the 2002 Act, there was a
risk that individuals might recklessly dissipate assets through lavish
spending on their defence in order to try to secure an acquittal at any
cost. In 2002, the then Government decided that it was better to allow
access to legal aid than to allow a defendant to draw down restrained
funds to pay for their defence. However, that has led to a public
perception that rich offenders with significant restrained assets are
receiving vast sums of legal aid when they could afford to make a
contribution to their defence. For example, over the past three years
more than £14.3 million in legal aid was paid to just
49 high-profile individuals. Let us not forget that we are talking
about individuals suspected of involvement in serious and organised
crime, including drug smuggling and large-scale fraud, the victims of
which are all too often numerous.

Green:</Member></B> Since the introduction of the 2002 Act, a system of
means-testing for legal aid has been introduced for all Crown court
defendants. Those who can afford to pay some, or all, of their legal
aid costs are required to do so. Although anyone charged with a
criminal offence and facing imprisonment or loss of livelihood is
entitled to legal aid, I think that the whole House would agree that if
the defendant can pay some, or all, of their legal bill, they should do
so. After all, as we ask people on modest incomes to pay something
towards their defence costs, it is only fair and reasonable that we ask
millionaires to do so. As such, new clause 15 amends section 41 of the
2002 Act to allow payment of a contribution towards, and up to the full
amount of, their publicly funded legal aid
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031912000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0004.htm#13031912000063">The
detailed mechanisms of how that will operate in practice will be set
out in legal aid regulations made by the Lord Chancellor and, as
provided for in new clause 16, regulations made by the Home
Secretary, the latter being subject to the affirmative procedure. Both
sets of regulations will be developed taking into account the potential
impact on returning money to victims and assets that are used to
incentivise further asset recovery
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031912000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0004.htm#13031912000064">We
can already freeze criminals’ assets to make it easier to
recover ill-gotten gains and compensate victims, but that often leaves
the state picking up their legal bill, even if the offender has plenty
of money to pay that as well. I am sure that the whole House would
agree that our aim should be to increase the overall amount of money
taken from criminals. As I have said, the full details of the scheme
will be set out in secondary legislation that will be subject to debate
and approval in both Houses.</hs_Para>

The new <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T22:46:06"></hs_TimeCode>clauses
would provide for a number of positive support mechanisms for very
vulnerable witnesses such as a victim in a case of sexual abuse of a

are complex and stressful even for the most able adult. Justice is done

clause 12 deals specifically with registered intermediaries and calls

victim of sexual abuse. An intermediary offers support to a vulnerable

how best to meet their needs and provide effective but manageable

for judges; assigning to the witness a single, consistent and familiar
court usher; and taking into account the effect of time delays on the

The amendment would make no change to the premise of the
Government’s proposals on liability for enforcement costs, nor
would it introduce any new premise into the law. It would simply
replicate a system of basic means-testing that is already in use and
that the Government already accept as a reasonable and
proportionate method for setting fines. It is right that an offender
feels the financial hardship of their given fine and that they are
expected to pay on time. The means-testing system is in place as a
low-level safety net to ensure that penalties imposed do not jeopardise
a basic level of subsistence for vulnerable debtors. The amendment
would extend this safeguard, which is already subscribed to in law, to
the stage where the Government have added the costs of recovery into
the final system. I commend it to the

I welcome the broad measure of support for many—indeed, for
most, I think it fair to say—of the provisions in the Bill. Over
the two days on Report, the Government have, quite properly, been
probed on a number of detailed aspects of the Bill, but the approach of
the official Opposition, in Committee and again on Report, has been to
seek to weigh down the Bill with a litany of requirements to
produce impact assessments or to undertake reviews. Of course,
we must properly assess the impact of these important measures, but the
Government are determined to get on with the task of implementing these
much-needed reforms to our justice system, not to procrastinate and
delay by undertaking review after

commend the efforts of all those who work with professionalism and
dedication in our criminal and civil justice systems, but reforms are
undoubtedly needed if we are to continue to see further reductions in
crime, including serious and organised crime, and drive further
improvements in the efficiency, effectiveness and responsiveness of the
police, prosecutors, the courts, and prisons and probation services.
Our reforms must be judged, first and foremost, by whether they help us

fewer victims of

our economy billions of pounds a year. It will not do this alone, but
in partnership with others. We are redrawing the policing landscape,

criminal justice system treats them as the victim, not as the

the important changes made to the Bill in this House is the provision
to strengthen the civil recovery regime. As well as seeking to
prosecute and convict those who commit crimes for financial gain, we
must also ensure that we use all legitimate means to deprive such
individuals of their ill-gotten gains wherever they may be. The Bill
plugs a significant gap in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 that had
opened up as a result of the Supreme Court’s judgment in the
case of Perry. It cannot be right that someone who commits crimes in
this country should be able to escape the reach of our courts by
siphoning off the profits of their criminal activity to buy property
and other assets in another jurisdiction or to hide away cash in some
foreign bank account. The Bill makes good the damage done to the civil
recovery regime by the Perry judgment and ensures that, provided there
is some connection with the United Kingdom, the reach of our courts
continues, as before, to extend
worldwide.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031912000678" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0004.htm#13031912000678">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T23:19:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T23:19:15"></hs_TimeCode>
have also made another important change to the 2002 Act. The system of
restraint orders under that Act is designed to ensure that someone
suspected of profiting from crime cannot squander or squirrel away
their assets while the proper legal processes leading to the forfeiture
of those assets is under way. However, it cannot be right that those
with significant restrained assets can then qualify for publicly funded
legal aid, free from any contribution. Those who can afford to pay
towards their defence costs should do so, even if their assets are
frozen. I am pleased that the House has today agreed to add provisions
to the Bill to end this
abuse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T23:19:54"></hs_TimeCode>. In
implementing the scheme, we will want to be assured about the potential
impact on the moneys paid as compensation to victims or to the police
and prosecutors to fund further enforcement activity. Our aim should be
to ensure that more is received from criminals, rather than simply to
redistribute funds around the criminal justice

Bill also includes some important reforms to the system of immigration
appeals. There are two drivers for these reforms. The first is to
ensure that the limited resources available in this tight financial
climate are 
<?notus-xml column=755?>focused on those immigration decisions, such as a refusal of asylum,
that have the more significant impact on the persons affected. The
refusal of a family visit visa simply does not fall into that category
of seriousness. No other category of visit visa attracts a right of
appeal and the costs of the appeals process in such cases simply cannot
be justified, particularly when the more timely and cost-effective
option is to submit a fresh application.</hs_Para>

second driver underpinning the reforms to the immigration appeals
system is to ensure that those who are a threat to our national
security are removed from this country as quickly as possible. It
simply makes no sense for those whose presence in this country the Home
Secretary has personally deemed not to be conducive to the public good
should then be able to return to the United Kingdom to challenge the
cancellation of their leave, nor should someone who is being deported
on national security grounds be able to delay their removal from this
country by raising any and all objections on human rights grounds,
which must then be determined before the deportation can be effected.
Following an amendment in Committee, such a person will now be entitled
to an in-country appeal only where they would face a real risk of
serious, irreversible harm if their deportation were to go ahead before
the appeal had been

on this issue, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton
(Mr Raab) for his implacable resolve that the qualified right to
respect for private and family life under article 8 of the European
convention on human rights cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the
will of Parliament on the deportation of foreign nationals who commit
serious offences. Last June the House gave its unanimous support to
changes to the immigration rules for this purpose. I have already
indicated that I now intend to bring forward primary legislation as
soon as parliamentary time allows to establish the correct approach to
article 8 in immigration cases. I am determined that the will of

hon. Friend has also been assiduous in seeking to strengthen the
safeguards in our extradition arrangements. It is vital that we have
effective extradition arrangements with our European partners and
countries further afield. This country must not become a safe haven for
those who commit offences abroad, nor should those who commit crimes
here be able to escape justice by fleeing our shores. However, I will
be the first to accept that our extradition arrangements must not only
be fair, balanced and proportionate, but be seen to be such. That is
why I have brought forward a significant change to the
arrangements—namely, to introduce a new bar on extradition on
grounds of forum, so that wherever possible decisions about where a
trial should be held must be made in open court, where they can be
challenged and
explained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T23:22:49"></hs_TimeCode>. We

I want to mention briefly three further matters before the Bill returns
to the other place. These relate to areas of disagreement between the
two Houses, which I hope can be quickly resolved. When the Bill
was in the other place, their lordships removed the power to confer
counter-terrorism functions on the National Crime Agency by order, and
they also added unnecessary and unworkable proposals in respect of the
adjudication of complaints against bailiffs and the management of
female offenders. These were removed from the Bill in Committee. Last
Wednesday this House voted to restore what was originally clause 2 and
voted—again, by a wide margin—against the Lords amendment
on bailiffs.</hs_Para>

was nearly two years ago that the Home Secretary announced that she
wanted to replace SOCA with the NCA, yet they have failed to reach
agreement on the way in which the NCA should operate in Northern
Ireland. That is a matter of concern. As a result of the joint work
between SOCA and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, more than

terrorism, too, the Home Secretary’s approach is
chaotic. After the Government were defeated in the other place
on their plans on counter-terror and the National Crime Agency, she
told the House on Second Reading that she would “listen and
reflect” on the concerns of the experts, including the former
Metropolitan Police Commissioners in the other place, but she has done
nothing of the sort. Instead, at the last minute, she has simply
reinstated an order-making power to deal with a major change to
counter-terror action in Britain, yet with no reason given in her Third
Reading speech when she had the opportunity to do so. She has told us
repeatedly that she has not made a decision whether or not to transfer
the powers from the Met to the NCA. In that case, why put an

another Christmas tree Bill coming from the Home Office, if not many
more, which will give her the opportunity to do so and to have a proper
debate after she has taken a decision, when she can set out for
Parliament the grounds for her decision rather than trying to pre-empt
serious debate—either in this place, or in the other

forward the proposals on a forum bar without consultation. I hope that

I am particularly pleased that, after a great deal of to-ing and

agreements. I have a bit of a one-track mind on the subject, but I
suspect that this piece of the Bill is going

Goggins</B> (Wythenshawe and Sale East) (Lab):</Member> The Home
Secretary began by noting how much the Bill had improved since Second
Reading. As one who has sat through all the Bill’s stages so
far, I must admit that I found it difficult to remember what was in it,
given the huge range of other issues with which we were confronted at a
very late stage. However, it is indeed a very important Bill, and I
compliment those on both Front Benches on the assiduity with which they
have debated the issues and led the argument, both in Committee and in
the
Chamber.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031924000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0005.htm#13031924000003">The
National Crime Agency is now with us. I have never accepted
the Home Secretary’s premise that it had to be introduced
because what had gone before had failed—I think that the Serious
Organised Crime Agency was an excellent organisation—but if the
Home Secretary has judged that the NCA can take SOCA’s work
forward, it has my full support. I do not quibble
with that for a

difficulty involving the legislative consent motion. We debated that
extensively last Wednesday. It is deeply regrettable that the National
Crime Agency will not be able to operate fully in Northern Ireland, and
I urge the Home Secretary and all Ministers who are concerned with the
issue to do everything that they can. I urge them to negotiate, to
discuss the issue in detail, and to bring Northern Ireland into line
with the rest of the United Kingdom in this regard. As my right hon.
Friend said, it is essential for the same rule of law to operate there,
and for the same resources to be applied to the combating of organised
crime. I know that the Home Secretary shares that view, and I hope that
she will be able to secure an agreement soon so that all those
additional amendments can be implemented and the NCA can work properly
in Northern Ireland.</hs_Para>

Goggins:</Member></B> I am happy to agree with my right hon. Friend.
That is a very important point. Let me put a rhetorical question to
those who are not in the Chamber tonight, but who represent all the
parties in Northern Ireland. SOCA was able to sit alongside the Police
Service of Northern Ireland from 2006 onwards, and did an excellent
job. Why should that work not be continued to ensure that those whose
organised criminality poses a threat are dealt with, and dealt with
properly?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031924000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0005.htm#13031924000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Durkan" PimsId="3056" UID="13031924000122" xid="916" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0005.htm#13031924000122">Mark

last week that some of us made clear that we had drawn attention for a

Office, the Ministry of Justice or anywhere else had talked to us.
Since people have talked to us, the negotiations have made progress.
Let me also say that, unlike Sinn Fein, my party has never had any

will recall that last week I intervened on his speech to observe that
it was strange that the Minister had not leapt to his feet and embarked
on negotiations with him there and then, because he was clearly willing
to discuss this matter. I urge the Home Secretary, in good faith, to
talk to the parties in Northern Ireland and work with Northern Ireland

of moving restorative justice to the mainstream of the criminal justice
system. I know that the Minister shares that aim and aspiration, and I

hope that the amendment relating to women offenders, which was cruelly
removed from the Bill in Committee, will be reinserted when the Bill
returns to the House of Lords, because I think it important to focus on
the needs of women offenders. The aim of working with any offender is
to try to ensure that they do not reoffend and that they can
re-establish their lives in a proper way. The Lords amendment was right
to focus attention on the needs of women offenders and if that is
re-inserted into the Bill, I urge Ministers to accept it as a positive
move that they can work with.</hs_Para>

I think that the Home Secretary is wrong to bring the super-affirmative
order proposal back. I say to her that the way in which this has been
done is not acceptable. She told us on Second Reading that she had not
made her mind up, the Minister in Committee never raised it there,
except obliquely, and yet right at the end it is brought back in. There
is a debate as to who should lead on counter-terrorism, but I find it
odd—it is nice to be able to say this to her personally, as I
said it the other day when she was not here—that this Home
Secretary told us that to extend pre-charge detention beyond
14 days and to get the enhanced terrorism prevention and
investigation measures we had to have fresh primary legislation, but to
change the lead responsibility for counter-terrorism we need only
secondary legislation. I ask her to reflect on that again. I
hope that their lordships will take that measure out of the Bill again,

welcome what I see as the core of this Bill: the creation of the
National Crime Agency. The shadow Home Secretary cavils in respect of
how it is not going to be greatly different from the Serious Organised
Crime Agency, but surely the key difference is that the NCA will be
able to task police forces with carrying out necessary policing
activities in the national interest. SOCA has not had that power and
has been reliant on persuasion to get co-operation from local forces,
and the creation of the NCA is the other side of the coin of the
election of police and crime commissioners. We are making local and
democratic what properly should be local and democratic while ensuring
the necessary central control over national policing, which we have not
really had in this country previously.</hs_Para>

very much regret the attachment to this Bill of what I consider to be,

have taken over both the Liberal Democrat and the Labour party

Labour party was the political wing of Hacked Off, 
<?notus-xml column=762?>the deputy leader of the Labour party did not deny it; she merely gave
great congratulations to Hacked Off on what it had achieved. I am
concerned that what it has achieved is eliding two different groups:
the genuine victims of the press, such as the Dowler family, and a
group of celebrities who would like to engage with the press on their
own terms. I fear that what is coming out of today’s proceedings
will benefit that latter group at least as much as the former.

Drax:</Member></B> I want to speak very briefly on the royal charter,
if I may do so again. As a former journalist of some 17 years’
experience, I am extremely concerned about where the House is going.
What has happened today has been described by those outside as a bit of
a love-in; it was self-congratulatory. When all the parties agree, I am
pretty concerned that something is wrong. In this case, to use a
military analogy, we have dragged a tank out with nothing on
it—just the frame. We have parked it on the press’s lawn
and said, “Here’s our latest 
<?notus-xml column=764?>toy, our latest weapon, that we are going to use to control you.”
What frightens me about this toy is that inevitably, now that the royal
charter is underpinned by statute—whatever people say, however
they disguise it, that is the fact; it is—politicians in the
future will not be able to resist the temptation to slap on an extra
gun, a mortar tube, because they need it to control the press because
the press have done something that does not please the
House<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031924000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0005.htm#13031924000030">This,
for me, is a red line, and my biggest fear. I have spoken to many of
the local press down in my constituency and already, because of the
Data Protection Act and other law, it is a nightmare for them to get
hold of the facts. When I was a journalist, the police, the fire
brigade and others used to tell us what was going on because it was in
the public interest. Local journalists now are finding it harder and
harder to get information from local authorities, the police or the
fire brigade—information which is in the public interest.
Freedom of information requests, which have been mentioned, have
increased because journalists have to use that method to get
information that is in the public interest and which this place, on
occasions, is trying to hide. That cannot be right and it certainly
cannot be in our interest in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031924000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0005.htm#13031924000031">I

this and bring in their own legislation anyway. What we are doing is
purely notional, nothing more. I conclude on this cautionary note: what
we are doing is important for the freedom of our country and for the

Greenwood</B> (Nottingham South) (Lab):</Member> “Nowhere to
go”—that is how today’s <I>Nottingham Post</I>
describes the crisis facing thousands of social tenants in our city.
Why? Because two weeks today the Government are set to play the
cruellest joke on more than 6,000 of our city’s poorest
households. On the same day as they deliver a huge tax cut to the
UK’s highest earners, they plan to take £4.23 million
from the pockets of those people in our city who are least able to
afford it. Whether we call it the bedroom tax, the under-occupancy
penalty or the spare-room subsidy, it is a heartless policy which, the
Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research concluded, will
create “severe hardship” for affected
households<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T23:54:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031924000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0005.htm#13031924000036">Let
us look at the households affected. Two thirds of them include someone
who is disabled, one third are families with children, more than a
fifth are working households on low wages, and many of them do not have
a spare room at all. They include families whose children have their
own rooms. Let’s face it, some bedrooms are so small that they
are barely big enough for one child, let alone two. Many families do
not think it is fair to expect their teenage son or daughter to share
with a toddler, even if they are the same sex, and children’s
education can suffer if they do not have somewhere quiet to
study.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031924000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0005.htm#13031924000037">So<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T23:54:47"></hs_TimeCode>-called
spare bedrooms are also needed where couples sleep separately,
especially where a husband or wife cares for their disabled partner and
desperately needs a decent night’s sleep. Some are used to store
disability-related equipment. Where parents are separated, these
bedrooms are needed for when their children visit at
weekends<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-18T23:55:12"></hs_TimeCode>. Are
the Government really saying that people who live in a council or
housing association home cannot have a spare room for their children or
grandchildren to sleep in when they come to visit? It seems so. People
who have lived in the same house for decades and spent time and money
making it their home all face the same impossible situation: move out
or find the extra money.</hs_Para>

city council was allocated £696,000 to support tenants affected
by the bedroom tax in the coming year. That amount will be reduced to
take account of the U-turn on foster carers and armed forces personnel,

be enough to help all those with disabilities, for whom the prospect of

in office than they had coming in. She knows perfectly well—she
did not mention this, but she knows it—that any incoming
Government, including an incoming Labour Government, would have sought
to take tens of billions of pounds out of public spending. She also
knows that out of public spending there are two big things on which
Governments spend money. The first is public sector pay, on which the
Opposition were very slow to agree with us—they have now finally
agreed—that restraint was required. The second is what is
loosely called welfare—benefits, tax credits and pensions. It is

her debate. The higher rate of income tax in April will be 45%. For 13
years under the previous Labour Government the highest rate of income
tax was not 45% but 40%. If she thinks that a 45% rate of income tax is
immoral, why was a 40% rate acceptable for 13 years under the previous
Labour Government? In addition, higher earners will pay a bigger share
of tax as a result of a combination of measures. The hon. Lady has
chosen to mention one, but if she takes the capital 
<?notus-xml column=770?>gains tax increases and the cuts in pension tax relief into
consideration, she will see that overall we are taking more from higher

case for private sector tenants for a long time under Labour party
policy. The local housing allowance scheme introduced by the previous
Government was, broadly speaking, for benefits to cover the household
size needed. Why is it immoral to ask social tenants to pay the cost of

hon. Lady mentioned Nottingham City Homes. I welcome some of the
measures that it is taking to assist people who are affected by this
measure. For example, it has produced a lodger guide so that any tenant
who wishes to take in a lodger has information about how to do so. That
will not be the answer for everyone, but it will be the answer for
some. It will mean that there is better use of the scarce resource that
is the empty or unused bedroom in social

hon. Lady mentioned HomeSwapper, a mutual exchange website that
Nottingham City Homes is encouraging people to refer to. That is very
welcome because it tries to make better use of the valuable social
housing that we have. Nottingham City Homes ran what I think it called
a speed-dating event to help match people who want to move to smaller
properties with those who want to move to larger homes. It is true that
this measure saves money, but it also leads us to make better use of
the very underutilised resource of our social housing stock.
As these initiatives demonstrate, there are some people living in
overcrowded accommodation, whose voice was silent in the hon.

Nottingham next year in discretionary housing payments, as if it is a
drop in the ocean or a trivial sum of money. That money is being given
to local authorities so that they can assist people on a case-by-case

that. It is noticeable that many Labour-led local authorities have
decided to pass the cost on to their tenants. For example, my local
authority of South Gloucestershire has not passed on the cut to
tenants, so they will receive full council tax benefit. Nottingham city
council, however, has decided to expect its low-income tenants to make
a contribution. The hon. Lady said that Governments have to make
choices, but so do local authorities. Nottingham council has decided to
charge low-income working age households a contribution towards their

forward to the changes we have made, foster families were mentioned and
the Government have been clear throughout that we want to protect such

we think it will cost to protect those families into local government
budgets through discretionary payments, but, partly because of the
alarmist scaremongering about foster families, we decided it was far
better to avoid any anxiety on that point and simply to entitle foster
families to an extra bedroom at the same cost. We have not had to find
extra money for that measure 
<?notus-xml column=773?>because it was there already. We always said that we would protect those
families, and we will. However, we will do so directly because when we
relied on discretionary payments, Opposition Members claimed that we
were not going to support foster families, which caused concern among
those families. Giving foster families a right to a room seemed a more
direct way of providing that support.

sets out an ambitious programme to keep the UK firmly at the forefront

It is based on ensuring that the UK has the capabilities to be at the
leading edge of the design, development and production of wings,
engines, aerostructures and advanced
systems.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1303181000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/wmstext/130318m0001.htm#1303181000024">The

Council held a debate on the proposal for a directive of the European
Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the rail
system—part of the Commission’s fourth railway package.
The aim of the 
<?notus-xml column=36?>proposal is to address concerns about significant delays and costs
associated with vehicle authorisation that can occur in some member
states (although this is not a problem within the UK). The proposal
would also make a key change to the process for the authorisation of
rail vehicles in the EU. It is proposed that this activity is only
carried out by the European Railway Agency instead of by the national
safety authorities within each member state. I noted that while there
were clearly problems with the authorisation process which merited
consideration, these were not causing particular problems in the UK. I
suggested that the rail undertaking could be given a choice to go to
either the national authority or the European Rail Agency for approval
of rolling
stock.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1303181000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/wmstext/130318m0001.htm#1303181000045">The

are introducing a 4% cap on the proportion of their renewables
obligation that electricity suppliers can meet using certificates
issued for electricity generated from bioliquids (with exceptions for
CHP stations below 1 MW, energy from waste with CHP, advanced
conversion fuels and microgenerators). The bioliquids cap equates to
approximately 2 TWh of bioliquid electricity generation in 2017. The
modelling for the impact assessment accompanying the Government
response to the RO banding review showed that the support levels set
for April 2013 onwards are not expected to bring on additional new
deployment of bioliquid electricity generation, however, this is
uncertain and there could be a small amount of new deployment of low
cost bioliquid
generation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031832000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/text/130318w0001.htm#13031832000182">The
impact assessment does not assess the likely source of the bioliquids.
However, to date the vast majority electricity generated through the RO

Vaizey:</Member></B> The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport, has had no discussions on this issue with utility providers,
banks and building societies and other companies, as telephone
numbering is an operational issue for the independent regulator, the
Office of Communications (Ofcom). Organisations operate in a
competitive commercial market and therefore have the freedom to use
contact telephone numbers, which meets both their needs and those of
customers. However, under General Condition 14, Ofcom requires
communications providers to publish transparent pricing information for
non-geographic calls (these are non-local numbers such as 0845 and
0871) and such information should also be included in their advertising
and promotional material. Also, providers must ensure that these
charges are given the same prominence as other call charge information.
Ofcom recognises that the current system around non-geographic numbers
is unclear for consumers, with confusion around call pricing in
particular. Therefore, Ofcom is proposing to make changes to simplify
non-geographic numbers. The main proposals are as follows and more
detailed information will be made available by Ofcom in due

Heath:</Member></B> Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is classified as low
impact by the EU. This is as a result of reports produced by the
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 
<?notus-xml column=394?>based on data collected from all affected member states (MSs). Their
report of November 2012 stated that the maximum proportion of confirmed
sheep herds per region in affected MSs is 6.6% and 4% for cattle herds.
At the EFSA's most recent meeting in February 2013, impact assessments
from other affected member states continue to conclude an overall low
impact and the Commission stressed again that they consider SBV to be a
low impact
disease.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031832000914" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/text/130318w0002.htm#13031832000914">This
concurs with our own consideration of the impact of Schmallenberg in
the UK. The online sheep survey on SBV run by the Animal Health and
Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) after lambing in 2012 has shown
SBV did have an impact on the losses during the lambing season of
2011-12 on the participating farms, but not a large impact when
compared to normal losses on the majority of infected farms. Losses
during lambing happen on most farms whether or not SBV was present or
suspected. A few SBV confirmed farms (3%) or farms with malformed lambs
(12%) were badly affected with large losses of lambs and ewes. However,
3% of farms without any lamb malformations and 3% of SBV negative farms
also reported high losses. Likewise both SBV confirmed farms and SBV
negative farms had low losses. 494 farms took part in the study, of
which 76 had had SBV confirmed by testing as the cause of malformed off
spring and 140 suspected due to clinical signs, that they had had SBV
infection. While some farms with certain specific management practices
lambing early in the season have seen much greater impacts, this is
linked to them having a large proportion of their flock all at the
crucial susceptible stage of pregnancy at the same time when virus has
arrived in their flock. A similar effect has been seen in the
Netherlands and France, which have flocks synchronising their mating
periods. The vast majority of our sheep flocks are not synchronised so
there is no evidence to believe that they will see similar high
impacts. This is anecdotally being borne out in recent reports from
AHVLA vets in the field and the contact they have with veterinary
practitioners.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031832000915" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/text/130318w0002.htm#13031832000915">Cattle
herds have a much more staggered mating period and calves are born all
year round, thus reducing the number of cows at the critical stage of
pregnancy at the same time and lessening the impact in the herd. Data
from other affected member states support
this.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031832000916" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/text/130318w0002.htm#13031832000916">There
have been anecdotal reports of more barren ewes and cows at scanning
following the last breeding period. There are many reasons for animals
not to hold at mating, including the poor weather resulting in poor
nutrient content in fodder, and liver fluke, both of which have been
issues late in 2012. Our scanning surveillance has not detected that
SBV has been the cause of
this.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031832000917" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/text/130318w0002.htm#13031832000917">Following

Border Force use targeting techniques in order to combat potential
threats from canalised maritime traffic. Targeting is a means of
selecting a person or a consignment for examination at the border,
based on trade and carrier data received pre-arrival or pre-departure.
Targeting is used to inform deployment in order to maximise the
effectiveness of limited resources by deploying to the highest risk.
Targeting relies on intelligence and profiles that are up-to-date being
laid over the data received from the trade in order to identify those

recognise that the health of the Department's civilian staff is central
to their attendance and performance at work, and the contribution they
make to Defence outputs. While the MOD compares favourably with other
large Departments in terms of sick absence rates, we are not

‘Health and Well-being Champion’ at a senior level who is
responsible for supporting and encouraging progress on particular

the pupil premium by schools that are neither good nor outstanding, and
where pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds in that school are doing
particularly poorly. In these circumstances, schools will be required
to work with a school system leader—an outstanding leader from
another school with a track record of narrowing attainment
gaps—to draw up new strategies for spending their pupil premium
based on evidence of what works and established best practice. Ofsted
will then take account of the school's new strategy and adherence to it
when monitoring progress and re-inspecting the school. Schools that are
judged to ‘require improvement’ and that do not
demonstrate improvement risk being judged ‘inadequate’. I

Officials are in the process of providing detailed data sheets to every
local authority in order to further explain their basic need

local authorities to the Department through the Annual School Capacity
Survey. The available budget for 2013 to 2015 was allocated on a

Hancock:</Member></B> The City and Guilds report is a welcome addition
to debate around vocational education. Learning by trying to solve
real-life problems can be a highly effective way of acquiring and
applying vocational knowledge and skills. That is why we are
implementing significant post-16 curriculum reforms and consulting on
the reform of vocational qualifications. From September 2013 the
introduction of 16-19 study programmes will particularly benefit
students taking vocational programmes. These will focus on students
studying substantial vocational qualifications, undertaking work
experience and the continuing study of English and/or maths. The
qualification reforms we are planning are expected to take effect from
September 2014 and will encourage a much greater focus on the mastery
of occupationally relevant
skills.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1303191000050" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/text/130318w0003.htm#1303191000050">Young

totalling £844,061 were made by the Strategic Rail Authority to
a number of operators. In 2006-07 a further payment was made by the
Department to a single operator. As explained in the answer given to
the hon. Member by the then Minister of State, the right hon. Member
for Chipping Barnet (Mrs Villiers), on 17 February 2011, <I>Official
Report</I>, column 969W, the Department for Transport takes the view
that the details of this case should remain commercially confidential
as their release would enable identification of the individual payment
and operator concerned. No payments have been made since

specifically for loss of revenue arising from industrial action, and is

industrial action by Network Rail staff prevented an operator from
running services, Network Rail may be required to make payments to the

access in Syria in order for aid to get to all those who need it most.
My noble Friend, the right hon. Baroness Amos, Emergency Relief
Co-ordinator for the UN, regularly briefs the Security Council on the
humanitarian situation in Syria, most recently on 27 February. We have
called on all parties to the conflict to reach an agreement that allows
humanitarian workers full unfettered access to all people in need,
without interference or threat of violence, and have called on Security
Council members, including Russia and China, to encourage these parties
to provide access. We have made formal representations to the Russians
asking for their assistance, through the UN, to enable a cross-border

also include the founding treaties of international organisations, such
as the EU and NATO. In the event of Scottish independence, the

Hoban:</Member></B> The reason DWP uses non-geographical numbers (08)
rather than geographical 01, 02 numbers is because DWP operates a
virtual telephony network. Using non-geographical numbers enables calls
to be routed to the next available advisor with the appropriate skills
to answer the enquiry and best places DWP to meet customer demand.
Moving to geographic numbers would undermine the ability of the
business to effectively manage the significant volume of calls received
each year.</hs_Para>

03 numbers. DWP numbering policy is kept under review, taking account
of any changes to the costs of calling non-geographic numbers.
Depending on the service provider and the specific contract or call
plan in place, many customers would currently pay more to contact DWP,
if 0845 services were replaced with 03 numbers. As a result, any change
to the policy will need careful consideration. DWP has responded to
Ofcom's proposals for the 0845 number range and we await their final
report in March 2013. Their proposals do not include any requirement
for organisations to replace 0845 numbers. More information on this

These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI)
data sourced from the 2010-11 Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses
disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equalisation
factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a
proxy for standard of
living.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">2.
Net disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This
includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support,
income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and
other sources. Income tax payments, national insurance contributions,
council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from
incomes.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">3.
Figures have been presented on a Before Housing Cost and an After
Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Costs, housing costs are not
deducted from income, while for After Housing Costs they
are.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">4.
All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a
degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution
as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in

incapacity benefit (IB), claimants have to undertake an assessment of
incapacity for work called a personal capability assessment. Under the
employment support allowance regime, new claimants have to undergo the
work capability assessment. From April 2011 incapacity benefit
recipients began also to undertake this assessment. The medical
condition recorded on the claim form does not itself confer entitlement
to incapacity benefit or employment support allowance. So, for example,
a decision on entitlement for a customer claiming incapacity benefit on
the basis of mental and behavioural disorders would be based on their
ability to carry out the range of activities assessed by the
personal/work capability assessment; or on the effects of any
associated mental health problems.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>5.
Medical condition is based on evidence provided at the start of the
claim, this in itself does not confer entitlement to IB/SDA or ESA and
may not represent a claimant’s most recent medical condition.
Please also note that where someone has more than one diagnosis or
disabling condition, only the predominant one is currently
recorded.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><I>Source</I>:</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>Information,

The first which affects all three schemes is the collection of
maintenance by direct deduction from state benefits. This will remain
the case in the 2012 scheme and work is ongoing to align regulations,
IT systems and procedures to allow this to continue to happen under
universal
credit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303199001147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/text/130318w0005.htm#1303199001147">Once
charging is introduced to the 2012 scheme, non- resident parents on
benefits will be given the opportunity to make scheduled direct
payments themselves, and only those parents who are
unwilling to do so will have their payments deducted direct from
benefits. This is an important part of the Government approach to
encouraging parental responsibility. We are currently

The second affects only the 2003 and 2012 schemes. Receipt of certain
benefits, that universal credit will replace, leads to maintenance
being set at the flat rate in these schemes. We cannot simply put all
universal credit recipients onto the flat rate as entitlement will
extend to non-resident parents in work. We are currently developing the
details of how to distinguish those universal credit recipients who
should pay the flat rate from those who should be assessed on their
income.</hs_Para>

while it does indeed suggest that there is a pay gap between recent
male and female graduates, the reasons behind this will be complex, and
are not all explored fully in the HECSU analysis. For example, males
and females tend to enter certain occupations and sectors in different
proportions to each other and this can influence the level of earnings.
Also, the subject breakdown used in the analysis is at quite a broad
level; exploring pay differences by subjects/courses studied at a more
detailed level may help to explain the observed differences.</hs_Para>

for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more

Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate
and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have
been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the

Where data is drawn from the ET database about types of claims (rather
than jurisdictional complaints) disposed of, it relates only to
instances where the complaint type reported against was recorded as the
first complaint within that claim. E.g. in a multi-jurisdictional claim
involving unfair dismissal and sex discrimination, the database will
only be able to report on the claim-level (rather than complaint-level)
disposal by reference to the first-recorded complaint—in this
instance unfair dismissal. Assuming the sex discrimination complaint
was also successful, this would not be reported on in the 'Successful

Where monetary awards are concerned, the database records awards made
in each applicable jurisdictional category. The cumulative number of
monetary awards made, therefore, is not necessarily the same as the
number of claimants who received monetary awards. Some claimants could
have received awards in one claim relating to two (or more) separate
complaints, for example. In these statistics, this would be recorded as
two separate monetary
awards.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>

where a claimant is successful at a hearing, or wins a default
judgment. Some information is collated centrally on the number of
monetary awards made but it is only partial. It includes only
information in respect of most (but not necessarily all) complaints
about unfair dismissal or discrimination. Data on monetary awards made
in respect of other types of complaints including those where the
employer has failed to pay wages or make unauthorised deduction from
wages is not collated centrally. To provide it, we would have to trawl,

an element of a monetary award, that judgment will be issued to the
parties involved, and the respondent will be directed to pay as
appropriate. If the respondent fails to satisfy that award (i.e. fails
to make the appropriate payment), the claimant is then able to bring
enforcement proceedings through, a civil court. Therefore the
employment tribunal has no means of ascertaining what awards are
satisfied, and what awards are not. Nor would there be any benefit for
the claimant to give that information to the tribunal, as it has no
powers to take any further steps. As a result there is no information
held on the number of awards that are satisfied, or the number that
remain unpaid.</hs_Para>
