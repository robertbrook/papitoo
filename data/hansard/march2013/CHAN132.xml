want to see more provision for women in areas where it does not exist
at the moment. I also want existing provision in the centres deepened
and strengthened further. Funding may be readjusted for some services;
there has to be redistribution and some centres may have to do a little
more with less, but I assure the hon. Lady that funding is continuing

right to point out that police and crime commissioners can increase the
precept if they think it appropriate to do so and bring more money into
their budgets, but the hon. Gentleman’s point is about the
importance of prevention. We should recognise that youth offending
teams are already doing good work in that regard and having
considerable success, bringing down the number of people who come into
the criminal justice system in the first place. We hope that that
progress will continue, but prevention is a key part of what youth
offending teams do and it will continue to be
so.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13031966000028" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0001.htm#13031966000028">Devolved

issues that has arisen through this process is the dynamic nature of
risk, and we fully appreciate that that is an important subject. None
the less, it is important to look at the need to make the best use of
the skills of the probation service. There are considerable skills
within the probation service in managing the risk of serious harm,
which is why we propose that those offenders who pose the highest risk
should be managed directly. We also think that it would be good to
bring in new ideas from those who work in the voluntary and private
sectors to manage the reoffending rates of medium and low-risk
offenders. As to the point he makes, it will be clearly crucial for
good relationships to exist between the public sector probation service
and those providing work for medium and lower-risk offenders, and we
will build into the system those
safeguards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0001.htm#13031966000131"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3965" UID="13031966001716" xid="43" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0001.htm#13031966001716">Mr

contribute over £20 billion to the UK economy. Beyond London,
the north-west, Scotland and Wales are also emerging as centres of

legal markets abroad and selling the benefits of British law firms and
the English legal system, as well as championing our offer to overseas

of view, NNB Generation Company Limited, a subsidiary of EDF Energy, to
construct two European pressurised reactors, each of a capacity of
1,630 MW. It will also enable the company to construct associated
development, such as freight handling and road improvements, and to
carry out the necessary work to obtain land and rights over land, by
compulsory acquisition if
necessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000291" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0001.htm#13031966000291">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T13:12:29"></hs_TimeCode>

and analysis, first on the policy that underpins the decision. As set
out in the national policy statements that were approved by this House
in July 2011, a new generation of nuclear power stations are a key part
of our future low-carbon energy mix, tackling climate change and
helping to diversify our supply, contributing to the UK’s energy
security. Low-carbon energy projects will also bring major investment,

on the proposals for Hinkley Point C itself, these were considered,
with full public engagement, by a panel of five
experienced planning inspectors from the Planning
Inspectorate, whose conclusions and recommendations I have followed
very closely. I am grateful to them for all their work, and to all
those who engaged in that process, which was completed within the

recommending that development consent be granted, the panel concluded
that the benefits of the proposed Hinkley Point C station outweighed
the impacts, including those on the local communities, particularly
when taking into account proposed mitigation measures. These include
the provision of a bypass around Cannington; enhanced landscaping and
access for amenity purposes; and ensuring that the work force do not
cause any additional burden on local services such as health, education
and housing. In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T13:14:15"></hs_TimeCode>

expect the wide range of mitigations and controls provided for in the
order and elsewhere to be effective in reducing the impact of the
construction work on local people, but I also recognise that as these
works are carried out, those who live in the area may well have their
daily lives disrupted in one way or another. This disruption is, in my
view, outweighed in the final analysis by the benefits that the project
would bring. Chief among these is the very significant contribution it
would make to the achievement of energy and climate change policy
objectives. The energy national policy statements make it clear that
the construction of new low-carbon electricity generation
infrastructure is of crucial national importance.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T13:15:11"></hs_TimeCode> is also a

scrutinising the nuclear safety aspects of the project, with decisions
taken by independent regulators in the Office for Nuclear Regulation

of course, is not the end of the story. Decisions remain to be made on
the funded decommissioning programme and strike price. Discussions on
both these subjects are ongoing and intense, but I expect them to be
concluded shortly. As confirmed in my January statement to Parliament,
the Government are committed to their existing policy on long-term
disposal of nuclear waste and are pressing ahead with plans to identify
a geological disposal facility in order to put in place a permanent

new nuclear will play a critical role in a secure, diverse electricity
supply for Britain and make a significant contribution to the
transition to the low-carbon economy needed to tackle climate change.

the specific point about planning consent, let me ask the Secretary of
State three questions. First, as we know, new nuclear build has the
potential to contribute to economic growth and job creation. Hinkley
Point C alone could require as many as 500 new construction apprentices
and 200 operations apprentices. Last year, the Prime Minister signed an
agreement with France on nuclear energy, but what specific steps is the
Secretary of State taking to ensure that the UK supply chain and the
local work force are able to benefit as much as possible from this
development? Many of the people we hope will be building and operating
this power station are probably still in school, so we have got to
equip them with the skills they need.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031966000303" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0001.htm#13031966000303">We must also
be mindful, however, that any development of this magnitude, if not
properly dealt with, could have a detrimental impact on the local area.
Secondly, therefore, will the Secretary of State tell the House in more
detail what measures will be put in place as part of the planning
agreement to ensure that any mitigation measures needed to reduce or
eliminate this impact are
implemented?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000304" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0001.htm#13031966000304">Thirdly,
nuclear power stations are national assets, but we should also
recognise the contribution of the communities that host them on our
behalf. Last year, the Government launched consultation on the
community benefit of onshore wind. Will the Secretary of State tell us
what community benefit package, beyond what he has already mentioned,
the Government believe is right for new nuclear developments? Will he
also provide a little more detail about how any package would be split
between West Somerset council, which covers Hinkley Point, and other
local authorities, such as Sedgemoor district council, which will also
be affected by the
development?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0001.htm#13031966000305">Given
that EDF is still in negotiation with the Government to agree a strike
price for the power it generates at Hinkley Point, it is difficult to
debate today’s announcement on planning consent without some
reference—the Secretary of State has already mentioned
this—to the financing that will determine whether the
development goes ahead. I understand that details of those discussions
are commercially sensitive, but there has been much speculation in
recent weeks that a deal is imminent.</hs_Para>

of State will know that the length of the contracts, as well as the
price, will face scrutiny whenever a deal is reached, but can he
provide an update on those negotiations and on when he hopes to reach
agreement? He knows that we believe that the process for agreeing
contracts for difference could be improved to make it more robust and
transparent and to ensure that it delivers value for money for
consumers. Will he tell us what, if any, further consideration he has
given to our proposals in respect of the Energy Bill, which include
ensuring that agreed investment contracts are laid before Parliament
within three days of being entered into, provisions to ensure that any
change to the contracts are published and subject to proper scrutiny,
and greater protection for bill payers in the event that construction
costs are lower than
projected?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000307" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0001.htm#13031966000307">Today’s

Davey:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that my concerns
on nuclear power for some time have related to the price, because the
history of nuclear power in this country and elsewhere is
that it has turned out to be expensive. That is why this coalition
Government —and, indeed, the previous Labour
Government—have gone about the third generation of nuclear power
stations very differently from how Government’s went about
things in the past to ensure that the consumer, business and the
taxpayer are protected. That is why the coalition agreement says that
there will be no public subsidy.

Government on finally getting our civil nuclear programme moving after
too long a period of paralysis in this country. It is vital for our
energy security and our low-carbon generation. The Secretary of State
will be well aware that the transmission from Hinkley will be through
450 kV cables as opposed to the current 132 kV. That will
require electricity pylons more than twice the height of those we have
now. Where is the overall green gain if we get green generation, but
the transmission results in a blight on our environment in some of the

Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Spain, Germany, Sweden and
Denmark are all rejecting new nuclear. Even France is aiming to reduce

need every form of low-carbon generation possible. The risk and the
challenge are so great that it is wrong for people who are worried
about climate change to turn their back on the issue. She points to
other countries, but around the world many countries are looking again
at new nuclear. She is right that the two new nuclear power stations
that are being built are over budget and out of their original time
schedule. That is why we are being extremely careful in our approach to

decommissioning past nuclear power stations. That is why I, probably

the mistakes of the past. Any strike price negotiated will take into
account the costs of decommissioning and of waste disposal. It is
absolutely critical that when we agree a deal with EDF or any future
nuclear operator, it must do the clean-up and the decommissioning. That

will know, responsibility at parish and town council level is limited.
Although they undertake an enormous amount of additional work, they
have sole statutory responsibility only for allotments. However, with
the support of district councils and other partners, parish councils
have often taken on other responsibilities. One example is the
excellent work undertaken by Keighley town council, which has taken
over Keighley’s cenotaph and town hall square and done a
tremendous job. I also cite the excellent consultation undertaken by
Oxenhope and Addingham parish councils, which have done extensive,
first-rate, highly competent work on planning and potential housing
numbers. Finally, Silsden town council has a youth council that has
been making a contribution to youth provision in the town, driven by
motivated, thoughtful and determined young people doing their bit for
where they live.</hs_Para>

While I fully support all this work and commend it to others, I
question the actions of a few councils. Hawarth, Cross Roads and
Stanbury council, and Keighley town council, have raised their precept
in recent weeks by 60% and 73% respectively. In the case of Hawarth,
Cross Roads and Stanbury council, the argument in favour of such a rise
appears to be that the Secretary of State might cap such a rise next
year, so it has decided to bank it this year. There are no firm
spending intentions, but the council has taken the money without
holding a meaningful debate with residents. I acknowledge that it has
good ideas in the pipeline, which may merit future increases in the
precept, but residents have been taxed for ideas, and I think that
residents should pay for services.</hs_Para>

town council has interpreted localism as an opportunity to
empire-build. Bearing in mind the fact that its sole responsibility
under statute is for allotments, it has taken it upon itself to
purchase the old police station in Keighley and offer the town a new
civic centre at a cost of £1 million, despite the fact that the
town already has a town hall and a brand new community centre within
400 yards of the civic centre. Sadly, the business plan does not
service the debt that has been 
<?notus-xml column=821?>incurred, so residents have to pay a 72.6% increase in the precept. This
is a shambles, and it is of the council’s own making. Rather
than sting local residents, it should look at its overheads, and

the Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon) has fought an effective campaign

council precept in Keighley. Parish and town councils do not have an
accountable body, so we have a duty to ensure that the public have a
say in any rise in the precept, and a clear understanding of why that
rise has been introduced. Many people are struggling, and we should
make every effort, however small individually, to reduce the demands on
the household purse. I urge the House to support the Bill and give a

different economic climate from the one in 2008, when we saw a
debt-fuelled boom that undermined the strength of the British economy.
The economy is going through a healing process at the moment, and since
May 2010 we have actually seen the private sector creating an extra 1
million new jobs. She should welcome that, because it has given people
across the country an opportunity to get into work. We have seen the
effectiveness of our welfare reforms—230,000 fewer people are
claiming out-of-work benefits than they were in May 2010—and
they have contributed to an increase in the numbers of people in work.

That is the maximum they could lose. What the Court of Appeal said, and
what the High Court said previously, was that we should make reference
to the fact that if someone had committed a first offence, as it were,
we should give details of the amount of benefit they would lose the
first time they did not participate in a scheme. In fact, we have
changed the notices as a consequence of the High Court judgment. The
notice that we sent out said that people would face a loss of up to 26

Court wanted was details of the lower levels of sanctions that could

is a broad consensus that mandatory back-to-work schemes are a

When a person signs on to receive jobseeker’s allowance, they
accept that they have certain responsibilities. It could be called a
contract between the jobseeker and the taxpayer. We will offer a huge
amount of support to jobseekers, including help to search for jobs,
work experience and jobseeker’s allowance. That is our part of
the deal. The jobseekers’ part of the contract is to take up the
help that we offer. While the vast majority of jobseekers live up to
their part of the contract, there are a small minority who are
reluctant to do everything they can reasonably be expected to do to get
back into work.</hs_Para>

some distance from the labour market. We know that we need to make a

Those on the scheme can put that work on their CV and demonstrate to
employers that they are ready for work. That makes a contribution to
moving them closer to work. As the evaluation that the hon. Lady

made clear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T14:16:06"></hs_TimeCode>, the
Department fundamentally disagrees with the Appeal Court’s
verdict, which is why it has applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme
Court in respect of both grounds. We believe it is right that the
regulations should allow for flexibility, so that we can respond
rapidly to improve jobseekers' chances of finding work, such as
trialling new approaches in Derbyshire and London to help young people
get vital experience to bolster their CV. A more prescriptive
approach—the one proposed by the Appeal Court—to the
content of the regulations would create inflexibilities that would
ultimately hinder the jobseeker's chance of finding work.</hs_Para>

are the arguments that we will make before the Supreme Court, if we are
granted permission. Those arguments will not be affected by the Bill.
We are hopeful that we will obtain permission and that we will win our
appeal. There is, however, no guarantee that we will be granted
permission to appeal, or that we would win the appeal. Were that to
happen, claimants who have been subject to a sanction for failing to
take part in the schemes would be entitled to a refund of that
sanction. It would also mean that we had no power to impose sanctions
in relation to failures under the ESE regulations, in cases where no
sanction decision has yet been taken—the so-called stockpiled
cases. If that were to happen, the cost to the taxpayer would be up to
£130
million.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000425" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0002.htm#13031966000425">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T14:17:29"></hs_TimeCode>
is vital that, in the present economic climate, the public purse be

not have to repay benefits lost by claimants who have failed to
participate in employment programmes, and can properly impose sanctions
for such failures. It would be unacceptable for claimants who have
failed to take all reasonable steps to increase their chances of
finding work to receive an undeserved windfall payment.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T14:17:59"></hs_TimeCode> Bill will
prevent that by providing that any decision to reduce jobseeker's
allowance under the ESE regulations cannot be challenged on the grounds

claimant’s appeal rights against a sanction decision remain
unchanged in all matters, apart from those covered by the High Court

they had good cause for not participating in one of these schemes, they
would still be able to appeal to the first tier tribunal on the basis
of good cause. That is a helpful reconfirmation of the right of
claimants to appeal. Similarly, the Bill will not overturn appeals that
have succeeded on the basis of good cause. I hope that our
amendment on that provides the clarification that the right hon.

I support the principle of a sanctions regime. If somebody consistently
fails to turn up for work experience or a Work programme scheme,
sanctions should be applied. However, I believe that sanctions are
being applied indiscriminately. For example, one of my constituents was
a beneficiary of employment and support allowance after they had
retired on grounds of ill health as a result of a heart problem. He was
required to attend a work capability assessment with Atos. During 
<?notus-xml column=840?>the assessment, he was told that he was having a heart attack and the
nurse said that she had to stop the assessment. He got a letter a
couple of weeks later saying that he had withdrawn from the assessment

this Bill is enacted, it is not clear what would happen in the cases of

against sanction decisions at first-tier tribunals, following the Court

judgment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T14:54:47"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government’s argument is that the Bill will protect taxpayers by
saving them a bill of £130 million. May I dare to suggest that
that is denying those claimants their legal entitlement? Taxpayers will
be better served if back-to-work schemes are properly scrutinised to
ensure efficacy and that taxpayers are receiving value for money. That
is a separate argument and has been stated well from both sides of the

can see from the poor performance of the Work programme so far, with
only 3.5% of people referred to the programme finding a long-term job,
that people are more likely to get a job without that scheme than with
it. Is there a £130 million liability that would have to be
repaid? The Government argue that legislation is necessary to protect
the public purse from having to repay £130 million of
sanctions that have been imposed. As I said earlier, however,
significant anti-test case provisions already within the social
security system mean it is highly unlikely that the Government would be
required to 
<?notus-xml column=842?>repay all the sanctions. Section 27 of the Social Security Act 1998
allows the DWP not to change decisions that were only shown to be wrong
by a decision of a court. It means that the DWP could probably resist
repayment in all cases where the sanction was imposed and served before
the High Court decision of 6 August 2012, as well as decisions after

what is the Department’s understanding on whether section 27 of

sanctions? Some 300,000 people will be denied their legal rights if the

the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery). My contribution might pale into
insignificance compared with his comments of the past 20 minutes or so.
He has probably saved me some time, because he has obviously taken to

the inequity of workfare schemes in the past couple of years. However,

want to compliment Department for Work and Pensions staff. We sometimes
forget the job of work that people do in their day-to-day life, and how
difficult it can be. I only have to look back to when I came into this
place in 1997. At that time, DWP staff were doing excellent work and
were up for the challenge, keeping in mind that unemployment levels
were excessively high when we came into government. They took on board
the task of delivering for the then Labour Government the whole concept
of new deal: new deal for long-term unemployed, new deal for young
people, new deal for lone parents and new deal for disabled people. It
made a vast difference to the lives not only of individuals, but of
families and communities the length and breadth of the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:12:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000541" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0002.htm#13031966000541">It
is therefore disappointing when things go wrong and DWP staff get
castigated—it is grossly unfair. In recent weeks, I have held a
couple of welfare reform summits, with some 30 or 40 different
organisations attending. A member of DWP staff attended, explaining
fully the changes that are about to hit many families across the
country. As I said to people at the meetings, “Do not shoot the
messenger.” The member of DWP  
<?notus-xml column=846?>staff explained what would be happening. The fault does not lie at the
door of DWP staff; it lies at the door of the Department and the
Ministers who are pushing the policies that everyone is faced with on a
day-to-day basis.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr Byrne) knows full well
what that emergency legislation was about. I have to tell the House
that it was not in the realm of what we are seeing today. The
retrospective element  of the Bill is galling. My right hon.
Friend knows that yesterday I had certain difficulties with the Bill. I

not everyone plays by the rules, and so there are times when people
have to be taken to one side and told where they are going wrong.

know what is going on out there in their communities. When they see in
their local press half a dozen vacancies and potentially 40, 50, 60 or

hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), who has left the
Chamber, was absolutely correct to make the point that the sanctions
being imposed were wholly unfair, verging on the criminal. A number of
us heard yesterday about someone who was asked to report to the
jobcentre and sign on as unemployed at 9.30 on a Tuesday morning. At
the same time, they were asked to turn up at a new training
organisation at 9.30. They went to the jobcentre and said,
“Look, I can’t come at 9:30 on Tuesday morning.
I’m reporting to a new trainer,” but was told,
“No, you need to come here, otherwise you’ll face
sanctions. You’ll need to get a letter from your new
trainer.” When they went to the trainer and said,
“You’ll need to provide me with a letter that allows me
to avoid signing on,” they were told, “We don’t
provide letters.” So individuals are being trapped and end up
being sanctioned. There is no fairness in that sort of
system.</hs_Para>

for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr
Brown<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:25:34"></hs_TimeCode>).</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000562" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0002.htm#13031966000562">A
very simple principle underpins my remarks: if somebody works a shift
for an employer, they deserve a fair day’s pay for their time
and effort. I cannot think of any circumstances in which it is okay not
to pay employees or to pay them a derisory sum below the legal minimum
wage for the work they undertake. I am sure that a number of us feel
that the Government’s back-to-work schemes have fallen short of
that principle, but the critical point is that the courts have found
aspects of the regulations and sanctions regime attached to the schemes
to be unlawful.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:26:10"></hs_TimeCode>At stake here is
whether it is acceptable 
<?notus-xml column=849?>to use retrospective legislation to clean up the mess left in the wake
of these court rulings. I do not think it is. Instead, I think the
Government should accept that they made mistakes with the original
legislation, take responsibility for the consequences and use the
opportunity to rethink their approach and find more effective ways of
creating job opportunities for people entering or returning to the
labour
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:26:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000563" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0002.htm#13031966000563">Given
that aspects of the existing scheme have been judged unlawful and that
penalties have therefore been imposed on some claimants unlawfully, it
would be wholly wrong to legislate retrospectively as the Government
propose to do. That, frankly, undermines the judicial process and the
rule of law. We might as well rename this Bill “Jobseekers (Make
It Up As You Go Along Schemes) Bill”. Whether or not we agree
with the approach of the schemes in question—I have made it
clear that I do not—the key issue is whether backdating
legislation is the right approach to deal with this. I do not think it
is. One of the main reasons why the courts found against the Government
concerned the information provided to claimants and the description of
the scheme in regulations. As legislators, we have a duty to scrutinise
these regulations, and if we go down this retrospective “policy
on the hoof” route, that aspect of our role is compromised, and
that gives me great concern not only in a general sense, but in
relation to the particulars of this issue, because to my mind the use
of unpaid labour by businesses requires careful scrutiny and proper
accountability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:27:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000564" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0002.htm#13031966000564">I
am quite sceptical about the value of such schemes, not just because if
the jobs are there, they should be properly paid—at the very
least at the minimum wage—but because I have seen very little
evidence that they work. I am sure that many jobseekers will welcome
every opportunity that comes their way, and some might even be able to
use them effectively in the future, but there remain serious questions,
mentioned by other hon. Members, about the practical outcomes of these
programmes. I want to raise concerns about their long-term
sustainability while the wider economy remains stagnant.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:34:12"></hs_TimeCode> are real
fears that schemes such as these actually inhibit recovery. Jobseekers
might not be getting the skills that they need, but in the meantime
they are depriving someone else, or even themselves, of a proper paid
job opportunity. Also, while they are working for free, they cannot be
out there looking for work that is appropriate to their skills and
experience. Many will find themselves stuck in a sector that is wholly
inappropriate and unsuitable.</hs_Para>

my mind, the schemes represent a poor use of our human capital. For
example, they require graduates to stack shelves, yet we have invested
thousands of pounds in those people’s education. They often have
the confidence, skills and qualifications to enter the labour market,
but if they are compelled to undertake low-paid, low-skilled work
instead of looking for more suitable opportunities, what hope will that
give to people who do not have high-level qualifications and who are
trying to access a competitive labour
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:29:19"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000566" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0002.htm#13031966000566">One
question that has been raised today is: where is the money coming from?
It is important to point out that that could well be a worst-case
scenario. Other Members, particularly
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:29:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Wansbeck 
<?notus-xml column=850?>(Ian Lavery), have mentioned section 27 of the Social Security Act 1998,
and suggested that only some of those who have been sanctioned under
the unlawful sanctions would have a case. Also, claimants would need to
appeal, and there is no guarantee that they would all do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:29:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000567" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0002.htm#13031966000567">In
regard to the question of where the money would come from, this is only
a tiny proportion of the overall welfare budget. I am sure that there
are as many ideas about where the funding could come from as there are
Members in the Chamber today. There are lots of other places where the
money could be found, according to one’s political priorities.
My own personal bête noire is tax avoidance, which, even by the
most conservative estimates, costs the UK billions in lost revenues
every year. Ironically, some of the large corporations that
have faced recent allegations of tax avoidance are the same large
corporations that are participating in the unpaid labour schemes. So it
is not just that they do not pay tax; some of them are now not paying
wages either. I suggest that recouping unpaid tax might be one way of
meeting the shortfalls in the budget. That might also bring a rather
satisfying element of poetic justice to the proceedings.</hs_Para>

UK has a poor track record on cheap labour schemes, and we should learn
from the mistakes of the past. As someone who came of age in the 1980s,
I remember all too well the failures of the youth training scheme that
afflicted many of my own peer group. It was essentially a cheap labour
scheme for employers that exploited the hopes and aspirations of young
people desperate for work, and it marched far too many of them up the
hill, only to abandon them back on to the dole at the end of the
scheme. Some were able to use the scheme as a springboard to something
better, but for many, the quality of the training was highly

worst aspect of the youth training scheme was that people were paid off
from proper jobs in order to make way for YTS trainees on 20-something
quid a week. Even in the 1980s, that was a derisory amount of money. It
perpetuated dependency, sucked real jobs out of the economy and created
huge resentment, not just among trainees who felt that they were being
exploited, but from those who had watched their own wages and job
opportunities evaporate.</hs_Para>

several years now, I have taken an active interest in the programmes

A work experience placement is an integral aspect of the

run by experienced voluntary organisations are often the most
successful in overcoming the real attitudinal, confidence and
self-esteem issues that many young people have when they are finding it
difficult to get a job and to find the dignity that comes from work,
and when they feel that society is telling them that they do not have a

a training programme. Recent teams of young people have struggled; they
did well in their placements, but there is not sufficient demand in the
economy to generate the entry-level jobs they were working towards.

the Government brought in their workfare scheme, they made mistakes.
They should acknowledge their mistakes and take this chance to rethink
the entire scheme, refocusing their efforts on creating real jobs for
those who can work. Above all, the Government should step back from
legislating retrospectively to penalise those they

the past two decades, we have seen a transformation in how unemployment
is considered, discussed and viewed. Governments since the second world
war had a commitment to full employment and saw as a responsibility
their role to ensure full employment. There have always been sanctions
within the system to prevent people from abusing it, but they were
about ensuring that people were sanctioned if they refused to go for
paid work, never unpaid work. Now, just when unemployment is at its
highest and it is the hardest time to find a job, the attitude is that
unemployment is not the fault of the system or a failure of Government
or of society, but a failure of the individual.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> individual
is to blame, not the society that has caused the unemployment.

unemployed—the unemployed themselves have caused their own

worth looking at the Boycott Workfare website, which gives example

Interestingly, it is private companies that recommend sanctions to the
Department for Work and Pensions. The worst are Serco, Seetec, A4e and

of people are extremely angry at how they have been treated. I believe
that many are now willing to stand up and say, “We’re not
going to be treated in this way.” That is why the sanctions

young people in particular are intimidated into unpaid work. People who
were brave enough to say, “I’m not willing to take unpaid

sanctioned 
<?notus-xml column=858?>because of that,” have now been proven right.
They were not informed of what they were getting into,

Gilmore</B> (Edinburgh East) (Lab):</Member> The Bill is not perhaps
what some people think it is, nor perhaps what we would like to debate.
It will not end various forms of work experience, whether we think that
is a good or a bad idea, because the Government have put in
place—and have done so very quickly—regulations to
overcome mistakes in previous regulations.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031966000633" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966000633"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>We
need a lengthy debate, and we need to think hard about what we do to
help people find work, if there is work—often there is no work
to find, which is the fundamental failure of many of these programmes.
Whatever we call the schemes or however we dress them up, if the jobs
are not there, no amount of job readiness and training will get people
a job. They might make people readier for a job, which might not be a
bad thing in itself, but it is an illusion to assume that if we simply
introduce a programme and make people do it, suddenly a job will emerge
at the end. It will not, unless there are jobs and demand in the
economy.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031966000634" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966000634"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>It
is the same for many people doing part-time jobs. We have had many
debates in the past few weeks about the bedroom tax, and people have
said, “Well, people can go out and get extra hours to pay the
tax; it will be easy.” In the course of half an hour on Saturday
afternoon knocking on doors in my constituency and asking people about
this, I met two people who were working part time. They both wanted
extra hours and had gone to their employers to ask whether extra hours
were available but were told they were not. Ironically, if firms gave
extra hours, that work would be taken away from someone else, giving
them fewer hours or no job at all. Hours are short because the jobs are
not there.
Similarly<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>, many
job programmes have failed because, to a large extent, the jobs are not
there.</hs_Para>

we should give more time to this debate, because we need to consider
whether we are achieving what we should be achieving.
Unfortunately—and I say this to people watching our
debate—whatever the result of the vote at the end of
today’s debate, it will not stop these programmes. Some people
say that this is a vote 
<?notus-xml column=859?>on whether some of these so-called training programmes continue, but
sadly it is not. I hope that we have further votes on the issue in
future, because the new regulations, which may still be proved to be
not as valid as the previous ones, have been introduced. Anyone out
there who thinks that how the House votes today will bring an end to
all those programmes will find that, sadly, that is not true.</hs_Para>

this were a situation involving parking regulations—my council
introduced parking regulations, which were challenged in court and
found to be invalid—and we were asking, in effect, for a
sanction on sanctions or, in parking regulation terms, retrospectively
forcing people to pay parking penalties which were unlawful at the time
they were incurred, the Lib Dem and Tory Benches would be packed with
Members saying how unfair that was. Even if we correct the regulations,
that would not solve the problem. In the example I gave of my council,
it corrected the regulations and issued new ones, and achieved the
parking restrictions that it wanted, but it did not seek to go back to
people and say to them, “Well, we can impose these penalties,
because we will make it right retrospectively.” If it were any
other subject, we would not see people sitting on their hands, which is
what is happening today.
Much<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:05:20"></hs_TimeCode> attention
has been focused on what the Labour party is doing, and rightly so;
people are right to ask what we are doing. However, they also must ask
what the Government parties are doing, because apart from the Minister,
no one has come into the Chamber to speak in favour of what the
Government are doing, and that speaks for itself.</hs_Para>

number of things have been said today that are simply not accurate. In

Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) has described so thoroughly. I am
talking about the research on the pilot programme. Half of those on
that pilot programme, which was for 1,300 people, were off benefit in
13 weeks, but being “off benefit” is not
necessarily the same as being in a job. After that results of the pilot
was published, there were no further figures on those schemes. No one
has actually said what the success rate of those schemes has
been.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Battersea (Jane Ellison) referred to a visit that she
and I and other members of the Select Committee made to a jobcentre
today as part of our inquiry into the Work programme. Yes, some people
who are providing the programme did feel that their morale had perhaps
been undermined by its results and outcomes and the fact that they had
been told that it was worse than doing nothing. However, those outcomes
were the ones that the Government themselves set for their own
programme; it is not something that someone else invented. It is not
those individuals who should feel that they are to blame; it is the
set-up of the whole programme that is at fault. It is unfortunate that
those people felt that they were being criticised.</hs_Para>

the hon. Lady had stayed to make a speech, perhaps she would have told

course the providers speak up for their programmes, all of them made

more and do far better.</hs_Para>

provider we heard from was putting considerable additional resources
into individuals to get them job-ready and hopefully to find them jobs.
They were putting some people through programmes that cost £900
a head out of their own resources. If those people get jobs as a result
of being part of that Work provider’s programme, no doubt the
Government will say, “We managed to do that through the Work
programme, and it was the cheapest Work programme ever.” The
truth is that it would not be cheap, because those programme providers
are supplementing the cost by a considerable amount. They all said that
if it were not in fact the cheapest Work programme, it could be doing a
lot better. Cheap is not always good; cheap is sometimes extremely
shoddy and of poor quality. As we all know, a cheap pair of shoes will
not last very long.</hs_Para>

of what has been said about the quality of the programmes is poor. I
want to have the debate about sanctions, because the experience of my
constituents is that the sanctions regime has not only been increased
in extent but has lost discretion. Discretion has flown out of it all
together, so that many people are finding that they are sanctioned for
things that they hardly understand. Many people who are deemed to be
job-ready are actually suffering from mental illness or a learning
disability and they are the people who may be sanctioned. I therefore
welcome the new clause that provides for a report on sanctions. The
sooner that comes through, the better.</hs_Para>

ask the Government yet again, as I have before, to look at individual
cases. I raised one with the Minister at DWP questions. A young man was
on the Work programme for a year and a quarter, but there was no real
progress. He sourced a training course—a very good training
course—to learn construction skills. That would have involved
eight weeks of unpaid work, which he was quite prepared to do, as part
of a structured scheme, followed by 13 weeks of paid work and the
prospect of a job at the end. When I raised that case with the
Minister, he simply said, “The reason he is not getting to do
that is the Scottish Government’s funding.” I will come
back to the Minister on that case because that is not so. The
underlying issue is that the Work programme provider could not provide
anything like that quality. In a year and a quarter, the provider had
never offered that young person that sort of training. That should be
the significant point; it should not be a blame-game—“Oh,
it’s the fault of the Scottish Government, Jobcentre Plus, or
the Work programme provider.” That is the merry-go-round that
that person is on; as far as I am aware, unless something has come in
today, he is still on

social justice for me and I have a number of concerns about the Bill.
The issue of retrospection is an important and fundamental one. I
suspect that the Government are opening a Pandora’s box here. In
the debates on last year's Finance Bill,  I heard the same
Minister warning of the dangers of retrospective measures to deal with
tax avoidance and loopholes, so using this route will have
consequences. If he was so confident about the quality and strength of
his argument, why did he not challenge the decision in the Supreme
Court, rather than using primary legislation? Perhaps he might answer
that question in his response.</hs_Para>

is not just an issue of retrospection—the Government's arguments
are wrong. They are trying to justify this measure, but they have made
the mistake. It is an issue of wording. Nevertheless, the Government
have made the mistake and they are seeking to sell their argument to
hon. Members on both sides of the House by saying that, if the funds
are not recovered from those who were incorrectly sanctioned, they will
have to be recovered from elsewhere in the welfare budget. That is
outrageous blackmail; I am sorry if that is not parliamentary language,
but I find that deeply offensive. It goes against every grain of
fairness in Members on both sides of the House. The view I am
expressing is the view that has been unanimously expressed to me. I
have received numerous e-mails and messages from my constituents over
the past 48 hours, all of them asking me to vote against this Bill as
it is unfair and unjust.</hs_Para>

Government, and especially Government Back Benchers, have characterised
jobseekers who have been sanctioned as workshy and feckless—the
sentiment expressed was “Are you really suggesting these people
shouldn’t be sanctioned?” Let us have a look at the Work

“workshy”, but what about wage-shy employers who exploit
the unemployed, with the connivance, approval and funding of the

commentators have severely criticised the Work programme as not
representing value for money, and so, too, I believe, has the Public
Accounts Committee—I am sure the Minister will correct me if I
am wrong about that. Indeed, it has been suggested that the programme
is worse than doing nothing, and I am certainly aware that major
retailers have exploited free labour from the Work programme to meet
seasonal demand, rather than, as would otherwise have happened,
employing temporary staff or, even, giving existing employees
additional hours. The programme has therefore 
<?notus-xml column=862?>had the perverse effect of blocking real jobs, and I agree with other
Opposition Members who feel it should be subjected to a root-and-branch
review.</hs_Para>

one of the most galling things is that
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:18:25"></hs_TimeCode>Ministers have
shown absolutely no contrition or understanding of the consequences of
their actions. That might be because they do not understand the
consequences, because they do not live in the real world where they
would rub shoulders with some of the poorest people in society who are
suffering hardship. People in my constituency in east Durham ask me,
“Why are we suffering for the consequences of this crisis? Was
it created in Horden, Shotton, Haswell, Blackhall or even
Murton?” No, of course not; the crisis was caused by the
mistakes of the banking sector and City speculators. I raise that point
not only because I despise the casino bankers for the state they have
reduced the economy to, but because there is another avenue that
Ministers could pursue to recover the £130 million,
which I will return to shortly. In fact, we touched on this issue last
year in the Finance Bill Committee. Why on earth do the Government not
legislate for a general principle of tax avoidance? Instead of robbing
people who have been inappropriately sanctioned, the Government should
consider the huge reservoir of unpaid tax that individuals could well
afford to contribute to. To my mind, there was a failure by

£25 a week from the poorest families, most of whom are in social

can this be fair, when the Government’s priority is to make
millionaires richer, to the tune of £2,000 a week? Such a tax

intended to train as a social worker and that a work placement such as
the one offered by Sova, the voluntary body, included a requirement to
apply for an MA course in social work. He therefore needed to make that
interview a priority. He had only a day’s notice, which he
needed to spend in preparation and buying appropriate clothing. He
telephoned Seetec as soon as possible to advise that he would not be

Hughes:</Member></B> Let me just finish this example. Mr RE
told me that Seetec was unwilling to discuss the matter and that
nothing was resolved. He found the telephone staff rude, abrupt and
unwilling to hold a sensible discussion. He went for his interview with
the voluntary organisation for vulnerable adults and—as he said
he would—he attended the mandatory work activity the following
day. Three days later he received a letter advising him that as he had
not started his placement on the date originally requested—22
June—he was no longer required to attend. He then received a
letter informing him that his JSA claim, and that of his partner, would
be suspended from 1 August until 30 October last year.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:34:25"></hs_TimeCode> protested that
that was a completely inappropriate penalty because it seemed to me
that he had good reasons for not attending his placement on
22 June that were directly related to finding work.
Furthermore, he had telephoned the provider to explain the reasons, and
he attended the work placement as soon as he was able. I stated my view
that the system was clearly failing. As it happened, in the end, a
review found in his favour. Jobcentre Plus said originally that he did
not tell it of the work placement, but it gave in when he queried that.
Jobcentre Plus has cancelled the
sanction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000674" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966000674">That
was a satisfactory outcome, but it is not the only complaint that has
come my way. The second case is of D.P., who contacted me on 25
January. He told me that three sanctions had been applied to his JSA
claim for failure to attend appointments at the jobcentre. For the
first two sanctions, he had failed to attend because he had not
received the letter in the post. His representative had written to the
jobcentre but it did not agree to lift the sanction. He does not
understand the reason for the third sanction, which applies from 10
November 2012 to 10 May 2013, and feels he has done all he can to
comply with jobcentre requirements but is still being punished. He has
received such severe sanctions that, effectively, he is no longer
receiving JSA. I have not yet received an answer to my
letter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966000675" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966000675">I

fourth constituent was sent to a charity shop. He was required to carry
out mundane manual lifting work. He said that he had a problem with a
back injury, which meant that the work was inappropriate. He has
asthma, and therefore work in a dusty environment was not great. There
was a failure to provide sufficient work for people to do, including
for other people who had been sent there. There was a clear breach of
the rules that state that people are meant to work four weeks for five
days a week from Monday to Friday. The person at the work placement
said, “You have to work on a Saturday 
<?notus-xml column=868?>if I say so.” Clearly, that was not in the paperwork. The crude
point for the Minister is that I am not sure that a graduate seeking
work in finance should be sent to a charity shop to dust shelves and
move boxes. This seems to be regular and routine in the current system.
The Government are spending taxpayers’ money on providing
schemes that should help people back to work. I am not sure, however,

the Under-Secretary of State will make clear, all of these things are
kept constantly under review. We want to improve them and that is what
jobcentre staff do. They are brilliant at that, by the way, and they
get better and better. My point on mandatory work activity is that it
is not just work experience. It is also about changing culture: finding
out whether someone is working and not declaring it; and getting
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:43:28"></hs_TimeCode> used to
the idea of getting out of bed in the morning and attending somewhere
where they do what they have been asked to do, because they have so got
out of the habit of doing that, that even attending an interview has
become a problem for them. This is not just about training; it is about

Hughes:</Member></B> I absolutely understand and agree with that point.
That is fine for all people of that type. In the case of my last
example, the individual had been doing an internship and getting up,
always being on time and being there all the time. If anybody had
checked, they would have known that he had had a 100% successful record
in the previous three months. There was no history of shirking, not
getting up or lying in bed. Therefore, it would have been appropriate
for an interview to find out about that work history, and assess and

ensure that the House is fully aware of what is going on. We will
ensure that there is a clear and loud argument that the back to work
programmes in this country should be better and properly financed, and
that those who have the latitude to take part in them should be asked
to contribute. We want to ensure that more people get back into jobs;
that is why we are in the Labour party. That is the argument that we
will take to the Government over the course of the next few

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Esther
McVey):</Member></B> I want to thank all Members who have taken part in
the debate today, and I will answer in turn all the points that have
been raised. I also want to thank the Opposition for taking a measured
approach in supporting and expediting this important Bill, which will
ensure that we are able to give jobseekers the best possible chance to
find employment, as well as holding them to account when they refuse to
hold up their side of the bargain. By ensuring that the Government do
not have to repay previous benefit sanctions to claimants who have
failed to participate in employment programmes, and that we can
properly impose sanctions for such failures, the Bill will protect the
public purse as well as the fundamental principle that jobseekers have
responsibilities as well as rights.</hs_Para>

to potential employers, and that their personal confidence had been
increased by attending the programmes. Some 76% said that their ability
to work as part of a team had improved; 89% spoke of the benefits of
getting into a working routine; and 81% said that they enjoyed their
work placement. We should all be listening to those voices, rather than

it is not entirely clear to us, whether all the 63,000 people affected
by stockpiled sanctions already know that they have a sanction on the
way. If, for example, they enter work straight after receiving a
sanction that is in the stockpile, and so receive little benefit after
the sanction is imposed, presumably the amount to be reclaimed from
them will be very small. I ask for clarity. Is the intention, in taking
the sanction out of the stockpile and applying it, that people’s
benefits will be stopped for the appropriate period, or is it—

is in the impact assessment that the Government have produced, which
distinguishes between the amount that would be incurred because of
people who were sanctioned before 6 August 2012 and the amount incurred
in respect of people sanctioned since the court case, because those
sanctions have been stockpiled.</hs_Para>

part of the impact assessment that contains those figures says that, by
the look of it—to take the upper valuation—£24

stockpiled. The CPAG view would be that of the £130 million,
£106 million or £107 million would not apply,
because of the Social Security Act 1998, whereas £24
million—the stockpiled sanctions—would. As I said, I am
sure that the Department’s advice is different from the advice
given to us by the CPAG, but it would be helpful if the Minister
provided clarification so that we know the basis on which the measure

would say again to the Minister that this is a helpful amendment. I do
not think that it changes the position substantively, but it helps to

a stockpiled sanction will, as usual, have the opportunity to ask for a
reconsideration and perhaps subsequently to appeal. That is a welcome
clarification, and I am grateful to the Minister for providing it, but

Gentleman has made a couple of points. In respect of payments where
decisions have been stockpiled, when we received the High Court
judgment, we did not proceed to make any further sanctions decisions,
but claimants who were subject to a stockpiled decision are aware of
that: we made it clear at the time, so they know what to expect.
However, he asked whether we would recover sanctions from those who are
in work now. The answer is no, we would not. That is a policy that we
adopt elsewhere. We want to encourage people to do the right thing, and
doing the right thing in this case is getting back into work.</hs_Para>

Section 27 of the Social Security Act 1998 applies only when a

(3) requires the Secretary of State to lay a copy of the resulting

requests. It is important to say that as a Department, we keep the
functioning of sanctions under review. A number of comments on that
were made on Second Reading. It is important to ensure that sanctions
are applied fairly and consistently across Jobcentre Plus. It is an
important part of the regime, so the sanction should be credible, and
something that we keep under review.</hs_Para>

me pre-empt the arguments made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:26:02"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul Goggins). I understand the
purpose of his two amendments. He is keen to ensure that the review is
expedited, and we will try to complete it as quickly as possible. The
time period for someone to launch an appeal against the sanction is 13
months. By imposing a six-month deadline, we might miss appeals that
are made at a later point. He then requires a report to be laid within
three months of the end of the six-month period, so that is nine
months. There is a risk that we will miss out on three months’
worth of appeals, so we would not necessarily get a full 
<?notus-xml column=879?>view of how the sanctions under the Bill have operated. Although I
understand his arguments for haste, may I suggest, as a counter
argument, that we take things at a slightly more leisurely pace, which
will ensure that we get a full year? None the less, I share his view
that once we get to the end of that year, we should be moving as
quickly as possible to complete the review and to lay the report before
Parliament. It is not in any of our interests unduly to delay a measure
such as this. I commend new clause 1 to the
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:27:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966001095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001095"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Timms" PimsId="4291" UID="13031966002386" xid="593" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966002386">Stephen

State for Work and Pensions, and me and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:27:52"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr Byrne). It is
something genuinely valuable to emerge from this debacle, which has
been entirely of the Government’s own making. We do need to know
what is going on with sanctions. The independent review,
which is required by the new clause to be conducted over the coming
year—I will comment in a moment on the further amendments
proposed by my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:28:22"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul
Goggins)—could be crucial in getting to the bottom of what is
going on. From the standpoint of anyone who is concerned about what is
going on in our social security system, as very many people are, this
is a valuable
initiative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:28:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966001096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001096">The
scale of the sanctions that are being imposed at the moment is
extraordinary.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:28:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) made that point in
the earlier debate. He correctly suggested to the House that the number
of sanctions being issued trebled in the two years between the period
just before the general election and subsequently to more than half a
million per year, and that number is still going up. The impact
assessment tells us that the number of sanctions that has been issued
under the defective—as we now know them to be—employment,
skills and enterprise regulations is “between 221,000 and
259,000”; that those sanctions involved between 136,000 and
159,000 people and that their cumulative value is between
£80 million and £99
million.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13031966001619" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001619">5.30

first thing that puzzles me is why the Government do not know how many
sanctions have been issued. It seems pretty strange to me that all they
can tell us is that somewhere between 221,000 and 259,000 have been
issued. Surely the systems in the Minister’s Department are
sufficiently robust to tell us how many there have been, rather than
our being given that wide range—there is a difference of almost
40,000 between the low point and the high point. I am puzzled as to why
the Department cannot tell us precisely how many sanctions have been
issued. After all,
we<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:30:35"></hs_TimeCode> are not
talking about minor matters: the average value is some hundreds of
pounds, so it is not unreasonable to expect the Department to know
precisely how many of these things it has handed out.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031966001098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001098">Looking at
the figure of up to 160,000, I ask, why is the number so large? We are
told in the impact assessment and other information on this Bill that
90% of the people on whom sanctions have been applied are on the Work
programme. The figure that I quoted relates to the period before cases
were stockpiled—the period 
<?notus-xml column=880?>before 6 August last year. Up to last July, 877,880 people
were referred to the Work programme, so slightly more than that will
have been referred up until 6 August. Comparing those two figures
suggests that 15% of those who have been referred to the
Work programme have been sanctioned.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031966001099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001099">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:34:42"></hs_TimeCode>
is a surprisingly large figure—almost one in six of those
referred to the programme have had a sanction imposed on them. It would
be helpful to know, and I hope that the independent review will be able
to tell us, what those sanctions are for exactly. Why is it that the
requirements being imposed on people by the Work programme are
apparently so unpopular? The numbers are bigger than in the past. Is it
because the Work programme is much more irksome than previous
provision, or is it because the system has become far more
trigger-happy over sanctions? We need to know the answer to that
question.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031966001100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001100">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:33:05"></hs_TimeCode>
sums involved are not small. Again, the impact assessment tells us that
the average value of one of these sanctions—we should bear it in
mind that we are talking about people who depend on benefit for their
income, so we are not talking about well-off people—is between
£600 and £800 in the case of mandatory work activity.
That is a huge sum to take away from someone who depends on benefit for
their livelihood.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031966001101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001101">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:33:37"></hs_TimeCode>
is becoming clear is that the proliferation of sanctions—the
very large increase in the number of sanctions being
imposed, and the increase in the size of the sanctions being
levied—is one of the principal drivers in the growth of demand
for food banks throughout the country. The chief executive of the
Trussell Trust, the impressive organisation behind the explosive growth
in Church-based food banks over the past few years—it is opening
three new food banks per week and there are now well over 300 of them
across the country—said in a statement that appeared in the
press yesterday that in 2009-10 the trust had about 29,000 referrals of
people to food banks, but in 2012-13 the figure will be almost 300,000.
That is a tenfold rise in three years, and the number is still growing
fast. The Trussell Trust reports that about 40% of referrals to food
banks result from Jobcentre Plus mistakes or delays. It also makes the
relevant point for this debate that Jobcentre Plus performance is
clearly getting worse.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031966001102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001102"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:35:15"></hs_TimeCode>Beyond
that Trussell Trust statement, people running food banks say that
sanctions are a big driver. They say that people often have no idea why
they are being sanctioned; all they know is that their money has
stopped and, as they have none to buy food with, they have to go along
to the food bank to get some help. According to the impact assessment
for the Bill, the number of sanctions is up to 260,000, and the number
of people affected is up to 160,000. Meanwhile, the number of people
going to food banks is up from 30,000 three years ago to 300,000 now.
The order of magnitude is comparable. The people running food banks
often report that the increase in sanctions has been a very big driver
in the growing recourse to food banks around the country over the last
three years, and that certainly appears to me to be the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:36:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Timms:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting and
telling point. Why, indeed, do people not go to jobcentres to get an
explanation? The reason is that it is very difficult for them to get
through on the telephone, and if they do go and speak to somebody, they
probably do not get a clear
explanation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:37:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966001105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001105">The
Minister said in one of our recent statutory instrument Committees that
Jobcentre Plus will now inform people in writing of the reason for
their sanction. When the Minister responds, he will, perhaps, give us a
little more information. I am not sure whether that has already started
or whether it is still due to happen, but it will certainly be a
welcome step. The hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart) will be very
familiar with the experience that I have often come across, however,
which is that people do receive a letter from Jobcentre Plus, but,
frankly, making sense of it is very difficult. I hope that the written
explanations people receive will make more sense than some of the other
communications they bring to our surgeries, sent to them by jobcentres
and the
Department<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:38:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966001106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001106">I

we need to know the precise figures. It is not good enough for us to be
told the Department has issued between 221,000 and 259,000 sanctions.
We need to know precisely how many have been imposed. We also need to
know what exactly they are for. Is it that people are failing to turn
up to appointments, or that they are failing to do the work-related
activity they are required to do? We need to be given some clear
categories as to the grounds for sanction, and then to be told how many
of the sanctions imposed fall into each of those categories. How tough
are those sanctions? How many maximum three-year sanctions for the
basic element of jobseeker’s allowance have been imposed so far?
In the recent debate on JSA regulations, a colleague rightly reaffirmed
our opposition to the three-year sanction introduced by the Government.
It would be useful to know how many people have so far been denied
benefit for a full three years, which the Government’s
legislative change now makes possible.</hs_Para>

need to know how many people on whom the sanctions are imposed request
reconsiderations —the kind of people who, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Beckenham suggests, might go along to the jobcentre and ask what
the sanction arises from. How many people have asked for
reconsideration, and when it has been refused, how many subsequently
appealed? What are the outcomes when reconsiderations are requested and
appeals made?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031966001109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001109">Thirdly, we
need the independent reviewer’s opinion as to whether the
reconsideration and appeal process is working correctly and properly.
When people have a sanction imposed on them, do they know that they can

<?notus-xml column=882?>apply for reconsideration and, if they are not happy with the outcome,
submit an appeal? Is that whole process working correctly?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031966001110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001110">Fourthly, how
many of those being sanctioned are on employment and support
allowance—and perhaps other benefits as well—rather than
JSA? Ministers have given commitments during debates in this House and
the other place that they will not normally issue sanctions to somebody
on ESA—somebody who is out of work on health grounds, for
example—other than after a face-to-face discussion with the
applicant and, if necessary, a home visit. We need to know from the
independent reviewer whether those assurances are being honoured in
practice. It does not require much imagination on the part of Members
to realise that it may well be wholly inappropriate to impose a
sanction on someone who is on ESA as a result of a serious mental
health problem or a fluctuating health problem of the kind we have
often debated in the past couple of years, thereby removing their
benefit for the potentially very long periods that are now permissible,
unless they have had a proper face-to-face discussion with an

the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Beckenham made a few minutes ago—but we need to know it. To
what extent do people understand the reasons for the sanctions being
imposed on them? As I mentioned earlier, food banks are reporting that
people who turn up, having been sanctioned—who therefore do not
have any money and cannot buy food for themselves and their
families—commonly do not know why the sanction has been imposed.
I hope that the independent reviewer can establish how widespread a
problem that is. If it is widespread, as anecdotal evidence suggests it
may well be, that is a serious difficulty with the system.</hs_Para>

Minister will know that there are reports and growing numbers of
complaints that some sorts of targets are being applied in jobcentres.
The independent reviewer could get to the bottom of what is going on
and tell us whether that is the case. Two years ago, there were press
reports about targets for sanctions being set in Jobcentre Plus
districts. When those reports were published, the Secretary of State
rightly made it clear that he had no wish to see any such practice in
jobcentres and told everybody that it should stop forthwith. I wonder
whether it has stopped or whether it is creeping back into the
jobcentre network. The independent reviewer 
<?notus-xml column=883?>could perform a valuable service by telling us whether sanction targets
of any form are in place in parts of the jobcentre
network<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:46:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966001115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001115">The
eighth thing that we need to know is what people who have been
sanctioned are doing for support. How big a factor are sanctions in the
growth of charitable food banks? As I have suggested, the numbers show
a striking similarity in the order of magnitude. Are there other things
that people do for support, because clearly they still have to obtain
food and to

ninth question for the independent reviewer concerns how the hardship
provisions are working in practice, including the requirement that
hardship payments need to be repaid by those who benefit from them.
Provisions were written into the Welfare Reform Act 2012, which we
debated when they were passed, for hardship payments to be made when
people would otherwise face serious hardship. Are those provisions
being taken up? Are people receiving hardship payments? Are they being
required to repay them later and are they doing so? A significant chunk
of work needs to be done on that

tenth question and the last that I want to suggest, although other
Members may want to raise others matters, is perhaps the most important
of all. How effective are the sanctions in changing people’s
behaviour as they are intended to? That is supposed to be the intention
of sanctions, not just getting money off people—I certainly hope
that that is not the wish of Ministers. The purpose of sanctions is to
encourage people to take steps that will lead to their getting into
employment. The independent reviewer could do a great service by
assessing whether the sanctions are effective in encouraging people to
do the right thing and get a
job.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966001118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001118">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:49:01"></hs_TimeCode>

moment. He campaigns effectively on behalf of his constituents, and
thinks carefully about these matters. The Committee will understand why
he is calling for a shorter time scale for the measure that new clause
1 will include in the Bill. Will the Minister help the Committee by
indicating whether he would welcome an interim report from the
reviewer, perhaps after six months, on the way to the 12-month period
envisaged in the new clause? It is not necessary for the reviewer to
say nothing for 12 months and only then say what their work has

quick piece of work. The 10 points that I set out, which I

pieces of work—including research—to be carried out among
those on the receiving end of sanctions. In many ways I would welcome a
proposal for such work to continue beyond the 12-month period envisaged
in the new clause. We are dealing with the culture in jobcentres, and
such 
<?notus-xml column=884?>work will not be done and finished and that will be the end of it: we
need continued scrutiny of the sanctions contained in the Welfare
Reform Act 2012, and I caution my right hon. Friend about seeking too
speedy a piece of work. He is right to suggest that having some
findings from the independent reviewer within six months would be
helpful to the House—and probably to Ministers as
well—but it is likely that the full work required will take at
least 12 months, as envisaged in the new

me say at the outset of my short contribution that I am in favour of,
and not opposed to, sanctions. If we offer something to young people
and others who are out of work, we need effective sanctions to back
that up. Unfortunately, however, at the moment we do not have a proper
offer for young people and others who are out of work, and that is part
of the problem. It is important for sanctions to be fair and lawful,
yet we heard in earlier debates this afternoon that the Court found the
regulations and notice to be unlawful, which is why the Government have
introduced this Bill.</hs_Para>

Friend mentioned the large numbers of people who are being sanctioned.
All hon. Members know from their work in their constituencies of the
increasing number of sanctions cases. We take a view on how fair or
unfair those sanctions are, but I increasingly question the quality of
decisions. A number of my hon. Friends have referred specifically to
representations they have made to the Department for Work and Pensions
on looking at decisions again because they were plainly unfair. In many
cases, the decision is overturned, because any common-sense look at
them would tell us that the decision was wrong. There are serious
questions to be asked about both the quantity and the quality of
sanctions. It is important that the review takes place—it is a
welcome concession in the discussions between those on the Front

In one or two cases even in my constituency, which is relatively

an interim report after six months, so that Parliament and the public

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:04:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Beckenham (Bob Stewart) made a point about illiteracy. In the
poorer areas of the country, in constituencies such as mine, there are
still significant problems relating to illiteracy, because people have
poor reading or writing skills, or perhaps cannot read. That impacts on
people’s ability to interact with the system and unfairly works
against them. Whether they are former soldiers or other people, it is a
problem that has not been properly addressed. I hope that the review
will consider that as well.</hs_Para>

Minister said—that this has to be done properly—but I see
no reason why an interim review could not be carried out. We need to

penalised. We need to look at the system and get it changed as quickly

example, of the person how leaves the envelope behind the clock in the
hope that it will go away. We have to deal with this matter seriously,
therefore, and separate those people from the people the Minister is

Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul Goggins) on the
speed of the proceedings, but I also want to add another question for
the reviewer to consider. Shortly after I had tabled that question, I
asked the Minister about assaults on jobcentre staff. If we compare the
period from October 2012 to January 2013 with the period a year earlier
from October 2011 
<?notus-xml column=889?>to January 2012, we see that the number of assaults on jobcentre staff
increased from 76 to 98.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:13:36"></hs_TimeCode>The seriousness
of the assaults increased as well. In the first period, there were
three that resulted in cuts and bruises, and three that resulted in
more than cuts and bruises. A year later, 13 had resulted in cuts and
bruises, with eight resulting in more.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031966001154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001154">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:14:12"></hs_TimeCode>
fear—although I do not know for certain—that those
increases in assaults on jobcentre staff are a product of frustrated
claimants who have been sanctioned. It has been pointed out that they
do not always know why they have been sanctioned. If the sanctions
regime is resulting in this kind of behaviour—as I have said, I
do not know whether that is the case—it would be appropriate for
a reviewer to consider whether the regime has consequences for the
safety of jobcentre staff. If there are consequences for the safety of
the people responsible for giving claimants explanations, their
explanations might become less clear and they might retreat behind
letters rather than actually talking to
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966001155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001155">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:14:50"></hs_TimeCode>

failures; 378,000 sanctions were of fixed length, which included 58,000
that were for not attending ESE—employment, skills and
enterprise—regulation schemes, 55,000 for not complying with

there is a tension here between clarity and disclosure. The more detail
there is in the letter—maybe to comply with what is in the

sanctions. As my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

Ministers to think again and take responsibility for the mistakes that
have been made and to step back from a scheme that relies on unpaid
labour. It is not helping people to find real jobs, it is actively
preventing real job creation and it is 
<?notus-xml column=894?>undermining efforts from people in the voluntary sector and elsewhere,

The Secretary of State says not true. Should the day ever arrive when
universal credit began to be delivered, we would all be in a position

second issue is important. We are dealing with an attitude of mind
whereby there is a feeling that, even without ever making a
contribution, a person has a right to benefits and to a pension from
other taxpayers. That attitude is now deeply ingrained in our culture,
and the Secretary of State’s welfare reforms and universal
credit will encourage it. Under his scheme, more people will think they
have a right to benefits than do now. Many of us, even those in areas
with high unemployment, know that there are people, particularly young
people, who feel that unless they will be offered jobs at three 
<?notus-xml column=895?>times their benefit level, it is not in their interest to
work. That is why it is so important to

are trying to move from unconditional welfare to welfare that attaches
conditions to drawing benefits. The last Government started those
important reforms, and we continue to support them. The big divide has
been between a welfare state based on contributions, in which people
are eligible for benefit only if they have paid the requisite number of
contributions, and one in which people think that they should get
benefits because they are citizens. The Secretary of State may continue
his conversation, but he knows full well that as he tries to limit the
entry of Bulgarians and Romanians into our welfare system, the weakness
of his hand is that they will be able to claim benefit here, because
large numbers of other people do, and we will be discriminating unless
we give them benefit on the same
terms.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966001204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001204">The
lesson that I hope we will draw is that the Opposition will go into the
election with a clear mandate to move from a means-tested welfare
system, in which people think that they have a right to benefits, to
one in which people gain entrance to welfare because they have paid
contributions. The difference is in job offers and job guarantees. The
most crucial welfare reform that the last Labour Government made was
the future jobs fund, which was destroyed by this Government when they
came into office. If we are to build up a medley of worthwhile
alternatives for people who cannot find jobs, we the Opposition and the
Government must play some part in creating those
opportunities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031966001205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0003.htm#13031966001205">There
is debate on both sides of the House about the best routes back to full
employment, but no certainty about what they are. In the immediate
future, therefore, we will have to rely on an even more severely
tightened future jobs fund than the Labour Government did. We know from
our constituencies that the real test of whether people want to work is
to have jobs to offer them. Without those, we are in difficulties. That
is not to say that we would not sanction without them. London, for
example, has the second highest youth unemployment, but in 10 years of
Labour government, 1 million immigrants came to London to work. There
is clearly some problem in people’s thinking about what is
suitable for them to do versus what is suitable for
immigrants.</hs_Para>

Secondly, like them, we are moving away from an unconditional welfare

something like the future jobs fund, so our constituents are offered
real opportunities to work. I hope that those of us who have Labour
authorities or even decent Tory or Liberal authorities, despite their

the purposes of the payment of additional salaries. The first
determination of salaries for Members by IPSA will take effect from 1
April 2013. That determination by IPSA provides for a 1% increase in
the salary of Members in April 2013 and a further 1% increase in April
2014. IPSA further determined that the additional salary payable to
specified holders will also receive a 1% increase. The motion will
ensure that this increase is payable to the specified office holders to
whom an additional salary is paid. It will also allow IPSA to make
further determinations, without the need for any intervention of the
House, although IPSA is required by statute to consult and then to
publish its
determination.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031970000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0004.htm#13031970000013">The

Broadbent drew attention to the following unsatisfactory way in which
the FOS acted. After downloading the FOS standard PPI claim form, a
client completed it. He answered the questions honestly in the form of
tick boxes, and stated that he did not recall the sale process. The
claim was declined, yet nine months later a CMC made the same complaint
on behalf of the same client. In this case all the boxes were ticked,
stating that the client had a clear recollection of the sales process
and how the product was mis-sold. That was not considered a vexatious
complaint and it is being considered by the FOS. It says that it must
ignore the original complaint and review it on the basis of the claim
submitted by the CMC.

FOS does good work resolving disputes in many areas, but its ability to
deal appropriately with PPI disputes is compromised by the sheer volume
of complaints it receives. Last year, complaints about PPI made up 60%
of all complaints dealt with by the FOS, yet CMCs made no contribution
to the running costs of the FOS. Greater control over CMCs, and a
system where they will be charged for making unsuccessful claims, would
help free up the FOS to deal more effectively with other matters in its

down CMCs that deliberately submit vexatious claims, but the number of
claims companies is too high for the regulator to keep up. The number
of companies is rising—it has doubled in the past two years to
more than 3,000. The competition between them results in more vexatious
claims and ever more aggressive tactics. In the years 2011-12, the
regulator undertook only 150 visits and audits of firms, which is fewer
than 5% of authorised
CMCs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031970000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0004.htm#13031970000051">I
would be grateful if the Minister responded to a number of questions in
her reply. Does she support the call of Which? for improved regulation
of CMCs? Will she take steps to ban cold calling and cold texting? Will
she take action to ensure that, in any advertisement, CMCs make clear
to the client the benefit of their taking their claim directly, without
intermediary, to the FOS? Will she place a duty on CMCs to ensure that
the claims they submit contain accurate information? Claims companies
should be required to exercise due diligence and must reasonably
believe that there is a possibility of a valid claim. They must not be
allowed to continue to fish for claims with very little
consequence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031970000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0004.htm#13031970000052">CMCs
play an influential role in the UK’s compensation and redress
regimes. They are responsible for almost half the complaints sent to
the FOS, but make no financial contribution to its operating costs of
around £107 million. In the light of that, will the Minister
explore how CMCs can make a financial contribution to FOS running
costs? For example, CMCs could be required to pay the £500 FOS
case fee when they have not undertaken adequate checks to ensure there
is a policy in place. The FOS dismisses charging for CMCS in
“Charging for our work: modernising our case fee
arrangements”, saying that charges will be passed on to
customers. A simple solution would be to ban the collection of up-front
fees and cap the percentage of a claim that a CMC can take. That would
prevent their passing on to customers the reasonable charges that I
argue should be levied on the
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031970000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/debtext/130319-0004.htm#13031970000053">Will
the Minister take steps to ensure that CMCs accept leads only from
organisations that are also regulated by the claims management
regulator, organisations that are exempt introducers, or organisations
that are regulated by another body, such as solicitors? There is
concern that the FOS is insufficiently independent of the regulator,
which is currently the FSA. Can that be scrutinised? Can appropriate
action be taken to ensure a clear separation of powers and
responsibilities? It seems unreasonable that a business must adhere to
the adjudicator’s findings without a right of appeal and with no
knowledge of the adjudicator’s qualification for making a
decision. Can that be looked at with a view to equalising the playing

for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin) on securing this debate on claims management
companies, which remain topical. Clearly, there are serious conduct
problems among a minority of CMCs, but it is worth remembering that
some provide a useful service in identifying consumers who have
suffered loss and supporting them in obtaining redress when they would
otherwise receive nothing. While we have made good progress since the
start of regulation, I acknowledge that there is more that can be done
and should be done to improve the conduct of CMCs, and to strengthen
consumer protection across the claims management industry. To that end,
the Ministry of Justice claims management regulation unit remains
committed to providing a stable and robust regulatory system that the
public can trust. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman acknowledged the
good work that the CMR unit is doing. It is stepping up its approach to
improving CMC compliance and strengthening enforcement action through a
range of measures.</hs_Para>

CMR unit has established a specialist compliance team to deal with poor

warnings, and taken other forms of enforcement action where problems

point out that spam texts that market claims services are generally not

and has worked with a range of organisations and agencies to tackle
fraud, including the Insurance Fraud Bureau, and police forces on a
number of operations throughout the year. Those operations have
resulted in arrests, charges and convictions. Much has therefore been
achieved at a time when resources are limited. Since regulation began
in 2007, the CMR unit has removed the licences of more than 900 CMCs
across the sector. More recently, a major crackdown resulted in more
than 400 CMCs 
<?notus-xml column=908?>being warned, suspended or having their licences cancelled. That has

the regulatory framework continues to deliver effectively. This
year’s reform agenda includes four main measures. Following a
consultation exercise, we are proposing to tighten the conduct rules
for CMCs. Most critically, we are proposing that contractual agreements
between CMCs and consumers must be signed by clients before any fees
can be taken. CMCs will only be permitted to refer to being regulated
by the claims management regulator, rather than by the Ministry of

one thing that serves all our constituents, wherever they may work or

a nation, we import some $640 billion—I used dollars
deliberately and hon. Members will see why as I refer to other
figures—but we export approximately $480 billion only. This is a
timely debate. The UK’s share of global exports has declined
sharply over the past decade from just over 5% in 2000 to a fraction
over 4% in 2010—a 20% drop. We should not pretend that this
country is alone in seeing such a drop, but some of our near neighbours
have fared much better. Germany, to which I will be making further
references during my contribution, managed to grow its share of global
exports. Are UK companies slow to react to opportunities? Are there
inherent uncompetitive disadvantages? Perhaps more pertinently, have we
been tapping into the wrong markets? I will suggest later that that has
been the case. Have we failed to reach the high-growth markets as a
result, perhaps, of over-dependence on our European neighbours and the
US? If one looks beneath the figures, one wonders whether there is a
mismatch between the goods and services we currently sell and those
demanded by high-growth economies. After all, we are not supplying
high-capital goods to the booming markets in the BRIC countries for
machinery, tools and equipment. Whatever the diagnosis, the treatment
is the same. We have no choice but to increase exports and inward
investment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000016"><Member ContinuationText="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" PimsId="2637" UID="13031954000219" xid="120" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000219"><B>Geoffrey

de Bois:</Member></B> My hon. Friend anticipates some comments I will
make shortly. Even within that good news story, it is worth remembering
that the success of our services exports perhaps masks an underlying
problem in our not being successful in selling our capital goods to
emerging BRIC countries. He is absolutely right, however, and since
2009 the volume of exports to the rest of the EU has probably risen by
some 5%, but exports to the rest of the world have increased by 30%.
The trend is definitely the right one. There are encouraging signs, and
we should be quick to recognise that and to endorse such
efforts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000018">We
are coming together this morning as a constructively critical friend to
the work of UKTI and the FCO.  Since entering Parliament, I
have found an admirable determination in Ministers and officials to
deliver on the often quoted target for exports of £1 trillion by
2020. I have no doubt that this is the first Government to put trade
and inward investment at the heart of government and, in particular, to
make them a cornerstone of the wider economic resurgence of the UK. I
count myself lucky, because there are Government Members present
today—I welcome such a strong showing—who have witnessed
the work of the Government after a career in business and are therefore
qualified to fulfil the role of constructive friend. On that note, I
remind the House that I spent 25 years in business, actively supporting
SMEs and large corporations in their efforts to trade abroad, which
involved working in the exhibition 
<?notus-xml column=193?>and events industry, which in turn involved working with trade
associations and UKTI’s predecessor, British Trade
International. I remind the House that my wife runs the company that I

interest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000019">Today,
I want to deal with both the strategic and tactical aspects of UKTI-FCO
work, and I am grateful for the support of the CBI, the Federation of
Small Businesses and other organisations, not least SMEs and trade
associations from whom I have gleaned advice. Let us start with a
premise. One in every four SMEs in Europe is an exporter, but the
figure in Britain is currently one in five. What is holding back a
nation of entrepreneurs that has an enviable track record in trading
and a history of unique historical ties with Commonwealth countries,
and that is now host to large diasporas from many parts of the world?

are doing well in pharmaceuticals and chemicals, our rate of growth
still compares unfavourably with that of Germany, because we have not
sold to high-growth economies. However—I speak as a former
owner-manager of an SME—where SMEs have the right goods and
services for high-growth economies, the reluctance to export is a
combination of risk management assessment, operating outside the
comfort zone and, of course, fear of failure. That is often fuelled by
what seem daunting and in some cases very real barriers to export, but
also by a fair share of myths, without necessarily recognising the
hidden and transparent benefits of export
markets.</hs_Para>

is absolutely right that micro-businesses will be more inclined to stay
in their comfort sector. When they are successful and they grow, it is
hard for them to shed the fear of the unknown and of recognising the
extra management time that would go into breaking down the barriers to
export. Success as a micro-company often brings with it concerns about
entering the export market. However, the answer is staring us in the
face: engaging with those that have succeeded and letting them drive
those that are inclined to go—or thinking of going—into
the export market.</hs_Para>

expect from SMEs in this country. They had all used the support of UKTI
and the FCO, which, in the Gulf region, is exceptional. However, they
all wanted more British companies to be there with the British
pavilion, supporting a British presence in the region, because it was
as much in their interests to have that greater commercial and
intellectual capital in a region in which they were operating. When I
asked, “Would you attend forums and speak to contemporaries that
are either thinking of, or may not even have considered, going into
export markets?”, “Would you come and tell them about
your experiences?”, and “Would you help them learn the
lessons that you have learnt?”, every single

hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham will touch on that
point when he talks about how UKTI’s work must expand—I
do not wish to anticipate him unfairly, but I have read his report, and
he has done some excellent work on the future of UKTI.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T09:44:45"></hs_TimeCode>Therefore, with
the companies that want to leverage more activity in a region, it is a
win-win, no-cost option for UKTI and the FCO to capitalise on those who
are successful in order to breed more success.</hs_Para>

the few parliamentary delegations that I have attended, I have always
met local embassies, and local UKTI representatives and staff. Every
time I visit, I ask the staff a simple question: “What are the
top three UK companies doing business in this region?” I confess
that the answer is often mixed. Some do not know, some waffle, while
others are extremely well briefed. The picture is mixed, but what all
have in common is that although the large exporters may be identified
and known to them, very few of the SME companies, which might even be
in the same supply chain as the well known prime contractors, are
known. That worries me. At delegation level, led by senior Ministers, I
cannot recall how often SMEs were included in the teams accompanying
Prime Ministers or Foreign Secretaries.</hs_Para>

specific interest is with the “M” in SMEs. Medium-sized
businesses will be crucial to driving export growth, because it is not
realistic to presume that our export goals can be achieved by securing
large, single-group contracts. The critical mass achievable by the vast
swathe of medium-sized companies will lead growth and I suggest that
UKTI overseas representation is spread more evenly across the company
base to reflect that fact.</hs_Para>

message is taken away today, it should be that across Government,
across UKTI, and across parliamentarians, we have to make, as some in
the Chamber have, excellent efforts to engage with medium-sized
companies, and that is the only way that we will hit our goal, because
of the critical mass, size and number of SMEs. However, let me be
positive. My hon. Friend said “only 23%”—well, 23%
can multiply that much quicker. The 23% that are active can reach out
to those that are not active. It will not be politicians in suits
telling people how to export; it will be the businessmen who have got
dirty, been down there and done it, and can sell their expertise and
encourage others. That would be my key

achieve the critical mass in relation to the SMEs and particularly the
medium-sized enterprises, we should start to engage more. I recommend
that UKTI and the FCO have more trade delegations where medium-sized
enterprises are engaged with, not only as an SME delegation, but as
part of larger delegations. They can be integrated into the supply
chains of prime contractors, and we can look at the supply chains of
the high-growth economies and what they need. We should ensure that we
give the political clout that we commit to larger groups.</hs_Para>

the Member for Stourbridge (Margot James)—where I was told of a
large hospital construction programme in Saudi Arabia. UKTI had gone
out and sought suppliers to the hospital industry for
equipment—diagnostic equipment. It was going to take suppliers
out—it invited them to go—and the prospectus said that a
Minister would be leading it to open the political doors and provide
the clout it needed. There was a modest charge, in my opinion, to do
it, and then at the last minute, the Minister was not available. How
disappointing that was for those SMEs—not because they wanted to
rub shoulders with the Minister, however attractive that may be, but
because that Minister would have opened doors and allowed them to make
the contacts that they needed.

want to talk now about where
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T09:50:03"></hs_TimeCode>we focus our
efforts. To reflect the new commercial emphasis, the Government have
rightly increased investment in personnel and resources. The debate has
been about how we secure business from the so-called
emerging—emerged, I think—economies and most notably the
so-called BRIC economies. That is understandable and it is reflected in
increased investment. We have put, I believe, 50 more staff into China
and another 30 into India. There are also more staff in Brazil, Turkey
and Mexico. However, those pesky Germans —perhaps that
is an inappropriate thing to say with a Foreign Office Minister
present; I take full responsibility for that. Those very assiduous
Germans<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T09:50:45"></hs_TimeCode> have
already resourced up to 30% more staff, with a total of 1,700. France
is already expanding its efforts into Chile and

doubt that the potential growth for UK plc in the BRIC countries will,
if developed, provide a much-needed boost to our balance of payments,
jobs and prosperity. They are the immediate attraction when it comes to
helping us to meet our challenges. It is interesting that in those
economies there will now be a shift to a different market. As the
infrastructure there changes and consumer demand
increases—consumer spending is set to increase by about 12% per
annum—we desperately need to be there. Although we are playing
catch-up now, I remain optimistic that, particularly with the increase
in consumer spending and infrastructure developments, British companies
will be able to capitalise on the changes. My concern is that while we
are focusing on the battle in those economies to fuel our immediate
needs, we are possibly in danger of losing the next
war.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000035">Hon<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T09:50:18"></hs_TimeCode>.
Members may know that the CBI commissioned research that showed the
poor penetration of the UK into what are described as the next
generation of emerging economies, compared with the efforts of some of
our competitors. For the N11—next 11 economies so
identified—we will have to do the groundwork now to avoid
playing catch-up in the future. That will ensure that we are
strategically and politically aligned in such a way that British
companies can capitalise on the increased spending by those economies.
I argue that it is important for business and policy makers to identify
those markets that will provide opportunities to exploit our
comparative advantages in the future, so that we can capitalise on the
growth dynamism in those
regions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T09:52:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000036">If
we plan now, the FCO and UKTI will generate greater diversification of
our overall export presence across a series of high-growth markets,
rather than our being over-dependent, as we have been in the past, on
Europe and the US and potentially on the BRICs. We would not run a
business on any other model, so why should we run a country in that
way? We need to be ready to exploit the new markets now, even though
the payback may come in 10 or even 15

us take a snapshot of the next emerging economies. In relation to
Bangladesh, which has been identified as one of the growth economies,
we import seven times more than we export. We do not feature in the

relation to Turkey, which is set to grow at a rate of about 8% a year
and be the fastest-growing economy outside Europe, the UK has only a
1.2% share of the market. Those pesky Germans and, incidentally, the

have recognised that—I give credit to the FCO and
UKTI—but again we are in danger of playing catch-up. We have
talked about BRIC. Believe it or not, we now have MIST—Mexico,
Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey. Overall, those economies have more
than doubled in size in the past decade. That is a warning sign for us.
My recommendation and challenge to UKTI and the FCO is to look to run
an N11 strategy in parallel with the emerging economies. We should
entertain a presence in those countries at both strategic and tactical
level to foster and engage with the influencers to ensure that we are
positioned to capitalise on the emergence of those economies over the
next 10 to 15 years. Let us avoid being a spectator and instead lead
the team on to the pitch. That would be to the benefit of future

take more money? Of course it might take some more money, but I would
ask for some slightly out-of-the-box thinking and suggest that UKTI go
further in making partnerships with professional bodies and trade
associations that could help to share the load. After all, that is also
in the interests of the companies that are their members. I thought
that there were early signs of that. I ask the Minister whether the
announcement in February 2012 of a strategic agreement between UKTI and
the Council of British Chambers of Commerce in Europe was a taste of
things to come—an example of where Government can partner with
trade associations and bodies that are experts in their field and, much
like the Germans, use those bodies to provide support services and
strategic planning in export markets. The House will be interested to
know that the network of German chambers of commerce is already
established in 80 countries, providing precisely those services. Can

shall make just two final points to give other hon. Members a chance to
speak. When I was at the exhibition event in the Gulf states,
exhibitors said to me, “Look, we can’t compete with the
costs in China and India, but we can compete on added value.”
That becomes very important. They said, “What we want the
Government to do is not to tell us how to run our businesses, but to
sell the strategic value, the top-brand message, of what Britain is
good at, which will support what we do.” They said, “When
you think of Germany, you think of engineering, technology, the motor
industry—BMW. That reinforces the idea of quality and advanced
engineering, and German companies trade on the back of that
image.”
Drawing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T09:57:45"></hs_TimeCode> on my
previous days in communications, I would say that the message is that
in UKTI and the FCO we should be defining brand UK and reflecting that
brand. We should remember that the brand supports everything we do, and
everything we do supports the brand. Let us give businesses the

Access—getting into and out of markets—is crucial. I
think that UKTI and the embassies in particular can do more than just

setting proportionate targets for inward investment visits to Northern
Ireland? Will he commit, with colleagues, to a schedule of regular

am conscious of your strictures, Mr Hollobone, so I shall deal quickly
with a couple of other points. In recent years, the Prime Minister has
led a global investment conference event in London for the chief
executive officers of top global companies, and Invest provides input
to such events. Communication regarding invitations and attendees is
not always as it should be, and access to the events and CEOs is often
limited. I ask the Minister to consider how UKTI can help Northern
Ireland business leaders to gain greater access to the global CEOs
attending such conferences. I am sure that that goes for other regions
of the UK as well, because presently the concentration seems to be on
London. Will he also have a word with the Prime Minister about the G8
summit? It is in Northern Ireland this year, which is very significant
and welcome, and we could build on that opportunity. I suggest that the
Prime Minister hosts a G8 investment conference in Northern Ireland,
because that would be an opportunity further to maximise the spotlight
on the Province.</hs_Para>

did a lot of good business, which arose out of the games. The feedback
has been positive, because of 40 companies in Northern Ireland, 24 have
won £53 million of business, which is excellent. There are
issues about marketing rights, however. In January 2013, all London
2012 suppliers were offered the opportunity to apply for licences to
allow them to publicise the fact that they had supplied London 2012.
Greater access to those licences is important so that people can build
on the success.</hs_Para>

Ireland was originally excluded from UKTI’s GREAT campaign

Northern Ireland was included on the Prime Minister’s recent
visit to India, and the strapline and messages now include Northern
Ireland. Northern Ireland must not be excluded from United Kingdom
initiatives and measures, as we are part of the United Kingdom. It is

am, however, disappointed that a number of companies that I have met
have failed to get the support that they require from UKTI, so I have
started to take them to Mr Baird to allow him to engage directly with
them and provide support. Some of the companies are talking about
hundreds of millions of pounds of investment into the United Kingdom,
so that is very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T10:10:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000061">I
shall mention briefly, as I have to be very brief, three key
recommendations that I would like the Minister to take on board, with
which, by the way, Mr Baird agrees. The first is about the structure of
UKTI. At the moment, personnel report into different Departments,
including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills, and sometimes to local ambassadors.
What we want in the United Kingdom is one organisation that is fit for
purpose, with reporting taking place directly to UKTI’s board
and its chief executive. We want an organisation that can hire, fire
and reward on the grounds of performance and on a 
<?notus-xml column=201?>commercial basis. We want to encourage people in UKTI to go the extra
mile and strive to do everything possible to help British businesses to
export. Regrettably, the support is rather patchy; in some parts of the
world it is superb, but in others it is poor. We therefore want a
common theme across the world and a common reporting
structure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T10:11:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000062"><Member ContinuationText="Jim Shannon" PimsId="650" UID="13031954000231" xid="1218" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000231"><B>Jim

second point is about funding. Only 0.005% of Government spend goes to
UKTI, and I am concerned that we will fall behind Scottish Development
International, for example. That body receives far more pro rata, given
the number of companies in Scotland, so it is able better to support
its
companies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000065">There
is only a 49% awareness of UKTI among SMEs, and it is important that
the body gets more funding from the Chancellor so that the message

understood. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T10:12:27"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Enfield North (Nick de Bois) made the superb
point that for every £1 spent, UKTI generates £22 of
revenue. If I was the Chancellor of the Exchequer, my No. 1 priority
would be to give UKTI
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T10:12:46"></hs_TimeCode>more
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000066">My
third point is that we need greater parliamentary scrutiny of UKTI. I
am having to condense a 25-minute speech into five minutes, and this is
only the second debate that has been held on UKTI in the past
12 months. This is a ridiculous way of scrutinising one of
our country’s most important bodies. I want ongoing
parliamentary scrutiny, and even—dare I say it—a Select
Committee that can interact with Ministers and the UKTI chief executive
on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis, and hold them to account
about specific countries and projects so that we are always
scrutinising how taxpayers’ money is spent. When that
parliamentary scrutiny takes place, we will be able to say to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, “Look at what UKTI is doing. Look
how things are improving. Give it more
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T10:13:44"></hs_TimeCode>,”
and I cannot overemphasise the importance of that. I desperately want
to work with colleagues to convince the Chancellor and the Prime
Minister to give us a Select Committee of the House of Commons to allow
those of us who are passionate about exports to work together
constructively to hold UKTI to
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T10:14:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000067">Some
45 UKTI staff work in Brazil, but 52 opportunities are listed on the

are listed for a huge number of countries. We might not be surprised
that that is the case for some obscure, small countries, such as Cape
Verde and Mauritania, but there are many larger countries that have no
opportunities listed against them. If we are going to have a website
and to communicate with SMEs up and down the country, we need always to
be harvesting opportunities across the world and putting them on that
site. We must ensure that information is disseminated daily to all nine
regions in England, and that those regions then interact with their
SMEs to find out which can best be tailored to each
opportunity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T10:15:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Minister has announced a national challenge for the UK to encourage
more small and medium-sized businesses to export, which is essential.
As has been mentioned, if the UK exported at the EU average of about

important. The Foreign Secretary has made it clear that he wants

<?notus-xml column=206?>business. We must also ensure that officials have their ear to the
ground for new trade opportunities and then feed such information back
to UKTI<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T10:29:28"></hs_TimeCode>. We need
to create a dual hub-and-spoke system, with the UK’s vast

networks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000098">The
Foreign Secretary has tried to reverse the decline in trade offices in
consulates throughout the world, but we need to do more than merely
reverse the decline—we need to expand, particularly in the
emerging markets I mentioned earlier. Information is crucial in an age
in which companies can communicate in minutes and deals can be won or
lost through the smallest of delays. In the longer term, we also need

a British Chambers of Commerce survey in 2011 pointed out, contacts are
often key for businesses exporting into new markets. Businesses that
had employees or directors who had lived abroad were even more
successful. However, the most direct way in which we can support
British businesses to export is by ensuring that our export products
and guarantees are as competitive as possible. The Government should
therefore commission a report into the comparative competitiveness of
the UK’s export guarantees and credits, and the effectiveness of
our institutions such as UKTI, so that we can learn from the success of
others, and accordingly improve our own standards and the way in which
we

the Member for Enfield North was absolutely right to mention the target

represent £1 trillion in exports. If we are to meet that target,
we will have to connect with many more SMEs. If my figure of 23%
currently exporting is correct, that has to grow hugely, which means
that awareness in UKTI has to increase hugely. It also means that we
all have a role—the Government, the Foreign Office, the

during my preparation for the debate. I was especially interested to
learn that Germany’s export credit agency, Hermes, provided
€32 billion of financial support to German exporters in 2010,
which is equivalent to 3% of Germany’s exports. The UK
equivalent, the Export Credits Guarantee Department, provided only
£2.9 billion of support for exporters which, if my maths is
correct, is less than one tenth of the support that Germany offers. It

and considered how a country such as Germany can fund such a

The banks are

Lucas:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. I am
a proponent of a much more regional structure in banking than the one
that exists in the UK at the moment. The flawed reforms in the 1980s
created a very centralised and uncompetitive banking sector that has
not fundamentally changed in any way since 2007. The German Sparkassen
model has been successful since 2007, and the Leader of the Opposition
made a speech only last week in which he talked about introducing the
concept of regional banking within the UK to try to link in with those
businesses that we need to see expand.</hs_Para>

say that because the businesses that are exporting successfully from
the UK at the moment—and, frankly, the businesses that are also
using export credit guarantees—are the largest businesses that
we have. I do not want that to diminish in any sense, as I speak as
someone who represents a constituency that is immediately adjacent to
an Airbus factory, which is a vital part of our local economy. However,
we also need an expansion of exports by small and medium-sized
businesses.</hs_Para>

course we need to work more closely with UKTI and our embassies abroad,
which in my experience do an excellent job of linking in with local
economies. We particularly need to look at the developing countries
where we ought to be doing better. Of course, there are many examples
of the benefits of soft power in the UK. Reference has already been
made to the World Service and to the English language, and our
universities also develop excellent links with the outside

that in mind, the quality of the service provided by South West Trains

2012, it received 31,500 responses to its national passenger survey.
South West Trains was rated the joint-worst train operating company for
providing value for money, with just 37% of respondents expressing
satisfaction. By contrast, Merseyrail achieved a 70% rating for value

are various reasons why so many passengers do not feel they get value
for money. For one, overcrowding has worsened. In 2011, the most recent
year for which information is available, the company’s morning
services ran at 4.1% over capacity, up from 2.8% in 2008. In the

services are much worse. According to Department for Transport data,
the South West Trains 7.32 am service from Woking to London Waterloo,

whole country. It normally runs at 64% over capacity, carrying 471 more
passengers than it is meant to.</hs_Para>

punctuality of South West Trains services has stayed flat over the past
five years. On average, a commuter will experience at least one late
train per week, and far more at certain times. On top of that, a spate
of signalling problems has caused longer delays. The service is also
often unable to cope with what must be described as relatively minor
snowfall<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T11:03:21"></hs_TimeCode>. Of

company’s wider performance must be set against a backdrop of
sharp increases in fares. Further analysis by the Office of Rail
Regulation reveals that season ticket costs for companies operating in
London and the south-east rose by 46% between 2004 and 2012, which was
just above the national average. Currently, a season ticket between
Guildford and London Waterloo costs £3,224 every year. That does

rising fares and low customer satisfaction, remuneration at Stagecoach

8.2% for directors and by 9% for executive directors. The
dividends rose by 44% between 2008 and 2012, to
7.8p per ordinary share. That was dwarfed by the one-off

appreciate that South West Trains is just one part of Stagecoach Group,
but when the performance of South West Trains has been so

reward for failure. What levers do the Government have under the

there is a whole series of questions about the role played by central
Government. Under the terms of its franchise agreement, South West
Trains pays a premium to the Government for the right to run its
services. That was worth 4p per passenger kilometre in
2011-2—the second-highest rate paid by any train operating
company to the Treasury. The subsidy paid by South West Trains can be
contrasted with the subsidy of 11.4p per passenger kilometre received
by ScotRail and the 12p per passenger kilometre subsidy paid to Arriva
Trains Wales. Altogether, over the three years to 2011-12, South West
Trains paid a whopping £544 million in subsidy to the
Treasury— £140 million more than any other train
operating company. That is inevitably reflected in fares paid by South
West Trains
users<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000162">Those
figures raise a slew of questions. First, while South West Trains has
been the largest net contributor to the Treasury through its premium
payments in recent years, other train operating companies in the
south-east region were still receiving a Government subsidy. Those
included Chiltern Railways and Southeastern. Will the Minister
therefore clarify what objective criteria are 
<?notus-xml column=217?>used to determine which travellers subsidise other lines, how that
subsidy is calculated and what can possibly justify the stark
discrepancies in the
figures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T11:08:14"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000163">There
is a second range of questions about the regional train companies
group, which includes the five train operating companies that received
the highest Government subsidy in 2011-12: Arriva Trains Wales,
ScotRail, First TransPennine Express, Northern Rail and London Midland.
In direct consequence, passengers who use those regional train
companies, as classified by the Office of Rail Regulation, have enjoyed
below-average increases in the cost of their season
tickets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T11:08:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000164">Let
me make a broader point. It is one thing for the Government to seek to
control ticket prices in more remote destinations, to prevent them from
soaring out of control. However, it is another thing altogether to ask
passengers on South West Trains to subsidise below-average season
ticket rises in the north, Scotland and Wales, when, as I have made
clear, some passengers in the south-east have faced price increases
above the national average for their season tickets, in return for
crowded carriages and poor
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T11:09:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000165">That
is not just a redistribution of wealth out of general taxation, which
understandably and rightly takes place to a degree, but a massive
redistribution of wealth from the fares paid by specific commuters
using a specific rail service. Can the Minister understand why so many

cause of concern. The report concluded that up to £1 billion of
savings could be made by 2018-19, without any reduction in services.

conclusion, South West Trains provides vital services in Elmbridge, but
also well beyond. I recognise that running a train service across
ageing infrastructure in a time of rising demand is not an easy
challenge. There is also the compound effect of rising fares on
customers, commuters and residents at a time of rising energy prices
and the standard of living becoming a real issue, particularly for the
squeezed middle. There is not a huge amount of extra money in the pot.

run on time and decent travel conditions. Government must also play
their part by providing a coherent overarching framework that promotes
innovation and productivity, and transparency in relation to the
funding arrangements, in particular by ensuring that passengers on
South West Trains are not treated—let us talk

hon. Members know, the South West Trains franchise is primarily based
on services operating into and out of the nation’s busiest
terminal station, London Waterloo, to a wide range of destinations. It
includes the provision of one of Europe’s most intensive
suburban and commuter networks, servicing more than 200 stations with
more than 1,700 trains a day. The route network, which is managed by
Network Rail, extends to 643 miles, with 1,375 sets of points and more
than 4,000 signals. The network is therefore
complicated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000178">One
issue with the railways is that of success. We have seen a fantastic
growth in passenger numbers over the past 15 years; across the country,
numbers have just about doubled. They are where they were in 1929, on a
network that is about the half the size that it was then. That is a
huge operating challenge for Network Rail and the train companies, and
it means that there is sometimes no longer the space to pick up on
problems when they occur. Every train that is late has a knock-on
effect on every other train all the way behind

now turn to the operational performance of the South West Trains
franchise, as my hon. Friend raised that matter. According to the
public performance measure, which is used to record arrival within five
minutes of the scheduled time, its current performance is 91.4%. That
is a moving annual average. My hon. Friend may be interested to know
that, for the latest period, 67% or thereabouts of arrivals were within
one minute of the scheduled arrival time.</hs_Para>

maintains its position as the most punctual railway south of the
Thames. It is important to make that point, as it might be of some
comfort to my hon. Friend, given his concerns. Its operational
performance is better than that of Southeastern, which had a
performance figure of 91.2%, while the five-minute performance figure
for Southern was 88.3%, and it was 88.7% for First Capital Connect.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T11:18:22"></hs_TimeCode>
company’s joint performance improvement plan target of 92.7% of
trains over the course of the year arriving at their destination within
five minutes of the published arrival time will unfortunately be missed
by around 1%, but that is still  a better performance than
other train companies in  the south-east. However, that is not

way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000181">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T11:18:42"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend asked what levers we had. In my capacity as Minister for
rail performance, I regularly meet train companies and Network Rail not
only to go through performance generally across the network, but to
pick up individual problems. For example, I had a meeting this morning
with East Coast Trains about problems on the line north of
King’s Cross. Such meetings take place regularly.</hs_Para>

that are being quoted, because the autumn 2012 Passenger Focus survey
rated South West Trains as the joint worst for providing value for
money—I think that is the most recent survey—with a
satisfaction rating of 37%, which suggests a slightly worse picture
than the Minister indicates. If customers are giving such a poor
indictment of the state of the service, despite the punctuality
statistics that the Minister has kindly cited, is he suggesting that
those customers have got it wrong? Is he suggesting that they are not
appreciative enough of the service? I travel on the line every day, and

factors, including, for example, the information given on station

hon. Friend mentioned fares, and we are all acutely conscious of the
need to try to bring to an end the era of above-inflation rail fare
increases, as the Government has clearly set out. We inherited a
situation in which the previous Labour Government had driven up rail
fares by above inflation under a process that started, I think, in
2003-04. The difference between the previous Government and this
Government is that we are investing heavily in the network to try to
provide extra capacity to address some of the issues that he rightly
raises on behalf of his constituents, whereas fare increases in
previous years were simply a measure to provide extra funds to the
Treasury for other uncertain purposes. We now have the biggest rail
investment programme since Victorian times, and the South West Trains
area, like all others, will
benefit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031954000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031954000192">The
present fare arrangements, which we seek to bring to an end as the
Network Rail efficiency savings kick in, allow regulated fares to rise
by 1% above the retail prices index each year. Importantly, the formula
is exactly the same as that applied nearly all the way through the
previous Labour Government. The formula is applied equally across
England, so there is no difference between what we do for the South
West Trains franchise and what we do for Northern Rail or TransPennine
Express. They all use RPI plus 1, unless there are exceptional
circumstances, such as under the previous Government when the
Southeastern franchise used RPI plus 3 for a while to pay for the
Javelin high-speed train. The subsidies for First ScotRail and Arriva
Trains Wales are not a matter for us, as they are entirely determined
by, respectively, the Scottish Government and the Welsh Assembly. What
they do with their trains and their money is up to

the franchising process, we also try to ensure that we get the best
value for taxpayers’ money, because the more money we get in,
the more we are able to invest in addressing the capacity and crowding
problems to which my hon. Friend rightly referred. There is a
competitive tendering process for each franchise, and I am sure that he
accepts that it is in our interest to get the best possible price for
each franchise. If that means that we are securing money through a
premium from the franchise holder, that is a good outcome for the
taxpayer. There are clearly some areas of the country in which the
train service will not turn a profit, meaning that a premium is not
possible. Under this Government, we have seen a 
<?notus-xml column=222?>general trend towards ensuring a better balance between the fare payer

Ruane</B> (Vale of Clwyd) (Lab):</Member> I rise to speak about fuel
poverty in Wales. Fuel poverty is defined as when 10% or more of a
household income is spent on fuel. Wales has the highest rate of fuel
poverty in the whole UK, with 420,000 households, which is 30%, in fuel
poverty. To put that in perspective, the figure compares with just 11%
in the south-east, so that for Wales is nearly three times higher. The
ward in Wales with the highest rate of fuel poverty is Rhyl West, which
is in my constituency. The ward with the 10th highest rate is Rhyl
South West, where I have many relatives, in which I grew up on a big
council estate.</hs_Para>

Rhyl West, 900 hotels and guest houses have been turned over to houses

substandard homes. That is a big problem in my constituency and in
Wales.</hs_Para>

disposable income, but the highest falls in living standards. The
situation is going to get worse, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
rightly said, because council tax for the poorest will be introduced,
although the Welsh Government have mitigated the effect of that by
setting aside £22 million for the next year to stop the rise
hitting the poorest. Owing to the bedroom tax, someone who has lived in
their council house for 50 years but does not want to move,
because they love their house and community, will have to find an
additional £25 a week. The benefits freeze of 1% could result in
people on benefits actually freezing. There is also wage stagflation in

the same time, the Government and their allies are giving
£44,000 a year extra to a person who earns £1

again. Whichever way the hon. Gentleman slices it, the Labour
Government introduced a rate of 50%, but the Conservatives and their
Liberal allies have taken it down to 45%. That means additional money
in the pockets of millionaires and billionaires, and less money in the
pockets of the most vulnerable. That is Robin Hood in reverse; it is

do not want to sound too negative, so let me say what could be done.
Local authorities need to work with the Department of Energy and
Climate Change and the Department for Communities and Local Government,
and more widely across the Government, to ensure that they play a full
role in encouraging collective switching, because that process can lead
to big discounts of £200. DECC needs to promote that more with
local authorities, because people are not switching at the rate they
should be. There might be many reasons for that. For example, an
elderly person may be going blind or have early-onset dementia, while
poorer people may be functionally illiterate or have no access to
computers. There is a whole swathe of people who should be switching
but are not, so local authorities should be co-operating with DECC and
other Departments to organise collective
switching<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T14:35:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031975000014">Local
authorities should introduce community energy initiatives, perhaps with
the encouragement of central Government grants. A lot can be done by
local authorities. In my constituency, Denbighshire county council used
£35 million of prudential borrowing to upgrade fully its 3,000
council houses with double glazing, gas and insulation—it did a
fantastic job. It also co-operated with me and Crispin Jones, the
director of Eaga Partnership in Wales, to connect 125 former Ministry
of Defence soldiers’ and officers’ houses to the gas

the same time, they have taken £100 off the £400 winter

the issue of SWALEC—now SSE—which is a large supplier in
south Wales. Because many people tend to be loyal to their original
company, they have not switched from their supplier, and that
particularly applies to people who are perhaps elderly, or not in a
position to make price comparisons on  a website. Such people

discount—they pay another £100 for the privilege. When I
took that up with the supplier, saying that it was absolutely
outrageous that the standing charge had rocketed to the extent that the
poorest families were paying £200 before they used even 1W of
electricity or one therm of gas, I received the answer that the
practice was encouraged by the regulator, because it would simplify
things. However, it is clear that that is a regressive way of charging

about the motives behind the charge, and one reason why is that I am
aware that energy companies know that politicians are trying to suggest
that they might offer the lowest tariff to the most vulnerable
customers. If the lowest tariff is upped, a buffer is created against
politicians doing that. Additionally, bills go up every time energy
prices rise. Again, as politicians, we would like to see energy
companies decreasing their charges when prices fall, but of course a
standing charge will not be decreased. It seems to me that that is an
extremely sly ploy to fix a price that will not be hit by the whim of

of what happens is probably beyond our ability to deal with. I do not

was an absolutely massive increase in fuel poverty. We have seen the
Library figures. The number of households in fuel poverty in this
country increased from 2.5 million to 5.5 million between
2004 and 2009. The reason why I do not want to make this a political

Davies:</Member></B> The first figures are for 1996, but I just made
reference to the figures for the period from 2004 to 2009, which saw a
massive increase. I simply wanted to draw attention to the fact that
even though the Government at the time would have been very committed
to protecting people from fuel poverty, there were international
conditions that resulted in a massive increase. That is why I
congratulate the hon. Gentleman on bringing forward a debate on such an
important issue. It is one that faces us all. It is a particularly
serious issue in Wales, and there are a number of reasons for
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031975000066">Clearly,
one reason is that
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:04:08"></hs_TimeCode>we have less
insulated housing stock in Wales. The Welsh Government are seeking to
deal with that issue, and here at Westminster we have the drive towards
the green deal. Across Britain, we are tackling the issue of home
insulation, which is massively important. However, there is one issue
that we must always be careful of: all these things add costs to new
housing; they make it very difficult to build. One of the worries that
we have is that we should be focusing all our attention on making sure
that properties are well insulated. That is why I so disagree with the
sprinkler system that is being introduced in Wales. That puts a high
value on new houses when that value should be coming from making houses
more
insulated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:04:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031975000067">The
second issue is the higher dependence in Wales on oil, which is more
expensive. That is an historical issue. And of course, in
Wales—this is a big issue in Rhyl and certainly in the north of
my constituency—average wages are lower, which increases the
level of fuel
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:05:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0001.htm#13031975000068">I
commented initially on the huge rise in fuel poverty between 2004 and
2009, much of which was due to the international market, which is
outside our control. We are seeing now the pressure that comes from
international gas prices—probably the biggest contributor to the
increase in energy prices that we have seen—which are outside
our control. That means that we must be particularly careful about the
additional things, which might not have quite as much impact but are
within our control. That is why I want to refer again to an issue that
I think my right hon. Friend the Minister will be tired of

television wearing coats because they were cold and about being unable
to afford to heat their houses or turn on an extra bar on their fires.

years before that, I was working for my predecessor, now Lord Touhig. I
was doing some research for his speech at the time, and I spoke to the
president of the National Old Aged Pensioners Association of Wales and
asked him for some examples. He said that many members do not know they
are in fuel poverty and simply put on an extra pullover or go to bed
early. I was quite struck that the problem was still going

second fuel poverty debate that I spoke in was on the effect on
vulnerable people and, in particular, those suffering from cancer. I
discovered from Macmillan that 70% of cancer patients lose, on average,
50% of their household income during treatment. One in four cancer
sufferers also suffers from fuel poverty. I was disappointed with the
response of the Minister at the time. Rather than talking about
positive action, he 
<?notus-xml column=236?>mentioned the example of Her Majesty the Queen being in fuel poverty,
because it was being measured wrongly. That is all very well and warm
words, but to someone who is suffering and choosing between heating and
eating, it does not matter whether the Queen or anyone else who can
easily pay their fuel bill is in fuel poverty. When I listen to debates
such as this, I am seriously concerned, because every time we come back

happens.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0002.htm#13031975000099">Fuel
poverty hits Wales harder than anywhere else, as it has more people

anywhere else in the country. More people have to press the button that
disconnects them from electricity bills. More than a third of Welsh
households are in fuel poverty, which is higher than the UK average and
higher than any other UK region. By 2015—the time of the next
general election, which is when we will go before our
constituents—the average household in Wales will have

previous Labour Government. It is in vogue and fashionable among
Government Members to attack the Labour Government. They say that we

before about the better targeting of support for vulnerable groups. It
is all very well targeting it and it is all very well having the winter
fuel payment, but it is eaten up by constantly rising energy bills. It
is perverse that every time we hear of rising energy bills we also hear
of record profits by the same energy companies that are pleading
poverty. It is up to us in this House and this Government to stand up
to those energy companies. It is no good inviting them round to Downing
street for tea and biscuits and begging them, “Please, please
will you reduce your energy bills. It is making us look bad.” We
need real action and we need a regulator that will fine the companies

There are 100 different tariffs for energy bills and the most basic

electricity or gas coming faster to them, like they can with the
internet. Someone can go into Currys and say, “I want a luxury
LCD or LED television”, and pay the price for whatever they
want, but energy is energy; there is no luxury system. My hon. Friend
the Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith) talked about energy companies
saying, “You can go on the internet and start switching.”

took place when I was the Opposition spokesman on pensions—if
hon. Members can remember that; it was in the dark age of
Thatcherism—in which the then Minister suggested that elderly
people should go to jumble sales and buy coats to put on, saying that
they would get good value. That was only a few months after Edwina
Currie suggested that the elderly should go to bed with bobble hats
on—that was the then Government’s Dickensian approach of
the time. It was a happy occasion, because a group of Welsh MPs had the
only fax machine in the House at that time, because faxes were suspect
and not allowed—all that could be attached to a telephone line
was a telephone. A group of officials came to inspect the installation
of our wood-burning fax machine, which cost an enormous amount and was
built like a steam engine. However, that meant that we could ensure
that news of the Tories’ answer to fuel poverty—jumble
sales—went out to the nation so that people would realise what
it
was.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0002.htm#13031975000112">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:30:27"></hs_TimeCode>

fuel prices are crucial. Something extraordinary has happened, which

targeted the ECO primarily at the fuel-poor? He will have heard many
representations about how our energy market is broken, so why will he
not accept our proposals for reform and introduce a pool, breaking open
the market and ending the regional monopolies that lead to people in
Wales paying more for their energy than people in any other part of the

assure the hon. Gentleman that the coalition shares his real
determination to end the affront of fuel poverty in 21st-century
Britain. The Government are only too aware of the real daily choices
that confront too many people—not just in Wales, but across the
country—in making decisions about keeping warm, particularly
during the winter, and we take that issue extremely seriously. If we

went up in Wales. I do not say that the last Government were entirely
to blame, because there is in fact a direct link between the
international wholesale gas price and fuel poverty. We can score petty
points and selectively choose dates that suit our argument, but the
fact is that a bigger issue is at play that has eluded successive
Governments, so we need to come together with a much more ambitious,

Wales, there is a degree of complication in the sense that fuel poverty
is largely a devolved issue. Although the Welsh definition of fuel
poverty is the same as the English one—namely, 10% of household
income, as the hon. Gentleman said—the issue is devolved and is
not therefore subject to the Hills review that we commissioned to come
up with an accurate definition that will aid our policy making. One
reason why we have suffered with ineffectual policies in tackling fuel
poverty over successive 
<?notus-xml column=244?>Governments is the lack of specificity—the fact that our efforts

dead, the feed-in tariff—particularly for solar

capacity. In fact, solar represents a very good return and a very good

of standing up for the rights of minorities. The majority Muslim
population in Bangladesh is all too aware of what it is like to face
persecution; they fought a war of independence for that reason. I am a
British Bangladeshi, but I was born in Bangladesh, and it is absolutely
right that people are constantly reminded of the values and principles
on which Bangladesh was founded. In fact, the nation was founded by
Muslims and Hindus, by those with faith and those without
faith—by people across the board. That is Bangladesh’s
great strength as a country. Where there is rising intolerance, that
intolerance must be dealt with.</hs_Para>

would emphasise, however, that there are concerns about religious
freedoms across the board. Within a liberal
framework—I believe that Bangladesh has a strong liberal
tradition—the rights of people to peacefully practise their
religious beliefs, whatever religion they practise, should be observed,
along with their other civil rights. So I totally agree with the hon.
Gentleman, but we need to ensure that we encourage the Government of
Bangladesh and other political leaders in the country to set the tone
and to try to ensure that they stand up not only against any kind of
oppression towards any minority

remind Members of the progress that Bangladesh has made in its 42 years

growth rate in Bangladesh is now at 6%, according to the World Bank.
According to Goldman Sachs, Bangladesh is projected to be one of the

has made considerable attempts  to address poverty, to improve
girls’ education and to achieve many of the millennium
development goals, particularly those on girls’
education.</hs_Para>

are important achievements, but Bangladesh still faces grinding poverty

that people focus on the big challenges facing the country. Only when

I want to make it clear that the United Kingdom and Bangladesh enjoy a
strong and long-lasting relationship, which is important to both our
countries. As Bangladesh prepares to mark 42 years of independence, we
are proud that the UK was the first European country to recognise
Bangladesh. Personal ties continue to connect our countries. Nearly
500,000 people of Bangladeshi heritage live in the UK, a good number of
them in Bethnal Green and Bow. It is all the more important that we do
not shirk our responsibility to highlight our concerns about human
rights and respect for the rule of law. Those values are at the heart
of British foreign policy, and they are particularly important at a
time when Bangladesh is experiencing some of the worst violence it has
witnessed in decades. According to human rights organisations, last
year there were 15,101 incidents of political violence. That is lower
than the 2001 figure of 26,426, but it shows the magnitude of the
problem. Indeed, human rights organisations indicate that in January
and February alone, there have been approximately 5,000 incidents of
political violence.</hs_Para>

January, the International Crimes Tribunal in Bangladesh has found
three men, including two leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami, guilty of crimes
committed during the 1971 war between Pakistan and Bangladesh. As a
result of the verdicts and the ongoing political tensions, opposition
parties, mainly Jamaat-e-Islami and the Bangladesh Nationalist party,
have called approximately 
<?notus-xml column=251?>twelve enforced strikes, or hartals, as they are known. The latest
verdict issued in the case of Jamaat’s vice-president Delwar
Hossain Sayeedi on 28 February led to mass protests across Bangladesh,
with media reports of more than 70 deaths, many of which were reported
to be the result of action by the law enforcement agencies.</hs_Para>

concerned about the media reports that 24 Hindu temples, 122 houses and
dozens of shops have also been destroyed. The hon. Member for
Strangford (Jim Shannon) and my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham
and Rainham (Rehman Chishti) raised similar concerns about attacks on
religious minorities. We are concerned about the recent attacks, and in
a statement on 13 March, my noble Friend Baroness Warsi said that she
deplored the attacks and called on all parties to exercise restraint.
The British high commission has met the Government of Bangladesh and
opposition parties, and senior officials in Dhaka have met officials
from the Bangladeshi Prime Minister’s office and the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs to make clear the importance that we attach to ending
the violence and making peaceful political progress. The British
Government have been clear in their condemnation of the senseless
attacks and their widespread and debilitating impact on families,
communities, religious minorities and businesses—as the hon.

who have followed the situation in Bangladesh over the years will
recognise the many personal and historic events that influence the
political climate. For Bangladesh to achieve its potential, its
politics should be practised primarily in Parliament, not on the
streets. The British Government are strong proponents of freedom of
expression and the right of all citizens to hold Government to account,
including through legitimate and peaceful protests. That is an
essential element of any democracy. As my noble Friend Baroness Warsi
said during her visit to Bangladesh last month, however, violence and
vandalism have no place in legitimate protests. We hope, therefore,
that all parties can resolve differences through dialogue and
discussion, and that citizens will be able freely to raise their
concerns or grievances through peaceful means, without fear of
retaliation or attack.</hs_Para>

am pleased to have the opportunity to talk about police community
support officers and their powers. PCSOs are an extremely successful
product of the previous Labour Government. As a natural progression
from provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, they are an
effective part of community beat teams across England and Wales. I am
proud to say that I served on the Standing Committee that scrutinised

community council in Wrexham—a community council in Wales is the
equivalent of a parish council in England— is an active local
council that works hard to address local neighbourhood concerns in a
part of Wrexham that is partly residential and partly commercial. The
council works closely with its local police community beat team and
PCSOs. One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:30:52"></hs_TimeCode> of
the local PCSOs attended a monthly community council meeting last year
at which she explained that she attended the local Victoria primary
school at key times when parents dropped off their children in the
morning and picked them up in the evening. While she was doing that,
some of the parents—I emphasise that it was a
minority—were parking on zig-zag lines outside the school and on
double-yellow lines in the area. That is a problem across the country
with which we are all familiar, but in the context of a primary school
with young children, it is a big worry that parents and teachers have
to deal
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:31:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0002.htm#13031975000197">The
PCSO told the community council that she had asked parents who were
flouting traffic regulations to move, because they were causing a
danger to children. Everyone, of course, would be fearful that an
accident might occur and that someone would be seriously injured. Most
parents complied with the PCSO’s wishes, but several refused.

do about it. They are only police community support

preparation for this debate, having been fortunate enough that it was
drawn in the ballot, I attended the school last Thursday afternoon to
see the situation on the ground. The area was very busy, and some cars
were parked dangerously. Young children were moving precariously among
traffic, as children of primary age do. In such circumstances, the
existing law unfortunately says that even though a PCSO may make the
judgment that some vehicles are causing a danger to children in the
community, they cannot take appropriate legal steps to deal with the
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0002.htm#13031975000199">Chief<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:33:08"></hs_TimeCode>

PCSOs do not currently have the power to prevent dangerous parking or

that the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice will be responding
to the debate, because I have written to him about the situation. I am
sure that his assiduous civil servants will have dug out the file. I

suggested, at the instigation of the community council, that the

such problems by giving them the powers so to do. Unfortunately, the

to resolve a practical difficulty in their neighbourhood, were being

I have explained, the case arose from a specific request that was made
by an officer on the ground in response to a danger to young children.
It is patently clear that the request for an additional power is
neither unreasonable nor excessive. In the spirit of localism, I am
content for the local chief constable to be granted a power, which he
may or may not exercise, to allow PCSOs to issue tickets in such
circumstances. At present, the PCSO has no power to issue a fixed
penalty notice and has to call in a community beat manager—a
police officer—from the town centre to take the necessary
action, which is a waste of valuable police time. That deficiency can
be easily

clerk of the community council, Karen Benfield, reports to me that
there is increasing reliance on PCSOs to undertake community policing.
In the immediate vicinity of Wrexham, the number of community beat
managers, who are police officers, is falling because of the
Government’s budget cuts. The area used to have one community
beat manager for each of the four wards served by Offa community
council, but now there is only one community beat manager in charge of
a PCSO team of
five<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:37:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0002.htm#13031975000204">PCSOs
in north Wales are already given the full range of discretionary powers
that the chief constable can grant, which include the power to issue
fixed penalty notices for disorder, truancy, graffiti, littering and
dog fouling, but not for dangerous parking. Additionally, 25% of the
cost of PCSOs in Wrexham is paid for  by Wrexham county borough
council to encourage the police and the local authority to work
together to address the needs of the local community. PCSOs are seen to
be working closely with the local authority to address all sorts of
community issues, and dangerous parking is clearly a community issue
that is upsetting the local community
council<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:38:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0002.htm#13031975000205">The
community council does not want PCSOs to take on the role of traffic
wardens. It is as anxious as anyone to ensure that PCSOs carry out
their role in the community and have a balanced, discretionary
approach. Parking is a matter for the local authority, but the
community council wants the PCSO to have the power to act when she sees
a vehicle parked in the community in a dangerous situation. At present,
only police officers  
<?notus-xml column=256?>can deal with such situations, but that suggestion is entirely

will put the debate in the context of the Government’s wider
police reform agenda. On entering office, the Government set the police
a challenge: we asked forces to cut crime and at the same time undergo
a radical programme of reform. The central objective of the reform is
to re-establish the link between the police and the public, reflecting
Sir Robert Peel’s principle that the police must answer to the
people they serve. The reform of the crime and policing landscape is to
ensure that policing is reconnected to the public and is sustainable,
stronger and successful in pursuit of its core mission.</hs_Para>

have achieved that in a number of ways. First, we scrapped national
targets, as the Government believe that policing must be responsive to
local concerns. Priorities are now set by police and crime
commissioners in consultation with the public who elect them. That
approach is the embodiment of democratic accountability. The hon.
Gentleman correctly talked about localism, which that approach embodies
in that Whitehall is withdrawing from interfering in matters that
should be determined
locally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:41:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0002.htm#13031975000210">Secondly,
we have provided the public with better information about crime in
their area. There is now clear, transparent and accessible
information for the public. I am sure the hon. Gentleman has heard of
police.uk, which I hope he is an avid user of. That website is a
phenomenal success: it has received more than 548 million
hits since its launch, equating to a daily average of more than
200,000. That demonstrates the public’s appetite to know what is
happening in their communities and on their
streets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:42:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0002.htm#13031975000211">Thirdly,
we have changed how forces are held to account, through police and
crime commissioners. The Government have ensured that the public, not
bureaucrats, are the judges of police success. The PCC will be held to
account by the public for the delivery of effective policing. Alongside
that, new roles for key policing partners have been carved out. In the
new landscape we have legislated to make Her Majesty’s
inspectorate of constabulary more robustly independent, so that it acts
directly in the  
<?notus-xml column=257?>public interest. The Independent Police Complaints Commission will

will now move on to the powers available to PCSOs, which are, as the
hon. Member for Wrexham said, set out in the Police Reform Act 2002.
All PCSOs are issued with 20 standard powers that enable them to deal
with antisocial and nuisance behaviour in neighbourhoods. In addition,
there is a list of discretionary powers that can be designated to PCSOs
by chief constables in response to local requirements. The
discretionary nature of the additional powers is important and goes to
the heart of the notion of neighbourhood policing, which, at its core,
is to ensure that policing responds to the needs of local communities.
Discretionary powers ensure that PCSOs are flexible, as they bestow on
chief constables the authority to take the necessary steps to ensure
that their PCSOs are suitably empowered to deal with the issues that
are of most concern to local residents. The Government believe that
these limited and flexible powers are one of the key strengths of
PCSOs, providing them with the time and space necessary to get to know
their local area and actively to engage and build relationships with
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0002.htm#13031975000229">I
am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that the powers available to
PCSOs remain under constant review, and we are always willing to look
at ideas, but we need to ensure we strike the right balance and do not
overburden them. The Government welcome consideration of revisions to
the powers where it is clear that they will enhance, rather than
undermine, this important role. The draft Anti-Social Behaviour Bill,
for example, proposes the introduction of a new dispersal power for
PCSOs. That will replace two existing powers and will allow uniformed
police officers and PCSOs to direct a person who has committed, or is
likely to commit, antisocial behaviour to leave a specified area and
not return for a specified period of up to 48
hours.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031975000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/halltext/130319h0002.htm#13031975000230">We
must be cautious not to overburden PCSOs with powers that could
introduce bureaucracy to the role, taking them away from providing the
visible presence on the streets that we want. Extending the scope of
existing PCSO powers could introduce to the role an unwelcome element
of confrontation that is associated with the power of arrest and is
outside the PCSO’s unique role. Many, in fact, see the power of
arrest as a last—not a first—resort, preferring instead
to focus on being proactive and preventive. Therefore, we need to
ensure that we give full consideration to the issues around extending
PCSO powers.</hs_Para>

that the hon. Member for Wrexham described at the start of the debate,
and then conclude with a general point. Pondering it in our
interregnum, it occurred to me that of all the parking issues, parking
outside schools is probably the easiest to solve. It is overwhelmingly
likely to involve parents, so if the PCSO turned up with a traffic
warden or police officer and ticketed everyone, they probably would not
do it again. If they turned up twice over the course of a couple of
weeks, they certainly would not do it again. Therefore, it is a prime
example of where we can use the PCSO’s power and detailed local
knowledge to bring to bear the forces of law and order in a way that
would prevent future crime. As I said, that would be a good example of
how to use the specific virtues of PCSOs, with the powers that they
have, and also, their ability to relate to local conditions.</hs_Para>

Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Sajid Javid):</Member></B>
High-quality, affordable child care is essential in improving
children’s life chances and supporting parents back into work.
The high cost of child care remains a significant disincentive to work
for too many
parents.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13031962000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/wmstext/130319m0001.htm#13031962000020">The
Government will therefore introduce a new scheme to offer tax-free
child care to working families. Support will ultimately be open to 2.5
million working families with children under 12, around five times as
many as benefit from the current system. Support will be provided at
20%—equivalent to the basic rate of tax—of yearly child
care costs up to £6,000 per child. This will be worth up to
£1,200 per child, and so will save a typical working family with
two children under 12 up to £2,400 a
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13031962000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/wmstext/130319m0001.htm#13031962000021">To
be eligible, families will have all parents in work, with each earning
less than £150,000 a year, and will not already receive support

new scheme will be phased in from autumn 2015, replacing the existing
system of employer-supported child care (ESC) and will build up over
time to include all children under 12, with all children under five
eligible from the first year of
operation.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13031962000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/wmstext/130319m0001.htm#13031962000023">Tax-free
child care will extend support compared to the current system of ESC,
which provides a tax exemption for child care vouchers and directly
contracted child care. ESC will continue for current members if they
want to retain it and new claimants will be able to receive support
through the new tax-free offer. ESC recipients who are eligible may
choose to move into the new tax-free child care scheme if they wish,
but will not be able to receive both. ESC will continue to be open to
new joiners until tax-free child care is available. The tax exemption
available for workplace nurseries will
remain.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13031962000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/wmstext/130319m0001.htm#13031962000024">The
Government will also increase child care support in universal credit to
improve work incentives and ensure that it is worthwhile to work up to
full-time hours for low and middle-income parents. A total of
£200 million of support will be provided within universal
credit, which is equivalent to covering 85% of child care costs for
households qualifying for the universal credit child care element where
the lone parent or both earners in a couple pay income tax. The details
of how to provide this support will be determined as part of the
consultation on the scheme for tax-free child care, to ensure the two
schemes operate effectively
together.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13031962000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/wmstext/130319m0001.htm#13031962000025">The
new tax-free offer will be phased in from autumn 2015, partly funded by
the phasing out of ESC. The £200 million universal credit offer
is planned to be phased 
<?notus-xml column=38?>in from April 2016 as child care support moves from tax credits into
universal credit and will be funded from within social security budgets
at the time. Details will be set out in future spending
reviews.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13031962000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/wmstext/130319m0001.htm#13031962000026">This
announcement builds on support already announced by the Government,
including increasing the free entitlement to 15 hours a week of free
early education all three and four-year-olds; extending the free
entitlement to around 40% of two-year-olds from 2014-15; and extending
child care support in universal credit to parents working fewer than 16
hours.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13031962000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/wmstext/130319m0001.htm#13031962000027">At
the same time, the Government are taking action to drive up the quality
of child care and give more flexibility to professionals: improving
qualifications through introducing early years teachers; increasing
Ofsted’s focus on weaker provision, to drive up quality; and
reducing bureaucracy for providers. Alongside improving standards in
the early years, this will help ensure that parents’ money goes
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13031962000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/wmstext/130319m0001.htm#13031962000028">The

29 May 2012, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government allocated £60 million of capital funding to tackle
“clusters” of empty homes in areas of lower demand, but
where there was good potential for homes to be occupied. Funding was
allocated as un-ring-fenced grant to 20 local authorities, including
£1,910,788 to Lancaster City Council. This funding will bring
3,600 homes back into use through an intensive street by street
approach. Some of these will be at an affordable rent but there will
also be mixed tenure schemes, reflecting the nature of local housing
markets. The Government’s funding needed to be match funded with
this coming from either public or private sector
sources.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13031955000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/petntext/130319p0001.htm#13031955000012">Lancaster
City Council’s award was to bring up to 114 empty homes back as
part of the wider improvement strategy for the Morecambe West
End’s housing. The Cluster area focuses on the Central West End
area and includes the whole of the Chatsworth Gardens site. Since
receiving the Secretary of State’s approval of the project,
Lancaster City Council have been considering the most positive and
viable route to deliver the programme. A way forward has now been
proposed and agreed by their Cabinet on 4 December

purpose of the independent examination is set out at section 20 (5) of
the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. The role of the
inspector is to assess whether the plan has been prepared in accordance
with relevant legal requirements, and whether it is sound. For a plan
to be found sound it must be positively prepared, justified, legally
compliant and consistent with national policies. At the Examination
stage the council will also need to demonstrate how it has
appropriately considered the views of local people; and demonstrate
that its proposals are based on robust

it forward to

section 21 of the 2004 Act, if the Secretary of State thinks that a
local development document (Local Plan) is unsatisfactory he may at any
time before the document is adopted direct the local planning authority
to modify the document in accordance with the direction and give
reasons. Section 27 of the Act applies if the Secretary of State thinks
that a local planning authority are failing or omitting to do anything
it is necessary for them to do in connection with the preparation,

Each of the leading 50 payday lenders, inspected as part of the

given 12 weeks to change their business practices or risk losing their
licences. The OFT also has specific enforcement action under way with
more in the

setting out their expectations of the industry and launching a

detention for immigration purposes and has met that commitment by
radically changing the system to ensure that the welfare of the child
is at the heart of the decision and returns process. In exceptional

while alternative arrangements are made for their care and safety. To
release unaccompanied children before social workers have arrived to

Harper:</Member></B> When a detainee held in an immigration centre in
England or Scotland needs to be released to an address in Northern
Ireland, or any other UK address, the immigration centre operator
(either a public or private sector service provider operated centre)
issues the detainee with a travel warrant, which allows the detainee to
travel to his nearest rail station. In the case of Northern Ireland
this warrant would cover the cost of the ferry between the mainland and
Northern Ireland. The money for the warrant forms part of the operating
cost for any immigration removal centre and is therefore fully funded
by the UK Border Agency.</hs_Para>

third-parties, such as community groups, charities and local
authorities will have an important role to play in engaging consumers

involvement. The Department is also working with stakeholders to ensure

more high quality graduates consider a career in early years teaching.
Early Years Teachers will build on the strengths of the Early

primary classroom trainee teachers. The change will give one title of
'teacher 'across the early years and schools workforce which can be

know that universities use a range of information and evidence about
applicants for admissions purposes. Even within individual

adopted conclusions on the protection and welfare of animals. The
Netherlands submitted a declaration expressing concern at the
Commission's lack of ambition in the EU Welfare Strategy and the
importance of dealing with the shortcomings identified in their review
of the animal transport legislation—and abstained. Sweden,
supported by Belgium, Austria and Denmark, made a statement to the same
effect as that made by the Netherlands. The UK also made a statement on
improving welfare during transport, noting particularly the importance
of scientific evidence. The Commission noted the widespread support for
their Strategy and promised to bring forward various non-legislative

transportation.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13031993000715" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/text/130319w0002.htm#13031993000715">There

designation in 2013 and which require further consideration, the
Department considers it wise that regulators such as the Marine
Management Organisation (MMO) should not consider these sites as marine
conservation zones under the relevant requirements of the legislation.
However, the enhanced evidence base associated with any such area will
be relevant and material to any licensing decision by the MMO. As such,
regulatory authorities may wish to utilise any such evidence that has
been gathered by the regional projects and the statutory nature
conservation bodies in performing their statutory duties. Regulators
will consider whether it is appropriate to protect the features in such
sites through current legislative provisions. Ultimately, the final
decisions on these issues rest with the relevant

the costs and benefits of the whole package of reforms and shows all

last full year of the Audit Commission's operation before the
Government's programme of reform began in 2010) to 2019-20. It shows
all costs and savings in the run up to and after the closure of the
residual Audit Commission. It shows that the programme to end routine
inspection and assessment, disband the Audit Commission and introduce a

a proxy for the number of awards made, it is possible to look at the
number of claims determined by employment tribunals in favour of
claimants. By way of background, employment tribunals have jurisdiction
to hear complaints in respect of the failure of an employer to pay
wages, or in respect of the unauthorised deductions from wages. All
such complaints presented are categorised by employment tribunals under
a specific reference code, and management information can be obtained
in respect of that
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303204000459" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130319/text/130319w0004.htm#1303204000459">The
Ministry of Justice publishes, annually and quarterly, statistical data
on workload trends in tribunals including employment tribunals. These
data include the volume of complaints presented to, and disposed of by,
employment tribunals, broken down by jurisdictional type. This includes
reference to complaints for unauthorised deductions from wages. It also
includes data on the type of disposal in respect of those complaint
types—so it is possible to see the number of
‘successful’ and ‘unsuccessful’ complaints
determined at a hearing for all ‘unauthorised deduction’
complaints, for example; or the number of complaints of a particular

can be presented as free-standing complaints by a claimant; or as one
of two or more complaints making up a larger claim. Where two or more
complaints make up a claim, the component complaints could have
different outcomes—for example one could be
‘successful’ and the other ‘unsuccessful’.
Because of this, it is difficult to present data on the outcome of
global claims, as distinct from the outcome of the jurisdictional
complaints that make up those claims, using the format employed by our

policy for the provision of inter-prison visits by prisoners can be
found in Prison Service Instruction (PSI) 16/2011 “Providing
Visits and Services to Visitors”. The purpose of inter-prison
visits is to enable close relatives, where both parties are prisoners
at separate establishments, to maintain strong family ties.
Inter-prison visits will be granted by the Governor only where security
requirements are met. The decision to allow any visit must be balanced
against the need to maintain security and keep prisoners in lawful
custody. Visits must be well managed, monitored, and where necessary
due to inappropriate behaviour, terminated to maintain the good order
and discipline of the prison. A copy of PSI 16/2011 can be found

claims performance in two key areas: the timeliness of cases that have
a final court hearing; and the settlement rate. Table 1 as follows
shows the average time in weeks for each court in Essex from allocation
to hearing for small claims cases that went to hearing from January
2008 to September 2012. Between January and September 2012
Southend-on-Sea was 15 weeks, the same as the national figure. Data for
the quarter to December 2012 will be published on 28 March 2013. We are
constantly reviewing listing practices to improve timeliness in this
area. In the 12 months to September 2012 Southend had a settlement rate
for small claims of 87%, Essex overall, 77%, and England and Wales
