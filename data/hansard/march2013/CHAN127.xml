important part of our programme sector-based work academies represent.
They provide a combination of work experience, training and a
guaranteed job interview. Jobcentre Plus will work closely with
employers throughout the country to organise the right type of
sector-based work academies, but I encourage Members to work with
jobcentres to identify good opportunities in that
regard.</hs_Para>

One of the challenges is that the money is sometimes transferred

trustees not to be transferring money—authorising the transfer
of money—out into suspicious pension funds. So trustees have a

the law stands, when a local authority agrees that a family needs an
extra bedroom because their child’s disability means that they
are unable to share, the family can be entitled to the spare room
subsidy in respect of that extra bedroom. As with housing benefit
claims, the determination of whether their disability requires them to
have an extra bedroom is a matter for the local authority to decide
with the help of DWP guidance and medical evidence. This week we will
issue final guidance to local authorities on a number of areas,

the National Housing Federation estimates that there are 2,000

they were. It now transpires that the Prime Minister’s meetings
with the proprietors and editors of national newspapers were not
published until very recently for any date beyond last June. Now we
have the information for up until September. This very afternoon,
serious decisions are being made about what should be done to implement
the Leveson inquiry and to introduce legislation to this House. Will
you confirm that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport

was not strictly speaking accurate?</hs_Para>

pay for public services. The industry is by far our biggest exporter,

me continue to make my point. The financial services sector is of great
importance to Britain, but that importance carries risks for this
country. At their peak, the banks’ balance sheets amounted to
500% of UK GDP, compared with 100% in the US and 300% in France and
Germany. In 2008, for example, the Royal Bank of Scotland was the
biggest bank in the world and, as we all know, Britain also witnessed
the first bank run for more than a century, with depositors queuing in
the streets to get their savings out of Northern Rock. RBS and HBOS had
to be bailed out, with £65 billion of
taxpayers’ money needed to shore up the
banks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:08:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031112000281" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0001.htm#13031112000281">The
system of regulation failed, as did the culture of the banking sector,
in not preventing and resolving the crisis without recourse to
taxpayers’ money or otherwise putting people’s deposits
at risk. That is why fundamental reform was needed, the first pillar of
which has been put in place through the passage of the Financial
Services Act 2012, which received Royal Assent in December and
establishes a clear and distinct role for prudential regulation and
conduct regulation, a role that was blurred and ineffective.</hs_Para>

the basic architecture of the ring fence by making it an objective of
the regulator—the Prudential Regulation Authority and, if
necessary, the Financial Conduct Authority—to secure the
continuity of core services by preventing ring-fenced bodies from
exposing themselves to excessive risks, by protecting them from
external risks, and by ensuring that, in the event of failure, core
activities can carry on uninterrupted, the so-called resolution
objective. The core activities are defined, as recommended by Vickers,
as the taking of retail and small and medium-sized enterprise deposits
and overdrafts, but they can be added to if required through secondary
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:14:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031112000297" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0001.htm#13031112000297">In

arrangements; treasury and balance sheet management; risk management;
and human resource management. As the parliamentary commission has also
recommended, directors of banks will be held personally responsible for

commission also made a recommendation that the ring fence should be

summarise what the Bill does include before I go on to talk
about what it does not. As proposed by the independent commission, the
Bill provides that deposits protected by the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme—the deposits of individuals and small
businesses up to £85,000—will be preferential debts in
insolvency. The Bill provides the regulator with the power to require
ring-fenced banks to maintain a buffer of at least 17% of what is
referred to as the primary loss absorbing capacity—that is,
equity, other non-equity capital instruments, and debt that can be
written down or converted into equity in the event that a bank fails.
This allows losses to fall on the bank’s wholesale
creditors—sophisticated financial investors—rather than
on ordinary taxpayers, as was the case with
RBS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:18:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031112000307" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0001.htm#13031112000307">A
legitimate question arises as to whether additional loss absorbency
requirements should apply, in an international financial centre such as
the United Kingdom, to the overseas operations of UK-based global
banks. This has been much debated in the House, both before the
parliamentary commission and
elsewhere<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:19:13"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
obviously right that where the overseas businesses of a UK-based bank
could pose a threat to UK financial stability, or to the British
taxpayer, that bank should issue loss-absorbing debt against the
entirety of its group operations. Equally, where
overseas units do not pose such a threat they should be exempt from
loss-absorbing debt requirements, not least to avoid creating a false
impression that the UK somehow stands behind those overseas
businesses.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_11_PT_1/47FB8E6B3B8C92A98C16A2003EF0518EE1B8B756" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 March 2013">Monday

The Government have listened to the Financial Services Authority and
the parliamentary commission on how that should work. We agree that the
requirement should follow the strategy for managing the failure of each
group, know as the resolution strategy. Where a UK parent company will
provide support to resolve failing overseas operations, the regulator
must ensure that the parent company issues loss-absorbing debt against
the entire group. However, where a bank’s overseas subsidiaries
would be resolved locally by overseas regulators without reliance on
the UK parent, the parent company should not be required to issue
loss-absorbing debt against those overseas subsidiaries. Crucially, it
will not be the bank’s call but the decision of the regulator
and the Treasury as to whether group primary loss-absorbing
capacity—PLAC—should be

question remaining is about the precise level of the leverage ratio. I
referred earlier to the British dilemma of how to maintain an
internationally competitive financial sector without imposing risks on
domestic taxpayers. This is a case in which that dilemma is, to be
frank, most acute. When it comes to capital requirements, international
agreements have already established that different countries will have
different requirements. The European Union capital requirements
directive, CRD4, provides for member states to have discretion to go
beyond agreed capital
requirements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T16:33:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031112000339" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031112000339">In
the case of the leverage ratio, the 3% Basel III recommendation was for
the requirement to be binding only from 2018, and it is not clear yet
whether there will be the flexibility in European law to
increase it as Vickers and the parliamentary commission recommend. The
Vickers commission did not recommend that the higher leverage ratio
should apply before 2019, in order, for reasons that I think we all
understand, to minimise the impact on lending in the short term while
the economy is still

during our repeated consultations, concerns have been raised by
institutions such as building societies that they could be caught by a
4% leverage ratio despite having a relatively low-risk portfolio of
assets, thereby restricting lending to home owners. Moreover, it would
lead to assets in Spanish property, for example, being viewed as equal
to US Government bonds for the purposes of the calculation. Our view,
therefore, is that at this time we should follow the international
approach and press for countries to have a power to set a higher ratio

acutely important that the leverage ratio provides that protection. As

suggested in the reports of the two commissions. I strongly believe
that the concentrated nature of the UK banking industry is
unacceptable. I want to see far greater possibility, and indeed
reality, of entry into the market by new banks and building societies.
One of the barriers to that has been access to the UK payments system.
Potential challengers have to win the permission of incumbents to be
able to use the system. The Government will therefore shortly consult
on a proposal to make access to the payments system regulated, to
ensure that it is available on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory
terms. Subject to the findings of the consultation, the Government will
consider tabling amendments to the Bill to give the regulator the

Britain’s financial services sector is larger than most, and
with the greatest financial centre on the planet in the City of London
we must take additional steps to guard against the risk of future
collapse. The Financial Services Act 2012 sought to address regulatory

advent of the FSA in 1998 was a step forward from the dark ages of
self-regulation, but that regulatory framework was not capable of
policing the extreme risks and dangers of a rapidly expanding global
banking sector, interdependent from country to country. We agree with
the need to introduce prudential regulation and greater systemic
oversight, but that theory has not yet been translated into reality.
Although there were regulatory shortcomings, we should be in no doubt
that primary culpability rests with the banks, which should not be
allowed to get away without reform.</hs_Para>

Vickers Banking Commission concluded that structural firewalls are
needed to supplement capital safety buffers, which is undoubtedly true.
With this Bill some of the legislative underpinnings for those
firewalls will gradually take shape, and to the extent that it enables
the ring-fencing of retail from investment banking, we welcome that.
However, the Bill merely provides the scaffolding for the basic
building blocks that will come at a later date, largely in secondary
legislation by Treasury order. It focuses only on structural
scaffolding, not on wholesale reform of the standard and culture of the
banking sector—something we hope that the cross-party
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards will help focus on to
help fortify the Bill in due course.

As I said earlier, that shows total disregard for the parliamentary
process and flies in the face of the Banking Commission’s
careful recommendations. The Bill is already a cursory framework
because it is largely a string of enabling powers for the Treasury to
arrange for ring-fencing through secondary legislation. The Government
established the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards to ensure
that recommendations could be added to the Bill. So far, however, we
have had only part 1 of that commission’s points about

this is merely a tick-box exercise and a part of the process that does
not matter, and there is no need to scrutinise the final proposals.
Dropping in late additions to the Bill on Report or—more
likely—during consideration in the Lords, is not an appropriate
way to legislate. As I said, the parliamentary commission recommended a
three-month gap between publication of the Bill and commencement of the

is clear that the commission wants a full separation power only after a
full review and decision by Government and Parliament—perhaps it
was being inadvertently misrepresented by the Treasury—so it
would be far more sensible to legislate now, not just if one
or two individual banks misbehave, but in case ring-fencing as a whole
fails across the sector. Indeed, we see cross-sector failings, as LIBOR
illustrates, so it is not enough to have a half-done backstop. Stopping
short will deliver only half the backstop measures that we need and
will have corporate lawyers across the City rubbing their hands with
glee at the prospect of litigation against regulators who might want to
intervene on a case-by-case basis. However, given the possible views of

Leslie:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is spot on. A bank’s
leverage is the ratio of its assets to its equity capital. Its equity
is equal to the value of its assets minus the value of its liabilities.
A higher leverage ratio magnifies returns because any growth in the
assets will be proportionally greater if equity is thin. The corollary,
however, is that any losses are also magnified if leverage is greater.

of over-extending themselves, putting at risk either their customers or
the taxpayer. It is very simple. We need to listen to the carefully
thought through advice of the banking standards commission, the Vickers
report and others, including the incoming Governor of the Bank of
England, on these particular issues. The Government may call it the
British dilemma, but it is astonishing that they always seem to be
asking the European Union to come to their rescue at some point 
<?notus-xml column=55?>with some reform to deal with bail-in or whatever
other problems happen to be around later on down the track. That is not

me deal with the issue of derivatives inside the ring fence, as I know
that the parliamentary commission has been concerned about it. The
Vickers report said that derivatives trading should not be
allowed—full stop. The parliamentary commission recognised,
however, that there were services on the margins where some simple
derivative products might be permitted, but it
added<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:10:56"></hs_TimeCode>

agree with the commission on that issue. We need clearer protections to
prevent abuses within the ring-fenced retail banks where derivatives
are sold. That was illustrated, of course, by the mis-selling of some
interest rate hedging products to small and medium-sized enterprises.
The danger is one of information asymmetry between customer and vendor
and the fact that the trade became exceptionally lucrative for the
banks. We have to move away from this era of the exploitation of the
customer’s lack of knowledge, and the commission was clear about
that in the three tests it set.</hs_Para>

have seen one of the drafts of the secondary orders, subsequent to the
commission’s recommendations. It is therefore worth comparing
that order with the tests that the commission has set. The commission
said that there should be adequate safeguards against mis-selling, but
as far as I can see, the draft order does not go into any detail about
how the Prudential Regulation Authority or the Financial Conduct
Authority will enforce anything new. The commission said that there
should be a clear definition of simple derivatives, which will be
allowed, versus complex derivatives, which will be disallowed, but the
draft order seems to define simple derivatives quite widely—in
other words, as instruments designed to tackle interest rate risk,
exchange rate risk, default risk, liquidity risk or for dealing in
assets included in the liquid assets buffer. It would be easier if the
Minister set out what would not be allowed rather than what would be
allowed in the ring

third test relates to limits on the proportion of a bank’s
balance sheet. The commission thought that was necessary, but the draft
order so far leaves out what that percentage should be. There is a
space left for a figure before the percentage sign, so perhaps the
Minister can give us a sense of what that proportion of the
bank’s balance sheet should be. That was one of the
commission’s tests, as I said, so we need to secure assurances
from the Minister about the Government’s intentions. As Martin
Taylor said in his evidence to the

to talk about the need for the banking system also to enhance our
economic prospects, support enterprise and growth, and maintain the
supply of credit to the economy. Those are some of the issues that our
constituents are concerned about for the future. Nothing in the Bill
looks forward at the challenges facing business or the economy more
broadly. So we want to see urgent action—ideally in the Budget,
but if not in this Bill—that improves the operation of the
funding for lending scheme to ensure that lending to small business is
prioritised. We called for that last summer when the scheme began, but
since then net 
<?notus-xml column=58?>lending to business has fallen further and further still. It is very
important that we take this moment to improve and adapt the funding for
lending scheme in this way. We must recognise that we have had the
failure of Project Merlin and we have had credit easing, which was
given eight months to do the job. So funding for lending is the third
scheme that the Chancellor has tried and we have to make sure that it
is changed in a way that makes these things work.</hs_Para>

Andrew Tyrie</B> (Chichester) (Con):</Member> Last July, immediately
after its creation, the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards
was asked by the House to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny of this
Bill. In other words, in addition to fulfilling its terms of reference
it was asked to examine the Government’s proposals for the
implementation of large parts of the Vickers review. We have worked
very hard to do what the House has asked of us, and I particularly wish
to thank all my colleagues on the commission; all the commoners are in
the Chamber today and although I cannot see any of the five peers up in
the Gallery, their work has been not inconsiderable—as has been
pointed out, they are a formidable bunch. I also wish to thank the
Treasury Committee, which has continued to participate in aspects of
this debate in our inquiries and the vast majority of whose
members—nine, I believe—are also in the
Chamber.</hs_Para>

first report from the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards,
published in December, welcomed the Government’s decision to
implement the Vickers ring fence, but we also argued that the ring
fence had to be made much more robust if it was to have a good chance
of enduring. We suggested that the level of innovation in financial
services, the lobbying power of the banks, and the short memories of
regulators and politicians all pointed to the need to reinforce the
ring fence. That is why the commission recommended that the ring fence
be supported by a reserve power, subject to final Treasury approval, to
enable the regulator to impose full separation on a bank that attempted
to game the ring fence. The Government have now accepted the
merits of that recommendation and the Bill will be amended to provide
for the reserve power, which is very welcome news.</hs_Para>

their response to our report, however, the Government did not accept a
number of other proposals, so we produced a second report. It was
published today and it seeks to do three simple things. First, for the
convenience of the House, especially those Members who will serve on
the Committee, it provides draft amendments to support all our
proposals that might need statutory backing. As far as I know, that is
an innovation for a Select Committee or Joint Committee and I hope that
it will be of some use and perhaps set a precedent for how such
Committees operate.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:25:18"></hs_TimeCode>The amendments

an annex juxtaposes our recommendations against the Government’s
response to enable the House to see clearly what has been accepted and
what has been rejected.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031112000441" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031112000441">Thirdly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:31:39"></hs_TimeCode>,
the report examines the arguments made by the Government for
rejecting a number of our recommendations. We were able do that on the
basis of further evidence gathered from, among others, Sir John
Vickers, the Governor of the Bank of England, the deputy governors and
the chief executives and chairmen of most of the major banks.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:26:02"></hs_TimeCode>We have
concluded that much more work is needed to improve the Bill and I shall
linger briefly on only two areas. Much of what needs to be said is in
the report and I hope that colleagues will find time to read
it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031112000442" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031112000442"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:26:17"></hs_TimeCode>The
first area is leverage. The parliamentary commission has not heard a
convincing argument for blocking, as the Government seem determined to,
the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England from setting the
leverage ratio. We have concluded that the ratio is likely to be too
low—that is, that banks are likely to remain
overleveraged—but we also think that that judgment should rest
with the financial stability regulator, the Financial Policy Committee,
and not with the Chancellor. We argue that the regulator will want to
consider long transitional arrangements, particularly for building
societies—the Minister mentioned his concerns about
this—as some problems particularly apply to those with large
mortgage books. In our first report, paragraph 295 and the
paragraphs preceding it go into the issue in some detail.</hs_Para>

also argue that the Bank of England should provide an annual assessment
to Parliament on risk-weighting. It is clear to anybody who has
considered the 
<?notus-xml column=60?>composition of risk-weightings and how they are derived, including the
fact that they are based on modelling by the banks themselves, that to
rely on risk-weighting alone would be a perilous task. It is vital that
that should be supported by a robust leverage ratio, as risk-weightings
are not a good measure, on their own, of overall balance sheet
risk.</hs_Para>

Government have rejected all those suggestions and, frankly, I find it
surprising that they cling to the line, which we heard again today,
that we should wait for Basel—that is, that we should wait for
other countries to decide. As many witnesses have said, it is for us to
sort out what is best for Britain. We need to work out what is right
for our industry, rather than waiting for a lowest common denominator
decision from the Basel group.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:28:35"></hs_TimeCode>I was a little
disappointed to hear more in that tone from the Government
today.</hs_Para>

time to time, the Government even remind us, as they did today, that
the transfer of the power to the Financial Policy Committee, if and
when it happens in 2018, should occur only after it has been reviewed.
In other words, it is possible that the Government might conclude that
it should not be transferred at all. I think that would be a grave
mistake. Getting leverage right is crucial to the future of the banking
industry. With twin peaks in place and the financial policy up and
running, it must be right to give that power to the
FPC.<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

major outstanding area of disagreement is the Government’s
rejection of a second reserve power for industry-wide separation. Our
first report made it clear that this should be exercisable only after a
fully independent review, after a recommendation from the regulator,
and with Treasury approval. Not only did the Government reject the
second reserve power, but in their first published response they even
rejected the case for an independent review after a few years to assess
the effectiveness of the ring fence.</hs_Para>

give the authority directly to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but I
understand what he means if he thinks that Parliament should be given
some opportunity to debate the issue. It is possible that some scope
for flexibility could be built in to reconcile the point that he is
making and the point that the commission is making. What would be
unacceptable would be for the legislation to reach the statute book
without a power of general separation and without there having been a
thoroughgoing independent review. If those are in place, the extent to
which Parliament can be involved a second time, and

some of the sector’s structural problems, and there is a lot

issues, the problems of standards and the culture in banking. We have
just had a shocking LIBOR scandal and the wholesale rigging of crucial
wholesale markets, and we have seen the equally shocking rip-off of
consumers in the payment protection insurance scandal and of small
business in the interest rate swap scandal. Those and other

right to have made a start with this Bill. I very much hope that they

Pat McFadden</B> (Wolverhampton South East) (Lab):</Member> I would
like to begin where the Minister began, with this issue of the British
dilemma: the relationship between 
<?notus-xml column=62?>the size of our financial services industry and the rest of our economy.
It is right that it is a very big UK industry. It is a big contributor
to taxes, as the Minister said, and it is a major employer. It has a
cluster of expertise around it, including law, accountancy, and
consultancy services, which are also important contributors to our
exports.</hs_Para>

are two views that we can take because of that importance. One is the
view, sometimes canvassed, that because of its size we cannot
touch it, or only in a minimal way, because if we harm this huge
industry it will go to Singapore or the United States; it will go
somewhere. But there is another view, which I would like to advance in
this debate, that the very size of the industry in relation to the UK
economy places a responsibility on us to ensure that that size does not
damage the interests of UK taxpayers or the real economy.</hs_Para>

have seen through the crisis that occurred several years ago precisely
how damaging failure in that industry can be to the wider economy. I do
not have to remind the House about the results of that failure in terms
of the bail-outs, the deficits and the decisions about tax and
spending, the consequences of which our constituents are living with
today and will be living with for many years to come. The approach that
we should take to this British dilemma is to say, yes, the industry is
valuable and important, but because of its very size we believe in the
need for particular measures in the UK to insulate us from wider
damage. Simply to stress the size of the industry and to ask for it to
be left alone whenever someone comes up with a regulatory proposal is,
to put it in the language that bankers would understand, a one-way
trade, and a one-way trade is not good enough. We need a two-way trade
that protects the interests of taxpayers

Field</B> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):</Member> The right

Innovation and Skills at the time of the bail-outs of the banks, which
are commonly regarded as a great success. As part and parcel of looking
back on the past while also preparing for the future, does he recognise
that elements of those bail-outs were not quite the success that they
were portrayed as at the time? To get out of the large positions that
we still hold in Lloyds Banking Group and RBS with any profit, let
alone the large profit that perhaps we should have been negotiating at
the outset, seems a long time away. Does he recognise that mistakes

McFadden:</Member></B> One of the reasons for having this debate is
that when the crisis hit in 2007-08 there was no proper resolution
mechanism or bail-out regime in place to ensure that bondholders,
rather than taxpayers, were on the hook for bank failure. We are having
this debate precisely because we did not have the tools in place in
legislation to deal with the global crisis when it unfolded. As I have
said, what we need is a two-way
trade<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:40:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031112000462" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031112000462"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Field" PimsId="3229" UID="13031112000844" xid="198" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031112000844">Mark
Field:</Member></B> I do not buy into the argument that the tools were
not in place. In reality, it was not that many of the businesses were
too big to fail, but that they were too interconnected, which I accept
put us in a very different position from that in any previous bail-out.
In relation to any insolvency or restructuring, there were 
<?notus-xml column=63?>and are protocols in place, and they should have been adopted to ensure
the best value for the taxpayer in the long term. That did not happen

me turn to the Bill and some of the issues before us today. There is
broad agreement on the need for some kind of structural separation
between retail and investment banking. It is important to understand
that the point of ring-fencing, as recommended by the Vickers
commission, is not to ensure that no retail bank can ever
fail—that is impossible—but to make failure, if it does
occur, more manageable by insulating the risks and focusing the
resolution effort on the essential services that the Government judge
it in the public interest to protect: people’s savings, the
payments service and simple consumer and SME lending. It would be going
too far, and it would be far too rash, to say that that solves the
“too big to fail” problem. However, ring-fencing ought to
reduce the risks of future failure to taxpayers and the wider
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031112000465" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031112000465"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:42:05"></hs_TimeCode>As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:42:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Chichester (Mr Tyrie) has said, the parliamentary commission, on
which I serve, made two proposals in relation to structural separation.
The first was the reserve power to separate individual banks should
they try to burrow under, climb over, erode or get through—or
any other metaphor that has been used—the fence, and the
Government have accepted that recommendation. The second was to have a
wider power to enforce separation on the sector as a whole. That second
power would be needed precisely because problems in the sector do not
come in the neatly wrapped form of one institution. As we saw in
2007-08, contagion is a fact of life in banking; the weakness of one
can quickly affect others. Cultural problems in one part of the sector
also spread quickly. It is precisely because problems in the industry
are often widespread that there is a strong case for taking a reserve
power to enforce separation on the sector as a whole, in the event that
the sector tries to get around the intention of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:43:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031112000466" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031112000466"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stewart Hosie" PimsId="4796" UID="13031112000846" xid="835" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031112000846">Stewart

is not, as the Minister argued, about introducing two policies at once;
it is about introducing a policy and making sure that it is adhered to.
As the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:45:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier) said in this House a few weeks
ago, the banks have nothing to fear if they adhere to the spirit and
letter of the Bill. It need not introduce uncertainty, as some have

about the ring fence.</hs_Para>

capital and leverage, it is absolutely true that in the run-up to the
crisis banks were over-leveraged, and that is because they held too
little capital against the risks that they had. The Vickers commission
was very clear about that. It recommended a future leverage ratio of
25:1, which is still quite high in historical terms, while the
Government are recommending 33:1 because that is the internationally
accepted Basel outcome. Without going into any more detail, I just say
to the Minister that this goes back to the one-way trade to which I
referred. It is a really important question running through all these
reforms. If, every time we rub up against an issue, we say that we
cannot damage the industry because it is so big here in the UK and we
therefore have to stick to the lowest common denominator of
international reforms, we will not be doing our duty to the UK economy
or to UK taxpayers. If we have learned anything from the crisis of 2007
and 2008, it ought to be that there is a case for taking particular
measures here in the UK precisely because of the size of the sector in
relation to our wider economy. That is the basis on which we should
judge the correct degree of leverage for the banks that operate in the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:47:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031112000475" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031112000475">Then
there is the question of resolution and bail-in: in other words, what
happens when a bank fails, and who is on the hook for that failure? In
2008, it was the taxpayers, not the bondholders, because a resolution
mechanism was not in place in law that could allow for normal
insolvency procedures were those to whom the banks owed money to take
the risk. A very important part of the reforms is to change that
situation. Bail-in is 
<?notus-xml column=65?>signed up to by the Government, but, like
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:48:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie), I am very curious as to
why the Government are pursuing this through the European resolution
and recovery directive. I would have thought, particularly after last
week, that the Government might be somewhat nervous about pursuing a
major financial services reform through a European directive. I return
again to the one-way trade argument. Surely, because of the importance
of this industry here in the UK, we should legislate to make sure that
bondholders take a future risk and not UK taxpayers, and we should not
leave it to the very uncertain process of a European directive
negotiation. That might work out fine; there might be spontaneous
agreement among the 27 member states. However, I am sure that the
Minister agrees that that there is a very real possibility—this
is not uncommon—that that would not be the case. I ask him to
think again on the bail-in regime and to ensure that a proper UK
decision is taken rather than leaving it all to a European directive. I
would have thought that Government Members would support such a
suggestion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:49:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031112000476" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031112000476">In
conclusion, I want to reiterate the point about time. The parliamentary
commission, which was set up by the Chancellor, has spent six months
taking in—the chairman,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T17:50:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Chichester has done more totting up than me—60-odd oral
evidence sessions and much written evidence. It is simply not good
enough for the Minister to say that he will take the Bill out of
Committee by the end of April, before we issue our final report. The
Opposition supported the establishment of the parliamentary commission
after the House had voted on the issue. We expect its recommendations
to be properly considered by the Government, not swept out of the way
by the timetable. I hope that the Minister will think again, because
the structural issues under discussion are not the only issues.
Important changes still need to be made to banking culture, standards
and corporate governance, so that this very important industry
contributes positively to the UK and does not put the economy and
taxpayers at

imposed an absolute separation between commercial banking and
investment banking. It also banned proprietary trading in commercial
banking. The essence of Glass-Steagall in 1933, by which Roosevelt
managed to save the American banking system, was to root out conflicts
of interest, which are the evil at the heart of universal banking.
Banks were told that they had to choose between servicing a client and
promoting their own short-term interests. Combining the two inevitably
creates conflicts of interest that lead to many other problems.

look at the Bill and at the Ministers and my reaction is to ask,
“Is this it?” Considering what we have been through and
the problems in British and world banking, is this Bill the best that
we, as legislators, can do? If that is the case, it is no surprise that
we are increasingly derided outside this
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:03:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000003">The
Minister should have set the context. I offer him my file detailing the
top 50 banks in the world by assets. What unifies those top 50 banks is
that every single one, without exception, either has been
subject to major convictions for criminal fraud recently or is being
investigated for criminal fraud. The Americans have been
very good at portraying this as a British problem. They have, perfectly
properly, exposed problems and illegalities in British banks. However,
their banks are doing the same and worse, as are banks the
world over. That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:05:12"></hs_TimeCode>
sums up the problem. What other industry could have all 50 of its top
players committing criminal fraud at the same time while the
world’s legislators are happy to do just a bit of poking, a
little juggling and a few bits and
pieces?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000004">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:09:24"></hs_TimeCode>
do not disagree with the bits and pieces, especially if there is
strengthening and improvement, but is that all we are going to do? I
heard reference to the 1930s and I have heard that time used
before as a comparison. We are doing the same thing with the same
boldness, but it did not work in the 1930s because 1931 turned into
1933 and into 1939 to 1945. That was the consequence. We therefore need
to be significantly bolder in what we are doing. This Parliament, like
other legislatures, remains cowed by the bluster and power of
investment
banking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:06:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000005">There
are models that are different from the British model of investment
banking. The Chinese have a very different model. We seem to be
forgetting how successful that model is. While we are sellotaping our
banking system together, they are building a competitive base that will
dominate the world economy for generations. It is as if we are the
fools at the Chinese emperor’s ball. By using a model of cheap
finance, concentrating on raw materials and technological transfer,
investing in skills and infrastructure, and planning for the medium
term, China is showing how ruthless simplicity creates permanent
competitive advantage. That contrasts with the short-term monetary
advantage that our investment banking model offers. We play with paper
while the Chinese build with concrete. Worse than that, they
are developing tomorrow’s building materials, designs and
visions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:07:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000006">A
simpler, democratic model that similarly contrasts with the British
investment banking model is the German model. An example is KfW, which
was formed in 1948. Its lending to business in 2011, the last year for
which I could find figures, was €70 billion out of a loan
portfolio of nearly €500 billion. That is a less risky and less
speculative model than our money market, casino model. Just like the
Chinese model, which I do not recommend but do admire, the German model
is beating ours. The danger is that we are playing yesterday’s
games, whereas those countries are playing tomorrow’s games.
That is a bit like the
1930s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:08:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000007">We
must not be fearful of investment bankers. We should not just create an
electric ring fence between retail and investment banking, but should
consider 
<?notus-xml column=69?>whether the model that we have is fit for purpose. One thing that it
certainly is not is competitive. We have allowed a model that does not
create competition, and the Bill does nothing about that. There is the
hope of the challenger banks, but they have not been very successful
and there is more that we could do to help them. Over the past 20 years
in this country, we have stripped out
competition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000008">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:09:15"></hs_TimeCode>
would like to be able to follow the advice that I was given when I
first got a bank account: “Put your money somewhere safe. You
won’t get a great deal of interest on it compared with other
places, but it’ll be reliable and it’ll help you get a
mortgage and buy a house in the future.” It was called a
building society. That was only one part of the model, but there were a
lot of them all over the country not many years
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The problem
with the Bill is that there could end up being even fewer of them and a
greater concentration of the tiny number that there are. Building
societies are only one part of the financial services market that I
want to see, but they should be a significant part—at least 30%,
if that is what consumers want, but consumers have not been
given the
choice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:10:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000009">There
is no real competition. Where is the national interest test for
takeovers and mergers? The vast majority of investment banking’s
speculative profits over the past 20 years has come from the mania for
takeovers and mergers. Germany has such a test, and would anyone try to
merge or take over a major conglomerate in China? I do not think so. A
national interest test should be in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:11:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000010">The
two state banks should be broken up, and the Halifax building society
should be recreated out of them, but we need far more than that.
Competition should be created in the marketplace and enforced. If that
were to happen, consumers would flock to that model in large numbers. I
would like to see a model of tiered risk. I do not believe the idea
that we can guarantee every type of saving for ever up to a certain
limit—£85,000, or whatever it ends up being in the
future—is rational. I would like a real choice between
low interest rates and total security for my money, and medium or
higher risk. We should give the consumer the choice rather than have
the pretence that the state will always be able to provide a bail-out.
From the moment such a pretence is created—we have essentially
had it since the war in this country—there will by definition
always be banks that are too big to fail. The fundamental logic of that
cannot be
broken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:12:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000011">There
are many other bits and pieces that I would like to see. One of the
Treasury Ministers ought to be in Europe full time. Whether or not I
agree with what the coalition argues, one Minister ought to be
negotiating, pre-warning and advising on and helping to create what
comes out of Europe. I would like to have the bonus cap and the
Government disagree, but the point is that we have not been there at
the table, which is where we need to be. That is a fundamental
weakness, as it was under the last Government. It would be wise
politics to make that

has been mentioned, and another minor point that ought to be in the
Bill, on the micro level, concerns compliance officers in banks. They
are the office boys—there is no qualification for them and no
basis of standards. It would be pretty easy to sort that out and ensure
that there is a qualification to be a 
<?notus-xml column=70?>compliance officer. We should raise their grade and standard. We should
not make a fetish of degrees, but it ought to be a graduate-quality
job, which it has not been. That is a fundamental weakness in how banks
see themselves and
compliance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:13:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000013">A
major change that I would like to see concerns tax loopholes. There has
been a lot of talk about them, but when it comes to banking the biggest
loophole involves the UK Crown dependencies. We have a significant
degree of influence over them and they rely on us for their legal
system and their defence, but we allow them opaqueness in finance,
whether banking, commercial, personal or a combination. No wonder my
file is full of cases of money laundering and other criminal corruption
that have been found out, and those are only the ones that people have
been able to see. That opaqueness should go, and we have the power to
do it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:14:52"></hs_TimeCode>. Those are
the big issues that have not been addressed in the Bill. I implore my

and I have served as a councillor there for the past six
years. Bishopstoke was mentioned in the Domesday Book, and it was to
Bishopstoke junction that London and South Western Railway moved its
railway works and employees lock, stock and barrel in 1891. Indeed, it
was the company that proceeded to change the name of the
station and the surrounding area to Eastleigh. Bishopstoke has never

the years passed, Eastleigh developed as a bustling railway town with a
strong industrial identity and a skilled work force. Aside from the
railway, Eastleigh played a major role in the development of
Britain’s aero industry, and it was at Southampton airport,
formerly Eastleigh aerodrome, that the Spitfire was designed and built.
Of course, local people remember with much pride and some
sadness that its designer, Reginald Mitchell, foreseeing the awful
shadow of war, defied his doctors and literally worked himself to death
to ensure that the Spitfire would be ready in time to defend our
country against the evil of the
Nazis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000021">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:18:37"></hs_TimeCode>

Hamble and through the development of high-tech industries including
SPL Lasers and Lubetech in Hedge End and Prysmian in Eastleigh town,
which I believe our Prime Minister visited during the campaign. These
firms demonstrate that the key to a sustainable and balanced economy is
to embrace both the old and the new. Eastleigh is fortunate to
have a much lower rate of unemployment and youth unemployment than the
national average. Indeed, both have dropped

after business is struggling to obtain financial support from our banks
to enable it to grow and expand its work force. The Business Secretary
has worked tirelessly to improve that situation; I am confident he is
succeeding but the banks seem too slow to respond. The

me say why I think this Bill matters. By way of setting the scene, I
want to explain something from which I think the financial services
industry suffers. There has been a recent influx of Members to the
Chamber for this debate, although I fear that it is not entirely due to
the subject under discussion. Normally, the financial industry is quite
a niche subject, which is partly to do with the fact that people often
talk in code about financial services. There is a certain language that
people are supposed to use when talking about financial services, and I
suspect that those who work in the industry feel a bit as if they are
part of a special club. They use words that normal people cannot really
understand; they repeat their shibboleths and some of them live in
their gated community, quite apart from normal society.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:24:53"></hs_TimeCode>Well, hands up,
Mr Speaker, it takes one to know one; Parliament is just the same in so
many 
<?notus-xml column=73?>ways. If we make things sound complicated, people will think we are
really clever, but I think we should learn that democracy and financial
services are too important for that.</hs_Para>

the culture in financial services makes scrutiny much harder than it
ought to be. We now know that in the 2008 crash, the real risks taken
by the banks were hidden, and that happened because of the insider
culture. We are yet to hear from the Parliamentary Commission on
Banking Standards about the cultural aspects of the financial services
crash, so I repeat to Ministers earlier pleas about the timing of that
advice. As I have explained, cultural aspects are important for
effective scrutiny and good legislation in the future, so can we not
ensure that we proceed with the best possible advice from the
parliamentary commission?

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:26:12"></hs_TimeCode>House would
probably all agree that we have been sent here to speak up for ordinary
people, but what happens in the City’s square mile matters on
every high street in Britain. It is not good enough anymore for
financial services to be a niche interest in Parliament.</hs_Para>

Chancellor’s words over recent months, it has sometimes felt a

defending the interests of London as a financial centre—for
example on leverage ratios—but how much do financial

turn to my second point, which is more specific to the Bill, we need to
ask ourselves what kind of economy we want. My constituents,

enough money in their pockets to feed their family and have a roof over
their heads. They want a Government who do not tell them that they will
cut debt to solve the problem, only to see debt rising. Notwithstanding
that, the Bill ought to help finance to underpin a growing economy.
Will the ring-fence help us do that? That is determined by what we
think banks are for. We should say that banks are not just like any
other industry: cavalier risks are totally unacceptable, and that is
why the ring-fence matters. We need to assure ourselves that we have
done enough to provide for business continuity in a real, productive
economy.</hs_Para>

afraid that that sounds a little too much like special pleading. Saying
that this will hurt lending to the real economy because it passes costs
on just sounds like tit-for-tat: “Block our preferred business
model and we will punish small and medium-sized enterprises, small
business and the average small lender.” Why do they have to do
that? I am not sure that one necessarily leads to the other—it
is about their business model. How does the Bill help with protection
from banking failure in other European countries?</hs_Para>

dwell on that for too long, but the Government must be clear and
Ministers must say exactly what kind of competition they want. Any

otherwise. How many new entrants to the market are sufficient? More
importantly, what kind of competition do we want?</hs_Para>

conclusion, this is a shell of a Bill and we can do much better. To
paraphrase John Donne, financial services is not an industry entire of
itself; it is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. We
therefore need a greater commitment from the industry that it is
prepared to change, and from the Government that they are prepared to
legislate to help it do so. The impact of the financial crash on people
in my constituency was huge, be that from the threat of losing their
house, or losing their job. That is too important for this subject
to remain a matter of technical, niche interest. The
Government must be much stronger and listen to the voices who are
calling for
change.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_11_PT_1/FA50C87CE17ACBED80D44FF30942F2C834CDB82C" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 March 2013">Monday

started by talking about the members of the Parliamentary Commission on
Banking Standards. As one of those

the heart of this debate lies the balance of interests within banks.
Any commercial organisation—or, indeed, any bank—must
balance the interests of its shareholders, the interests of its staff,
and, importantly, the interests of its customers and the wider society
at large. When those interests become unbalanced, we end up with
problems. When staff are over-incentivised with bonuses, they will take
greater risks at the expense of shareholders. When shareholders see
stellar returns, they will fail to provide the governance oversight
needed to protect the organisation.
When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:37:27"></hs_TimeCode> looking
after customers is seen as a tricky task in an ever-increasingly
competitive world, the customer takes second place to proprietary
trading, and is relegated to providing mere liquidity to help the
proprietary traders. When those balances of interests become too skewed
in favour of staff and shareholders, society loses out altogether, with
the banking collapses and the bail-outs we saw, and which we are trying
to avoid in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:37:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000052">One
of the concerns that I have been wrestling with is that of
over-regulating our banks. Can we, unwittingly, drive our banks to
relocate offshore by supposedly over-regulating them? We need to look
closely at the problem. What do we mean by relocating? In part, we are
looking at banks changing their domicile, and in part we are looking at
the moving of specific operations to different parts of the world.
Those are two very different things, and it is important to
make sure that we do not confuse them. Setting up a trading desk in
Spain, for example, is decided by where the traders want to work.
Moving a global bank to Singapore is a very different thing
indeed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:38:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000053">First,
these banks are huge. One has to asked oneself the question: who would
want to have one of them located in their economy? If HSBC went to
Singapore, its balance sheet would be over 1,000% of Singapore’s
GDP. Not many countries can take a bank of that size, and, of those
that could, do they have the same offering that we have here? There
would be no question whatever of any implicit guarantee. London offers
some key elements that banks need: we speak English, we are in the
centre of the global time zone, we have a transparent and well-tested
legal system, and, importantly, we have what amounts to a relatively
good regulatory system. All those points are absolutely
key<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:39:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000054">The
banks benefit from an implicit guarantee—valued at between
£10 billion and £40 billion, depending on where we are in

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:39:39"></hs_TimeCode>We need to get
rid of this implicit guarantee for exactly that reason and in order to

we combined a transparent legal system with a robust and secure

would trust the UK’s legal and regulatory system, it would be
prepared to take a slightly lower return. London would provide an
environment in which the cost of funding for banks would be lower.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:49:17"></hs_TimeCode> cheaper
funding, as a result of regulatory security, should replace the
banks’ implicit guarantee and thus result in a lower cost of
capital. As a result of that cheaper funding cost, which is reliant on
good regulation, we should not fear banks relocating when we introduce
regulatory reform. They might complain, but they will ultimately thank
us for the strongest regulatory regime in the world.</hs_Para>

also depends, however, on how the Government take forward the Bill. The
banking commission has made its early recommendations, and the
Government have responded. As we heard from
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:40:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie), we are grateful to
the Government for listening to some of our recommendations, but they
could pay more attention to certain other areas. We want a leverage
ratio set at 4% by the Financial Policy
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:41:24"></hs_TimeCode>, a
full reserve power for full industry-wide separation and regular
reviews of the effectiveness of the ring fence in order to ensure the
most effective and secure regulatory regime in the world.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:41:24"></hs_TimeCode>By winning the
race to the top, we will ensure cheaper capital funding for our banks

turn to the thorny issue of proprietary trading. The term
“casino banks” was coined by someone at a time when I
suspect they were keener to play to the gallery than necessarily to
address the serious issue of what investment banks actually do. It is
important to remember that investment banks raise huge amounts of debt
and equity capital, generating thousands, if not millions, of jobs in
the UK and around the world in commerce and industry—jobs that
create wealth and tax receipts for this country—but there is an
element within investment banks of proprietary trading. The important
thing is to define proprietary trading. Every bank that makes a loan
makes it on a proprietary basis, but no one would want to prevent banks
from doing that—it is the key to what they do. Pure proprietary
trading, however, for the sole purpose of enhancing shareholder
returns—with no benefit to the customer or society—has no
place in our banks. It fails the balance of interest test and is
incredibly difficult to
define<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:42:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000060">We
can recognise the evil type of proprietary trading when we see it, but
let us take market marking, for example. It provides a service to
customers and liquidity to the markets, and so passes the balance of
interest test, but at what point does a residual position on a trading
book stop being that which is left over from normal market making
activities and start being deliberate directional betting? That
inability easily to distinguish between one and the other leads me to
believe that, although a Volcker rule would probably be desirable, it
would be too difficult to impose in a meaningful way. That is why,
reluctantly, I come down on the side of not banning pure proprietary
trading. If the Vickers proposals that the Bill implements seek to put
a ring fence around the deer park, does it matter what type of predator
is kept outside? The consumer will be protected from both the wolves of
market makers and the tigers of proprietary
trading<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:43:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

commission’s work has looked at competition. With a handful of
super-huge banks dominating the market, competition is tricky. Long
before the commission was set up, however, I spent much time meeting
smaller banks, including challenger banks, and those seeking to win new
banking licences. It was clear that there was a huge problem with banks
being too small to start—the regulatory hurdles facing small
banks, such as licence applications and ongoing supervision, distorted
the market in favour of the big banks—but the FSA has responded
to pressure and had a change of heart. The regulator is moving in the
right direction, and I am grateful to the FSA for taking heed of our
warnings about new banking application processes and the treatment of
asset risk weightings on the balance sheet. The regulator is moving
towards greater opportunity for small banks in terms of regulation,
which is very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:44:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0002.htm#13031148000062">There
is also the thorny issue of account switching. Later this year, the
seven-day switching programme, which is a significant step
forward, will be put in place. I strongly believe, however,
that the ultimate goal has to be full account number portability.
VocaLink, which provides the payment system services, is considering
doing for banks what the telecoms regulator did for mobile phones, and
it is making good progress.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:44:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom) has done a lot
of work on this subject, and for four reasons her proposals for full
portability are right: first, it will ensure greater competition, as I
am sure we will hear later; secondly, the financial system will be more
transparent and so provide greater oversight for the FPC, which is
charged with ensuring stability in the financial system; thirdly, in
the event of a collapsing bank, full portability will make bank
resolution far easier and cheaper; and finally, the legacy IT systems
in many banks have their foundations in the ’50s and
’60s, with the punch-card system. At some point, the banks will
have to massively update their systems, and combining everything makes
huge economic sense.</hs_Para>

is the point of banks? Why are we so keen to reform them? Those
questions are crucial to the whole debate. Clearly, people need a safe
place to deposit their money, to manage their finances and to plan for
the future, but banks also provide an incredibly important social and
economic function. There has yet to be devised a better way
of taking money from where it has accumulated and distributing it to
where it is needed. Successful investors and business men need a way to
get their money to where it will work for them, and those
with an idea but no cash need to be introduced to investors with
surplus funds. So far, banks have done that job better than anyone
else. No matter what we say, they have a fantastic distribution
network, which we must utilise to the fullest

Garnier:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely
right. The two of us have spent much time together wrestling with this
thorny issue over the past nine months—and 
<?notus-xml column=79?>before that on the Treasury Committee. Part of the problem is that, with
the risk weighting of assets, a loan to a small business carries the
least weighting, because it is deemed to be one of the greatest risks.
The world is putting pressure on banks to reduce their balance sheets
and become less risky institutions, and the simplest way to do that is
to withdraw lending to small and medium-sized enterprises. That is the
natural outcome, if we ask them quickly to reduce their balance sheets.
Funding-for-lending schemes seek to bypass the risk-weighting element,
but none the less it is incredibly difficult to encourage more of what
the regulatory regime sees as the riskiest type of lending. It is a
problem we have to resolve, however, because, as I said, there is no
alternative way of getting money to businesses.</hs_Para>

is incredibly important that the Government never again have to bail
out banks when things go wrong. Broadly speaking, the Bill is an
enabling Bill. There is much more detail about the nuts and bolts to be
introduced in secondary legislation, but it is important that it
achieves what it is trying to achieve, which is to ensure that banks
can go bust without bringing the system down with them. For a
functioning financial market to work properly, it is important that
poorly run banks be allowed to fail—but elegantly and
non-destructively.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:48:43"></hs_TimeCode>The Bill will
ensure that, in a crisis, the vital parts of a bank can be resolved in
a dignified and stable way and that the British taxpayer will never
again be left on the hook to bail out bankers for their foolhardy
recklessness. That is why the Government are right to introduce it.
They were right not to rush into anything, but to have spent a great
deal of time listening to Vickers, Erkki Liikanen in Europe and others,
including of course the banking commission. For those reasons, I have
no hesitation in supporting the Government fully and look forward to
working with them as part of my work on the banking

of the day, to which I fully signed up in the first half of the last

regulation. What a difference half a decade makes! It was also during
that period that the present Chancellor fatefully nailed his colours to
the mast. Despite clear evidence that we were collectively living well
beyond our means during the previous Administration, and amidst growing
public and private debt, he decided to stick to the outgoing Labour
Government’s spending plans and characterise our fiscal
aspiration as “sharing the proceeds of growth.” I regret
the fact that as a result, when the 
<?notus-xml column=83?>crisis hit home, my party was unable to make the orthodox Conservative
case that the seeds of that financial destruction had been profligacy
and the leverage that was referred to earlier. Instead, the established
view was, and continues to be, that regulatory failings—of which

were the primary, if not the sole, cause of the financial
calamity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T19:05:33"></hs_TimeCode>. Hence

operations require protection from the so-called casino excesses of
investment banking. The aim to reduce the burden on the British

at EU level, the Liikanen report has recommended to the European

all that uncertainty will be borne by the consumer and the wider

understandable public misconception, also heard here tonight, that it
has been “business as usual” in the City since 2008. It
would be fair to say that particularly over the past two years, volumes
of business have collapsed, state financial support has been largely
withdrawn and there has been and will continue to be a huge jobs cull.
If we couple that with falling salaries and bonuses for the vast

from the issue of commercial uncertainty, there are, I believe,
question marks over whether the ring fence will actually work. The

division between what amounts to wholesale and retail banking. There

hard-and-fast split between high street and casino investment banking
very difficult to achieve.</hs_Para>

the City of London has repeatedly benefited from arbitrage with Wall

and the effects of Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002 in the aftermath of the Enron

is, in my view, a danger that the UK and EU regulators will somehow
look at the Bill’s ring-fencing as a panacea, and will sell it
as such to the general public. Instead, in light of the pitfalls of the
ring-fence options, it might prove more effective to look at an
alternative dual system when it comes to ordinary deposit accounts.
This would allow those who desire a risk-free place to store their
money to place it in savings banks, while those happier to take a

whole landscape of international financial services for the future. It

regulation is often the sworn enemy of competition—one of the
other avowed goals in the Bill. Public confidence and ethical
foundations will slowly and surely be restored in financial services
only when the landscape becomes 
<?notus-xml column=86?>far more competitive. That means, in my view—whether we like it

greater level of responsibility. No amount of banking reform or new

capital to build the successful businesses of the future, let alone

Michael Meacher</B> (Oldham West and Royton) (Lab):</Member> We have
had an interesting and thoughtful debate, which has concentrated on
detail, but I think it is worth putting it into context. Despite the
banks triggering, as we all know, the biggest economic crisis since the
1930s, with the Government having to provide nearly £1 trillion
in loans, guarantees and asset protection schemes to ailing banks, it
has taken five years to reach this point of proposing reform—and
even then, by any standards, this Bill is woefully short of what is
urgently needed to prevent a recurrence of financial collapse and to
produce a safe and desirable finance
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T19:17:01"></hs_TimeCode>. I have a
lot of sympathy with
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T19:17:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) when he said, “Is this

the Bill’s central mechanism—ring-fencing between the
investment and retail arms of the banks—is all too likely to be
subverted by the Machiavellian skills of the City in regulatory
arbitrage. The Minister mentioned that, but rather slithered over it, I
thought, by saying that he had confidence that it would work. The only
evidence he quoted in favour of that was the opinion of Sir John
Vickers. Since it was his proposal, it is not surprising that he
believes it will work. Historically, however, all the evidence is that
Chinese walls will be circumvented.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031148000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031148000107"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T19:17:53"></hs_TimeCode>Let
me deal with the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. One has
to ask, as has been asked a number of times already in this debate, why
after five years of delay this Bill is being rushed through just a few
months before the Government’s own appointed commission actually
reports? The Tyrie banking commission has made it very clear that it
strongly advocates electrification of the ring fence. The Chancellor
initially rejected that until the commission’s chair, the highly
respected hon. Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie), and Lord Lawson
threatened to table amendments to force the Chancellor’s hand to
ensure that the full sanction of separation remained in the Bill.
Finding his hand forced, the Chancellor then made the absolute minimum
concession he could get away with, namely giving regulators the power
to dismantle an individual bank that tried to undermine the ring fence,
but not a more general power to apply full separation across the
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T19:19:10"></hs_TimeCode>. Even
after that, dubiety remains because the Bill does not say what
precisely is to be ring-fenced. Savings, for example, can certainly be
placed in a variety of exotic securities.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031148000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031148000108">The
Government have also succumbed to the banking lobby in permitting banks
to locate simple derivative products within their retail operations. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) pointed
out, that can be, and indeed already has been, uncomfortably extended.
The Government’s retreat can only have the effect of opening the
door to other forms of speculative activity to nest inside retail
banking.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=87?><hs_Para UID="13031148000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031148000109">There are
other uncertainties. Let me give just one example. Let us suppose that
funds are transferred from a ring-fenced to a non-ring-fenced entity
via a foreign subsidiary or affiliate in a place where there is no such
separation. Is that a breach of the ring fence? How does anyone
actually know? I presume that we will not rely on the good intentions
of bankers.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031148000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031148000110">The real
problem with the Bill, however, is that it does not deal with the
fundamental causes underlying the reckless and destructive banking that
has done so much damage. It is preoccupied with investment banking, and
it offers no relief from those suffering from the abuses in retail
banking. As many people have mentioned, payment protection insurance,
money-laundering, the fixing of endowment mortgages and interest rates,
and pension mis-selling are just some of the rackets that have been run
by retail banking. Nothing in the Bill offers any
reform.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031148000111">Many
of those abuses, on not only the investment but the retail side, are
fuelled by the incessant stock market demands for higher short-term
returns, as well as the profit-related pay of executives and traders.
Even when the European Union tried to limit the latter by means of
bonus caps, the Chancellor went out of his way to stop it without
managing to secure a single ally in any of the other 26 member states.
I can only say that the banks certainly do not provide half the annual
donations to the Tory party without expecting a very big
return.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031148000112">However,
even more important than the ring fence and the ambiguities relating to
the status of so-called simple derivatives, which are anything but
simple—for example, there is the obvious question of whether
currency hedges can be sold to small businesses from within the
ring-fenced operations—is the leverage ratio. As has been
mentioned, the Vickers recommendation was for capital of 4% with a
lending ratio of 25:1. The Chancellor, in yet another very big
concession to the banks, dropped that to 3%, opening up a 33:1 ratio.
In its interim report published today, the Tyrie
commission—rightly, in my view—rejected that as
being wrong-headed and unnecessarily risky, precisely because of the
excessive size of the finance sector in our economy, relative to the
size of those in other economies and, indeed, absolutely. I think that
that unwise concession ought to be overturned in both
Houses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031148000113">This
is not, I think, a great Clark-Javid Bill. It is a mini-Bill which,
unforgivably in my view, entirely ignores the wider banking framework.
The big four—and this, surely, is the background to the
Bill—have let Britain down badly. We need to transform the whole
banking culture, and end its present obsession with property, overseas
speculation, offshoring and tax avoidance. By being too big to fail,
the big four exacerbate moral hazard; because of their size and weight
they choke competition and new entrants to the market; and they have
manifestly failed to keep adequate funding flowing to business. They
should be broken up, initially by a clean break between the investment
and retail sides—on the basis of all the historical evidence, I
think that a ring fence is highly unlikely to work—and beyond
that by a wider restructuring.</hs_Para>

science and 
<?notus-xml column=88?>technology, small and medium-sized enterprises and a low-carbon
economy—to mention only some—together with a regional
spread of banks along the lines of the German Mittelstand. The other
essential requirement is the regaining of public supervision of the
money supply. As the Minister mentioned in his opening speech, the
total gross lending of the banking sector has been about £7
trillion a year, five times as much as GDP. What the Minister did not
say, however, is that only about 8% of that has gone towards productive
investment. The banks have used their virtual monopoly over domestic
credit creation—amounting to some 97%—largely to fuel
successive property booms and speculative foreign ventures. That is a
basic reason for the fact that the country now has a fast-rising and
unsustainable deficit in traded goods, which last year
amounted to more than £100 billion —7% of
GDP.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031148000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031148000115"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T18:27:34"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Steve Baker" PimsId="5570" UID="13031148000152" xid="1151" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031148000152">Steve

referring to literature from the 1930s, but today it is my pleasure to
talk about the Channel 4 documentary “Bank of Dave”. Of
course, Mr Fishwick has not been allowed to start a bank; he has had to
start a savings and loans company. The documentary reveals just how
difficult it is today to start a tiny little bank. But what does he do?
He knows his depositors—his savers—and his borrowers; he
goes out and personally shakes hands; and he understands the businesses
into which he is lending. In the documentary, we can see what tiny sums
are necessary to allow a small business to grow—just a few
thousand pounds to buy a new oven. Yet he puts his own personal assets
at risk to guarantee what he does. He knows his depositors and he wants
to make sure they get their money back, so all the savings he accepts
are underwritten out of his personal wealth. If you read his book, Mr

has overwhelming public support and that demonstrably can be seen to be
serving those in his local community, be they savers or borrowers,
those working in business or the elderly who cannot afford to lose
their money. In addition, all this service to the community is
personally underwritten by him. I have introduced a number of Bills in
this House, one of which was the Financial Institutions (Reform) Bill.
It would have made bank directors liable without limit for their
commercial losses and put bank bonuses into a pool to be treated as
capital for five years. That would realign incentives so that those
operating banks would take sensible decisions, cease to be reckless,
lend well and think about what they were doing for their customers. We
are in the absurd situation where a simple, unsophisticated man running
a corner shop in my constituency was subjected to a bank calling
him—a bank that had specifically procured an Urdu speaker in
order to obtain his trust—to sell him a sophisticated interest
rate swap that he did not need. This is a bank that has been bailed out
at taxpayer expense but is now paying bonuses. So we have that
injustice, yet a man such as David Fishwick, who is doing the right
thing and underwriting the commercial risk at his own expense,
is not allowed to call himself a bank—it is
disgraceful.</hs_Para>

feasible. The first is his personal guarantee. The second is his
personal relationship with his customers. The third is that if he were

were also capped at a certain level of lending, it would be possible
for that bank to exist as a bank with very little regulation. That

is, to divorce the process of creating and destroying money from the
business of banking. A purely incidental result would be to make
banking safer and more profitable; but by far the most important result
would be the prevention of great booms and depressions by ending the
chronic inflations and deflations which have ever been the curse of
mankind and which have sprung largely from
banking.”<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T19:39:24"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13031155000013" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000013">So

this point, I will have upset my friend Professor Kevin Dowd, who was a
tutor to Andy Haldane at the Bank of England. I have had the privilege
of meeting both of them to discuss these matters. Kevin is a free
banker—he would believe in fractional reserves on demand
deposits, without a shadow—but in his banking system there would
be no limited liability and no taxpayer-funded deposit insurance, banks
would issue their own notes and money, at bottom, would be gold. That
commodity backing would limit the banks’ ability to create
deposits.</hs_Para>

a problem in <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T19:37:45"></hs_TimeCode>our
banking system with accounting, which is another area where I have
introduced a Bill. Since I did so, significant progress has, thank
goodness, been made on one aspect—loan loss provisioning, which
Members can refer to in the media. However, there is another problem
with international financial reporting standards accounting for banks,
which is mark-to-market accounting. We have heard today the story of
how banks have securitised lending and sold it. In a chronically
inflationary banking system where banks lent money into existence and,
as we heard from another hon. Member, were encouraged to make bad
loans—they were creating money to make bad loans into
property—they of course wanted to get this off their books. So
they wrapped it up in a bond, insured it with a derivative and sold it.
They did not even have to sell it. They just took this instrument,
moved it from one accounting book to another and they could then
immediately mark its value to market. What does that mean in plain
terms? It means that one can take 30 years of cash flows,
unrealised, from mortgages not yet paid, and by marking them to market
within a bond, around a vehicle that is all these mortgages
securitised, one can take bad loans—loans that probably will not
be repaid—and take it all as profit in capital today. You can
pay yourself a massive bonus out of cash not realised—out of
capital.</hs_Para>

case for the question of the status of demand deposits, gold as the
ultimate backing to money and so on—we will find in the end that
the Bill is an honourable and brave attempt to prop up a contemporary
monetary orthodoxy that is failing. This is the end of the post-Bretton
Woods monetary order through which we have been living. We were told
that it was a banking crisis. We learned a little later that it was a
debt crisis. In a minute, people will realise that what we use as money
is debt, that what the banks deal in is debt and that the vast majority
of the money in our accounts was created by somebody else taking a
loan. When that is accepted, we will discover that this is a monetary
crisis. We will then find that there are two plausible ways to reform

Huerta de Soto as a route to what we really should do, which is get the
state out of money and banking. We should have a free banking system,
as proposed by my friend Professor Kevin Dowd. He has brought forward a
plan called “two days, two weeks, two months”, which

our language and our legal system, but also because of the financial

this debate were taking place in 2007, we would probably be saying that
everything in the garden is rosy and we would believe that nothing
needs to change, but we know how different the situation has become.
Banks became arrogant and thought they were invincible, Government
became complacent—“No more boom and
bust”—and where were regulators? It was a lethal
combination and we all know what happened. In 2008 there was a failure
of policy and regulation on a huge scale. Since 2008 we have been
dealing with the fall-out of the previous Government’s failures.
Arguably it is this problem, the banking problem, that is still holding
back recovery. Since the bail-out there has been much discussion of
what direction Government and our country should take in managing and
regulating our banks and the banking
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000038">We
have various choices. We could do nothing and allow banks gradually to
recover, carry on as they did before and hope that the banking crisis
never happens 
<?notus-xml column=95?>again. Alternatively, we could split the banks completely—split
retail from investment—and create a clear, absolute divide. We
could help change the sector completely by creating smaller banks and
more of them, in effect creating a banking sector where banks are small
enough to fail. Finally, we could pursue the middle way, which is in
effect what the Government propose. All these options could be equally
correct. They may be different solutions to the same issue, but who
knows if one of them might be more successful than the others? However,
there appears to be broad consensus that there should be some form of
divide within banking services. I therefore support the
Government’s proposals as they have a certain degree of
flexibility within them, allowing for changing
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000039">We
all acknowledge that the financial sector is critical to the success of
businesses up and down the country. Central to that is the success of
the banks themselves. The goal for Government must be to ensure that
the country has financial stability at the heart of the banking sector.
Clearly, stability must be the priority. We do not want our recent
experience to be repeated, but we should not lose sight of
other considerations for Government: lending to businesses and
consumers, which is vital to growing our economy; choice through
competition; awareness of the risks to the health of the
nation’s finances; and the need to ensure stability and strength
in the wider economy. I appreciate that some of these issues are not
relevant to the Bill and do not require legislation. Nevertheless, it
is important that the Government do not lose sight of the other aspects
that support a strong and vibrant
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000040">The
Government clearly take the issue of banking stability very seriously,
and so they should. We have had the Vickers report, the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards and the Government’s response to
them. We now have the Bill before us. The issue for the House is
whether it will achieve the Government’s aims and objectives,
and whether those are the right solutions. In general, I support the
direction of travel and the thrust of the Government’s aims. The
concern, as ever, is the detail. The Bill is a skeleton. Much flesh
still needs to be put on the bones. There is clear provision in the
Bill for further orders and regulations, which the Minister touched on
in his speech. I acknowledge that he will be making further amendments
to the Bill and that he has indicated that he will be open-minded about
amendments. That is to be welcomed, but to understand the Bill fully we
need to see those orders and regulations to judge whether the effect is
likely to be successful. I assume that that will be done in Committee.

appreciate that those on the Treasury Committee and on the commission
have a much better understanding of the issues, but I would like to
touch on three aspects of the Bill. First, a number of questions arise
from the provisions relating to a ring-fenced body. Which banks will be
affected? What will be the de minimis level? If there are going to be
only a few such banks, can we name them? As for the reserve power to
split up a group structure, the proposal is not for a general
industry-wide reserve power, but for a specific power. Is this
potentially a nonsense if there are only a few ring-fenced banks? The
same thing could be achieved by applying the 
<?notus-xml column=96?>specific reserve power to each of them. In some ways
we want our banks to be small enough to fail and we want plenty of them
so that they do not need to be
ring-fenced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T19:54:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000042">What
of the ring-fenced institutions themselves? They may be separate legal
entities, but how independent will they be? What of the boards? Who
will the directors be? Will they be entitled to be on the board of the
subsidiary as well as of the parent company? How independent will they
be? What of the employees? Who are they responsible to? Who will key
and talented employees look to as their bosses? Will it be the parent
company or the ring-fenced company that they are actually working for?
They will obviously be considering their careers, and that could have
an impact on their judgment.</hs_Para>

about the systems of the ring-fenced institutions—the computers,
the customer information? How separate will these be from the parent
company’s or those of the other institutions within the
group? What about management? Will it be totally separate? It could be
argued that even the buildings would have to be separated. Who has
access to information and decision making? Human resources, systems and
management issues need to be addressed to ensure that the whole
structure of the proposals will
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T19:55:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000044">With
reference to core services, the proposed primary legislation deals only
with deposits. Is that it? What other services may be included or
specifically excluded? I appreciate the need for flexibility, but we
still need to have a clearer idea of the proposals or at least of the
Government’s thinking. On the core activity, the acceptance of
deposits, what about small and medium-sized enterprises and high net
worth clients? What is the definition of an SME or of a high net worth
client? That could mean different things to different banks and to
different people. There are still many issues that need to be addressed
so that we have a better understanding of what we are being asked to
support and to ensure that we pass legislation that will

Within that we want a robust and competitive banking industry, which is

Although I support the Government’s intentions in the Bill, I
encourage the Government always to remember that a competitive market
with low barriers to entry and sensible regulation robustly applied
should always be at the centre of a successful banking and financial
sector. That should be our goal and it should certainly be the goal of

have to say, with regret more than anything else, that the Bill is
desperately weak and disappointing and it will need substantial
amendment in Committee if it is to provide the radical surgery that the
banking and economic system needs. The truth is that our banking system
is badly broken. It is failing to supply or boost demand for lending to
businesses in key parts of the

Bain:</Member></B> I know that the Prime Minister has been very much a
fan of a magic money tree. The Chancellor, by refusing to change course
on fiscal policy and putting everything on to monetary policy, shows
that the policy of the Government is to treat the Bank of England
almost as if it were a magic money tree, so I am not sure of the point
that the hon. Gentleman is

is very little in the Bill on competition. There is nothing that would
impose a fiduciary duty on the banks in relation to their
clients’ money in the same way that company directors have in
relation to company funds or lawyers in relation to clients’
funds, so there are huge deficiencies. There is also the great
suspicion that the Bill waters down some of the key recommendations of
the Vickers report. The maximum leverage that the Chancellor is
prepared to accept is way beyond the Vickers recommendation. The
Chancellor appears to be prepared to allow a leverage of 33 times,
whereas Vickers’ recommendation was for only 25 times. That is
because instead of adopting the Vickers report on the level of equity
capital at 4% of assets, the Chancellor is going for the Basel III
recommendations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:00:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000053">As
I said, the IPPR, in a report published in December, examined the
culture of greed and how the remuneration system got out of control in
the banking system. For example, the top 0.5%, or even the top 0.1%,
enormously enriched themselves because of the practices in the
industry. That is one reason why it is regrettable that the
Bill does not contain provisions for a banking code of conduct or to
put ordinary employees of the banks on remuneration committees to
ensure that there are annual binding shareholder votes on executive
pay. Neither does it propose properly to enforce the legislation passed
by the last Government to reveal how many people in the banking system
earn more than £1 million a year. There are great areas where
the Bill is enormously

terms of the overall reforms, we have three major issues of contention
with the Bill as framed. First, too much of the detail of the
Government’s policy is to be dealt with by delegated or
secondary legislation and is not present in the Bill. Secondly, the
Government are prepared to allow too much flexibility within the ring
fence, and do not give consumers and taxpayers the assurances they
deserve that the principle of too big to fail will not still exist
within a regulatory system. Thirdly, 
<?notus-xml column=98?>the culture of the banking system is not changed enough by the Bill.
There are insufficient steps to ensure the proper degree of lending to
households and SMEs that is required.</hs_Para>

take that final point first, the figures we have seen on the national
loan guarantee system, Project Merlin and funding for lending have one
thing in common: the Government are not matching up to their promise
and the banking system is inadequate to meet the needs of households
and businesses. After a net growth in lending of just £0.9
billion in the third quarter of last year, net lending through funding
for lending participating banks contracted by £2.4 billion in
the fourth quarter of last year. Whereas Lloyds was drawing £3
billion through funding for lending, lending by Lloyds shrank by the
same amount in the final quarter of the year. Whereas RBS has drawn
£750 million, it decreased its lending by £1.7 billion in
the same quarter. It is clear that funding for lending, as it has been
conceived and is operating, is simply not providing the lending to
small and medium-sized businesses. There is a missed opportunity in the
Bill to change course and ensure that the system provides the support
to businesses that is necessary if we are to have the growth that is
the only means of cutting the
deficit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:03:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000056">We
also see from the bank data published last week insufficient detail on
the breakdown of lending to households and businesses. However, we know
that business investment fell by 1.2% in the last quarter of 2012, and
it is clear that confidence in the economy is stubbornly low. There are
still high levels of corporate surpluses, but the banking system is
failing to deliver money to those businesses to start increasing
orders, to deal with our low productivity and to restore confidence
where it is most needed

is also clear that there are unfortunately no provisions to establish
immediately a British investment bank that would break the logjam of
getting money out of corporate surpluses and flowing into the real
economy and promoting orders and demand. Why have the Government
persisted with this argument, even in the light of the proposal in the
second report from the parliamentary commission for a secondary reserve
power to ensure that where there are examples, or even the possibility,
of the primary reserve power being circumvented by the banks, there is
a reserve back-up power to break up the entire system if that is
necessary in the national interests and to prevent financial
collapse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:05:30"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

primary but the secondary reserve power was necessary in order to
ensure that that did not occur and that we had proper enforcement of
the ring fence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:05:53"></hs_TimeCode>.
The Bill also introduces a requirement for directors of ring-fenced
entities to be approved by the regulator, with such persons being
subject to disciplinary action by the regulator if they have been
involved in any contravention of the ring-fencing rules. It is clear
that those powers should also be
increased<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:06:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000059">The
problem with the Bill is that the devil is in the detail, but a huge
amount of the detail is not apparent. One reason why the Chancellor
said that he could not accept the secondary reserve power is that he
claimed it would be anti-democratic. He said that it would not be
present on the face of the Bill and it would not be fair to introduce
that by delegated legislation. The question remains for the Minister:
if that is the objection, why 
<?notus-xml column=99?>not put more of the detail into the Bill? Why not
ensure that we can then have that secondary reserve power, which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:06:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Chichester (Mr Tyrie) and the other members of the parliamentary

other shortcoming of the Bill is the inconsistent treatment of
derivatives. Those were described by the US investment guru, if we can
call him that, Warren Buffett as financial weapons of mass destruction,
but sadly the Government have yielded to some of the more regressive
parts of the financial lobby and will permit banks to locate simple
derivative products—whatever simple means—within their
retail banking operations. They should look at that
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:08:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000061">The
Bill is weak and does not learn the real lessons from the financial
crisis. It does not learn the lesson that we have a very small number
of very large banks, whereas other countries, such as Germany, France,
Canada and United States, have a more diverse range of successful
financial institutions, including co-operatives, credit unions and
Government savings banks. There is little in the Bill that would help
to expand the thriving credit union movement. I recently visited credit
unions in my constituency and others in Glasgow city centre that are
providing mortgages and expanding the range of financial services in a
responsible way given the scale of financial exclusion that many of our
constituents face. Having different types of banks in an economy
introduces different incentives and gives the public real choice. The
point is not to have more banks competing on the same business model of
short-term speculative profit, but to have competition across different
business models with diversity of form and diversity of
function.</hs_Para>

Thurso</B> (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) (LD):</Member> I
begin by apologising to the Chair and to Members on the Front Bench;
due to the vagaries of snow at Aberdeen and the fact that the plane I
was on was not de-iced on time, I missed my connection and therefore
arrived to hear only the latter part of the Minister’s speech.
However, judging by the tone of the debate, I think that I have a
fairly good idea of what he must have
said.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000064"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:10:15"></hs_TimeCode>The
second point I would like to make at the outset relates to the staff of
the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. My hon. Friend the
Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier) made the good point that the
Chair of the commission,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:10:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie), has done a sterling job, but we
have also been extraordinary lucky in having staff of such high
quality. The preface to our report lists the staff and shows the amount
of resource that has been available to us. The staff who have been
available to the Commission are of an extraordinarily high
quality. 
<?notus-xml column=100?>We have therefore been able to produce work of an extraordinarily high
quality. I say that at the beginning because, whatever my poor remarks,
I very much hope that those on the Front Benches will take note of the
work that has been done to
date.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000065"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:11:13"></hs_TimeCode>I
think that the next banking crash will happen some time between 2078
and 2088, with a couple of small wobbles between now and then. If one
looks back to the dawn of banking, when an Italian moneylender first
sought to made a buck or two, one sees that crashes have happened ever
since. One of the best pieces of work I have read recently was a
commission staff note setting out exactly how often crashes have taken
place and the fact that they are pretty much identical. They all start
with over-exuberance and an asset bubble, which is followed by a
collapse, and on each occasion, going back several centuries, the Bank
of England has intervened and the country has had to rescue the
financial
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000066"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:12:09"></hs_TimeCode>The
Bill sets out not to prevent those sorts of crashes from happening in
future, but to try to make them survivable, in particular by making
banks resolvable. If we are to have risk and reward, there will be
problems in future. The Bill, and the recommendations of the
parliamentary commission in relation to it, set out to try to make
those situations less systemic and less of a risk to the country and
the taxpayer. At this stage, the Bill is necessarily rather more about
structure than it is about some of the other points that have been
raised. I welcome the Bill and want to comment on one or two of the
things that are not in it and to urge the Government to listen to the
points that the parliamentary commission has set out in our report.
When I have done that, time permitting, I would like to look at some of
the wider points.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031155000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000067"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:13:14"></hs_TimeCode>On
the question of process, it is a matter of regret that the Bill is
unlikely to have sufficient time in Committee to allow the House to
consider all the issues. Once again, the unreformed other place will
have the duty of sorting that out. I am particularly concerned about
the fact that, should the important areas of standards, culture,
competition and remuneration require any action in
legislation—we have yet to deliberate on whether they
might—the Bill will almost certainly have passed through this
House by the time the parliamentary commission completes its final
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000068">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:14:05"></hs_TimeCode>
me turn to the points that I wish to make. First, on the question of
leverage, the key is risk-weighting assets. Much of the academic work
has shown that, broadly, the banks that had better leverage ratios were
the ones that survived. It is a very simple fact. The risk weighting of
assets does not actually assist terribly much in that process. Andy
Haldane made that point remarkably forcefully in evidence to both the
Treasury Committee and the parliamentary commission. Therefore, the
simple test of the leverage ratio is extremely important. Vickers came
up with 4% and the Government have gone for 3%. I am convinced that 3%
is not enough, but perhaps 4% is too much. Certainly, as the report we
have published makes clear, we should be looking at that. There is a
problem for Nationwide and for building societies, but we really cannot
let that tail wag the dog when it comes to sorting out the
banks’ part of
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000069"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:15:25"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly,
there is the question of industry-wide separation, which a number of
Members have referred to. I want to be clear about what we are setting
out to do 
<?notus-xml column=101?>and what we have recommended. The electrification of the ring fence is
by means of allowing the regulator a power to separate an institution.
The institution is observed by the regulator to be burrowing,
tunnelling, climbing over, powering through—however it is done
and whether it is a tiger, fox, wolf or whatever—and the
regulator then makes a decision for that one institution, saying,
“You’ve tried your luck too far. That’s it: your
institution is separate.”</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031155000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000070"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:16:11"></hs_TimeCode>The
wider power seeks to address the fact that we are not going to have
another crack at this for a good few years and that in all probability,
in five or six years’ time, things will be recovering and people
might say, “Well, the punch bowl is not there yet so we
don’t have to pull it away. Let’s all just leave it
be”. We are saying that the Bill should permit secondary
legislation if necessary. There should be a review—I cannot
remember whether we agreed that it should be every three years or every
five years—at which time the Financial Stability Committee could
recommend, were there an attempt to undermine the system, that the
Government bring in secondary legislation to effect a total separation.
That is an immense number of barriers between the placing of the
possibility in a Bill and the actuality of it happening. I really hope
that the Government will accept the argument that allowing for such a
power in the Bill would stand as a potential encouragement to the
banking system not to seek to undermine the ring fence.</hs_Para>

started to study this in the last Parliament, when I served on the
Treasury Committee with the now Lord McFall, I have been a
Glass–Steagaller. I am in favour of full separation. However, I
accept the Vickers compromise, because it is where we have got to. I
accept it on the assurance that the ring fence is properly electrified
and that there is the fall-back power.</hs_Para>

third point relates to the sibling or parent governance structure. The
parliamentary commission’s members broke up into panels, and we
have now all reported back. I had the honour of chairing a panel on
corporate governance. The evidence I saw was not reassuring. If there
is a parental relationship, the temptation of the CEO to tell the
ring-fenced bank what it should do will, over time, become
overwhelming. Therefore, an equal governance structure, which gives
proper independence required within the corporate governance of the
ring fence, is absolutely essential.</hs_Para>

last point relates to derivatives. When someone defines a simple
derivative, will they let me know what it is? I know what a simple
product is. When I want to fix my risk by having a fixed-rate loan, I
know that there is a derivative product that I am sold. I understand
that and have no problem with that product. The problem is this: why on
earth does that have to be originated in a ring-fenced bank? Why on
earth can it not be sold on an agency basis? It will cost me a little
bit more, but I will probably get advice on which is the best one in
the marketplace. We have agreed with the Government that simple
derivatives should be permitted but, as our report shows, it was pretty
well surrounded by caveats.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031155000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000074">My final
point is that we need to answer the question what are banks for,
because it is at the heart of the whole issue of separation. Over the
past half century or so we have pushed together various businesses,
some of which were never banking and never will be. The problem now is
that we talk about bankers as a collective when we are really talking
about bankers, financiers, traders, 
<?notus-xml column=102?>stockbrokers, and all sorts of other people. This makes it difficult
when we come to consider regulation of the profession. Pure banking, if
I can put it like that, is a profession, can be regulated as a
profession, and can have professional standards expected of it, but
many other areas should be regulated in different ways; traders should
be licensed, and so on. I am sure that we will come on to consider that
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:20:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000075">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:20:37"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Friend, if I may call him that, the Member for Wolverhampton
South East (Mr McFadden), chaired a panel on small and medium-sized
enterprises and I chaired one on Scotland. One of the things that came
out of that is that banks have completely failed industry, individuals
and commerce. My worry is that this process will be about the political
bubble talking to the financial bubble—the Westminster village
talking to the City village. At the end of all this, we need a
banking system that serves commerce and industry. If that means that we
have to start by getting more competition through breaking up RBS or
creating a “good bank, bad bank”, then so be it; there is
a lot that we need to look at. However, what we must do is ensure the
availability of reasonable credit to our constituents and provide a
system that is resolvable, so that at least for a couple of generations
we can go without a crash.</hs_Para>

stand outside that debate, because I do not think that regulation will
work. I was the first Member to raise the issue of Northern Rock in
this House. At that time, I completely underestimated what Northern
Rock was up to. I thought that it was all about an offshore tax scam
that was part of its link with the organisation that it called Granite;
I had no idea of the scale of the problem that would be unravelled. I
can remember the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, I think, leaving
the Chamber after I had talked about Northern Rock, to obtain a
briefing about what I was talking about. I realised that what I was
talking about was a crisis that 
<?notus-xml column=103?>was being created in the City by greed, primarily,
and by speculation and casino banking. I remember being at the Labour
party conference in the 1980s, around the time of big bang, and
organising the launch of a book called “Big bang: the launch of
a casino economy”, authored by the then Member for Hackney and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:23:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bolsover (Mr Skinner), which predicted some of the

bang.</hs_Para>

I raised Northern Rock, I completely underestimated the levels of
casino banking and the corruption that was taking place. In the
previous debate a few weeks ago, I described the City as a
“cesspool of corruption”, which it was. However, what was
also revealed was the absolute incompetence. It was like
“The Wizard of Oz”—when the curtain was pulled
back, there was not a wizard but someone scrambling with various
levers. We discovered then that the hierarchy of British banking did
not even understand the instruments with which they were working
because they were so complex. Then it all started to unravel, and we
discovered scales of greed, incompetence and corruption that none of us
expected.</hs_Para>

that time, we were assured that the regulatory system was not at fault,
but we soon discovered how inoperable it was. The result, as we all
know, is that the then Government intervened to borrow and used
taxpayers’ money to bail out the system. At its peak,
taxpayers’ exposure to the bank collapse was on the scale of
£1.2 trillion. I understand that so far we have
retrieved only £14 billion of that taxpayers’ money. The
second wave was the austerity programme introduced to pay for the
Government intervention to save the banking system. Mervyn King
estimated the cost of that to be £1 trillion. Anthony
Haldane, who is probably more accurate in his assessment, estimates
that we have lost the equivalent of between one and five years’
GDP. Those absolutely staggering sums are the result of a crisis
brought about by incompetence and greed. The majority of people are 7%
poorer than in 2007, and their living standards have fallen, according
to the latest estimate, by 13.2% since 2008. The median household
income in 2015-16 will be the equivalent of that in 2002-03. These are
the implications of what this wealth of greed brought about: mass
unemployment, welfare benefit cuts, food banks, and parents missing
meals so that children can eat. It is absolutely staggering.</hs_Para>

laundering. This is happening even when the bankers are in full public

Every time the state sets up these dreadful institutions, people are
able to profiteer. If we tell people that we are creating new money out
of nothing and giving it to them in exchange for Government bonds, of
course they will seek to make a profit. The thing to do is to make sure

it. The hon. Gentleman and I agree about the problem, but there is
another solution. As he has said, regulation does not work with these
institutions or the motivation to profiteer. I do not think that the
new regulatory system—whether it be subject to a ring fence, an
electrified ring fence or leverage ratios—will work. The reality
is that as long as the banks are in private hands and have profit as
their motive, they will aim to get around a regulatory system. The hon.
Gentleman has mentioned how they will dig under and go around the
fence. Like a chicken finding its way into the coop, they will always
find a way. The regulatory regime proposed by the Bill is complex and,
to be frank, virtually unenforceable. I think it will be almost
impossible to execute the attempt to impose a firewall, as the Good
Banking Forum concluded
recently.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000091">I

can safely deposit their money and savings and which lend responsibly
and provide credit to finance investment growth across the country.
That is not what this Bill will secure and it is certainly not what is
happening at the moment. The larger banks have an estimated £6
trillion at their disposal, but just £200 billion
—3% of the overall total—is used to fund investment in
this country’s industry. I do not think that a system of honest,
responsible banking or long-term investment is deep in the culture.
That may well have occurred at the 
<?notus-xml column=105?>earliest stages of capitalism but, many crises of capitalism later, we

believe that the only way to secure probity and to ensure that
people’s funds are safe and secure and that we can invest in our
economy in the long-term to create jobs is through a publicly owned and
democratically controlled banking system. Of course, we own banks at
the moment—we nationalised them. After Northern Rock, I remember
standing up in the House to urge the then Chancellor of the Exchequer,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:32:30"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling), to nationalise
the banks. The next day he said that he had nationalised three of them.
I told him that I had been right and he said, “Well, you were
bound to be right at least once in 30

We nationalised those banks, but we have no control over them. They are
not democratically accountable to Government, workers, investors or the
wider community. That is why they are not investing and why people
cannot secure
loans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000093">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:33:00"></hs_TimeCode>
should take full ownership of the larger banks. We already own Northern
Rock, RBS and Bradford &amp; Bingley and a large part of Lloyds. We
should take public ownership and control of the UK-based operations of
Santander, Barclays and HSBC, and we should create a unitary industry.
That would enable us to control investment, secure savings, stop the
paying out of large bonuses and ensure that any surpluses are returned
to the public by investing in the public good. That is secure and safe
banking, which is what I thought was the House’s
objective<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:33:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031155000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031155000094">What
would full nationalisation cost? An excellent piece of work for the
Fire Brigades Union by Michael Roberts and Mick Brooks, which was
published and launched in this House only a week ago, estimates that it
would cost £55 billion at current market rates. That is 3% of
GDP. We could ensure that there would be no need for any cash exchanges
and could simply swap shares for bonds, thereby saving the public purse
a large amount of money. The Co-operative bank and mutuals would
continue to operate as alternatives, as would credit unions, because we
have confidence in them as safe and secure banks. We could
also—we called on the previous Government to do
this—remutualise those banks that transformed themselves from
mutuals into limited companies.</hs_Para>

we could achieve the stated objectives of the Bill not through
regulation, but through public ownership and control. I do not believe
that regulation will work. The system has gone too far and the profit

greedy and arrogant. They have now reached the depths of humiliation in
the wake of the LIBOR manipulation, PPI mis-selling and bank swaps
mis-selling. Individual bankers are rightly being investigated by the

we must recognise the vital importance of the financial services sector

carry on doing the same deal on a Monday morning in Singapore. While
reforming the industry to make it safer for people in this country, we
must be careful to preserve it so that we can take advantage of the
enormous opportunities that it provides, such as the sale of mortgages
and health and life insurance policies in developing markets such as
China, Brazil and South Korea that do not have developed, simple, basic
banking packages. We can make profits for Britain at the same time as

It will help to bring back to UK banking what used to be called the
balance of fear and greed. For many years, there has been enormous
greed with no fear of consequences. We have allowed a small group of
vast institutions to grow by consolidations, mergers and takeovers. The

Bill will address Labour’s failed tripartite system of
regulation. It will put accountability for the supervision of the banks

1995 when Barings went bust, before Labour had had the chance to mess
up the regulatory system, I was a small cog in the wheel trying to
prevent a run on the banks. I remember supporting the then Governor,
Eddie George, to ring the various international banks to ensure that
there was not a run on the banks on Monday morning. Why did he do that 
<?notus-xml column=107?>over that fateful weekend? It was because he knew that the buck stopped
with him and that it was entirely down to him to ensure that there was
not a run on the banks. How different it was under Labour’s
tripartite system. When people were queuing down the streets to take
their money out of Northern Rock, the Treasury was looking at the Bank
of England, which was looking at the FSA, and nobody took any action.

“The Wealth of Nations”, a truly competitive environment

have experienced massive barriers to entry not just from competitor
banks but from the regulators. Likewise, failure has not been possible,

instantly between banks would remove the huge barrier to entry that
currently constrains new, innovative banks. Several benefits would
accrue from that policy. First, it would cut barriers to entry for new
challenger banks. Increased competition would force existing and new
banks to differentiate themselves to retain customers, leading to
enormous improvements in customer service and the differentiation of
bank offerings. Secondly, new challenger banks would mean more banks
and increased access to new and different sources of funding, and over
time that would reduce the risk of banks being “too big to
fail”.

industry experts argue that the impact of creating a new shared
payments clearing infrastructure would mean the banks sorting out the
problem of multiple legacy systems that dates back to the consolidation
of the 1990s. Clearing banks currently spend billions each year on
string and Sellotape solutions for creaking systems, and we have seen
twice recently the problems that RBS subsidiaries had in managing
payments for their customers because of poor systems and systems
failure. New systems could lead to a reduction of up to 40% in bank
fraud that costs the sector billions of pounds each year.</hs_Para>

multiple legacy systems within banks make it hard for them to evaluate
business ideas. The banks’ poor systems make it harder for them
to assess good business ideas versus good collateral, and better and
new systems would enable them to make better lending decisions to SMEs.
Finally, and importantly, account number portability would offer the
potential for the orderly resolution of a failed bank. The potential to
close down a bank and transfer its accounts overnight to a solvent bank
would be a valuable tool in any future financial crisis.</hs_Para>

kick-start a move to account number portability, the Government would
need to introduce a new payments regulator with the power and mandate

independent regulator of money transmissions would get the job done,
and using an existing regulator or the Office of Fair Trading is
unlikely to be effective. I therefore welcome the Minister’s
announcement of a consultation on establishing a new, independent
payments regulator.</hs_Para>

conclude by saying that seven-day switching, as proposed by John
Vickers, is not the same or even similar to full bank account number
portability. It is a costly, overly-manual way of way of improving the
customer experience, and does not solve the problem for small
businesses, many of which—some 80%—have felt unable to
change bank account provider in the past three years. Banks have SMEs
tied up and want them to have personal overdrafts and bank accounts,
business accounts and fully funded bank loans, whether or not they draw
them down. It is extremely complicated for an SME to move banks in the
current environment, and trying to change bank account number is part
of that problem, as well as the lack of other banks that are willing to
lend.</hs_Para>

first problem with seven-day switching is that it will not change the
future for SMEs. Secondly, it does not address the administrative
burden for SMEs. If we find that seven-day switching dramatically
increases the number of people who switch bank accounts, that will
simply increase the burden on all of our milkmen, dry cleaners, Tesco
or whoever it might be. We will all have to change our bank account
numbers with them, and they will have to change their systems. For big
businesses that might not be a problem, but it is certainly a problem
for small businesses. Which? has provided a wealth of evidence
showing that SMEs are concerned about the impact of seven-day account
switching on their administrative burden. I urge

lessons. Of course there was too much leverage in the system. No one
would think that the level of liquidity available to the banks at a

hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie) and his commission, we
should be clear on what the Bill is not doing. It will not stop retail
bank failures, such as Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley; it
will not stop investment bank failures, such as Lehman’s; and it
will not stop the regulatory failures of universal banks, as we have
seen with the anti-money laundering and sanctions abuses or the LIBOR
abuses by some of our largest banks. The Bill does not address the
shadow banking world—the £200 billion of risk that is
currently carried in private equity. Most of all, the danger of
today’s debate is that we do what is so often the case after a
regulatory crisis: we focus on solving the problem we have just had. We
are not talking about the impact on banks if we lose control of
interest rates, which we all hope will not be the case. The focus is on
the structural failures relating to liquidity and capital, and that has
been the tenet of the
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:53:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

that individuals in banks are motivated by big bonuses, which drive

hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) is back in his place,
because he missed addressing that point in his remarks—it is a
shame he would not take interventions from me. Under his Government,
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, probably the
most-debated Act for many years, created a rule book of more than 6,000
pages. He spoke about the need for more regulation and suggested that
Conservative Members had failed because of the lack of regulation, yet
we had 6,000 pages of it. The issue was that the regulation was not
enforced.</hs_Para>

is even worse than that, because the hon. Gentleman actually allowed a
regulatory regime that included things such as guaranteed bonuses. Not
only would somebody get a bonus if they performed well, but they got a
guaranteed bonus even when the bank collapsed. When the financial
crisis hit in 2008, contractually the banks were signed up to
guaranteed bonuses, so they were still doling out money under the
enhanced regulatory regime to which he referred—true socialism
in action.</hs_Para>

gets worse. There was a fines system that incentivised banks to profit
from the wrongdoing of other banks. When a bank was subject to a
regulatory fine, the money went not to the taxpayer in the form of
funding good works or to customers of the bank affected, but to
the other banks in the form of lower levies to the regulator. When a
bank committed a wrongdoing, therefore, other banks in the sector
profited. This is the regulatory regime on which we are now being
lectured<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T20:56:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031156000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031156000027">Let
me give another example on structure: the collapse of RBS. After 10
months of the brightest minds in our Treasury—I am sure they are
the brightest minds—looking at this issue, they still could not
rely on the books. So untrustworthy was RBS’s auditing that the
permanent secretary to the Treasury had to send for a letter of
direction from the Chancellor saying, “I can’t rely on
the books. It’s such a mess, Chancellor, you’ll have to

know where the risks are and how they are incentivised to speak up. On
Thursday we will have a debate on the NHS and the fear of
whistleblowers to speak out. Many of the issues in the NHS are similar
to what we have seen in our banks. Let me give the House an example
that makes the point highlighted by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:02:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend.
So far, the two biggest fines imposed on any individuals in banking
were imposed on two Northern Rock executives. On both occasions they
were less than those individuals’ bonuses the preceding year.
How are people incentivised to do the right thing in our financial
sector when they can see such short-term benefits from wrongdoing and
very little downside

Barclay:</Member></B> Yes, I can address that question head on. It is
logical to have introduced measures to try to manage risk in the
financial sector, but we are requiring banks to retain more and more
assets at the same time as asking them to lend more. We are therefore
asking them to do two conflicting things, as well as introducing a
structural fix that innovative people will often be able to find ways
around. For example, the shadow banking sector is not affected by this
kind of proposal. If we want to address innovation, to be flexible and
to move with the market, and retrospectively to impose fines for
wrongdoing, we would be far more successful if we changed the culture
than if we imposed rigid rules.</hs_Para>

that is an issue for another day. There are many areas in which the
banks’ behaviour is wrong, but we cannot change the culture
through rules alone. We had more than 6,000 pages of rules, but that
did not achieve the right culture. We can achieve it by having
individual accountability, and one of the best ways of doing that is
through personal fines.

into the system a position in which those at the top who are getting

talked about criminal sanctions, but the burden of proof is such that
it is often difficult for the prosecuting authorities to get sufficient
evidence to make it an effective tool. I am not against that, but it is
often not an effective tool in practice. We need to ask how we can get
to a situation where we do not catch those on £2,000 bonuses and
those who have done no wrong, and do not set in place a whole load of
rules that fetter innovation or deter business, but where we do create
a stick and a deterrent for those who have abused the system and know
they are still on the hook for significant financial loss. Those are

the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) gave a comprehensive
opening speech from the Opposition Front Bench. Other Members picked up
the point that he made that we cannot have any repetition of the
actions that led to the taxpayer bail-out. The actions and attitudes of
the bankers meant that the banking sector—or individuals in it,
as many hon. Members have said—thought that it was okay to
retain the profits privately when the sun shone, to use that metaphor,
but to let the losses fall to the public purse when the rainstorms
arrived. We simply cannot allow a repetition of such risks to taxpayers
in the future. That is why the banks must be reformed here in the UK,

number of important points were made at the outset of the debate about
the timing of the Committee stage. My hon. Friend the Member for
Nottingham East, and a number of those who intervened subsequently,
expressed concern about the fact that the Bill provides such a slim
framework for further secondary legislation, largely by Treasury order.
My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) described it as an
“Is this it?” sort of Bill, and my right hon. Friend the
Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher) called it a
mini-Bill.</hs_Para>

seemed to suggest that we would have adequate opportunities not only to
scrutinise the Bill itself, but to scrutinise and respond to whatever
other measures or recommendations were made by the parliamentary
commission at a later stage. I think that how, when, and where that
scrutiny will take place remains rather uncertain. The hon. Member for
Chichester (Mr Tyrie), the chair of the commission and of the Treasury
Committee, asked for two days to be provided on Report, but it seems
that Ministers did not consider that appropriate, or did not wish to do
so. That is serious, because the Bill is very thin as it stands, and a
great deal of work will be needed in connection with the secondary
legislation. We ought to have every opportunity to scrutinise not just
the good work that has already been done by the commission,
but what it will do in future.</hs_Para>

commission report has helpfully provided us with a series of amendments
and explanations of why they are important. It has also provided us
with information on why the members of the commission feel that certain
amendments should be proceeded with even if the Government do not agree

amendments properly. I think that the public would expect us, having
given the responsibility to the commission to make recommendations, to
pay proper attention to them, and would expect the Government to take
heed of
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031156000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031156000066">It
is hard for the public to believe that things have changed when they
perceive that a massive bonus culture is alive and kicking, and that

debates of this kind may appear to be technical, and concerned very
much with the rules and regulations. People watching may wonder how it
affects their everyday lives. A number of hon. Members made the point
that we have to ensure that we use the opportunity of legislation to
rebuild consumer confidence, but we also have to talk about financial
inclusion and diversifying the sector, and we 
<?notus-xml column=117?>have to change the culture of high-risk banking and see an improvement
in standards, because that is what people expect legislation and the

Jamieson:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes very good points. There
would be real concerns if the Committee stage of the Bill was seen as a
rubber-stamping process and the Bill was not scrutinised properly. The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury likes to think of himself as a
listening Minister—he says that often—so I hope he is
listening today to the real concerns expressed by hon. Members.

wish to make a number of points about the particular issues that hon.
Members have raised. On leverage, I was reminded very much about our
discussions on the pronunciation of “schedule” in a
previous financial services debate. Obviously, it will be important for
us to have the opportunity to look at the issue of leverage properly. I
heard the Financial Secretary to the Treasury talk
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:22:10"></hs_TimeCode> the
dilemma of trying to ensure that he not only does the right thing for
the taxpayers, but listens to the industry. It is very important that
the leverage ratio powers need to be clearly taken in the Bill and, as
was said during the opening speeches, phased in ahead of the European
Union plans for the end of the decade.</hs_Para>

Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards highlighted that issue,
particularly in respect of building societies and the concern about the
3% ratio. Indeed,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:22:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bassetlaw raised particular issues about small building
societies, with others raising the more general issue of the building
societies and how the matter could be dealt with. I would hope that
proper scrutiny of the Bill would give us the opportunity to overcome
any negative impact or any problems that would arise for building
societies, which clearly have different equity structures. I would
argue, as did my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:23:14"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East, that that is not a reason
for not putting safeguards in place. I wonder whether the Government

us some further information, perhaps in the Economic Secretary’s
closing speech?</hs_Para>

issue raised by a number of hon. Members was the derivatives inside the
ring fence. A number of references have been made to the Vickers report
and the 
<?notus-xml column=118?>fact that derivatives trading should not be allowed—that was of
course the position. However, the parliamentary commission recognised
that there was a case for some simple derivative products. A lot of
hon. Members have sought a definition of a “simple derivative
product”. Again, we need clearer protections to prevent abuses
within the ring-fenced retail banks where derivatives are being sold.
Again, I expect us to examine that more fully in Committee. I hope that
we will be able to get assurances from the Economic Secretary about the
Government’s intentions, as this is one area where they depart
significantly from the original recommendation of the Vickers
report.</hs_Para>

number of occasions, as I have been on a number of Committees and in
Bill debates with the Economic Secretary. Although he has certainly
appeared to listen, I am not sure that that has translated very often,
if at all, into the acceptance of Opposition amendments or to any
change in Government policy. I hope that on this occasion, even if he
does not accept amendments tabled by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:25:14"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

also want to pick up on a number of areas where the Bill makes
no comment or does not do enough, as discussed by a number of Members.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:25:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Wycombe (Steve Baker) mentioned “Bank of Dave” and
the Bill does not address the issue of challengers or new entrants.
There is nothing in the Bill on a universal obligation for banks on
basic bank account services, which is very important. We take it for
granted that we have a bank account, but it is not quite so simple for
many people on low incomes.</hs_Para>

were asked about switching and bank account portability. There is
nothing in the Bill on mutuality and I do not see anything about a

hon. Friend the Member for Wirral South (Alison McGovern) talked
eloquently about how in such debates everyone on the inside speaks in

and understand how important such discussions are for them. She put
that into perspective very well when she talked about some of the
issues that matter to ordinary people.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:26:59"></hs_TimeCode>The theme was
picked up by my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:26:58"></hs_TimeCode>

two parallel policies: ring-fencing and full separation. That is

favour of ring-fencing, and despite the parliamentary commission
producing no evidence in favour of sector-wide separation as an

for an alternative policy in case we change our view would, in the
Government’s opinion, be bad law-making. If in the future a
Government were to believe that ring-fencing was no longer appropriate,

<?notus-xml column=121?>would be perfectly entitled to do, they should
conduct a thorough analysis of the evidence, consider the arguments for

the Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier). While some may support such
a measure, after 18 months of consideration, Sir John Vickers did not
recommend that the ring fence be supplemented by a ban on proprietary
trading. When the parliamentary commission asked him whether a Volcker
rule should be introduced on top of his ring fence, he warned that the
complexity of such a rule could, by distracting regulators’
focus, actually undermine the ring fence. On top of that, in Europe,
Governor Liikanen and his high level expert group noted how difficult
it could be to distinguish between market making and proprietary
trading. They also worried about pushing proprietary trading into the
shadow banking sector, instead choosing to keep it within the regulated
banking sphere. This Government are minded to agree with such an
appraisal, and do not therefore see the benefit of a Volcker rule on
top of
ring-fencing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:36:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031156000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031156000091">We
have heard some interesting views on the leverage ratio. Let me be
clear. The Government strongly support a robust leverage ratio and are
pushing hard for full implementation of the Basel III leverage ratio in
the EU via the capital requirements directive. The ICB and the
parliamentary commission have both proposed that we increase the
minimum leverage ratio above the 3% international standard set out in
Basel III. The Government strongly support the idea of a minimum
leverage ratio as a back-stop to risk-weighted capital requirements.
But a higher leverage ratio would become a front-stop, the primary
capital constraint on low-risk institutions, including building
societies—a point made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:37:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bassetlaw (John Mann)—and one that could reduce essential
lending to households. A front-stop leverage ratio would also create
perverse incentives for these institutions to risk-up, because a
leverage ratio does not distinguish between the safest assets, such as
UK gilts, and the most risky assets. I do not think any hon. Member
would like to see policies encouraging our safest banks and building
societies, including those that weathered the last crisis quite well,
to become more risky. So the Government are not persuaded by the
arguments for a higher leverage
ratio<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:38:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031156000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031156000092">We
have also had a number of interesting interventions on primary loss
absorbing capacity requirements, not least from the Chairman of the
parliamentary commission. The Government are committed to ensuring that
banks have the means to absorb losses should they get into trouble, and
that those losses fall on those best able to assess the risk that they
are taking. The Government agree that the ICB recommendation that
ring-fenced banks, and UK-headquartered globally systemically important
banks, should be subject to new PLAC standards. That will be 17% of
risk-weighted assets for the largest banks. That extra capacity to
absorb losses will improve resilience against shocks and mean that, if
a bank does fail, it can be resolved without recourse to bank
bail-outs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T21:39:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031156000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0003.htm#13031156000093">Some
Members questioned who would decide whether banks should issue primary
loss absorbing capacity against their overseas activities. The
parliamentary 
<?notus-xml column=122?>commission recognised that the Treasury should have a role in shaping
how the regulator applies primary loss absorbing requirements. That is
because such decisions will be inextricably bound to the key Treasury
objectives of protecting public finances and supporting long-term
growth. The Government therefore believe that there is strong merit in
the FSA’s suggestion that PLAC instruments and decisions should
be made in the context of a firm’s resolution strategy. We will
therefore make provision during the passage of the Bill to give effect

ensure that UK banks are not disadvantaged relative to international
competitors, and because the task of resolving large cross-border banks
is complex and requires close co-operation, it is important that the UK
works with other countries to design a consistent bank bail-in tool

Bernard Jenkin</B> (Harwich and North Essex) (Con):</Member> I am
extremely pleased to have secured this debate on regeneration in
Harwich. Harwich is both typical and exceptional. Harwich, Dovercourt
and the surrounding area have suffered from the economic dislocation
and isolation that has affected so many seaside towns and ports in the
past 60 years or so. Throughout the Anglo-Dutch war of the 1670s, when
Samuel Pepys was the local MP and secretary to the Navy board,
to the Napoleonic wars, when Nelson himself oversaw the construction of
the town’s defences, and the two world wars of the 20th century,
Harwich was a key naval base. It closed, however, after the second
world war.</hs_Para>

the ‘70s and ‘80s, the dock labour scheme drove the final
nails into the coffin of the traditional ports industry, ensuring that
the containerisation of freight was concentrated elsewhere. The huge
opportunities promoted by Hutchison Ports for a five-berth container
terminal at Bathside bay have so far been stymied by an excessively
complex planning system and the downturn in world trade. Latterly, the
chance of using that vast site for alternative economic development has
been frustrated by the EU habitats
directive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T22:06:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031156000631" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0004.htm#13031156000631">Over
the years, the growth of civil aviation and the channel tunnel have
intensified competition for Harwich as a gateway to Europe. As
elsewhere, traditional manufacturing businesses have gradually died out
and the sea fishing industry has declined to one small commercial boat.
Furthermore, Harwich is at the extremity of the commuting distance from
London—a fact not made any easier by recent decisions to end the
running of direct trains to and from Liverpool Street. Such things show
up in the unemployment figures: just 5.1% of people are recorded as
unemployed in Harwich, but that is well above average for the county as
a whole at 2.8%, and above the national average of
3.8<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T22:07:38"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031156000632" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0004.htm#13031156000632">Harwich
is also exceptional. It has an outstanding history and heritage and is
surrounded by the stunning Essex and Suffolk countryside and coast. The
spirit of the place has not diminished and some industries thrive.
Harwich has a specialist oil refinery and a major firework and
explosives factory, and I watched on Friday as JCBs arrived at the old
Navy yard for export. The railway, and the ferry and cruise liner
terminal at Parkestone quay—now known as Harwich
International—serve hundreds of thousands of passengers every
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T22:08:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031156000633" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0004.htm#13031156000633">However,
Harwich desperately needs new jobs and new sources of wealth creation,
as well as improved infrastructure, a recognition of the importance of
high-speed broadband, and to ensure that the A120 has the appropriate
designation at national and European level to attract the funds needed
for improvement. The immediate and pressing issue is for Harwich to
respond to the exceptional opportunities offered by the offshore wind
energy sector, which now employs around 4,000 people in the UK. Harwich
is the UK’s largest windport. It has extensive experience with
the Gunfleet Sands Array and is currently working on the Greater
Gabbard and London Arrays. It has deepwater facilities and it is
ideally located to take advantage of billions of pounds of investment
in the future Thames Array and East Anglia 1 Array
in 
<?notus-xml column=132?>the North sea over the next 10 to 15 years. However,
if we do not provide the necessary infrastructure of skills and
businesses to serve the tier 1 primary contractors that deliver that
investment, there is a real danger that business will be transferred
not just elsewhere in the United Kingdom but out of the country
altogether, perhaps to Flushing in Holland. I therefore very much
welcome the fact that Harwich is to be at the centre of one of the nine
employer ownership of skills pilots launched by the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills. It is questions about this that I wish
my hon. Friend the Minister to address
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T22:09:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031156000634" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0004.htm#13031156000634">The
Harwich scheme is called “Energising Harwich”, and is
aimed at being a passport to work for local people across the Haven
Gateway low carbon supply chain. The Government are injecting
£875,000 into the scheme over two years. It is being led by the
Colchester Institute, and I am grateful to Gary Home and Brian Cairns
of the institute for arranging a briefing for me on Friday. That was
attended by the lead employer, AJ Woods, a leading steel
fabrication business that has already been closely involved in the
development of the Gunfleet Sands and Greater Gabbard wind array, and
part of a concerted attempt to attract wind energy inward investment to
Harwich.</hs_Para>

co-ordinate up to 40 other employers—small and medium-sized
enterprises<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T22:10:37"></hs_TimeCode>—in
this scheme. A new social enterprise, the Harwich Mayflower project,
aims to build a replica of the Pilgrim Fathers’ vessel, the
Mayflower, which sailed from Harwich in 1620. It also aims to
re-establish Harwich as a wooden boat and shipbuilding centre,

chairman of the Haven Gateway initiative and the chief executive of
Tendring district council were also present at our briefing. Tendring
district council is taking a close interest not only in this debate but
in the whole project. Essex county council was represented by county
councillor Ricky Callender, who represents Harwich. Together, the
institute and Tony Woods have appointed Mandy Morris as project manager
for “Energising
Harwich<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T22:11:29"></hs_TimeCode>”.
This is a formidable team infused with creativity and determination to
succeed. There have been too many Government training initiatives with
the aim of simply filling schemes with people who may well finish up
with qualifications, but find that they are of little relevance to the
requirements of local employers. The challenge for “Energising
Harwich” is to ensure that the skills learned equip local people
and enable them to apply for jobs that will otherwise go to people from
outside the
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T22:11:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031156000637" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0004.htm#13031156000637">Working
offshore is a huge challenge. Unlike Teesside, for example, Harwich has
had zero involvement with the offshore oil and gas industry. The key to
the success of this pilot will be the ability of local employers to
train people in the particular skills for the particular jobs they have
on offer; otherwise it will prove a waste of time and money. Success
depends on a breadth and depth of understanding between employers and
the Colchester Institute. Employers are having to adjust, because the
scheme requires companies, who may well be competitors, to co-operate
and to deliver it. They need to understand the constraints attached to
public money. Culturally, it is also hard for traditional training
providers, such as Colchester Institute, to adjust to allow
commercialism to lead the allocation of the funds available, but they
must be supported in doing
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T22:12:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=133?><hs_Para UID="13031156000638" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0004.htm#13031156000638">I commend the
Government for allowing the structure of this funding allocation to be
so much more flexible than others before it so that it can fit employer
needs. The UK Commission for Employment and Skills and the Skills
Funding Agency should be congratulated. I am concerned, however, that
it is too early to say how easy it will be in practice for the bid
leader to provide the necessary paper trail to meet audit needs once
the project is in progress. This is where I must press my hon. Friend
the Minister to support necessary flexibility, or the pilot will
fail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T22:13:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031156000639" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0004.htm#13031156000639">There
are three other main hurdles for the pilot. One is that employers must
provide match funding to the value of 50% of the training fees—a
big ask for small companies in the present climate. The second concerns
legislative accreditations, which are not covered under this or any
other funded programme and yet are essential to the employers’
survival. In most cases, the life of such accreditations is only two
years and full retraining is required again thereafter. Maybe some
rationalisation training could be made. The pilot must have the
flexibility to address that need, which includes statutory requirements
for qualifications in manual handling, first aid and working at
heights, and such things as machinery operation that are never, or very
rarely, publicly funded. At Friday’s briefing, it was mentioned
that even caterers and the food industry need to be trained to deliver
support to offshore workers. These are referred to in the bid as
“mandatory accreditations” and comprise a group of what
are known as “tickets” that allow workers to go offshore.
In their own way, they could be seen as legislative accreditations, but
the bid explained that workers could not go out to sea without them and
that each contractor required a different set. I would be grateful if
the Minister confirmed that he is in favour of using this
bid funding to support such
training<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T22:15:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031156000640" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/debtext/130311-0004.htm#13031156000640">Finally,
working offshore places huge demands on these businesses as employers.
This issue arose during conversations between the Colchester Institute
and employers. Offshore contractors need ISO 9001 accreditation and to
be registered with Achilles or First Point Assessment Ltd, the trade
bodies that approve and monitor suppliers on behalf of the utility and
offshore oil and gas industries. Without accreditation, businesses
cannot bid for contracts. Applying for them takes time and can cost
hundreds of thousands of pounds, but building the businesses’
capacity to operate and employ counts as much as does the training.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T22:16:04"></hs_TimeCode> is a
danger, however, that by concentrating on training the work force, this
other aspect is neglected. Clearly, this support might not be available
from the “Energising Harwich” fund, but funds will have
to be found if these relatively small and vulnerable employers are to
be able to compete effectively for the contracts on which these jobs
will depend. I would be grateful if the Minister acknowledged that, and
I look forward to his response, for which I am extremely
grateful.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_11_PT_1/A7B2990B819E0704D86CC701260ED25405DA4DC5" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 March 2013">Monday

was in Lowestoft earlier this month looking at the links between the
skills system and the offshore industry developing all along the East
Anglian coast. It is critical that, as new industries develop, we
provide the necessary skills, but in the past our skills system has
perhaps not been good at responding to the needs of new industries as
they emerge. I am delighted that, like other parts of the country, my
hon. Friend’s constituency is benefiting from the reinvigoration

critical part of that. It is about a shift towards delivering skills

total, in round 1, which I announced within the first week
of being in this position, the bid comprised £80
million of training activity over two years. The A. J. Woods proposal,
“Energising Harwich”, is an important part of that,
bringing together local employers, working together, and the Colchester
Institute, as my hon. Friend said.
Bringing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-11T22:19:51"></hs_TimeCode>

employers in the project will contribute some £3 million over
two years, which will be supported by more than £850,000 in
public sector funding. The first thing he asked about was the need for
flexibility in the paper trail and the audit. This is a pilot scheme,
the purpose of which is to investigate new ways of delivering skills
that employers need, in exactly the way he described, in order to
support wider regeneration efforts. It is therefore crucial that we
keep under constant review the audit needs and the bureaucracy
surrounding the bids. With public sector money it is critical to have
appropriate audit. However, we have to ensure that that does not get in
the way of delivering the project. I will therefore take that point
away and very much keep my eye on it, as the project develops, and try
to ensure that the burden is minimal, considering the necessity for
good audit, given that we are putting public sector money into the
project.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend’s second point was about match funding of 50%.
Co-funding of skills provision is an important principle. The
beneficiaries are the wider economy and the employer, as well as the
individuals who do the training. In this case the 50% match funding was
agreed locally as part of the bidding process. It was not a ratio set
by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, although we
require some co-funding. Of course I recognise the challenge for some
companies, especially smaller ones, in contributing their own cash and
time, and it is appropriate that the model was developed

first two concerns might be related, because the permanent secretary in

in

know that it is rather unlikely that some hard and fast, actuarially

businesses that are providing the 50% matched funding will account for
it from their own resources. Some of these small businesses have their
accounts audited, but they probably do not have the sort of
comprehensive audit that one would expect of a bank or a major
manufacturing business. There will have to be some leeway on that and,
not so much a flexibility, but a recognition that everything is being
done in good faith, rather than as a means of defrauding the taxpayer
and getting away with committing less than
50%.</hs_Para>

Hancock:</Member></B> Yes, I recognise that that is a strong argument.
We are running this pilot precisely to work out those kinds of issues,
especially with respect to small businesses, with which the Government
are, frankly, not particularly well equipped to deal. We do not have a
good history of engaging with them, and skills is an area in which the
Government as a whole need to improve.</hs_Para>

links to my hon. Friend’s third point, which was funding for
legislative accreditations, or accreditations that are
near-legislative. The skills system has a general rule that legislative
accreditations should be paid for by the employer, so as not to crowd
out private sector funding with public sector funding, except in the
case of unemployed people who need accreditations in order to
get a job and who have no employer to take on the burden.</hs_Para>

is a link to co-funding. We recognise that funding for accreditations
can in some cases be expensive. In many cases it is necessary, and it
also forms part of the co-funding of the project. The two can therefore
be 
<?notus-xml column=136?>linked. A limited amount of resources goes into skills funding, and we
try to focus it on skills that are transferable and that would not
otherwise be paid for by an employer. After all, there is a £40
billion to £50 billion economy in skills provision
across the whole economy, and the Government budget for adult skills is
£4 billion, so it is important that we do not end up trying to
pay for the entirety of training across the whole economy. We simply
would not be able to afford that.</hs_Para>

are my responses to my hon. Friend’s specific points, but I want
to give him a broader, more generic, response as well. We are going
into round 2 of the employer ownership pilot. The bids for round 1 of
the pilot are important, in that we can learn from them how
the system can work better and in different and innovative ways. This
is an innovative example of companies large and small coming together
to provide for a specific need, so it is important for the Government
to learn from what works and what does not, and to change what needs to
be changed to make the pilot deliver.</hs_Para>

is called the employer ownership pilot for a reason. Each of the
projects is, in itself, a pilot, and I give my hon. Friend the
undertaking that I shall take a personal interest in his project. I
shall ensure that the necessary understanding of the context of running
a small business and the costs relating to time that he mentioned are
taken into account. I will ensure that I watch his project very
closely, because it has the potential to unlock a new industry in an
area that, for too long, has not had the vibrancy of a new industry. It
has the potential to do a lot, not only for the town but all
the way up the East Anglian coast. I will take away the points that he
has raised and look into them in more detail.</hs_Para>

congratulate A. J. Woods on the work that it has done, but I also urge
the company to work closely with others to bring the project to
fruition. As my hon. Friend said, the area has higher unemployment than
elsewhere in the region, as well as skills shortages. That tells me
that, for too long, the skills system has not been working properly.
Where we have unemployment alongside skills shortages, there has been a
problem. It is my job to try to fix that, and the employer ownership
pilot is an important element of finding the solution. I want to work
hard to make it happen and to learn what the Government need to do to
deliver better and innovative skills, and I shall be happy to work with
my hon. Friend on that.</hs_Para>

Heath:</Member></B> Under the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953,
it is an offence to allow a dog to worry livestock. The maximum penalty
is a fine not exceeding level 3 (£1,000) on the standard scale.
This is reinforced by the Animals Act 1971 which states that where a
dog causes damage by killing or injuring livestock, the keeper of the
dog is liable for the damage. I am aware that the definition of
livestock in the 1953 Act does not extend to camelids such as llamas,
but there is no evidence to suggest that these animals are subject to
significant numbers of dog attacks. Where such an incident occurs, it
could be dealt with under existing law such as the Dogs Act 1871, the
Animal Welfare Act 2006 and in some cases the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991,
and appropriate action taken including having the dog destroyed and the
owner
prosecuted.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13031154000053" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/text/130311w0001.htm#13031154000053">Floods:

Simon Burns:</Member></B> The development of mitigation for HS2 Phase
One is an ongoing exercise as part of the environmental impact
assessment (EIA) process. The EIA will identify the likely significant
environmental effects of the scheme. Where these effects are adverse,
HS2 Ltd's environmental specialists propose approaches to avoid or
reduce as far as practicable these effects. The main factor that
influences the development of appropriate mitigation for significant
effects is value for money for the tax payer incorporating issues such
as engineering feasibility, effectiveness of the mitigation, cost and
the impact of mitigation on the benefits of the project, such as
journey time or regeneration
benefits.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031154000387" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/text/130311w0001.htm#13031154000387">Draft

Brokenshire</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 7 March 2013]:</I> The UK
Cyber Security Strategy, published on 25 November 2011, has
an objective to tackle cyber crime and make the UK one of the most
secure places in the world to do business. Improving our understanding
of the effects of cyber crime is a key element of the strategy. This
includes actions to improve law enforcement capability to understand
cyber crime, international cooperation to promote better shared
understanding of the threat and the creation of a single reporting
mechanism for cyber and cyber-enabled crimes for citizens and small
businesses. It also includes the development of closer partnerships
with the private sector to improve information sharing on the threats
to
business.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031154000480" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/text/130311w0001.htm#13031154000480">In
the second year of the programme this work is well under way. For
example, by April 2013, all police forces will have a single mechanism
for reporting fraud and financially-motivated cyber crime to Action
Fraud, which will provide a better understanding of the scale and
changing nature of the threat and also the effect on victims. The
creation of the National Crime Agency and, within it, a new National
Cyber Crime Unit will build a stronger intelligence picture of the
effects of cyber crime.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr Osborne), keeps all taxes under review
and considers their effects on a range of sectors in the round. The
Government has limited the rise in air passenger duty (APD) to
inflation over the period 2010-11 to 2012-13. Budget 2012 set out rates
from April 2013, which will also only rise in line with inflation,
ensuring that level of APD will again remain constant in real
terms.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13031154000955" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/text/130311w0002.htm#13031154000955"><B><Member PimsId="1152" UID="13031154001546" xid="1099" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/text/130311w0002.htm#13031154001546">Cathy

of APD as south Florida destinations in the US would require a change
to the banding structure of APD as a whole. Changes to the banding
structure of APD, including a revenue neutral move to a two band
system, were considered as part of the consultation launched at Budget
2011 .The Government's response, published on 6 December 2011, can be

headline CPI inflation rate by 0.2 ppts, according to the Home Office's
published impact assessment for the policy. However as set out in the
impact assessment, the overall effect on inflation is very uncertain.
There are likely to be offsetting effects—for example, by

alcohol.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13031154000959" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/text/130311w0002.htm#13031154000959"><B><Member PimsId="5647" UID="13031154001550" xid="1103" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/text/130311w0002.htm#13031154001550">Iain

finance for high growth companies and has a number of measures in place
to support this. Tax reliefs such as the Enterprise Investment Scheme
and Venture Capital Trusts have supported over £11.5 billion of
equity investment in small companies since they were created.
Enterprise Capital Funds, in which the Government invests alongside
private investors, have so far provided £280 million of
investment in UK companies. The Government has also supported the UK's
largest banks in creating the Business Growth Fund, a £2.5
billion fund dedicated to investing equity in high growth small

who claim it and who are entitled to it. A tax charge is used to
withdraw child benefit so that people on lower incomes do not continue
to subsidise those who are better off. The tax charge only applies to
people on an income over £50,000, who claim child benefit or
whose partner claims child benefit. This charge increases gradually for

Last year, the SGF produced a cost benefit model (“Model

different technologies and approaches to ensuring distribution networks
have sufficient capacity to meet future demands. This model showed that
the appropriate deployment of "smart" solutions, such as demand side
management, can drive down costs by deferring or avoiding network

Ofgem established the Smart Grid Forum (SGF), an industry group which

year, the SGF produced a cost benefit model (“Model
Transform”) to assess the anticipated costs and the benefits of
different technologies and approaches to ensuring distribution networks
have sufficient capacity to meet future demands. This model showed that
the appropriate deployment of “smart” solutions, such as
demand side management, can drive down costs by deferring or avoiding
network reinforcement. This work was an input into Ofgem's electricity
distribution price control review. Further details are available on the

Defence strategy represents the Ministry of Defence's overall
contribution to national strategy, setting out the most appropriate
ways of achieving long-term policy objectives within the resources
available. Preparations for the next Strategic Defence and Security
Review in 2015, which will be co-ordinated by the National Security
Council and Cabinet Office, are already under way within MOD. This
includes a broad programme of activity overseen by the Defence Strategy
Group, co-chaired by the Permanent Under-Secretary and the Chief of
Defence Staff, that is examining possible changes in the future
strategic context, considering the policy options in response, and
testing the continued validity of Future Force 2020. This work is being
led and co-ordinated by a core team of 10 personnel in the Defence
Strategy and Priorities branch, but involves a wider range of staff and
organisations within the Head Office and across MOD. It also features
close engagement with other Government Departments.</hs_Para>

are no specific recreational facilities for retired officers. As part
of the policy for engagement with retired senior officers, rear-admiral
and higher, the naval service has for many years hosted an annual
update, the cost of which has totalled some £4,500 over the past
three financial years. However, in general there has been no official
entertainment or dining intended for retired officers that has incurred
a cost to the Ministry of Defence (MOD) in the previous three financial
years.</hs_Para>

McVey:</Member></B> The length of time taken to complete mandatory
reconsideration will vary from case to case and will be dependent on
whether any additional evidence is required, and if so how quickly it
is provided by the claimant. In any case where the Department requests
additional evidence regulations state that the Department must allow
claimants one month to supply it, so these cases could take in excess
of one month to
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031160001545" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130311/text/130311w0004.htm#13031160001545">The
Department aims to complete mandatory reconsideration without
unnecessary delays, but the focus of the process is to ensure that the
decision has been fully reviewed in light of any new evidence and
explained to the claimant and this process will take time to complete.
It would be difficult to give an estimate of 
<?notus-xml column=98?>the average time this process will take since it is
new and untried, and processing times are likely to range from a few
days to a number of weeks depending on the complexity of the

employment and support allowance cases, no benefit is payable once the
claim has been disallowed on the grounds that a claimant does not have
limited capability for work. This also applies to the period while the
mandatory reconsideration process is being undertaken, as there are no
legal grounds to make any payment of ESA while this process is
completed. If a claimant chooses to appeal following mandatory
reconsideration ESA can be paid at the assessment phase rate pending
the appeal hearing. The payment will cover the period of the mandatory
reconsideration so there will not be a gap.</hs_Para>

‘Varied length sanctions’: A sanction of between one week
and  26 weeks is imposed for leaving employment voluntarily
without just cause, refusing employment without good cause, or losing
employment through misconduct. The actual period in each case is at the
discretion of the adjudication officer who makes the
decision.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">5.
‘Fixed length sanctions’: A sanction of between one week

employment programme or carry out a jobseeker’s direction.
Payment of benefit continues in full pending the adjudication
officer’s decision on a sanction
question.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">6.
‘Entitlement decisions’: These are questions on which
entitlement to JSA depends. For example, if there is doubt around
whether the jobseeker’s agreement (JSAg) is suitable, whether
they are actively looking for work or making themselves available for
work. In most cases, payment of JSA will be suspended by benefit
processing until the doubt is

supports claimant participation in voluntary work, recognising the
value such work can have in building skills and experience. The
recently published regulations explain that we normally require a
claimant to be engaged full time in looking and preparing for work and
that voluntary work can count for up to 50% of that time (and of course
individuals can do more if they wish). Claimants may also be given a
longer period of time to attend an interview or take up paid work if

credit will also allow people who work to keep some of the money that
they earn before it has any impact on the amount of universal credit
they receive. This amount is called a work allowance. Universal credit
will have a single taper rate of 65%. For people who are working,
financial support will be reduced at a consistent and predictable rate
and they will generally keep a higher proportion of their earnings. It
will be much easier for people who are working or who are considering a

established in December 2009 to review the analysis and evidence
supporting regulatory proposals. From the beginning of 2011, each of
the opinions on impact assessments has been prefaced with a Red
(‘not fit for purpose’), or Amber or Green (‘fit
for purpose’) rating. A new streamlined system was introduced in
August 
<?notus-xml column=125?>2012 to speed up the implementation of deregulatory measures and to
apply a more proportionate approach to low cost (less than £1
million) regulatory measures. Consequently opinions for deregulatory
and low cost measures are now no longer issued and the results are no
longer directly comparable across the time series. BIS' performance is
