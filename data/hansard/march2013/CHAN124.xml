constitution and everything else remain unclear. We have seen nothing
at this stage to suggest that any date should be affected, but a new
Government have not yet been formed. The Prime Minister designate has
until the end of this week to create a Government. There may be an
extension after that, but hopes are high that that Government will be
confirmed. It will then be easier to see what dates will follow for the
other parts of the democratic process of

Burt:</Member></B> I am not quite sure what reassessment the hon.
Gentleman is asking for. As I have said, we are monitoring events as
closely as we can. We are engaged with a variety of projects for
democracy building in Tunisia, yet the constitutional processes being
undergone are for Tunisians themselves. I spoke to our deputy head of
mission just this morning. The streets are calm; people are expecting a
Government to be formed at the end of the week. They are well aware of
the difficulties of forming the Government and of the pressures between
the political parties, but as he said, there are grounds for some
optimism. These are obviously difficult days for Tunisia, but the fact
that the process has been handled democratically and peacefully to date
is much to be welcomed, and we will continue to encourage
it.</hs_Para>

Burt:</Member></B> I very much appreciate what my hon. Friend says.
There has been good progress, but we must all be clear that each state
is different. These events in the Arab world will take time and there
will inevitably be progress, both forwards and backwards. Tunisia is
facing its own difficulties, but facing up to them well. The Prime
Minister has made it clear that, as part of our responsibilities for
the G8, the Deauville partnership will be reinvigorated to ensure that
economic support is available to countries in transition. We believe
that the G8 process this year will be able to deliver economic benefits
to countries in transition such as Tunisia, which will be of enormous
help to them.</hs_Para>

Burt:</Member></B> My hon. Friend puts it very well. There is a great
risk of trying to see all political developments through the prism of
24-hour news or a rolling news programme. These things will not be
settled quickly. I suspect that we will not know the outcome of the
Arab spring even by the time most of us have finished our period in
Parliament. My hon. Friend is right: this will need patience. Equally,
the commitment of those such as the United Kingdom to
democracy-building institutions—which we are involved in through
the Arab partnership and other partners—is a vital part of the
process, if it is to be a
success.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0001.htm#13030539000047"><Member ContinuationText="Ian Lucas" PimsId="1569" UID="13030539000690" xid="370" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0001.htm#13030539000690"><B>Ian

Burt:</Member></B> It certainly is. The hon. Gentleman is right to
point to our engagement, through Arab Partnership, in various
democracy-building processes. We are expecting a number of projects to
be developed during the course of this year, at a cost of some
£2.5 million, and we will be looking to develop projects on
election monitoring, on the support of political parties and on
democracy building. We are constantly looking, with the Tunisians, at
what they will find most effective. Last year, one of the most
effective projects was to help them to move their state broadcasting
company into a public broadcasting company. Such efforts to open up
democracy to more people are a vital part of the process that we hope
will lead to the establishment of a new constitution in the time scale
already set out by the Tunisians.</hs_Para>

about illegal settlement building on occupied land, but I think the
starting point for negotiations has to be a common political will. That
needs to be there in Israel, where a new Government are being formed,
and among Palestinians, who continue to discuss reconciliation among
each other. The true starting point is a common willingness to enter
again into negotiations and to develop the middle east peace process,
with the leadership of the United States but with the support of us

also aware that that is the single largest proposed demolition of

actions hinder the search for a two-state solution. Our condemnation of
illegal settlement building and of demolitions on occupied land has
been very clear across the House, as I have said. The important thing
in the coming months is to move beyond that and to get into successful
negotiations. The only answer, in the end, will be an agreed two-state
solution, and the time for that is slipping away. The hon. Gentleman
rightly mentioned patience. The world has been patient, but the time in
which a two-state solution can be agreed is now slipping away, partly
because of changing facts on the ground. That demonstrates the urgency,

have not been finalised. Mrs Livni has worked hard in the past to try
to bring about negotiations on a two-state solution. We are indeed in
regular touch with her and have been even when she was out of
government. The negotiations, which failed to reach a conclusion by 1
March now have a further 14 days to produce an Israeli Government by 15

only from a successful negotiation between Israelis and Palestinians. I
do not know anyone who thinks that there will be any other way of

as it is part of the argument to Israeli leaders to get them to use the
time remaining for a two-state solution to be brought about. On that, I
differ from my right hon. and learned Friend in that while I think this
may be the last chance for a two-state solution 
<?notus-xml column=806?>and that the time is slipping away, I do not think that the time for it

I have listened carefully to the answers offered by the Foreign
Secretary, and on this matter I sense that there is genuine cross-party
agreement across the House. He says that active discussions are under
way with European partners on the proscription of Hezbollah’s
military wing, but that some countries are looking at further evidence.
Given the terms of the report published by the Bulgarians on 5 February
and the discussions that the Bulgarian Minister has had with other
European colleagues, will the Foreign Secretary tell the House what
further discussions he is going to have, particularly with the French
and with others? What assurance would they need in order to be able to
match the action that, with our support, the British Government have
taken?</hs_Para>

Hague:</Member></B> Of course, we are in active discussion with other
European partners, including France. As I say, some are immediately
supportive of designation, as we are, but some want to look in more
detail at the evidence, although plenty of evidence is available. Some
have concerns about the impact on the stability of
Lebanon—concerns that I think are unfounded—on EU
relations with Lebanon or on European troops serving in the UN mission
in southern Lebanon, the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon. So
there are a variety of reasons for this, which I do not agree with, and
it is clear that the right hon. Gentleman does not agree with them
either. I shall, thus, quote the strong cross-party support in this

action this year, the opportunity for a two-state solution is slipping

on 26 and 27 February, and they were successful enough for further
meetings to be agreed. Meetings of officials will take place in early
April, also in Kazakhstan. Of course, it is pleasing that it is worth
while having those further meetings. In the E3 plus 3 we have put a
revised offer to the Iranians. However, that revised offer would
involve both sides taking actions that then build confidence for
further negotiations, without our thinking that we can resolve the
entire problem in one move—one negotiation. We hope that Iran
will continue to take a strong interest and a constructive role in
these negotiations. It is too early to tell whether the Iranian
position is to do that or to play for time, as has often happened in

discussions, which are difficult in our case because of the unavoidable
closure of embassies. Nevertheless, I have from time to time met the
Iranian Foreign Minister and we are open to the idea of other members
of the E3 plus 3 having bilateral discussions with Iran. Such
discussions sometimes take place at the margins of the E3 plus 3
meetings. It is important for Iran to know that we are seeking to
settle the nuclear issue—Iran would, of course, have all the
rights of a country under the non-proliferation treaty—and that
the western world is not embarked on regime change in Iran. That
sincerely is what we are trying to do. Any bilateral discussions that
make that clear and allow negotiations to proceed more successfully on
that basis would, of course, be welcome.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman has raised an important question and I want to deal with
some aspects of it. First, however, I will set the scene as to what we
are trying to deal with. I understand that Labour Front Benchers now
admit that they fundamentally got it wrong on immigration, but the
scope to which they got it wrong is why we have this issue. Between
1997 and 2010, net migration to the UK was some 2.2 million
people—larger than the city of Birmingham. Interestingly, from
2004 to 2010, 1.1 million European economic area nationals registered
to work in the UK. After the prediction of what was likely to happen,
the scope of the problem is far greater than anything the Labour party
wanted to tell the public. Most of all, I congratulate my right hon.
Friend the Home Secretary and her team in the coalition for having
begun the process of reducing net migration to Britain for the first
time in a long time.</hs_Para>

benefit of the House and in line with the right hon. Gentleman’s
request—I know he particularly wanted me to answer that bit
first, so having dealt with it I will get on with the rest of my
answer—let me explain the current arrangement. A lot of nonsense
is talked about what we are and are not capable of. First, people must
pass the habitual residence test, introduced by the previous
Government, before being entitled to claim income-related benefits. The
current system was put in place in 2004 and has basically two
elements—a legal right to reside and an assessment of factual
evidence of habitual residence. As we know, EU citizens have the right
to live in another member state as long as they are a qualified person,
which basically means a worker, self-employed person, jobseeker,
self-sufficient person or student. Tax credits have, I am afraid, been
open to abuse outside that system from day one because the rules allow
anybody from within the European economic area to claim self-employed
status and receive full entitlement immediately. The Government are
trying to wrestle with that problem, and I will return to it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030539000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0001.htm#13030539000185">We are
currently facing—not for the first time—a legal challenge
from the European Commission because our habitual residence test states
that people must prove they live in the UK habitually before they get
access to benefits. It seems strange to me that anyone should be
surprised that a habitual residence test requires that a person should
live in the UK habitually, but we sometimes live in that George
Orwellian political language world, which the Commission seems to
foster with great alacrity.</hs_Para>

exportability, under the EU co-ordination rules, benefits under the
main categories of social security are exportable—that is,
payable elsewhere in the European economic area. So that we clear up
the confusion, let me 
<?notus-xml column=824?>say that that includes, notably, child benefit, for example, and has for
a while. We therefore pay child benefit to children who live in other
EU states when their parents are working here. That causes a lot of
concern, and quite legitimately so. When both parents work but in
different countries, the EU rules apparently determine who has primary
responsibility for paying, but any difference in entitlement is netted
off. So, for example, if someone comes from Poland and works over here,
the child support that we pay here is netted out against what they
might have received had they been paid in Poland, and the net amount is
therefore paid across. That is the existing rule. The UK system is
obviously more generous, and that is why it pays people in a sense to
be here, getting those
benefits.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0001.htm#13030539000187">I
recognise there are some real issues here. We are in the midst of
looking at those issues with other countries as well, and I want to
mention which ones are on the schedule. The Government are concerned
that, although some protections are in place, they are not enough. That
is particularly worrying given the issue, which the right hon.
Gentleman raises, of 1 January 2014. So we are trying to look carefully
at where the system is falling down at the moment, and I am exploring a
series of options. Today, for example, I have called for another
meeting of a series of European nations that share our concerns. Some
people might have noticed today that Germany has woken up at last to
the reality that it might face a large net migration. We are due to
meet its representatives and others from around the EU to try to ensure
that we deal with this. I do not believe that it is acceptable that we
go on with it—I have told the European Commission
that—and we will resist
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0001.htm#13030539000188"><Member ContinuationText="Mr David Winnick" PimsId="4647" UID="13030539000823" xid="643" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0001.htm#13030539000823"><B>Mr

reality is that we are trying, for example, to figure out the rules
that allow us to prevent individuals from staying in the UK for only a
short time before claiming benefits—a rule that existed under
the last Government. We are looking at the tests about accommodation
and the length of time people spend here. We want to look at things
such the leasing arrangements they have for their housing and over what
length of time, and even at challenging the narrow and short-term
definition of “habitual” used by the European Court of
Justice. In other words, we are trying to lock people out from coming
here solely for the purpose of claiming
benefits.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0001.htm#13030539000191">I
have to tell Opposition Members, who were making a noise just a second

claim benefits, and we will be on top of those figures.</hs_Para>

things we need to do. We need to tighten up immediately the rules about

and the leasing length of time. 
<?notus-xml column=825?>We need to tighten up and start the process of arguing hugely with the

benefit and pay the higher level to people whose families do not even
come with them into the country to work. Finally, many nations in
Europe are just as angry as we are about this, and we have been meeting
them since last summer and reaching a common purpose to deal with the
Commission and force it to recognise that any further changes it wants
to make, including by taking us to court over the British residency
rules, are not acceptable. We will tighten up. I refuse to accept the

that, if the word “crisis” is used, it is a crisis that
successive Governments have engendered by moving welfare from the basis
that people had to make contributions to receive benefits to one where
they receive them if their income proves needs? Is not his universal
credit just one more move in that direction? When will the House know
what further restrictions will be placed on universal credit to prevent
it from being claimed immediately by people who arrive in this country?
Does he not accept that the current situation—basically, a
means-tested welfare state—is inconsistent with our European
Union treaty obligations and is against the Prime Minister’s
wish that we should be open for trade but not an easy touch? Are the
Government now going to rescind the directions issued by primary care

let us put the facts as they are: I inherited a habitual residency test

self-employed people coming in to the country are immediately able to
claim tax credits even if they are doing only a little bit of

That is one area we have to look at in relation to universal credit,
but I take the opposite view from him. Universal credit gives us an
opportunity to redefine the nature of that benefit by absorbing the tax
credit issue, taking away the right of individuals coming in from
overseas to claim on that basis, and redefining it as something much
more in line with our obligations, while being able to lock out many
migrants who would come and claim immediately. I am happy to discuss
that with him further, but I believe we will be able to make that move,

looking carefully at issuing clear instructions that they do not have
to do this. It is my view and belief that that is the case, and it is
about making it clear that they do not feel they will be challenged. It
is a little like health and safety rules—people over-interpret
the situation. In fact, things are never as tough as that, and we need

Edward Leigh</B> (Gainsborough) (Con):</Member> I love the Secretary of
State, but frankly his answer was so long and complicated that one
would need a degree in social security to understand it—I did
not understand it. As a recent by-election showed, the people are
hurting and they want a clear answer from the Government. Why do the
Government not do as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr
Redwood) and the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field) suggested
and either move to a contributory system or say, “We will not
pay you benefits until you have stayed here for a number of
years”? If the European Court sues us, bring it on, and that
will make our case for renegotiation.</hs_Para>

the Labour party’s position was an absolute disaster. This is
not about that; the reality is simply that we need to ensure that the

pay their taxes in Britain, who work hard and do not want to see social
housing and all these other areas going to people who never made a

have been done and the issue should have been raised at a much higher

the contradiction in the Government’s stance at present? We are
talking tough at home while—according to Romanian
Ministers—giving assurances that those who come from Romania
will be given full access to benefits, on the same basis as UK

for what anybody in the European economic area can do when they come
here. The problem has been in existence for some time, as the right
hon. Member for Birkenhead said. I now have to sweep up after the lord

that the average salary in this country is five to six times what it is

cross-departmental co-operation, so that we do not face the situation

number of meetings with the Prime Minister and coalition colleagues
about tightening up between Departments and understanding where one
Department’s position knocks on to another. The first thing is
to get rid of the silo mentality that existed and create a
pan-Government position. The next thing is not to talk tough here and
soft abroad, but to work with the Foreign Office to be as tough over
there as we are back here. That is the process that is now being

Estonia, Ireland, Germany, France and Poland. We have had meetings with
all of them. There is no common position for them all, but a sub-set of
those most likely to be affected—I understand that Germany and

Hughes</B> (Bermondsey and Old Southwark) (LD):</Member> I commend the
Secretary of State and the Government for addressing this issue, which
has never been addressed before. The principle is simple: UK citizens
are entitled to the benefits that come with the contribution system we
inherit, whereas EU citizens—those from Ireland perhaps are
excepted, because of the common travel area—should not expect
greater benefits here than UK citizens should expect in other EU
countries. If we could get to that position, everybody would understand
it and there would be greater justice and far fewer
complaints.</hs_Para>

he makes—it is one I have made before—is that there is
not an easy solution to what the Commission wants, which is to try to
drive free movement as the sole and most important element in this
process. However, it fails to recognise that all the nation states have
very different social security systems. Many of those nations are
finally beginning to say, with us, that this cannot be driven through
like a coach and horses, because we control our social security
systems. We have different ways of contributing and we use tax
differently, so the argument we are making—I believe we will win
it—is that we must be left to make those decisions. Obviously
when people want to come and work, we want them to do that; the issue
is when they come not to work. I think we have a strong position on
changing that.</hs_Para>

reality is that it is issues such as this that drive people away from
the concept of the success of the European Union, if that is what they

such as this, the more damage it does to those who are pro-European. I
personally have been quite sceptical about the process for a
considerable period, but even I can recognise that this damages the
concept of a European Union that works for all its members and that is
about trade and co-operation and ensuring that the people who live in

already relocated, such as Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps,
which has moved to Innsworth, Gloucestershire. Planning for completion
of the return is well advanced. We are on track to reduce our presence

just about rebasing the Army from Germany. It is about providing a
basing plan for Army 2020 in the UK that will allow the Army to
generate its military capability in the optimal way. As the plan has
developed, two key principles have emerged to inform it. First, the
armoured infantry brigades of the reaction force should coalesce around
a single location. We have concluded that Salisbury plain training area
is the only place in the country where we have the capability to carry
out the complex and demanding training exercises that they need to
conduct. Having all three brigades located in close proximity around
the plain will enable them to train and fight more effectively and will
present significant opportunities for efficiency in equipment support
and people management. Secondly, the Army should retain a UK-wide
footprint, maintaining the vital link to civil society, fostering
closer links between reserve units and their partnered regular units

represents the best value for money in the utilisation of existing

north-east of England, centred on Catterick; at Aldershot; around
Edinburgh and Leuchars; at Colchester and Swanton Morley in the east of
England; in the west midlands around Stafford and Donnington; and in

are 7,000 service children currently being educated in Germany, will
the Secretary of State say what will happen to those whose new homes

for advance sight of his statement, welcome the return of troops from

breaking of a raft of defence promises in relation to Scotland. Will he
clarify that the UK Government are not returning 6,500 to 7,000 troops
from Germany to Scotland, as promised, that they are not building new
barracks at Kirknewton, as promised, that they are not opening a new
training area, as promised, and that they are not delivering the Army
personnel levels promised for Leuchars, but that they are closing the
Sterling headquarters of 51st Infantry Brigade and HQ Scotland? The
Ministry of Defence has acknowledged that over the past decade there
has been a 28% cut in the number of defence personnel in Scotland,
compared with an 11% cut across the UK as a whole. The Army return to
Scotland was supposed to offset the loss of the RAF and increase the
defence footprint, so will the Secretary of State confirm that across
the services, and taking into account the RAF changes, there will in
fact be fewer personnel, not more, and certainly fewer than the 15,000
planned for an independent

accused the Government of planning to remove the Royal Marines from
Scotland completely and close Fort George, neither of which has
happened. It is true that the decision has been taken not to develop
Kirknewton, but the balancing factor is the retention of Dreghorn as an
Army barracks. The hon. Gentleman’s assertion about personnel
numbers in Scotland is incorrect. My right hon. Friend the Member for
North Somerset made his statement on 18 July 2011, and I have checked
the numbers against that baseline. The total number of armed forces
personnel in Scotland will be just over 600 higher than the baseline. I

forces personnel who will be based in Scotland, compared with the

withdrawal of our forces from Germany represents the logical conclusion
of the ending of the cold war some 20-odd years ago. Keeping a large
standing force in Germany is expensive and no longer serves its
original strategic purposes. As our Army becomes smaller, the
diseconomies of scale of having two separate centres for armoured
vehicle training, for example, and consequently two separate centres
for armoured vehicle maintenance, become unsupportable. This is a

Nevertheless, the logic of my right hon. Friend’s announcement

it is very important that the TA is based where it has historically
recruited and where it can recruit and that that is not distorted by
pairing arrangements with regular units, important though they may be.
Secondly, it is critical that we keep our training areas going,

the need to have reserve accommodation in the areas where we recruit
and the need to enable joint training for regulars and reserves, which
is at the heart of our new model for the reserve forces. I can assure
him that resolving that tension is at the core of the work going on and

Ireland, we must recognise that a significant proportion of that number

a result of the legacy of Operation Banner in Northern Ireland, there

Hammond:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is right that there is some
vacant accommodation at Thiepval, and the Army looked very carefully at
the possibility of further location at Lisburn. However, the equation
is complex. It is about not only utilising existing estate but the
operational cost of having troops on that estate—the cost of
getting them to the training areas where they need to operate. Overall,
the value for money case points to the solution I have set out, even
though that means that some vacant accommodation will remain at
Thiepval.</hs_Para>

consequence. I cannot give my hon. Friend an exact profile of the
investment in Salisbury at the moment, but I can tell him that the move
of 20 Armoured Brigade will take place towards the back end of the
programme. That reflects the fact that there is a very big investment
programme to be completed. Partly for technical and planning reasons
and partly for financing reasons, it will be somewhat slower to get
under way than some of the smaller investments we are making elsewhere.

this is the first such appointment to a foundation trust under the
Health and Social Care Act 2012. Given the seriousness of the
decisions, I urge Monitor to ensure that there is the longest possible
period of consultation and that the trust special administrator has the
option to consider proposals other than those that have been set out,
none of which are acceptable to me or my constituents. I welcome the
reassurance that the administrator’s priority is to deliver
high-quality services to
patients.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000440" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000440">Secondly,
although some of the reasons for the administration are particular to
Mid Staffordshire, the most important reasons are not. The pressure
being placed on mid-sized and even large acute trusts by the squeezing
of the emergency and acute tariffs since 2009 is huge. Mid Staffs,
which had £21 million of extra funding injected into it last
year, may be the first trust this has happened to, but if the squeeze
continues, it may be the first of many. The House urgently needs the
opportunity to debate NHS tariffs for emergency and acute care, the
demand for which is rising annually.</hs_Para>

proposed changes to hospital services in the area served by Mid
Staffordshire, including Cannock Chase, Stone and south Staffordshire,
are not acceptable. They will increase health inequalities, contrary to
section 4 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, by
reducing access, especially for those on low incomes and those without
access to private transport. The changes will put tens of thousands of
my constituents much further away from emergency, acute and maternity
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000442" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000442">Finally,
the impact of some of the changes will be felt much further afield. The
surrounding hospitals are already operating at or near capacity. The
idea that they can take on large numbers of additional patients without
it damaging the services for their local populations is highly
questionable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000443" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000443">I

in its present form needs to alter. However, the current proposals,
which differ from those made by several reports over the past three
years by Professor Sir George Alberti and others, go much too far. The
services provided by the trust have improved considerably in the past
three years. I urge the people of Stafford, Cannock and the surrounding

represented a constituency at the heart of the midlands motorway
network for almost 16 years, I have seen the impact of successive
efforts to improve the national transport infrastructure, often with
harsh consequences for local residents. Early in my tenure, I visited a
family whose home was just beyond the threshold for compensation on the
hard shoulder of the M42, despite the fact that the motorway noise
blighted their property as much as their next-door neighbours who got
compensation. The M42 has vastly exceeded its intended capacity and the
hard shoulder is now used for active traffic management, so the
property would now be eligible on simple
metreage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000454" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000454">A
few years later, the White Paper on aviation proposed a second runway
at Birmingham airport, which came as a bolt from the blue for local
residents. Immediately, they had difficulty selling their homes, yet no
statutory compensation was
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000455" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000455">The
airport came up with a proposed voluntary compensation scheme based on
noise contours rather than straight metreage from the runway, which
gained broad public support. The airport maps the noise contour of
every flight, so there is a strong scientific base for estimating noise
nuisance and taking account of the prevailing winds. Most recently, the
proposal of HS2 has brought a new blight to villages and a council
estate in my constituency. Once again, statutory blight laws mean that
compensation will not be paid until one year after HS2 opens in 2026,
except on the grounds of hardship, which are, of course, discretionary.
That adds yet more uncertainty. Although blight is often most severe
when uncertainty is at its highest, and when HS2 is built the impact on
properties will probably be much less than feared, the blight is
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000456" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000456">Large
infrastructure schemes can take a huge amount of time to progress from
the initial announcement to completion of the scheme. During that
process, the scheme will often change as more information becomes
available, although home owners or landowners do not know that at the
time. As the Country Land and Business Association points out, farmers
and landowners are prevented from making important business decisions,
sometimes for a whole generation. That impacts not only on those
individuals, but on their suppliers and
markets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000457" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000457">Statutory
blight and compulsory purchase provisions do not encourage an acquiring
authority to conclude compensation negotiations quickly. Although
provisions for paying interest on outstanding claims are available, the
statutory rate is 0% and the landowner foots the loss at a cost of 5%
per annum. Some claims will remain outstanding for 10 years. For
example, some landowners have still not been compensated for the
building of the M6 toll road.</hs_Para>

Compensation Act 1973 makes provision for compensation for the
depreciation of property values caused by physical effects such as
noise, but such compensation is available only a year after the
infrastructure is built. The blight is now, and current metreage-based
compensation does not help those who may feel the same physical effects
of the scheme as their neighbour, but are a few extra metres
away.</hs_Para>

compensation should be paid in advance of the railway opening, in
anticipation of the nuisance it will cause as modelled by noise
contours. If accurate scientific information about the physical effects
of the line on properties was made available, it would ensure that
residents receive proper compensation, reduce the level of uncertainty
about the effect of the line, and therefore reduce blight. We must be
clearer about noise data sooner and clear up the fear that causes
generalised
blight.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000460" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000460">The
HS2 voluntary compensation scheme is an example of how the rigidity of
the metreage approach does not address blight. Homes within 60 metres
of the track are safeguarded by compulsory purchase provisions, and
those within 120 metres can be purchased on a voluntary basis. However,
the eligibility criteria ignore the prevailing wind direction or
contours in the land that shield or aggravate noise. My Bill is
designed to make the eligibility for compensation fairer and more
scientifically based, and create parity between roads, rail and
airports. Such a proposal does not detract from the property bond
proposed by other pressure groups seeking better terms of compensation
for those affected. I am aware of the broad base of support for the
property bond compensation scheme that would tackle the root cause of
property—the loss in property market
confidence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000461" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000461">To
give one example from many, my constituents, Mr and Mrs
Hickin of Berkswell, live about 500 metres north of the HS2 line past
their village. Their interest-only mortgage must be repaid in 2015 and
they had planned to downsize to a smaller property and pay off the
debt. Despite being on the market for nearly three years and reducing
the price of their home by £90,000, they have received no offers
and live with the worry that they will not be able to meet their
financial obligations. Other constituents whose properties have been on
the market for several years have not received any offers, even when
dramatically reducing the price. That is not unusual among affected
constituencies such as those of my neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member
for Kenilworth and Southam (Jeremy Wright) and my right hon. Friend the
Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan). On average, properties
have lost 20% of their value. The exceptional hardship scheme suffers
from a lack of credibility. The Government will be consulting on
phase 2 of that, so why not bring it forward and consult on
amendments to phase
1?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000462" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000462">When
Birmingham airport proposed its voluntary compensation scheme, it was
designed to support the sale of property within a defined boundary of
the noise contour with a bond. The level of noise recognised by the
aviation industry to trigger voluntary compensation is 66 dB. The
boundary of eligibility was drawn with sensitivity around semi-detached
properties where one property might be eligible but the other not, so
as to avoid the kind of rigidity I experienced with motorway
compensation. The bond was based on an independent valuation of the
difference between the base price before 
<?notus-xml column=867?>the announcement and the reduced price thereafter. An independent
commissioner was appointed to review any complaints that compensation
had been incorrectly calculated and
applied.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000463" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000463">I
believe that model offers a more scientific basis for eligibility for
property bonds and would allow many people now experiencing blight from
major national infrastructure projects to receive fair recognition and
move on with their lives. Essentially, it would bring forward part 1
payments under the Land Compensation Act.</hs_Para>

conclusion, blight laws must be reviewed and changed to help those who,
through no fault of their own, are blighted by decisions made in
Westminster. In the long term, HS2 is vital for this country’s
economic progression and for the west midlands economy in particular,
but we should not balance the books on the backs of home owners and
landowners whose property may reduce in value. Adding flexibility to
the way blight is measured, removing the strict metreage classification
in the current compensation scheme, and recognising the loss in value
through a property bond would be a welcome reform for
many.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000465" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000465"><I>Question

spending, if not huge, relates to crucial areas of great public concern
and interest: prisons, probation and legal aid. Most of the expenditure
that the Ministry is responsible for is incurred in programmes
administered by agencies and non-departmental public bodies. The broad

if the Minister responded with some of the reasons for the £159
million increase for NOMS in the resource departmental expenditure
limit, which is mysteriously described in the Ministry’s
memorandum as due to “emergency cost pressures”. Last
year, £51 million was included in the supplementary
estimate under exactly the same heading. What are those pressures? Is

shall turn to the main conclusions of my Committee’s
wide-ranging report. We took evidence in the first half of last year
and reported in August 2012, and the Government responded in October.
We visited the Department during our inquiry, and we did so in an
innovative way that I commend to other Committees. We simply said,
“We don’t want a formalised tour. We wish to enter every
part of the Department and, on a second day, NOMS, and all we want is
someone who has got the keys to every door in the building.”
That is what we did, and we just wandered about every part of the
Department, talked to staff and got a clear picture from
them—interestingly, it was to the Department’s
credit—of their commitment to the transforming justice
programme. We just landed on anyone and asked, “What are you
doing? What is your role in all this?” That gave us a much
better feel than formal presentations sometimes do for how the
Department was functioning, and it was to the Department’s
benefit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000478" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000478">We
have regularly taken evidence and reported on the annual reports
produced by the Ministry. On the broader relationship between
expenditure and policy, our predecessor Committee in early 2010
produced a seminal report on the case for justice reinvestment—a
strategy for the transfer of resources away from custody to the
prevention of crime and the reduction of reoffending. It remains my
firm belief that the blueprint set out in that report is the only
sensible way forward for a long-term criminal justice policy. Some
elements of that philosophy are present in Government policy today, but
quite a lot more could be included.</hs_Para>

important questions of policy, particularly on the commissioning of

the first major examination of the activities 
<?notus-xml column=870?>of the Ministry and its associated public bodies. We looked at the
background to the setting up of the Ministry, its internal governance,
budgetary provision, financial management, commissioning and

concluded in our report that the Ministry’s structure and
performance had improved since its creation and that progress had been
made in integrating the Department, but many of the improvements had
been from a low starting point and there had been criticisms and
failures. The culture in which the focus was on
policy creation previously had changed to an increasing recognition of
the importance of programme management. The Department had developed a
greater understanding of its cost drivers, although it still did not
have sufficient management control of its finances.</hs_Para>

the Ministry had sought to bring its sponsored bodies under closer
central control and make them more accountable to Ministers and had
streamlined senior management structures and reduced the duplication of
functions. We called for further structural change to create an
integrated system of offender management, involving the commissioning
of both prison and probation services in defined geographical areas. In
fact, we look like ending up with roughly the opposite: national
commissioning of prisons, which is what we already have, and now of
probation, as part of the Government’s probation proposals. The
Lord Chancellor defended that on the grounds that, at this stage at any
rate, the limited available experience needs to be concentrated to
carry out that commissioning function, but that seems to us to be
entirely the wrong strategy. The commissioning of ways to deal with
offenders really needs to be associated with all the other agencies
that are situated in an area. The prisons, police and crime
commissioners, local authority social services departments and housing
authorities need to work together, as they have done in youth offender
teams, for example, to achieve the best results
locally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000483" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000483">We
expressed doubt about whether the Ministry had sufficient skills
capacity to implement the radical change of approach, with the greater
outsourcing of the delivery of services, and we pointed to a danger
that the way payment by results would be commissioned might undermine
the work of voluntary sector organisations, which play, and need to
play, a vital role in the justice sector. I think that Ministers have
got that message. I am less sure whether they can implement it
properly. There is certainly considerable anxiety across the voluntary
sector, where so much of the skill and commitment that is required to
change offenders’ lives is available. We drew attention to the
wide range of public, private and voluntary organisations that need to
work together if the wider justice system is to operate more
effectively and efficiently when resources are so
constrained.</hs_Para>

difficult to think of any part of the Department’s activities
that are not affected by the process of transformation, which has been
under way and has gathered pace. In particular, the proposals in
transforming rehabilitation document will entirely re-fashion the
terrain of probation services. There are welcome plans to extend
rehabilitation to prisoners serving sentences of under 12 months who
currently receive no such provision. We pitch them back into society
with no realistic expectation that they will turn away from a life of
crime merely because they have spent a limited time in
prison.</hs_Para>

controversially, the plans include contracting out to the private and
voluntary sectors of the majority of work with offenders in the
community currently overseen by probation trusts. This rehabilitation
revolution agenda is in addition to a huge amount of change occurring
across other parts of the Ministry’s core business: changes in
legal aid entitlement and in the status of the Legal Services
Commission, which has moved physically into the headquarters building
in Petty France and is becoming an executive agency under closer
central control. The Ministry is closing a number of magistrates
courts. It has announced plans to transform youth custody by
introducing secure colleges. In family justice, Children and Family
Court Advisory and Support Service will transfer back to MOJ control
effectively from the Department for Education.</hs_Para>

and probation policy, I think we all share the same goal of reducing
offending and reoffending, which in turn will free resources currently
spent on keeping people in prison, to maintain progress and to have a
virtuous circle, rather than the vicious cycle that the system now has.
But we remain to be persuaded that the Ministry has at its centre the
right people to steer through this monumental transformation process.
Most importantly, does it have people with the commercial, technical
and legal skills necessary to embark upon a huge range of highly
complex and sometimes novel commercial
projects?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000487" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000487">The
transformation agenda coincides with a period when the Ministry, like
most Departments, is being tasked with making very large savings. By
the end of the spending review period—by the end of the 2014-15
financial year—it needs to make annual real-terms savings of
more than £2 billion against its spending review baseline.
According to the National Audit Office’s departmental overview,
the Ministry still has some way to go to meet its cost reduction
target. It aims to make front-line savings of around 10% over the
spending review period—it has already saved £244
million—and to reduce back-office costs by around a third, which
will contribute about £1 billion towards its
target.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000488" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000488">The

annually by 2014-15 and sentencing savings of £51 million by the
same year, from the changes introduced under the Legal Aid, Sentencing

Minister today gives an accelerated timetable for proposals yet to be
spelled out in relation to criminal legal add. Obviously, we will be
closely interested in what comes out. We have some indications that
things such as cost recovery from offenders will form part of that. Of
course, there has been more coverage today in reference to the

will make a personal comment, which I think is broadly shared by the
Committee. It is widely recognised that we cannot go one having the
most expensive legal aid system in the common law world with no real

something.</hs_Para>

this is a view that the Committee expressed strongly in a previous
report, the welfare and tribunal systems are part of the problem. The
extent of legal advice necessary in much of the tribunal system
indicates a weakness in the way services are delivered in the first
place, and in the tribunal system. We ought to have a system under
which people receive the right benefit to start with, and, if they do
not, the tribunal system should obtain directly the information
required to judge the matter correctly. Where Departments in particular
fail to achieve that objective and generate a lot of failed
appeals—failed on the Department’s side—they
should contribute to the cost. It should not be the MOJ budget that
bears the cost, but the Department that is not doing its job properly.
Change is required in this area.</hs_Para>

approximately £50 million per year are expected from changes to
criminal injuries compensation criteria, and there will be other,
lesser savings from the closure of courts and prisons, and from
rationalising the administration of the Ministry itself and its
sponsored bodies. Restructuring the NOMS headquarters is expected to
save £91 million. At the same time, there are cost implications
to changes that the Ministry is making. Is there any costing for the
plan to extend rehabilitation to short-sentenced prisoners? That is
welcome, but we have not seen any plans for how it will be paid for.

riots, but it may be fairer to describe them as riots in a number of
cities—that occurred in 2011 and generated significant

for the outcome of the pilots is to wait too long—he is
impatient to get on with developing payment by results. One has to ask,
however, how can the Ministry know that it is rolling out programmes
that will work and not waste money? How can it learn from the

financial management more seriously, including centralisation and
standardisation of processes and standardised forms. The LSC is
implementing a new IT system. Frankly, we were horrified when the LSC
told us that it could not possibly ask all solicitors to submit claims
online, in a world where you and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, and most other
people have to use online procedures. This is having to change, thank
goodness. The Ministry, however, still faces an uphill struggle with IT
legacy systems and its estates. In particular, in the courts many IT

of Justice has not yet shown itself able to achieve the full savings to
which it has committed, despite some tough decisions and some welcome
improvements. The Department is trying to achieve major change, a
process that always involves front-end costs with the hope of later

ineffective use of the prison system, where half of those released from
prison reoffend within a year—for those on short sentences the
figure is 60%. We should not lose sight of the long-term objective,
which is to cut crime and reduce reoffending to such an extent that
much less money has to be spent on the consequences of crime, whether
in the criminal justice system or beyond. For that to happen, we need
to spend money to ensure that people are not drawn into crime in the
first place. The troubled families programme and early-years education
are examples of what the Government are doing and need to build on if
we are to cut not only the costs of crime, but the misery it brings to
those of our constituents who are victims of crime. We are spending
their taxes on trying to keep them safe from crime. That money needs to
be spent wisely and that is why it is important that we debate it

not be the most eagerly awaited debate the Chamber has ever seen, but

at having less reoffending, more rehabilitation and a better court,
prisons and probation service, and all with less money. I do not envy
the Secretary of State’s position, but I know that in
endeavouring to meet the task he will consider all areas for savings.
One area being considered is funding work opportunities for inmates in
custody. It is right that we provide employment opportunities in
prisons. Taking part in work programmes helps offenders to retain
or—where it is lacking—adopt a work ethic, increases
work-based skills, makes inmates more employable on release and reduces
reoffending rates. We must ensure that it does not undercut companies
not working with offenders or take jobs away from the law-abiding, but
giving prisoners work opportunities in custody could help not just
inmates, but victims of crime. If the money earned by prisoners can be
shared between rehabilitation and payments to victims, there is a dual
gain to be made.</hs_Para>

only prison work schemes, however, that provide these opportunities.
The National Offender Management Service has been identified as a
department that could undergo further restructuring. Managing the 
<?notus-xml column=875?>rehabilitation of offenders is one of the most crucial aspects of the
Ministry’s work, and the MOJ is right that someone is not best
placed to help prevent reoffending just because they are employed by
it. Very often, private companies or charities can assist with the
rehabilitation of offenders, so it is worth considering—and, in
suitable cases, adopting—the tendering of work currently carried
out by the probation service. If payment by results actually gets
results, it is worth pursuing, and giving a financial incentive to
those who carry out rehabilitative work can only help to reduce
reoffending rates. For the first time, we can say that if offending
rates are not reduced, taxpayers’ money will not be spent. That
seems right to me.</hs_Para>

reassured by the Secretary of State’s comments to the Justice
Committee last week, when he confirmed that the probation service could
also tender for contracts to work with offenders. That is right. The
public want less crime; what is less important to them is who achieves
it. Whether it is the probation service, a charity or private company
matters little; what is vital is that whoever helps offenders to stay
on the straight and narrow is successful in that important quest.
Payment by results is potentially groundbreaking for the MOJ, but I
concede that the devil will be in the detail. We need to ensure that
cherry-picking cannot prevail, for example, and that the system

Governments have tried to tackle the so-called revolving door of

There are two approaches to the problem. We can either curtail short

having any short-term prisoners, or we can 
<?notus-xml column=876?>work with such offenders, both in custody and on release. I support the
latter approach. It has not been done in the past, but the commitment
now to ensure the supervision of such offenders on release is the right

longer courthouses, but restaurants, accommodation and so
on—I think one is a Zizzi. They have changed beyond all
recognition. Although it is sad to see that happening to old
courthouses, it is right for the Department continuously to assess the
value for money it provides for the taxpayer. It has a difficult
balancing act to perform, between the value for money it
provides on one side and the interests of justice on the other.

virtual courts system has been highlighted as a good way for the
Department to save money. However, I would urge caution on this
approach. Virtual courts can actually cost more. We therefore need an
intelligent and targeted use of the system, rather than a blanket
approach. I am probably the only Member of Parliament who has used the
virtual courts system—I guess I should declare an
interest—and I have seen not only its strengths and weaknesses,
but its expense to the Department. I am pleased that the Department is
also looking at different ways in which magistrates courts can operate.
It makes sense to allow them to keep more cases for themselves. That
will enable savings to be made without compromising justice. In limited
circumstances, magistrates can already sentence adult offenders to 12
months. If we trust them to give such sentences for some cases, why not
for all cases? In some courts, the same magistrates who can sentence a

cite anecdotes and examples of very good practice, but anecdotes remain
just that. There is no systemic sharing of good practice. These
opportunities should be assessed, evaluated and made available for all
the offenders who need them, but the truth is that they are not.
According to the Public Accounts Committee, senior officials at the MOJ
have a poor record of managing commissioning, so I am not sure about
trying to transform the service through that method. At the moment,
there is not enough evidence of a good track record to be able to put
much confidence in their ability to do that. The problem with the
reforms is that they are all of structure rather than of practice. The
Government are rightly disappointed in reoffending rates of around 50%,
but for nearly three years they have done nothing of any substance to
improve the
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000533" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000533">Let
me deal now with payment by results. Instead of importing a failed
policy from the Department for Work and Pensions to the MOJ, why not
take a closer look at what works in preventing reoffending? For all the
academic studies and Government data, the truth is that there is
precious little understanding of what really makes a difference. Plenty
of organisations are prepared to tell us that what they are doing works
and are prepared to buy reports to prove it, but there is very little
objective analysis of outcomes of programmes and interventions. As a
result of scrapping probation service PBR pilots, the Government are
failing to use evidence that they should have to help them to decide
where to spend their money. When the Secretary of State cancelled the
pilots, he said, “Sometimes you just have to go with your
beliefs.” There we have it: Chris Grayling, Secretary of State
for Justice, our very own mystic Meg.</hs_Para>

is not good enough. Interventions in health, for example, are assessed.
They are monitored and evaluated before public money is used to provide
them, and the same should apply to interventions in criminal justice.
The rate of reoffending is stubbornly high, so why are the Government
not doing what can be done in health? Why are they not asking for
interventions to be evaluated and funded only if they prove to be
effective, and then insisting that only what works should be delivered
in our prisons and in community sentences? There is too much okay
practice, and too little sharing of the very best
ideas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000535" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000535">We
need to know which are the best interventions, which are the best
providers of services, and which are the best prisons. We need a

investing in ways of assessing the performance of establishments, based
on the profile of inmates entering prisons and their future
reoffending. Establishments should be accountable for their
performance: the best should be given greater freedom to innovate, and
the worst should 
<?notus-xml column=880?>be closed down. Farming out the supervision of medium-risk offenders to
private sector providers with no idea whether that will work any better
than the current arrangements is reckless, ideologically driven and
dangerous, and the Government should think again. They are not showing
any interest in practice on the ground, but are preoccupied with

been a renewed focus on improving financial management throughout the
Department, which means that it is set to reduce spending by about
£2.5 billion each year over the spending review period. It will
achieve that by means of a range of measures to drive down the costs to
the taxpayer. On the efficiency side, that has included rationalisation
of the Ministry of Justice head office, streamlining our structures and
processes, and rationalisation of the court estate. We have also
delivered savings through policy reforms, including the reforms of
legal aid funding—which have been mentioned—and the
criminal injuries compensation scheme. As the Select Committee has
acknowledged, the Department has protected front-line services by
making the bulk of its savings—some 60%—through ways of
working more efficiently. The Department also laid its 2011-12 accounts
unqualified, before the summer recess and ahead of the timetable it had
originally planned. That demonstrates a significant improvement on
previous performance, but there is room for further improvement and the

Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed raised two specific points
about the estimates, the first of which related to the explanation for
the £159 million extra for the National Offender
Management Service. As he will appreciate, a number of pressures that
arise during the year were not part of the MOJ baseline used in the
spending review negotiations. Such additional cost pressures will
include not only inflationary impacts, but funding for voluntary staff
exits—he will understand that there has been considerable change
on that front in the past 12
months.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000543" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000543">My
right hon. Friend’s other point related to the impairments to
the court and prison estate. As he knows, the Valuation Office Agency
carries out regular reviews of that estate, and the recent downturns in
the property market mean that that re-evaluation has obviously had an
impact on the Department’s budget. The figure of £520
million or so is substantially explained by that change.</hs_Para>

little about the justice system we are trying to design. Creating a
transformed justice system requires the Department to go beyond
improving its financial management. If we are to construct a justice
system that punishes the guilty, protects liberties and rehabilitates
offenders, the MOJ needs to continue to work at pace to drive an
ambitious reform agenda. Despite the determination of those working
within the justice system, there is too much litigation, too many
people are reoffending and too much money is spent on systems. So by
2015 the Department will provide services in a completely different
way. We are committed to transforming rehabilitation to reduce
reoffending—I will discuss that in some detail later— to
driving down costs across the prison estate to ensure that it delivers
maximum value for taxpayers; making sure that the youth justice estate
is appropriate and cost-effective; rationalising the court estate and
identifying further efficiencies across the criminal justice system;
and continuing to drive down the cost of legal aid and ensure it is
focused on those cases that require it. That is what transforming
justice looks
like.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030539000545" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0002.htm#13030539000545">One
of my top priorities within that is the transformation of
rehabilitation. That has had a good deal of attention in this debate,
so let me deal with the points that have been made. As the House knows,
we have consulted on proposals that could open up approximately
£1 billion of services to a diverse market; give greater scope
for providers to innovate, with payment by results acting as an
incentive to focus on rehabilitating offenders, as my hon. Friend the

with some of the points made by the Chairman of the Select Committee.
He raised the concern that he and his Committee have about having
national as opposed to local commissioning, and I appreciate that that
represents a change. It is explained simply by the need to ensure that
the necessary expertise and abilities to commission on a
payment-by-results basis are held by those doing the commissioning. We
think it is difficult to see how that can be done on a local basis, but
we think it is important, just as he does, that there are local
elements in the commissioning process and that local intelligence is
included in deciding what needs to be commissioned. We want to design a
system—I hope he will see this coming through the
process—that enables us to include that local understanding as
well as greater expertise on payment by results. He is also right to
say that we must design a system that allows voluntary sector
organisations to participate actively.</hs_Para>

Alan Beith:</Member></B> I am grateful to the Minister for seeking to
clarify this point. Let us analyse it a bit further. If the local
partnerships that know the local situation best can design what the
contract should be about, it is perfectly proper that they should turn
to a national body that has expertise in how to include the
measurements of results and so on. I would be worried, however, if the
national commissioning body was also the body that said, “What
you need in Blackburn is this.” That decision should be taken
locally, even if the expertise must be drawn on from a central
body.</hs_Para>

to the voluntary sector organisations, on which we have rightly spent a
bit of time in the debate. There are probably two areas in which we
need to be careful to ensure that the design of the system is right.
The first is in the assessment of the bids that are made for the
rehabilitative work that we are discussing. When we consider the bids,
we will want to be satisfied not just about their quality and price but
about the sustainability of the relationships brought forward as part
of the bids. We anticipate that a large number of bids will include
more than one organisation and will often include smaller voluntary and
community sector organisations. We will want to be persuaded when
assessing those bids that the smaller voluntary and community sector
organisations will have a sustainable future in the course of the
contract. We will want to ensure that the design is right and that we
keep our eyes on what is happening in contract management. It is partly
about assessing the bids when they come in and partly about assessing
how they are implemented over the lifetime of the
contract.</hs_Para>

the truth that he has no idea at all of the number of organisations

traditional fondness for central control, but we are not a fan of that.
She is right that there is an issue about what is likely to be called
“bid candy” in this context, but what she is missing is
that that is precisely why it is important for us to consider not just
the initial cost and attractiveness of the bid but the sustainability
of what might be called the supply chain. We want to design that into
the system for precisely the reasons she has given.</hs_Para>

on to the issue raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Berwick-upon-Tweed about prisoners who receive sentences of 12 months
or less. There is broad agreement when the subject is raised that it is
a good idea to bring within the ambit of rehabilitative services those
offenders who receive such sentences, as at the moment very little
provision is made for them. He is right to say that it will come at a
cost, but it is difficult to be precise about the cost of that
provision, which was another point raised by the hon. Member for
Darlington (Jenny Chapman). Until we have finished designing a
provision, we will not know precisely what it will cost.</hs_Para>

aspect that needs to be clarified by the design process is the
sanctions regime. Part of the cost will be incurred by deciding what to
do if someone who is under such a sentence and who will be expected to
participate in rehabilitation after that sentence does not comply. We
must go through a number of processes in the design of the scheme
before we can be more precise about the costs, but we confidently
expect the cost of incorporating those 46,000 extra offenders will be
covered by the savings we can make by competing rehabilitative services
for medium and lower-risk offenders. That is one of the central
advantages of taking that course.</hs_Para>

good enough results. The costs of youth custody are very high, yet

However, we recognise that there is a need to carry on looking at
how our estate is most effectively utilised, and we will

work, rather than to be idle. We are looking at both things, but the
prison system needs to deliver more hours and a more regularised

not quite so simple to design in the system: a reduction in

enough homes in this country for a long time. The basic requirement is
about 250,000 homes a year, based on household formation, plus an
increasing number to make up for the backlog of past under-investment.
Since the report was published, we have had the figures for housing
starts in 2012. There were 115,620 housing completions, up 1% on the
previous year, and 98,280 housing starts, an 11% reduction. Therefore,

building in the mid-2000s, we were building a maximum of only 170,000
homes a year, which was not sufficient, either. The private
house-building industry has never managed to build more than 150,000

planning was the obstacle to growth. We accepted the point, which the
Local Government Association has made again recently, that there are
400,000 planning permissions for new homes that have not been
activated. Getting at those is a major challenge that we should talk
about. I do not believe that the measures in the Growth and
Infrastructure Bill will deal with that problem, although that did not
form part of our report because it has been published since our

Les Sturch, the director of planning at Sheffield council, but this is
also happening in other councils. Because of market changes in housing,
many developers are saying that although certain sites have—or
could get—planning permission because the land is owned for
housing in a local plan, they are not developable in economic terms.
Local authorities therefore have to revisit their local plans and look
for new housing sites in more favourable areas. That is a real problem
and will put pressure on green open spaces because developers will say,
“These sites are much more attractive to develop in the current
climate.” Ministers must address that problem in the planning
system, or else Members will be knocking on ministerial doors and
saying, “Why do I

in our recommendations is that, if there is a limited amount of public
money, it can sometimes work for the best by assisting to leverage in
private funding and by providing some guarantee for that private

to the point the hon. Member for Meon Valley (George Hollingbery)
raised a few moments ago, the Committee recognised that there are a
number of ways to get more leverage from housing association assets,
and people gave evidence on what they were doing in that regard. It is
interesting that only yesterday the G15, the 15 big housing
associations in London, made an announcement about a common investment
vehicle to raise money to enter the private sector housing market. That
is one way in which the solidity of their balance sheets is helping
them to raise money for a purpose that should, in the longer term, be
self-funding. These are interesting ideas.</hs_Para>

also looked at the housing grant. The so-called grant is sat on the
books of housing associations and is counted as a debt. Changing that
to a genuine grant or equity could release a lot of funds for
investment, and is clearly supported by the housing association
movement. We suggested that the Government look at that, because we
recognised that there could be problems with overloading some
associations in some circumstances with too much debt. Nevertheless, we
thought that in principle it was an idea worth considering. We hope 
<?notus-xml column=896?>Ministers will look at it, because some of the stronger, more robust
housing associations might want to pursue it. We have to be cautious,
however. What might be right for associations such as the G15 in
London, where the private market is buoyant and rents are appropriately
high, will not be right in other parts of the country where there is
not the same ability to leverage funds. We have to be careful and
recognise that a one-size-fits-all solution is not necessarily
available.</hs_Para>

is housing the only form of investment that is controlled beyond
prudential rules? Why is it different? It is a ring-fenced account. It
should be in the other direction: it is a safer form of borrowing for
authorities. It is not only the Local Government Association, but
councils such as Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith
and Fulham that are saying, “Get rid of the artificial cap that
has been put on housing revenue account borrowing. Why is it there? Why
can we not rely on the prudential rules that are in place for all other
forms of local authority borrowing?” Ministers always have

Friend is absolutely right. She anticipates the “Let’s

ALMOs, the LGA and the Chartered Institute of Housing, among others. It
makes the point that if the cap was lifted the amount of borrowing
local authorities could enter into would rise from £2.8 billion
to £7 billion. That would allow the building of 60,000 homes and
put a lot of people into work. It just seems to be a simple solution.

possibility—we did not say they should definitely do
it—of changing Government borrowing rules in respect of the

the proposed new models of governance for arm’s length
management organisations, which, with more tenant involvement and more
co-operative-type structures, could borrow in the private markets, as
housing associations do. We also made recommendations concerning the
right to buy—about trying to ensure one-for-one replacements and
about how the Government could help facilitate that—and giving
more freedom to local authorities in terms of discounts in areas of
great housing stress and to housing associations that might want to
enter the right to buy, where they think it right for their
portfolios—that comes back to the point about using portfolios
in a way that benefits housing associations. We face the great
challenge of moving to a better situation in which we subsidise
building, not benefits. That is a long-term problem going back to the
1980s—and even earlier—and the change from subsidising
the building of homes to subsidising the high rents of people living in
those homes. That is a major challenge for all of
us.</hs_Para>

market housing production it is more difficult to build social housing.

Betts:</Member></B> There is a problem when market housing is not being
built. It is because of the over-reliance on section 106 housing in the
past. I know the Government have proposals to encourage, if not force,
local authorities to renegotiate the terms of 106 agreements to make
market housing more viable. I have reservations about that—it
was not something the Select Committee considered in
particular—although we recommended that any changes to 106
agreements be left to local discretion. The hon. Gentleman makes a
valid point, however, about the comfort of relying on section 106
agreements to provide housing. There are two problems with that: first,
when the market collapses, there is not the alternative balance of
social housing to replace it in the construction industry, so that
element falls at the same time, and secondly social houses are not
necessarily needed in exactly the same places as market
houses.</hs_Para>

made a recommendation about self-build—or rather
self-contracting, which is what we probably saw at the massive site at
in Almere. When I was told, “You’re going to see a
self-build”, I expected to see the teacher, the bank manager and
the postman in their wellies and overalls on a Sunday morning digging
away and laying the bricks, but that was not what we saw. We saw a
local authority site on which 
<?notus-xml column=898?>individuals had bought plots at a given price and with limited
restrictions on what they could do—some areas were reserved for
bungalows and others had a three-storey height limit, and obviously
there was a boundary to the site. These individuals had either
contracted a local builder or designed their own homes on the internet,
as we saw at one place we visited. In effect, they had contracted their
own homes. That seemed a brilliant way forward. I see no reason why we
cannot build 50,000 self-build homes in this country, instead of the
10,000 we build at present. That could go a long way to meeting the
gap. We found that people were satisfied because they had the homes
they wanted with the money they had. They did not have to have
something off the shelf that did not really meet their needs. Their
homes were being built for only 75% of the cost of a similar home from
a volume builder.</hs_Para>

clearly challenges in getting the whole thing up and running. I welcome
the Government’s £30 million of funding to try to
encourage such activity. How far have we got? I have not yet been
invited to the turning of the first sod on such a site, let alone the
first home to be finally built and opened, so I suspect we have not
made as much progress as we might have. I think all members of the
Committee who went were enthused by self-build and thought it was a
good way forward. It needs a push from the Government and local
authorities to release land—it might need the Ministry of
Defence to release some—but it seemed an excellent way forward.
Self-build also helps small builders, who have been hit more by the
recession of the last few years than the volume builders have, because
they cannot get funding from the banks and face real difficulties. The
challenge with self-contracting is to get the building societies and
the banks to understand that they can lend money on a house that does
not yet exist and—because people have to live in one home while
the other is being built—to put bridging arrangements in place.
In the end, however, people end up with something that costs only 75%
of its market value, so we really ought to push on
self-build.</hs_Para>

obviously an incredibly important issue for us all, not just for
getting future generations somewhere decent to live, but for this
country’s future economic prosperity. Without substantial
improvement in our building rates and the production of new housing
supply, our economy will struggle to grow, and we need it to grow. The
Chartered Institute of Housing released a report just this month that
said that home ownership was unachievable for many young people. The
report suggested that since 1992 it is down 67% among those 
<?notus-xml column=899?>aged 25 to 34. That is a pretty stunning statistic. The average age of
the first-time buyer is now approaching 40, at 37.5. It now takes 83
months to save the deposit required to buy a house, compared with the
30 months it took 10 years ago.</hs_Para>

Government schemes are helping. They have been slow to start, but they

uncertainty has also meant that potential buyers have been unwilling to

moment, is this really the time to take on, say, £200,000 of

30% up on the same time last year. The progress is definitely slow, but
there is some encouragement. Given the fact that taking on a debt is a

Denmead in my constituency have become pilots for the

Winchester city council has received £1.5 million under that

just shy of £500,000. This financial boost, allowing councils to
invest directly in new homes, has also benefited the two unitary
authorities of Southampton and Portsmouth, which have

Those are only a few examples from the package of measures included in

encouraged to invest. Increased investment from large financial
institutions and pension funds may not be a panacea, but could make a

associations should take steps to encourage institutional investment.
Vehicles such as Real Estate Investment Trusts should be revamped to
encourage investment in housing. The Government should also consider

second theme is the importance of local authorities and how much more
can be done by them and by housing associations. In Hampshire, we are
starting to see local authorities make a real difference in housing
provision. In February, Isle of Wight council introduced a scheme to
help first-time buyers, while Southampton 
<?notus-xml column=902?>has an estate regeneration project that is making great strides. Real
differences are emerging in housing starts and in some areas schemes
are proving seriously successful—in fact, occasionally, too
successful. I have not encountered this personally, but I have recently
been told that Wigan council had to close its £1 million scheme
to help first-time buyers after only a month because all its funding
had been used up. Further afield, the Scottish Government are
introducing a £20 million scheme to help people with shared
ownership. This is another way of incentivising supply that should not
be ignored. The Government need to get behind local authorities and
create a repository of knowledge and good practice that can be shared
right across the local government community. I have no doubt that the
Local Government Association will be involved in work of that
sort.</hs_Para>

Committee talks about two areas that could make a real difference. It
makes suggestions on looking at increasing the borrowing limits for
housing revenue accounts, as well as on promoting the right to buy. The
Select Committee Chairman has covered the increase in borrowing limits
reasonably thoroughly so I shall not go back there, but the latest
figures show a slight increase in right-to-buy requests in Southampton,
Portsmouth, Fareham and Winchester. Much remains to be done in this
area, but we discussed at some length in the Select Committee the need
for one-for-one replacement to be guaranteed in certain circumstances,
particularly in small rural villages. If we do not replace a social
house with another social house—and nowadays, frankly, it might
be the only social house in a small village—there will be no
social housing left at all, which is an important issue.</hs_Para>

level is falling. According to the DCLG’s own statistics, in
2012 we started only 98,000 homes. That is not just massively below the
230,000 level that is generally recognised to be necessary, but 11%
down on the inadequate levels achieved in 2011. An already bad
situation is getting worse, not better. According to the latest figures
from the National House Building Council—I received my copy only
yesterday:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13030546000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0003.htm#13030546000119">“NHBC

why that is happening. A number of contributory factors have already
been identified, but I think that four are fundamentally important. The
first, on which the hon. Member for Meon Valley focused, is a lack of
confidence in the market. People are very cautious about investing at
the moment, which is hardly surprising given the state of the economy
and their nervousness about whether they will have a job, and also
their nervousness about whether the house that they are thinking of
buying will be worth as much in a year or two. Prices in many parts of
the country—I do not include inner London, where the
circumstances are probably rather exceptional—prices have been
iffy. In some places they have declined and in others they have shown
modest growth, but there is little ground for real confidence. I am not
advocating a return to the hyper-inflation in house prices that we
encountered during the booms of the 1970s, 1980s and the noughties,
because they were unsustainable, but at a time when there is no
confidence at all, it will be difficult to get the market going because
people simply will not invest.</hs_Para>

when people are prepared to take the risk, they face real difficulties
in obtaining mortgage finance. It is a classic instance of our reacting
to over-generous lending during the boom years by allowing the pendulum
to swing too far in the opposite direction, and to get stuck in a
position where it becomes a serious obstacle. Anyone who has looked
closely at the figures will have noted that many people who are
currently struggling with high rents in the private sector could
probably support the cost of a mortgage easily if they were able to get
one, but the demands in terms of deposit requirements or the interest
rates charged in the case of high loan-to-value mortgages make that
impossible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030546000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0003.htm#13030546000033">Yesterday
the hon. Member for Rugby (Mark Pawsey) and I attended the launch of
that much-respected document “UK Housing Review”. Looking
through the rather voluminous set of useful housing data, I spotted the
latest figures relating to the current mortgage cost-to-income ratios
for first-time buyers. They are at a very low level: 17.6%, one of the
lowest levels in the last 30 years. The 
<?notus-xml column=904?>figure was 24.6% in 2007, at the end of a boom, and 26.9% in 1990, at
the end of another boom. It is not that house buyers need a
disproportionate level of income to pay a mortgage, if they can get
one—as I have said, some are paying rather more in rent than it
would cost them to service a mortgage—but that we have to find a
means of helping people to obtain a mortgage if they are prevented from
getting
one.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_05_PT_1/A5317D182B1CE117E1F09307BD89531E90C33EEC" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="5 March 2013">Tuesday

there has been a drastic fall in public investment. The Chair of the
Select Committee highlighted the Government’s decision, as part
of the spending review announcement early in their lifetime, to cut
spending on social and affordable housing by 60%. Output has,
inevitably, plummeted, with housing association starts in the latest 12
months totalling just 19,500, which is 23% down on the equivalent
period for 2010-11. Affordable housing is doing worse than the housing
market overall, which is obviously a particular concern for all those
people who depend on obtaining accommodation at a reasonable
rate.</hs_Para>

element in this overall package is the very uncertain planning
environment, which is entirely of the Government’s creation.
They decided to tear up the previous planning framework and to create a
new planning system. Many of us warned before the last election that
not only was that likely to cause uncertainty, which would be damaging
to development and to confidence, but it would open the door to an
awful lot of nimby instincts among people who have, for a variety of
reasons, been opposed to new housing development. I am afraid that the
evidence clearly shows that that is what has happened. Councils are
planning 272,000 fewer homes than would previously have been expected,
according to Tetlow King Planning, and the level of new planning
consents going through remains massively below the level required to
meet the country’s needs. So there is a problem with planning as
well as with the other factors that I have
identified.</hs_Para>

Hollingbery:</Member></B> I am wondering whether the right hon.
Gentleman might reflect a little more on those remarks. The provisions
of the national planning policy framework make it clear that if a local
council does not have a five-year housing supply, a permission is
almost certain to be granted, wherever it is. I have just spent three
interesting weeks in Eastleigh, where an application was allowed in the
middle of the campaign for exactly that reason. Does he suspect that
one reason for the number of planning applications being down is that
lots of developers know that they cannot actually build the houses so
applying for those permissions is a little futile at the moment? When
they do want them, the NPPF’s requirement on having a five-year
housing supply is making sure that they
happen.</hs_Para>

Raynsford:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly fair
point, but I put it to him that confidence is the crucial element in
planning. If developers are to do the very expensive work necessary to
put a planning application together, they have to feel confident that
they have a reasonable prospect of success. A very uncertain climate
has been created by the abolition, or partial abolition, of the
regional spatial strategies; the lengthy row about what the NPPF would
say; and the subsequent chopping and changing that have taken place,
including the ill-considered measures in the ill-named Growth and 
<?notus-xml column=905?>Infrastructure Bill, which, once again, tinker with the planning
procedure only months after it was put in place. That inevitably
creates uncertainty, to which we can add the uncertainty about whether
councils have got their local plans together in time. There has rightly
been a lot of pressure on them to get their plans in place, but some
have been less good than others at doing that. There is also clear
pressure coming from various sources; the hon. Gentleman will have
noticed in the context of the Eastleigh by-election that some members
of his party were clearly keen not to agree to the particular planning
for the housing scheme to which he referred. In that situation, there
will inevitably be less scope for securing planning consent—or
less incentive to apply for planning consent—than would
otherwise be the case.</hs_Para>

Hollingbery:</Member></B> I ought to point out that I actually spoke
against that particular application, although I have not done the same
in respect of many applications in my own district. The point remains
that Eastleigh borough council has not got an extant local plan; its
last one expired and its new one has not yet been approved. It does not
have an identified five-year land supply and the NPPF’s
provision about having one came into effect immediately, so the council
recognised that it had absolutely no option but to grant the
permission. So the mechanisms are in place, and most councils will find
it difficult to resist such applications
now.</hs_Para>

place, the housing output was substantially higher than we are seeing
now. Government Members sometimes forget that from 2000 to 2007, before
the impact of the recession, there was continuing year-on-year growth
in the supply of housing. It reached 180,000 new starts in 2007, since
when it fell—not because of planning but because of the
recession—so that we are now seeing starts of fewer than
100,000. I would not say that the regional spatial strategies were
entirely satisfactory, but the output of housing under them was
substantially higher than it is
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030546000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0003.htm#13030546000044">I
have spent too long, I think, on those issues and I need to move on.
Behind the statistics I have talked about are a huge number of human
tragedies: all the young families unable to get a home within their
means, 
<?notus-xml column=906?>all the people trapped in hopelessly overcrowded or squalid conditions,
the huge numbers languishing on local authority housing waiting lists
and the number of homeless households, which has been rising again

down.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030546000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0003.htm#13030546000045">Quite
apart from the human consequences, there are economic consequences,
too. As our economy is in difficulty— everyone who has spoken
has acknowledged that housing has a critical role to play in helping to
boost the economy—we must consider ways of helping to increase
the output of housing. What should we do? First, we must ensure that
the economic climate is one in which people can feel more confident
about investing, in which people are willing to buy homes and in which
house builders are willing to invest more in development. That is
fundamental. Whatever else we do will make some difference, but it will
not make an adequate difference if the economy is not strong. We need
to turn around the economy first of all.</hs_Para>

must ensure that housing is directly assisted by measures that can
ensure that confidence returns and that houses are provided by
developers and bought by people who want to get a mortgage. I have
talked about the tight restrictions on mortgage availability and the
fact that it seems to me that the pendulum has swung too far in the
other direction after the boom years when the restrictions were
excessively loose. We must send a powerful message that the test should
be whether people have the means and the capacity to repay the debt,
rather than the loan-to-value percentage that is too often used in a
mechanistic way by lenders to determine credit-worthiness. If we
focused more on people’s ability to repay, we could relax some
of the restrictions that prevent people without the adequate means for
a deposit from getting into owner-occupation.</hs_Para>

to do a lot more to assist those people who cannot afford outright home
ownership but would be happy to buy a share in a property. Over 30-odd
years, various schemes for shared ownership, shared equity and low-cost
home ownership have had some success, but they have tended to be
marginal. Although NewBuy and Firstbuy are perfectly admirable schemes
in their way, they are still relatively marginal. The Prime Minister
talked about NewBuy helping 100,000 people when it was launched, so
when we hear from the hon. Member for Meon Valley that some 3,000 homes
have been delivered so far that puts it in context. It is important and
significant, but it is relatively marginal.</hs_Para>

ensure that there are other options to help people who are not looking
for a new home purchase. I am cautious about the idea of extending the
NewBuy formula to existing homes. I think about—I am sorry, it
is one of the problems of being old—a scheme known as DIYSO,
do-it-yourself shared ownership. Those who have long memories of
housing will recall it. It was very popular. People liked the idea of
being able to go out and select their own home and get a
shared-ownership mortgage on that home. It did, however, prove
extremely expensive. It also had an element of risk because there was
no guarantee that it would be a newly completed home that was subject
to the various checks that apply to a new home. In some cases the
properties that were being bought under the DIYSO scheme were not
suitable. I can hear the attraction of the message. I read it,
like the hon. Member for Meon Valley, in today’s 
<?notus-xml column=907?><I>Financial Times</I>, but I caution against putting too
many eggs in that basket. However, it is important that we renovate
existing homes and make them available for people, possibly through
shared-ownership/shared-equity means, as well as building new
homes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030546000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0003.htm#13030546000049">I
shall talk briefly about energy efficiency and housing. This is an area
where there has been a great deal of poor information, inadequate
information and prejudice. I feel very nervous that the voices that are
hostile to improving the energy efficiency of housing are getting in
the ascendancy. Some rather pernicious views are being put forward that
somehow this is putting an impossible burden on house builders. The
example that I will take is a simple one. It is a scheme known as
AIMC4, which has been put together with the participation of some of
the largest house builders, including Barratt. The purpose was to
demonstrate that they could build a code level 4 home under the code
for sustainable homes for no more than the cost of code level 3 home.

agree very much with the hon. Member for Meon Valley about the
importance of housing for older people and providing them with
appropriate housing which, in turn, can release homes that are
currently under-occupied. There is something rather unfortunate about a
Government demonising many tenants in social housing who are occupying
one bedroom more than they might need, on some pretty tight definitions
of need, when two children of the same sex are expected to share a
bedroom right up to the age of 16, and two children of different sexes
under the age of 10 are expected to share a single bedroom, so no

Can he tell me whether elderly people are exempt from those rules in
the private rented sector? They are not. That is the point that I was
making. If this was a serious policy to try to reduce under-occupation,

<?notus-xml column=908?>it would apply more widely, as I said, and it would also apply to people
over retirement age. The rules being implemented by the Government
apply only to people below retirement age, even though the Government
know that it is predominantly among older people that under-occupation
is a problem. I will be quite open and say that the right policy would
have been to consider a deduction, but only if two factors apply.
First, there should be an option to move to smaller accommodation, but
in many cases there simply is not that option and it is grossly unfair
to cut people’s benefit where they have no chance of moving to
smaller accommodation. Secondly, it should apply only where people have
two bedrooms more than they require because of the tight space and
occupancy standards that apply. That should apply to everyone,
including those over retirement age. That would be a far more effective
policy in achieving the objective of getting better use of our stock
than the policy that the Government are pursuing. I make that point in
addition to my general point about providing more suitable
accommodation for older people in order to free up accommodation that
is
under-occupied.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030546000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0003.htm#13030546000055">I
support what the Chair of the Select Committee said about removing the

scope to borrow more under the prudential borrowing regime, when there
are safeguards in place through that regime, and when local government
debt is at an historically low level, it is absurd to deny the option
of creating the means to get further investment in new housing. There
should certainly be more support for that and a removal of the cap.
There should also be a willingness to engage with housing associations
about what happens in the post-2015 world, because they are literally
running out of time and running out of scope for continuing
development. It will be an utter tragedy if one of the more successful
organisations producing housing in this country in recent years simply

come now to the strange beast of the new homes bonus. This is a rather
expensive element of Government policy. Already it has cost £1.3
billion. Some of that has been taken from Peter to pay Paul because
some of it is recycled from local authorities to other local
authorities, but about three quarters of a billion is additional
Government money. That £1.3 billion will rise to
£3.3 billion because the scheme involves payment over
six years. That commitment to £3.3 billion is a lot of money
and, at the present rate of growth, the scheme will involve more
expenditure than the total Government investment on affordable homes
over the lifetime of this Parliament, so it is worth examining how it
is operating. I have already referred to the disastrous and declining
level of new housing starts, so it is clear that the scheme is not
affecting those. The total level of new planning consents last year was
115,000, and in the first three quarters of 2012, 95,000. It seems
likely that it might reach a level of about 125,000 when we have the
figures for 2012, but that compares with 212,000 in 2007 and 134,000 in
2010. The Government will have been presiding over a lower level of
consents for residential planning than ever before, which is
extraordinary when they are spending £3.3 billion in supposed
incentives to encourage more planning
consents.</hs_Para>

let us look at that in a year’s time, when we will have more

something that is supposedly, to use the Government’s own
phrase, a “powerful incentive” for authorities to give
planning consent for new housing. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says
about his local authority, but I am afraid that the figures do not
support his optimism. For the 17 authorities that have received the
largest amount of new homes bonus—this is all based on an answer
to a parliamentary question I asked the Housing Minister earlier this
year—the level of major residential schemes getting planning
consent in 2011-12 was 607, compared with 969 in 2005-06, a 37%
reduction and 10% below the previous year, so there was no growth at
all. It does not look convincing for a very large outlay of public
money. The £3.3 billion, if it were applied to direct
investment in new housing, would certainly be likely to achieve far
better consequences.</hs_Para>

Government inherited. Of course, there will be many areas relating to
the financing of new housing where the Government would wish to spend
more to achieve more, but we must recognise that at present that is
simply not possible. Housing is important not only for providing homes
for our people, but for our economy. The previous Housing Minister
reminded us that every 100,000 houses built adds 1% to GDP. We

entirely appropriate that the Government have brought
forward schemes to stimulate owner-occupation, of which three are key:
NewBuy, First Buy and Funding for Lending. The Select Committee report
suggested that the Government should review NewBuy after its first year
of operation. When I talk to house builders, I sense that a degree of

his car and met all his expenditure out of savings. He is unable to get
a mortgage because, not having borrowed, he is unable to demonstrate

years, as the sector has moved from accounting for 9% of housing to
18%. Interestingly, the Chartered Institute of Housing has suggested in
its presentations that that figure could rise to 25%. I accept that, in
many instances, renters would prefer to be in other tenure—they
would prefer to be an owner-occupier or in social rented
accommodation—but private renting has its benefits, particularly

of the issues we discovered when taking evidence is that institutions
are not keen to invest directly in the residential sector because of
the amount of management and administration that looking after
residential property entails. It is striking that institutions invest
in commercial buildings because of the lower management costs involved.
They send out a rent demand once a quarter, for example, and are able
to pass on repair obligations to occupiers. A tie-up between housing
associations and institutional investors might be possible. Housing
associations are very good and have demonstrated over many years a
strong track record in managing social rented accommodation. I do not
see why they cannot offer their services to institutional investors,
whereby the investor owns a stock of private rented accommodation and
tells the housing association, “You’ve got the skills and
the experience to manage it.” That is a business opportunity for
the housing association sector, if it wishes to take it up. I would be

remarks on the social housing sector need to have regard to the changes
to the Government’s welfare system, which were referred to by
the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich. I will draw attention
to some striking figures. There are currently 2 million households in
England on housing waiting lists and 
<?notus-xml column=913?>250,000 families living in overcrowded accommodation. Under the last
Government, local authority housing waiting lists rose from 1 million
in April 1997 to 1.8 million in April 2010. However, nearly
a third of working-age social tenants on housing benefits are living in
accommodation that is too big for their needs. That equates to nearly 1
million spare rooms that are being paid for by the taxpayer, denying
many hundreds of thousands of people the chance to house their family
adequately. I am sure we all agree that every family deserves the
chance to be housed comfortably. Hard-working taxpayers, many of whom
face tough choices of their own, will have a view about these
properties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030546000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0003.htm#13030546000080"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Slaughter" PimsId="4804" UID="13030546000153" xid="837" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0003.htm#13030546000153">Mr

disappointed he is not here now, because I regret that the Government
have recently been tinkering with the system after the implementation
of the NPPF. That has not been particularly helpful. Changes bring a
degree of uncertainty and it is important to allow the new planning
system to bed in. Some of the Government’s proposals, such as
changing the regulations on converting properties from office to
residential use, and changing permitted development rights regarding
the size of extensions and, more recently, the right to light, are not
helpful. I understand what the Government are trying to do; the aim is
clearly a further freeing up of the planning system, but I fear that
some of the changes may be counter-productive and will not lead to the
growth we need in the sector. In fact, they could lead to more
uncertainty in planning.</hs_Para>

(Mr Raynsford) and the Chairman of the Communities and Local Government
Committee, and that is as near as I will come to pretending expertise
in my comments. Instead, I will give a consumer’s view of this
subject, based on my experience as a constituency MP. My constituency
admittedly has some of the highest housing costs in the country
and—not unrelated to that—some of the greatest housing
stresses and needs, but it is not untypical of London and other
high-value areas, particularly in the south of the country.</hs_Para>

who has spent 20 years trying to build housing that is affordable to
local people, I know that even at the best of times that is not easy
because of land prices; subsidy is always difficult, particularly at
the moment. Nevertheless, there is currently a development boom in west
London, and it is envisaged that in three opportunity area sites in my
small borough, 22,000 new properties will be built over the next 10
years or so. Those are the major sites but there are many other similar
sites.</hs_Para>

policy states that at both regional and local level, 40% of houses
built should be affordable, which is right. A third of existing housing
stock in my constituency is affordable social housing, owned by the
local authority or a housing association. At the same time, however,
11,000 people are on the waiting list because of severe overcrowding,
conditions in the private rented sector and homelessness—I said
that 11,000 people are on the housing waiting list and they will be for
another four weeks until it is abolished on 1 April. Some 1,500 people
will then possibly be rehoused at the subjective discretion of the
local authority, depending on their individual merits as assessed on
things such as community contribution, previous employment and matters
not 
<?notus-xml column=915?>specifically related specifically to need. Other aspects of the Localism
Act 2011 are being introduced with alacrity on short-term tenancies,
affordable rents and other matters that, for the first time in
generations, put at risk the right to a secure, affordable home for
many
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030546000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0003.htm#13030546000093">In
those circumstances, one would think that using existing resources
would be a priority, but in fact the local policy in my constituency
says that there should be no new social housing because too much is
available. Therefore, when social housing properties become vacant for
any reason, they are liable to be sold. Consequently, the stock is not
increasing; it is diminishing. When those 10,000 or 11,000 people go
from the waiting list, they will not disappear; they will still be
there, often living in conditions of severe housing
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030546000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0003.htm#13030546000094">The
bedroom tax has been proposed as though it could be an option to build
new affordable housing, but, as I said in my earlier intervention, of
824 council households in my borough subject to the bedroom tax only 48
will be helped, according to the council’s figures, and other
social landlords have another 1,840 such households. The people who are
moving or who are likely to have moved are those who have been subject
to the caps on local housing allowance—540 families so
far—and those who are likely to be subject to the overall
benefit cap when it is introduced, not now in April but later in the
year, sometime between April and September. The date is yet to be
revealed. Again, the local authority estimates that that will affect
another 800
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030546000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0003.htm#13030546000095">Where

the <I>Daily Mirror </I>and GMB trade union into private landlords who
had bought up council properties. That is the source of the statistic,
which I gave earlier, that a third of right-to-buy properties that had
been quite properly bought by their former tenants are now in the hands
of private landlords. What sort of private landlords? One example given
in the article is Charles Gow, the multi-millionaire son of a former
Tory Housing Minister who, as the report reveals, owns 40 flats in one
south London estate alone. The profiteering of private landlords, who
buy up former social flats on council estates and individual council
properties at a relatively low cost, is now rife. What does that mean?
It means that they are able to charge market rents to tenants placed in
those properties by local authorities. Those tenants then have to claim
housing benefit—not because they are unemployed, but because
they cannot, even on a more than average wage, afford the astronomical
rent.</hs_Para>

£467 for a two-bedroom flat, £770 for a

levels. There is the obscenity. A social tenant in a secure and assured
tenancy pays the rent in full by earning a decent average wage, or
even, possibly, a low wage. Living next door is a similar family who
have been in temporary accommodation for three or four years, who are
paying a rent that is four or five times more to a private landlord,
and which is being subsidised by housing benefit. The
Government’s answer is, “Let’s evict the family by
placing a cap on the benefit.” The Government’s answer
should be, “Why are we not providing affordable housing for
working families”, as every previous generation did irrespective
of which party was in control? That is what lies at the heart of

debate has already dwelt on the Government’s reforms to the
housing targets and the important shift away from the regional spatial
strategies towards local plans. It is much better to have local
authorities with their own clear plans advocating, rather than
resisting, development in their areas. Under the regional spatial
strategies, local authorities fought housing targets, used every
opportunity to resist housing development and stood up to the last
Government in doing so. It is much better to have a system under which
local authorities are given incentives to allow development in their
areas and, instead of fighting development, are forced to make the case
for it. I appreciate that people have raised questions about that point
and that several local authorities are still finalising their local
plans and targets. The plan by my district council, Shepway, in Kent,
which is still being finalised, has at its heart a housing figure
greater than the previous target under the regional spatial strategy.
It is taking a sensible look at the opportunities for community
infrastructure that can arise from development. That is the right way
to go.</hs_Para>

consider the impact of infrastructure development in communities and on
the local economy and housing. I realise that DCLG is considering the
planning application for the expansion of Lydd airport in my
constituency, which was approved by the district council three years
ago. Since then, there has been a public inquiry and we now await the
Minister’s decision, which is eagerly anticipated by me, the
district council and many in the Bromley Marsh area and Lydd. It would
be an enormous boost to the local economy to allow the controlled 
<?notus-xml column=918?>expansion of the airport to go ahead. Other transport infrastructure
around it could make the area considerably more attractive to inward
investment, including in new housing, and help to create new jobs, all
of which are needed by the community. I ask the Minister to consider
the application carefully, make it a priority, which I know he has

Government reform I wanted to touch on was the liberalisation of
planning consent for spaces above shops in town centres. This
recognises that our town centres are changing and becoming mixed-use
spaces for leisure, retail, work and residence. This could breathe new
life back into our town centres. We have a lot of empty office space in
many of our town centres, particularly in towns such as Folkestone in
my constituency, and I think this would be a good use of space. If we
can simplify the planning process and get that empty commercial space
being used by residents who need it for residential property, it would
be a good thing for residents and town centres.</hs_Para>

specifics in the Select Committee report pose an interesting question
concerning social housing and those in the private rented sector who
claim housing benefit. Why, despite having a market with no lack of
demand and a lot of Government spending underpinning it, do we have an
inadequate level of supply? Why do we not have a system where we work
with that demand and use it to expand supply? The report hits on
interesting ways of doing that. The Committee Chair raised the
interesting issue of councils borrowing to fund housing expansion. I
would be interested to hear the Minister’s views on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030546000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0003.htm#13030546000110">Obviously,
that exists within the current economic climate, with the country
having borrowed too much, so it is right that the Government are
concerned and careful about allowing too much further borrowing to take
place, but it would be interesting to know what other schemes are
available, particularly involving institutions, to invest in housing
models. The report made some interesting suggestions for how we could
bring together housing associations to manage and build properties,
institutional investors with ready funds to lock away in long-term
investments and local authorities prepared to work with those two
bodies as partners. The funds are probably available from institutional
investors and pensions funds that could invest—over not just 30
years, but 60 years—in new housing programmes. Local authorities
have no shortage of tenants to fill the spaces. Any private landlord or
investor will know that what they want: high levels of occupancy. If
the local authority can largely guarantee occupancy of such properties,
that will make them an attractive investment. Housing associations can
manage such schemes to bring those elements together, so that the
institution does not have to put in place a management arm and the
local authority gets accommodation.</hs_Para>

some models have been put forward. I believe that Barking and Dagenham
council in London has looked at putting in place a model—some
local authorities in Kent are now looking at this too—whereby
the institutional investor effectively builds properties for the
council, which supplies the tenants and then gets to keep the housing
at the end. There is the question—this was raised in the
Committee’s report—of what guaranteed 
<?notus-xml column=919?>rate of return the institutional investor has to be given. What rental
increase does the local authority have to guarantee? Is it inflation or
inflation plus a small percentage increase over a 50 or 60-year period?
That has to be carefully considered, but given that in such models
local authorities would control the housing stock at the
end—either to sell to the tenants or manage for the foreseeable
future—they may be able to manage the risk of being locked into
guaranteeing a certain rate of rent against the value of
assets.</hs_Para>

are very interesting. Indeed, it would be interesting to hear
Ministers’ views on such schemes. As they are new, local
authorities might need encouragement and advice to enter into such
partnerships, but they pass the common-sense test. There are large
amounts of cash sitting in institutions, and we have a social housing
sector with an enormous need for new capacity and an almost limitless
number of tenants to fill the spaces. That suggests that these elements
could successfully come together in a tantalising and interesting
solution to many of the problems that the report looks at. The
Committee’s report also touches on direct borrowing from the
markets, through municipal bonds or local government bonds, as it were.
That could be a different way, but if we can bring these elements of
institutional finance together to meet the enormous need that is out
there, that could be an attractive solution.</hs_Para>

want to touch on investment in the private rented sector. Throughout
this debate hon. Members have referenced case work in their
constituencies involving people in housing need who live in squalor and
poor accommodation in the private rented sector and claim housing
benefit to do so. We discussed this issue in a Westminster Hall debate
last week. I feel strongly that it is wrong to pay out housing benefit
to slum landlords—people who maintain their properties in a poor
state. They know that their tenants cannot afford the cost of moving
out or a deposit. I had a case in my constituency where the cost of
simply moving from one two-bedroom flat in Folkestone to
another—the cost of a deposit, added to the letting
agent’s fees—could be over £1,000. People simply
cannot find that money. Bad landlords know that and they know they can
get away with not maintaining their properties to a sufficient
standard.</hs_Para>

authorities have the power to intervene under the Housing Act 2004,
which was passed by the last Government, but there are understandably
limits to their enforcement capabilities. The one thing we do control,
however, is the money supply for the housing benefit paid either
directly to tenants or to landlords. If we could turn off the tap to
bad landlords who will not take action to improve their properties, we
would have an opportunity to put pressure on the private rented sector
and those landlords, to ensure that such properties are maintained at
least to a standard whereby they do not fall foul of one of the
category 1 or category 2 hazards under the 2004 Act—largely,
that people are not living in severe damp and severe cold. There should
be no excuse for that. Putting this right is probably relatively
low-cost for landlords. If they were faced with losing two or three
months’ rent, they would find the money to put such properties
right pretty quickly. That would do an awful lot to improve their
tenants’ quality of life.</hs_Para>

nothing wrong with private sector landlords offering accommodation to
people on social rent or those renting with housing benefit, but they
have the right to expect such properties to be maintained properly. I
think all Members are far too aware of social housing tenants who are
trapped in the system, living in poor quality accommodation. Months if
not years can go by before anything is done to put it right. In
controlling the money supply, we have the opportunity to do that and,
in doing so, to correct some of the market failures in the
system—empowering tenants to move around it more freely by
making moving costs more affordable—and give them a better
standard and decency of accommodation in the first place.</hs_Para>

hundreds of people about their housing circumstances. More often than

desperately overcrowded accommodation. I sometimes see whole families
who are living in just one room. These people are often working,
sometimes with part-time jobs, but they are living in completely
unacceptable housing conditions and I believe that Members of this

region of £29,000. Furthermore, the vast majority of people who
come to see me at my advice surgeries cannot afford to buy through the
part-buy, part-rent arrangements either. Many of the shared ownership
schemes that housing associations run in London are completely out of
the reach of many of my constituents, because the salary required in
order to access the schemes is many times the amount that many of my

focus on the need to build social rented housing in London. The reality
of what has happened under this Government is that the number of
affordable homes being built has collapsed. Nationally, 34,000 fewer
affordable homes were started in 2011-12 than in the previous year.
That represents a 68% drop. We should not be surprised about that,
because one of this Government’s first actions when they came to
power was to cut the national affordable house building programme by
60%. They signalled their intentions for the supply of new affordable
housing when they made that decision.</hs_Para>

that money also enables other housing to be built. What I mean by that
is that some of the grant that goes into developments to deliver social
or affordable housing enables a mixed-use scheme with mixed tenures to
be created. Last year, when the Prime Minister and the Secretary of
State for Communities and Local Government launched their NewBuy
scheme, they chose to come to Lewisham. They stood in a
development there that had been constructed only because of
a £25 million grant from the Homes and Communities
Agency. The scheme, which is providing nearly 800 new
homes—about 200 of which are affordable—was coming out of
the ground only because of the capital grant from that
agency.</hs_Para>

There is a lot of rhetoric about this, and we do not see a huge amount
of progress. In my constituency, we are experiencing the possibility of
Lewisham hospital having two thirds of its land and buildings sold off.
There are many hospitals in London for which significant land disposals
are going to take place. What discussions has the Minister had with his
colleagues in the Department of Health? If these disposals are going to
happen—let me be clear that I am very much against it for
Lewisham—can we secure requirements for 50% of the land to be

medium-sized builders providing a far greater proportion of the homes
built. At the moment, 75% of new homes come from seven of the largest

demand for self-build in their areas, and then to say what they are
going to do about it? If we look at the experience of other countries

painfully little progress so far, we support the measure on a
cross-party basis, and believe that it should proceed to its subsequent
stages. However, we need to look at what has been trumpeted. When
NewBuy was launched it was said that 100,000 homes would be provided,
but according 
<?notus-xml column=924?>to the latest figure just 1,500 have been provided. Had we had the same
rate of progress as we saw in the first tranche of figures, it would
have taken 200 years to realise that 100,000 homes objective.</hs_Para>

the figures thus far, it is not possible to detect a growth in the
number of planning permissions or total approvals, the output of new
homes or the starts. Indeed, the new homes bonus has other problems: it
is both unfair, in terms of transferring public moneys from north to
south, and inefficient, in terms of the amount of money that actually
gets spent on building homes.</hs_Para>

difficult situation—I stress again that the facts speak for
themselves—there is a real risk that some of the
Government’s next stage reforms will make things worse. Let me
give two examples of such reforms, the first lot of which are the
changes to the planning system. The Select Committee is right to say
that the issue of whether or not to vary the requirement in terms of
social or affordable house building is best left to the local level,
but instead, rejecting localism in favour of Leninism, clause 5 of the
Growth and Infrastructure Bill introduces review mechanisms that might
rob local authorities of the sensible ability to renegotiate where
appropriate. The point was put to me in Plymouth, Exeter and Bristol
last week that there is the additional danger of delay, as some
developers wait for the new arrangements to kick in.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030562000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0003.htm#13030562000032">My second
example is the total impact of welfare reform, which I saw in Plymouth
in some detail last week. Let us consider the bedroom tax. Not only
does it have a human impact—one family whose son has been
serving in three tours in Afghanistan, going backwards and forwards,
will be hit by the bedroom tax, as will the disabled and the
carers—but it will have perverse outcomes. If people are pushed
into the private rented sector, there is the potential for rents to be
higher, which increases the housing benefit bill and the potential for
greater homelessness. In Plymouth alone, the totality of the changes
will take £30 million out of the local economy. There is growing
and disturbing evidence of the potential of this now to have an impact
on new builds—on supply—because of write-offs of bad debt
and the burden of cost being imposed on housing associations and local
authorities.</hs_Para>

Member for Meon Valley (George Hollingbery), in one of the many
thoughtful contributions that have been made by hon. Members from
across the Chamber, rightly made the point about the importance of
house building to the economy. History tells us that from the
depression, through war and the building of modern Britain in the
’50s and ’60s, to the recovery from recession in 2008, a
major programme of house building has always been at the heart of
economic recovery in our country—public and private—and
that it is not possible to have a sustainable economic recovery without
a major programme of house building. The CBI rightly makes the point
that the 100,000 affordable homes will see 1% added to GDP.</hs_Para>

with some of the Select Committee’s recommendations. It rightly
makes a number of intelligent points about how we finance a major
uplift in supply. It is right to argue strongly in favour of post-2015
certainty, including both rent models, making a crucial point about the
need to commit grant and investment. It is right to say that we need
progressively to shift from what we have at the moment—plenty of
public investment in housing but 95p in every pound going on housing
benefit—to bricks and mortar. It is right to recognise that,
over and above what we commit to by way of grant and investment, we
need innovatory forms of funding housing supply and therefore the
potential, for example, for institutional funding. I have been involved
in some interesting examples in that regard. The hon. Member for
Folkestone and Hythe mentioned Barking and Dagenham, to which I would
add what Manchester is doing and what I just heard about in Enfield,
where local government pension scheme moneys are being used to build
200-plus council homes.</hs_Para>

Committee is also right to advance a debate that we badly need to have
about the potential for what local authorities can achieve if we set
them free and if we have a true localism approach. Earlier, reference
was made to the potential for 60,000 homes to be built as a
consequence.</hs_Para>

is also right to argue in favour of a debate that we now need to have
about a housing investment bank. In the summer of last year, the leader
of my party proposed a British investment bank with a focus on
manufacturing and housing. The Committee discusses the potential for a
housing investment bank, pointing out some of the international
experience that shows why that can help.</hs_Para>

is also right when it talks about innovation by housing associations,
such as retail bonds, greater leverage of assets and equity sharing
with local authorities, as well as when it makes the point that it is
important that we have the admirable G15—the big—while
realising the potential of the small. I see that in my constituency
through the admirable Castle Vale community housing association. My
hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham East was also right about the
important and neglected role of small and medium-sized builders in
providing the capacity to ensure the uplift in supply we need to
see.</hs_Para>

Committee is right to advance the argument that we must reduce the
up-front costs of building. The notion of build now, pay later
therefore has a great deal to recommend it. The Committee is right to
refer to Government land, which thus far has been something of a holy
grail. Things have not happened quite as has been suggested time and
time again, but no doubt the Minister will convince the House that he
is determined to put that right.</hs_Para>

the clear problems associated with too many rogue landlords and too
many rogue letting agents. That is important 
<?notus-xml column=926?>both in its own right and in the context of a more stable sector
enjoying greater security and more affordable rents because of the
impact on supply. Let me quote briefly from a startling Scottish Widows

conclusion, let me return to what was said by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich and many others. All people should
have a decent home at a price they can afford to rent or buy, at all
tenures, but the crucial point is how we locate it in the context of
economic recovery in our country. Sustainable economic recovery will
not happen unless we have a major programme of public and private house
building.</hs_Para>

only on Friday, when we were together in Bristol. As ever, he makes

remarks about the need to look at the bundling of land together. I will

the Department of Health in relation to the land to which she refers.
Although from time to time I am critical of much of what the right hon.
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford) says, I was delighted
to hear him make a robust argument for the great value of further
improvements in the energy efficiency of our buildings. Although the
hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr Slaughter), who is no longer in his

Valley (George Hollingbery) described as an eloquent contribution.
Indeed it was. It was eloquent in giving just praise to the report that
the Select Committee produced more than a year ago. As I said to the
hon. Gentleman in an intervention, in the light of the fact that a year
has passed since that report, I have made available in the Library an

the hon. Member for Sheffield South East said, it is important that we

of the House. Reference was made, for example, to the reform of the
housing revenue account and to the greater flexibility given to the
many excellent arm’s length management organisations. The
Chairman of the Select Committee even praised the Planning Minister for
his willingness to accept the need for an agreed methodology for
determining housing need. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that this is

Chairman of the Select Committee pointed out that the Montague report
said that guarantees distort the market. May I tactfully suggest that
the Montague report was referring in that instance to rent guarantees?

that point, the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich asked what
has happened to the £10 billion loan guarantee and
where it is. He will be well aware that it takes time to work through
the details and to put an offer to the market. We have done all that
and I am delighted to tell him that we will make a detailed
announcement next month about the appointment of people to run it, so
progress is being made. He also challenges us about shovel-ready
projects, which he is clearly concerned about. As he knows, because he
looks at these matters in great detail, the Get Britain Building fund
of £570 million has already signed contracts with 120 projects
that will provide us with no fewer than 8,600 homes, and more are on
the way. Under this coalition Government, shovels are in the ground. We

all Members who spoke in the debate, we believe strongly in the

as so many hon. Members have said, a new Budget and a new spending
round is due shortly, 
<?notus-xml column=928?>when I have no doubt that further announcements on housing will be made.
I was not meant to say more than that, but my hon. Friend the Member

newspapers today on what might be covered. We will just have to wait
and see what is around the corner. As the Chair of the Select

Members who have spoken agree that we need more housing, but agree that
the politics at the local level can often be difficult. That is why I
said that the first thing that we have to do is ensure that we make the
best use of the built environment that we already have. That means, for
example, tackling empty homes, providing for the change of use from
commercial to residential referred to by a number of my hon. Friends,
and, as has been debated a number of times in the Chamber, tackling
under-occupancy and affordable housing. The new homes bonus gives local
authorities not only reward for new homes, but also for bringing empty
properties back into use. It is a powerful incentive that is really
working. From next month, local authorities will have further
flexibility to remove or reduce council tax discounts on empty homes,

to charge even higher rates.</hs_Para>

specifically to address properties above shops in our high streets, and
he will be aware that we are seeking to do that. There will always be a
number of homes that are unoccupied for a short period, and we
obviously need that for the market to operate, but the House will be
pleased to know that the latest data show that only 260,000 have been

possible we will use the bill now, pay later deferred payment scheme to

authorities do in some cases need to be quicker with their planning
applications, and he will be aware that we are dealing with that in the

scheme, to ensure that we can meet any reduction in the number of
affordable houses that might result from those renegotiations. In
addition, we have the £475 million local
infrastructure fund—we published its prospectus only a few days
ago—which will help local areas to deliver much larger-scale
developments to meet need. We want to go still further. The House will
be aware that there has not been a single new development of more than

first-time buyers into shared equity. Reference has also been made to
the NewBuy scheme, which gives prospective buyers the chance to buy a
home with a fraction of the deposit normally required. As we have
heard, there are already 3,000 reservations and the figure is rising
rapidly. As he also said, the Bank of England is crediting our

Edward Garnier</B> (Harborough) (Con):</Member> I begin by thanking Mr
Speaker for the opportunity to raise in this Adjournment debate an
issue of acute local concern in Market Harborough, namely the
operations of JG Pears Ltd’s animal rendering plant just outside
that town. I also thank not only all the many constituents whom I have
met or who have contacted me in order to provide me with evidence and
information about what is happening to the local environment and how it
affects their enjoyment of their properties and their own daily lives,
but the environmental health officials at Harborough district council
who agreed to meet me, along with my constituent Mary Morgan, at the
end of last year. Regrettably, the upshot of that meeting was that
there appeared to be little or nothing the district council could do,
or was prepared to do, to ameliorate the problem.</hs_Para>

to be joined by the Minister, who is here to respond for the Government
but, in reality, has very little power to influence the issues I am
here to raise. It is not for the Minister to tell JG Pears Ltd how to
run its business, nor is it for the Government to serve an abatement
notice, to prosecute the company for offences under the Environmental
Protection Act 1990, or to bring proceedings in the courts for
statutory nuisance. I do not think that the Minister can even tell the
local authority what to do, and I doubt he has the power to tell the
Environment Agency what to do. However, he can tell us what the
Government’s attitude is towards companies such as JG Pears that
are not good neighbours and appear on the evidence that I have
considered to be careless of the rights and interests of the people
who live and farm, or work in other ways, close to their
premises.</hs_Para>

constituents and I are anti-business or think that JG Pears’
plant in Market Harborough should be shut down. We are not
anti-business and we do not want the business closed, although I dare
say that from time to time some of my constituents must have thought
that that would make their lives more tolerable. Perhaps constituents
of my hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) will
occasionally have thought the same, because there is another JG Pears
operation in Normanton, Nottinghamshire, whose neighbours appear to be
suffering in a similar way to my constituents. My hon. Friend is in his
place, and I trust he will be able to catch your eye, Mr Deputy
Speaker, before the Minister
replies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030562000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0004.htm#13030562000074">In

councillor collected some of this slurry in her gloved hands. It is
known in the business as mixed liquor bacterial slurry and is used by
JG Pears in the process carried out in the main aeration tank and then
sluiced out on to its land, whence it leeches into the nearby

Judging from the huge number of 25-tonne articulated lorries delivering

which may explain why the disposal systems leave a lot to be desired.

residents to go to the trouble of filling out diary sheets if it then

the company’s licence requires the odours and other problems to
be witnessed by an environmental health officer? I understand that when
the only officer to have been on the site was asked if he understood
the company’s processes, he replied that he did not have to. I
disagree. He has a professional obligation to know what he is looking

small group of residents; and that only one person has complained. It
says that there is no basis for it to take action. I appreciate that
the council’s revenue budget is very small and getting smaller,

it should deal with the issue and not try to brush it under the carpet

learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Sir Edward Garnier) for the
eloquent way in which he raised this case, and to my hon. Friend the
Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) for underlining the concerns felt by
his constituents. This debate demonstrates in a particular
setting—two settings, in fact—the way in which my
Department’s priorities interact. First, however, I first want
to say on a purely human level that I have huge sympathy for the
constituents of my hon. and learned Friend, and wish to ensure that any
business of this kind is a good neighbour.</hs_Para>

debate in context, we want the rural economy to grow, and rendering
plants provide an important service to the farming and food producing
community by taking waste and animal by-products and processing them
for further use or disposal. Such plants are strictly regulated by the
Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency to ensure that animal
by-products are handled and processed safely and do not present a risk
to public or animal health. They contribute importantly to our priority
of safeguarding animal health but, like all businesses, they should be
good neighbours.</hs_Para>

particular plant takes in low-risk material from abattoirs and cutting
plants but does not take in fallen stock. It turns that material into
high-quality processed animal protein for the pet food industry. It
gets inspected quarterly by the Animal Health and Veterinary
Laboratories Agency, and was last inspected on 15 January—I
suspect it will be small comfort to the constituents of my hon. and
learned Friend, but in that inspection all was found to be
satisfactory.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030562000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0004.htm#13030562000104">The
Department’s priority is clearly to improve the environment, and
rendering plants are subject to integrated pollution prevention and
control under a European directive of that name. That directive has
been recast in a somewhat strengthened form into the industrial
emissions directive, which we transposed last month. Under integrated
pollution prevention and control, each rendering plant must have a
permit from the environmental regulator that contains conditions on any
pollutant likely to be emitted in significant quantities. Pollution is
defined in the directive to include the emission of anything that

the environmental regulator is Harborough district council. In
accordance with the secondary legislation that introduced the EU system
of integrated pollution prevention and control in England, the council
first issued a permit for the rendering plant in May 2003 and updated
it in November 2008. That permit is readily available on the
web.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030562000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0004.htm#13030562000107">The
permit requires all emissions to air from the plant to be free from
offensive odour as perceived by the local authority inspector outside
the plant site boundary. As we have heard, a group of residents
consider themselves to be continuously and adversely affected by odour
from the plant. Following their complaints, in May 2012 Harborough
district council compiled a report to determine the impact of odour
from the plant on the local community and whether any breaches of the
permit had occurred.</hs_Para>

report for the same purposes was compiled last month. Between them, the
reports show that the council officers undertook a total of 64 visits
to the vicinity of the site between January and November 2012, some in
the company of the complainants’ representatives. Between
January and April 2012, an offensive odour was found on one of the 30
visits. Between September and November, the period covered by the
second report, an offensive odour was found on one of the 34 visits.
That in no way diminishes the points made by my hon. and learned Friend
or my hon. Friend. I entirely take their constituents’ concerns
as they stated
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030562000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0004.htm#13030562000109">The
council’s reports point out that the Secretary of State’s
guidance for the rendering sector, issued in 2008, recognises that
occasional escapes of offensive odour may occur from rendering
processes. The guidance is that formal enforcement action may not be
needed if there are no more than two such instances in a 12-month
period, provided remedial action is taken
rapidly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030562000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0004.htm#13030562000110">In
the first of the two instances of offensive odour found in 2012,
further visits were undertaken on the day but no further offensive
odours were found. In the second instance, a problem with the abatement
technology on site was identified and, I understand, rectified as soon
as possible. The council, taking into account that guidance but making
its decision in line with its enforcement policy, has therefore
determined that no enforcement action is to be taken. That is a matter
for the district council as regulator, but I understand that my hon.
and learned Friend is concerned about it.</hs_Para>

council has investigated the residents group’s complaint about
noise. The council’s officers deemed noise emissions to be
extremely low, of negligible impact and not in breach of the
plant’s permit conditions. I can only report that; I am sure
that the residents might have a differing view. I understand that the
council’s recent offer to the complainant of sound-monitoring
equipment to enable further investigation has been
declined.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030562000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0004.htm#13030562000112">The
district council has correctly pointed out to the residents concerned
the availability of private action if they remain of the view that
odour from the plant is significantly impacting on the use and
enjoyment of their premises. The district council has also pointed out
to the residents that they can contact the site manager of the plant if
they experience odour problems.</hs_Para>

methods to abate odours likely to be considered offensive. That is
where the 
<?notus-xml column=937?>possibility of progress might be found. I am pleased to note that the
company appears to have needed little prompting in that regard. I
understand that it is developing proposals for a new raw material
reception facility, which my hon. and learned Friend described, a
replacement effluent treatment plant and the installation of a thermal
oxidiser. I am slightly dismayed to hear my hon. Friend say that such
improvements have not addressed the problem, but let us look to the

positively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030562000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0004.htm#13030562000114">According
to my Department’s experts, those proposals, if carried through,
should lead to an improvement in the environmental performance of the
plant, while developing its business. They should deal not only with
odour emissions, but with emissions of ammonia to contiguous
watercourses. My hon. and learned Friend alluded to an event that the
company is holding in Market Harborough between 3 and 7 pm tomorrow,
6 March at which those proposals will be described to local
people, enabling them to comment. I hope that the event, which I
understand is being publicised in leaflets to local residents, will
help to enable the company to move forward in delivering environmental
improvements, while not only continuing to make its distinctive
contribution to the rural economy and society but, one hopes, being a
good or better neighbour to those who live around it. That would be
entirely the best solution, and I trust that it will meet the concerns
expressed so eloquently by my hon. and learned Friend on behalf of his
constituents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030562000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/debtext/130305-0004.htm#13030562000115">All

the near future and that the changes the company are making will
resolve the issue. I recognise his point that this is a matter over
which the local authority has control: it has to address the clearly
genuine concerns of local people. These are not the kind of vexatious
claims that one might hear from an individual who may object to a
particular type of business for the wrong reasons. This is a consistent
concern for a large proportion of those who live nearby, and is
therefore something that the local authority needs to address. He and I

see how many hon. Friends and Members are here to support this debate.
Given the debate title, I intend to keep to the narrow issue of the

the escalator is having on our economy and communities across the
country. I will also discuss the positive story that our beer and pub
industry has to tell and the reasons why that industry should not be
compromised by further rises in the already excessive beer duty
rate.</hs_Para>

Since the escalator was introduced, beer consumption in the UK has

pubs have closed their doors for the last time and more than 60,000
beer-dependent jobs have been lost. As my hon. Friend the Member for

financial benefit of the beer and brewing industry, pub closures are
having a detrimental effect on the fabric of our society, due to the
high social impact when a pub closes. Our pubs offer a unique leisure
experience, 
<?notus-xml column=182?>are a great addition to the social fabric of our country and are often
at the heart of our local communities; they are akin to community

has given us far lower interest rates, helping the whole economy and in
particular those people who want to frequent our pubs. I appreciate the
freeze on council tax for the past three years, which has helped with
the cost of living, and the freeze on fuel duty, which has no doubt
helped the beer and pub industry because when the fuel duty goes up the
price of a pint goes up. I appreciate the other measures that the
Minister and his colleagues are taking to reinvigorate the economy as
well, but I also urge my hon. Friend to assess the beer duty escalator
and beer duty in general to see if the effect is disproportionate. I

327 are direct jobs for 16 to 24-year olds. It is very much part of

majority of that employment has been enabled by investment in pubs. It
is worth noting that although the hon. Member for Nuneaton wanted to
talk about the escalator, the value of the small breweries relief has
made an enormous difference to many small breweries all over the
country. If ever there was evidence that investment in a sector can
bear fruit, it is that small breweries relief, which has made such a
difference since its introduction back in 2002. The Government should
now go one step further and examine the
escalator.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000044">The
current policy of increasing duty above inflation may seem to be one
way of raising revenue, but the Treasury’s figures show that
that is misguided. They forecast a very small increase in duty revenue
from this policy—small enough that no additional revenue is
predicted. The policy is changing societal behaviour. An unintended
consequence of duty increases—we heard about this during
interventions—is that more and more people are choosing to drink
at home or on a park bench, unregulated and unsupervised, and they are
switching from beer to wine and spirits. Part of my career many years
ago was working with homeless alcoholics, and I cannot stress enough
the importance of having supervised places where people may drink
responsibly. Pubs are such places.</hs_Para>

is critical not just for small breweries such as Titanic, but for the
beer and pub industry as a whole, and the supply chain that contributes
to it. Since the introduction of the beer duty escalator, excise duty
has increased by at least 20p a pint. Beer sales in pubs and clubs have
fallen by 23% and more than 6,000 pubs have closed. Beer taxation now
costs the average pub 
<?notus-xml column=185?>around £66,000 a year. Instead of that, we should be creating
more jobs, employing more people, and creating more wealth locally.
That is possible if we do not have excessive
taxation, which is simply not working in a time of economic austerity.
For those reasons, I hope that the Government will listen to what is
being suggested
today.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_05_PT_1/4AD66437146F52D70D212CCB542DF4C90F58887B" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="5 March 2013">Tuesday

these issues, but I hope that this is the last time we have to discuss

am pleased to see the Minister in his place, and I thank him for the
way he has engaged in the matter and listened. He is a supporter of
beer and pubs, and he has acknowledged the important role of the
brewing sector and pubs, and the opportunities for growth and to be
part of getting the British economy back on its feet. I warmly welcome
that. He has been listening carefully and reflecting, and I hope that
that can also be said for the Chancellor and the Chief Secretary to the
Treasury. I urge coalition Members particularly to ensure when we bump
into them in the Lobbies that they are also listening. However, the
listening must be coming to an end, because there has been a lot of it,
as well as a lot of reflecting and campaigning. It is now time for
action, and the message from this debate is that nothing other than
announcing the abolition of the beer duty escalator in the Budget in
two weeks will be acceptable. We urge the Minister to ensure
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000049">I
want to emphasise to the Minister, the Chancellor, the Chief Secretary
to the Treasury, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister that
this is a hugely positive opportunity. Too often in debates, MPs say
that they want a tax break here and a tax break there, or a favour and
a leg-up. That is not what this argument is about. It is simply about
two things. From an economic point of view, the tax simply does not add
up. It does not make sense. Even the Treasury’s figures have
shown that if the predicted rise in beer duty goes ahead in two
weeks’ time, the revenues from beer duty will fall, yet we do
not need to be geniuses to see what effect the duty is having on
brewers, particularly medium-sized brewers. We need to remember that
the tax is a producer tax; it is levied on brewers at the point of
production, so it directly affects that sector. Taking it away would
lead to a change in investment decisions by those companies.</hs_Para>

powerful and stark conversation with Lancaster brewery—it is not
in my constituency. The brewery has done incredibly well to get above
the level 
<?notus-xml column=186?>of small breweries relief, to the extent that it is helping either very
little or not at all. I heard about how much the brewery would have to
pay in duty, and where it would spend that money otherwise. It would
spend it on investment, on employment, on increasing production, on
taking on more people, and on supplying more beer around the region,
and no doubt, around the country.</hs_Para>

Minister wants clear evidence—I know that he is both a pub lover
and a very capable economist—he only has to look at the
astonishing effect of small breweries relief since it was introduced in
2002, and I am not churlish enough not to give credit to the previous
Government for doing that. I did so at the time, and it has been hugely
important. Some people have the idea that small breweries relief is
simply something that has helped small breweries—these cuddly
microbreweries—to brew beer, and that that is great for beer
lovers, but actually, we are talking about incredibly powerful
facts.</hs_Para>

the Society of Independent Brewers—SIBA—show that volume
sales of locally brewed SIBA beer, against a declining level of sales
in the on-trade, were up 6.8% in 2012. Those local brewers already
employ nearly 5,000 people, and the really stark figure is that on
average, SIBA brewers invested 23% of their turnover back into the
business, and into employment, increasing production, and growth.
Clearly, there is a direct link between the level of beer duty and
level of investment that brewers are able to make into their business,
and that has a huge knock-on effect. As the chairman of the all-party
save the pub group, I am deeply concerned about the number of pub
closures in this country. It would be wrong to suggest that that is
down to one factor, when a number are involved, but clearly the unfair
level of beer duty is a factor, and it is time to address it.</hs_Para>

why pubs are affected in a powerful way is that supermarkets can absorb
any increase in duty that the Treasury throws at them. They have ways
of doing that and even now, they are selling alcohol at a price that
many people believe is not responsible. The difference between the
price of a pint in a supermarket and a pub is now tenfold—it is
ten times cheaper to buy alcohol in a supermarket, compared with in the
controlled, sociable environment of the British pub, which as we know,
provides community value. The Institute of Public Policy Research
published an excellent report, which estimated that the wider social
value provided per pub was between £20,000 and £120,000,
on top of the economic benefits. An interesting fact for the Treasury
and BIS about the local pub is that for every pound spent in a pub,
compared with a supermarket, twice as much is then circulated and
invested in the local economy.</hs_Para>

really is a win-win situation. We all know that the Budget has to focus
on growth—I look forward to some of the excellent suggestions
from Lord Heseltine being included—and here is a simple
opportunity to send the message to Britain’s brewers that we
want them to invest, to continue to succeed, and not to fall into the
trap that we currently have with small breweries relief, where if
brewers start to be too successful, they find themselves being
penalised.</hs_Para>

the Minister to look carefully at the levels of duty for all drinks,
because when it comes to beer, there has been a blind spot that many of
us simply do not understand. Beer has been seen as a cash cow for the
Treasury, and that must end. However, I also urge 
<?notus-xml column=187?>the Minister and his colleagues to look at other levels of duty, and
particularly to consider the situation with cider. Cider is, of course,
another wonderful drink, which is often produced by small producers.
There is also a relief for small cider producers, but interestingly, it

need to bring the Minister’s attention to the situation we have
in which huge, mass-produced cider brands—the likes of Magners

beer brands pay, and that is simply because of the idea that all cider
is produced by small producers. I am afraid that there is a lot of
dishonesty in the cider market. When it comes to Magners, the so-called
“Irish cider”, if it really was Irish cider made from
Irish apples, every Irish apple would be making something like 20
litres of cider. Some marketing kidology is going on—I say that

producers. That is absolutely important, and perhaps the relief to them

paying significantly more—currently more than double the
duty—than someone buying a pint of Strongbow, Magners or
Bulmers. There is no justification for that, and that inequality must

done—this was a conversation that happened after last
year—to show the effect that it will have on investment. In the
end, we all agree that taxation is there to encourage. That is really
what we would like taxation to do—to encourage positive
decisions. What we are saying is, “Get rid of this tax and have
fairer beer duty to encourage the sort of investment that has been
demonstrated at the smaller end, where people do have lower and
slightly fairer beer duty.” The prediction is that 10,000 new
jobs would come from doing that. Then there would be the employment tax

start to do that, but the hon. Gentleman is right to say that we must

beer group’s inquiry into the smuggling of beer to try to get
round the UK duty rules. That issue has not yet 
<?notus-xml column=189?>been raised much in this debate. One reason why we do not get the
increase in revenue that we would expect from the beer duty escalator
is the increasing amounts of beer that are brought over in what we
could euphemistically call white vans. I suspect that they are actually
large trucks, sneaking through our border, so that the beer can be sold
round the backs of industrial
estates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000068">It
was quite scary, when we took evidence from Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs, to hear exactly what the scale of the fraud was.
It was something like the equivalent of all off-sales sold outside
supermarkets in the UK, which is a seriously large volume. I am not
saying that every small shop selling beer is selling non-duty-paid
beer; that was just to show the scale of the problem that we have. We
have to consider whether, all other things being equal, a policy that

agree with what everyone else has said. I think that everyone has used
the useful statistics that we have for the debate. The idea of
increasing beer duty by more than inflation every year was probably
wrong when it was introduced four or five years ago. In fact, various

was wrong. It is a pity that taking  on the chains of office

reasonable people having an ordinary small amount of drink every week.

we are trying to tackle excessive alcohol consumption, which we clearly
should, it is important to point out that the beer duty escalator
targets people who drink, in pubs, pints of British-brewed beer. I
suspect that that is not the biggest health problem caused by alcohol
that this country has. We should be encouraging people to drink a nice,
relatively weak pint of beer, rather than sitting at home drinking a
litre of spirits or whatever. That is the direction of travel we should
be looking at—encouraging the supervised drinking of
British-brewed products in pubs and discouraging the drinking of
imported cheap
spirits.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000072">I
am not convinced by the arguments for the health benefits of this

advantages. The forecast in the Red Book last year showed that the
expected increases in this Budget would not actually raise any more
money. I accept, and I will happily make the argument, that we are
pretty desperate for revenue to reduce our deficit, but it seems
bizarre that a policy would be introduced that raises no money and
actually does damage to a pretty important industry that is a
significant employer throughout the country. While I am on that issue,
I should join the list of hon. Members praising their 
<?notus-xml column=190?>small local breweries. I can think of a fair few—Amber Ales,
Leadmill, Bottle Brook, Coppice Side and Marlpool. I have to say that I
think I have drunk quite a lot of all their beer. I made a special
effort to have a barrel of beer from the Marlpool brewery at my

provide a community facility that we value. Therefore, I do not believe
that the original case for increasing beer duty by more than inflation
holds water any more. We should at the very least be stopping that
above-inflation increase. I can see the argument that all other costs
go up by inflation, so why should not the duty element? I cannot see

2%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000074">I

my constituency, there is a social impact to discouraging people from
using the local pub, which is still a huge part of the local community.
Montgomeryshire is a very rural constituency, and traditionally the
social life in small villages is only about the local pub. The
situation is not what it was when I was young and the whole of village
life centred on the young farmers club and the local pub, but today the
pub is still very important, particularly to elderly people. I believe
that visiting the pub is a very good way of counteracting the
loneliness that often arises because people are living so much longer;
the social life associated with a pub can often be helpful in
counteracting depression and perhaps even dementia. I believe that
social activities do have an impact. That is an important issue for us
to consider.</hs_Para>

Members have talked about the economic impact. It is a great British
industry. Even in my constituency, which has had no tradition of
brewing at all— the Eagle Brewery was the last major brewery,

are employing people. One of them has taken over a local pub that was
in danger of closing. Monty’s Brewery and the Waen Brewery are
the subject of conversation. They are not employing a lot of people,

in my constituency, where most of the barley grown goes into feedstock,

growing malting barley is a massive part of agriculture, and we need to
act to protect it. In south-east England, the hops industry is

the Treasury is not raising the money that it expected from the beer
duty escalator. Secondly, let us look at the sectors that are growing:
cider is in substantial growth, and vodka, which is the drink of young
people now, is in growth. We need to have fairness across the duty
system that encourages a great British manufacturing success
story.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000103">I
will point the Minister to some important facts. In his constituency,
2,370 people are employed in the brewing and pub trades, and 898 16 to
24-year olds in his constituency are employed as a result of
brewing  
<?notus-xml column=194?>and pubs. That could be boosted; the brewing and pub industries could
help support growth and employ young people. We all recognise the
importance of brewing in our constituencies as an economic driver and
employer. We also recognise the cultural importance of the great
British
pint.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000104">There
has been some talk today about the impact of drinking on health and
antisocial behaviour. I think that the great British pub is the answer
here, not the problem. Drinking in a supervised environment with a
landlord who would tell someone, “I am sorry. I think
you’ve had too much. I am not serving you any more,” is a
far better way for young people to be introduced to alcohol than, as
the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent North (Joan Walley) mentioned,
drinking on a park bench or unsupervised at home when mum and dad are
not there.</hs_Para>

about the beer duty escalator—or any escalator—is that
when one reaches the top, it is time to get off. We have seen from the
falling revenue and sales and the number of pubs that are closing up
and down our country that it is time to get off the beer duty
escalator. By scrapping it in the Budget, the Minister will be able to
promote growth and jobs and put a smile on the face of British drinkers

Jamieson</B> (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this morning, Mr Caton. I
thank the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr Jones) for securing this
important debate. As a number of hon. Members have suggested, there is
a certain sense of déjà vu, given the number of debates
that there have been on the issue, but the timing of this debate, ahead
of the Budget, is critical.</hs_Para>

the outset that a number of my hon. Friends have let me know that they
would have liked to participate in this debate, but they were not able
to do so because of other parliamentary business or commitments that
they had already made. I hope that we can continue with the generous
spirit in which the debate has been conducted, and focus on a number of
issues that Members on both sides of the House would like the Minister
to answer—although that is not to say that I will not make some
reference to the previous Government’s position or press the
Minister on some questions that I think all of us would like to be
answered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000109">It
is important to recognise, as many hon. Members have, the organisations
that have briefed Members and allowed them to make visits and listen to
representatives of the industry in their constituencies. Those
organisations include the British Beer and Pub Association, the Society
of Independent Brewers, the all-party groups on beer and on pubs and
the Campaign for Real Ale. I have worked closely with CAMRA in my
constituency; I had the joy of judging one of the beer competitions at
a local real ale festival, for which I thank the local CAMRA
organisation. We also heard about representations made by the TaxPayers
Alliance and <I>The Sun</I>.</hs_Para>

hon. Members have talked about the importance of the wider brewing
industry and of manufacturing. There is also, of course, the bottling
sector, from which representations have also been received. We have
discussed small and medium-sized enterprises, micro-breweries, the
rural economy, and the focus of the pub trade as a base for the local
community. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Glyn Davies) recognised
the impact on elderly people and the important social role that pubs
play in the community. We also heard about the charitable events and
the various activities that pub goers regularly get involved
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000112">In
his opening speech, the hon. Member for Nuneaton praised the Minister
as a listening Minister. He recognised the need to deal with the
deficit and welcomed, as I have, some of the actions taken on fuel
duty. He urged the Minister, as other hon. Members did, to assess
whether the escalator was disproportionate. I will return to that issue
with some specific comments for the Minister to
consider.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000113">My
hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent North (Joan Walley) talked
about responsible drinking, which is important. Like her, I spent some
time working in the voluntary sector before becoming a Member of

with drinking problems. I have also spent some time, when I was a
social work student, working at a drinking problems unit in a
psychiatric hospital. I have seen the difficulties and problems that
emerge when people get involved in problem drinking. One theme that has
come out from the discussion is the importance of the pub sector in
providing a different ethos, culture and way for people to consume
alcohol enjoyably and responsibly. We are all concerned to ensure that
that continues.</hs_Para>

by my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Glyn Davies). His
focused point was on how the issue is about not just the economy or the
cost of beer but the social contribution of pubs throughout the
country, particularly in rural communities—like his and, I might
add, mine—in which pubs are a key part of the local community.
Pubs and brewers up and down the country should be assured that they

the time available, I will try to respond to all the issues raised

pubs and brewers in general, and the Government’s alcohol
strategy. In response to the shadow Minister, the hon. Member for
Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson), my hon. Friend the Member for
Burton (Andrew Griffiths) said that, understandably, he wanted this to
be a cross-party discussion. I think that that is right, so I will not

will first focus on beer duties. The Government inherited the current
rises in alcohol duties from our predecessors, as has been said. The
2008 Budget announced that alcohol duties would rise by 6% that year,
and then by the retail prices index plus 2% in the next four years. 
<?notus-xml column=198?>The Budget in March 2010 extended those rises for a further two years,
until 2014-15. If the Government were to cancel the planned 2
percentage point rises for beer, it would cost the Exchequer £35
million next year and £70 million the following year. Given the
current public finances and the sums involved, it would be prudent for
the Government to think carefully about the consequences of making any
such tax changes. The Government continue to keep all taxes under
review and regularly monitor the impact of alcohol duty rates on both
the industry and consumers.</hs_Para>

our monitoring suggests that the decline in the nation’s beer
consumption predates the increases in duty and is a reflection of how
consumer tastes have changed. Beer’s share of the total alcohol
market has declined by nearly 30 percentage points since the mid-1970s.
More than 85% of the beer consumed in the UK is brewed in the UK, which
was a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton, and we want
to continue to support such business.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030536000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000135">Brewers will
benefit from a number of actions this Government have taken to support
all businesses. The reduction in the rate of corporation tax and the
temporary increase in the annual investment allowance, for example,
will enable them to invest in new machinery. As my hon. Friend the
Member for High Peak (Andrew Bingham) highlighted, the small breweries
relief supports microbreweries by reducing their beer duty by up to
50%, and it has contributed to an increase in the number of such
breweries. Both consumers and pubs benefit significantly from the
diversity of products produced by the 730 microbreweries in the UK, and
the Society of Independent Brewers estimates that small breweries
relief has increased the number of jobs by 1,000 since it was
introduced in
2002.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000136">There

act more flexibly with measures such as beer duty. May I take this

recognise the importance of brewers and the contribution that pubs make
to our local communities and the wider economy. Unfortunately, the
number of pubs has been declining for decades, but that reflects the
changes in consumer tastes and in lifestyles. The number of
pubs continued to decline in the early 2000s, despite relatively flat
alcohol duties in real terms. None the less, we continue to support
pubs through our policies. For example, the drop in the small profits
rate from 21% to 20% in April 2011 has supported thousands of small
businesses such as pubs. About a fifth of pubs currently receive a
reduction in the business rates they pay. Small pubs can also benefit
from small business rates relief or rural rates relief, and the
Government have extended the small business rates relief holiday until
March
2014.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000140">The
majority of pubs have also benefited from the reform of gaming machine
taxation introduced on 1 February, and they have the
opportunity to benefit from the Live Music Act 2012, which came into
force last October, making it much easier for pubs to put on live music
events. On top of that, in January the Government announced plans for a
statutory code alongside the independent adjudicator to ensure fair
practice between large pub companies and their tenants on issues such
as rent and the price publicans pay for their beer. The Government will
be consulting on those plans shortly, and I hope that Members present
will make pubs and publicans in their communities aware of the
proposals.</hs_Para>

about our wider economic policy, which includes the strategy to reduce
the record budget deficit that we inherited. That strategy has led to
lower interest rates, which benefit people who have mortgages. If
interest rates were just 1 percentage point higher, the average
mortgage would go up by almost £900 a year, which is money that
could be spent in pubs, and companies up and down the country would pay
another £10 billion in interest in servicing their loans.
Clearly, low interest rates have been helping companies, especially
small and 
<?notus-xml column=200?>medium-sized companies. Our record increase in personal allowances has
also put more money in people’s pockets, which they can use in
their local pub. My hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley (Nigel
Mills) mentioned the change in fuel duty, which means that rises that
we inherited from the previous Government have not gone ahead, and that
again has meant more money in people’s
pockets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000142">I
want to say a quick word about our alcohol strategy. Moderate alcohol
consumption can be positive for people’s well-being, but the
Government are committed to tackling cheap alcohol and irresponsible
alcohol consumption. We have therefore reformed beer duty to support
responsible drinking. In October 2011, duty was halved on low-strength
beer, while duty on high-strength beer increased by 25%. That was
warmly welcomed at the time by many hon. Members and by
CAMRA.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000143">The

drinking.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000144">In
the interests of time, I shall conclude my remarks. I am glad that we
have had the opportunity to discuss beer duty, brewers, pubs and the
alcohol strategy, and we have had, I think, a constructive debate. I
hope that I have reassured hon. Members that the Government fully
support pubs and brewers. As I have shown in some of the examples that
I have cited, the Government have already taken action in that regard,
and, despite our tight fiscal situation, I am keen for them to go
further. Hon. Members will understand that I cannot make any specific
commitments on action; we have to leave that for the Budget. None the
less, as one of my hon. Friends mentioned, I like to be seen as a
listening Minister, so please be reassured that I take the matter
seriously, and that today’s debate has served to underline its
importance.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_05_PT_1/BB70FAADCDA7D08422ABEABF5A4678432C2187E3" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="5 March 2013">Tuesday

they do, and the Minister is not only obliged to see these measures
through—he has a duty to do so—but is actually quite
privileged to be part of what I believe will be seen in the future as
incredibly important legislation. As the Secretary of State said, the
reforms that we are planning are “historic”. I think that
the Minister like me, would want to thank on the record his predecessor
as Minister, our right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam
(Paul Burstow), for the work that he did in introducing the Health and
Social Care Act 2012 and for his commitment over a long period of time

that how we deal with social care, and how we fund it, is one of the
biggest challenges that the Government face. To provide a local
context, Bradford has 79,000 people over the age of 65, and that number
will increase during the next 10 years to 85,000. The cost of caring
for people over 65 in Bradford will increase by £30 million by
2025, on demographics alone; that does not take into account the
increasing level and scale of need that people over 65 will have.
Across the Bradford district, it is estimated that 5,500 people have
dementia, but only 52% of those people are currently
diagnosed.</hs_Para>

this issue was so important that we could not ignore it. We not only
needed to find out what the local perspective was but beyond that we
needed to give an opportunity to people across Bradford, and not just
to people within my constituency, to contribute to legislation. We
carried out a survey; 35,000 survey forms were distributed. We also
carried out interviews with carers, users and stakeholders, and we held
a summit in January, which was attended by Baroness Barker, to report
back on our findings. I want to put on record my thanks to Bradford
council, Bradford Alliance on Community Care, Age UK Bradford and
District, Alzheimer’s Society Bradford, Ideal Care Homes, the
Bradford and District Disabled People’s Forum, the
Consortia of Ethnic Minority Organisations and the Carers’
Resource, whose help and support were received during the production of
the report; indeed, without their support we could not have compiled
the report, which we have already submitted to the Minister. We have
also received research and case studies from Scope, and we thank it for
that.</hs_Para>

that, although I may refer to one particular case study today, reading
the case studies that were submitted to us and that we collected was
the most disturbing aspect of the work we carried out. We can look at
statistics, figures, trends and analysis, but when  
<?notus-xml column=202?>we look at how the care system treats individuals—I have to say
that very often such care is not very good—the importance of
this issue really comes home to us.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030536000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000151">We made a
range of findings. Of course, funding is a crucial issue. We can look
at the background. Yes, we can say that it is for local authorities to
make priority decisions within their own areas, but that is happening
against a background of a reduction in funding to local authorities.
Many of the remedies that we came across required local solutions, but
the context is that there has been a 16% reduction in spending on
social care in Bradford in the past two years, and there is a proposed
further reduction of £7 million for
2013-14.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000152">We
found that enormous contributions are made by family, and often also by
friends, towards paying for the costs of care. In Bradford, 65% of the
residential homes charge top-up fees, and 21% of the contributions to
pay for those fees comes from family and friends. I must say that the
Dilnot proposals and principles received widespread support from the
people we contacted. In particular, it was interesting to note that
when we talked about the funding of social care, although the average
age of respondents was over 65, many of them regarded the funding of
social care from universal benefits to wealthier older people as being
their favoured way forward in order to address the funding gap. The
average house price in Bradford is £94,000, so people can
immediately see the benefit to a place such as Bradford of having a
£123,000 threshold by 2017. However, we worry about a national
cap because it represents a greater share of wealth in a place such as
Bradford, where there is much deprivation and lower incomes than
elsewhere, but the general principles are applauded.</hs_Para>

problems in Bradford with self-funders, who pay more than local
authority-funded care users. I think that there are provisions in the
Health and Social Care Act 2012 to look at finding a greater role for
the local authority in brokering services on behalf of self-funders,
which people welcomed.</hs_Para>

issue that cropped up time and time again, and not only in our
research; when I was a councillor, I held a hearing to try to get the
views of the elderly across the constituency and it cropped up then. It
is the issue of isolation and loneliness for the elderly, and it has
become an issue of the utmost importance. Age UK believes that 10% of
over-65s are either lonely or very lonely. Of course, there is not only
the impact of loneliness on how they a particular person feels there
and then but the impact on their long-term health. Indeed, there are
indications that isolation and loneliness may, in certain cases, lead
to premature death. In our survey, 95% of respondents believed that the
loneliness and isolation that I have referred to would have long-term
health repercussions for those affected.</hs_Para>

more local context, some cultural barriers to ethnic minority
communities’ acceptance of residential care were identified. We
believe that that issue needs to reviewed on a national basis, to see
whether any generalisation can be made from the particular experience
of Bradford.</hs_Para>

access to information was considered very important by respondents to
our survey, and the people’s increased dependence on online
access to information was not accepted as being the best way forward.
There is still a desperate need for face-to-face contact, so that
information can be transmitted to those 
<?notus-xml column=203?>who are often in a vulnerable position and who are entering a world they
have not been in before. For many people it will be
a completely different world, either as a receiver or user of care. It
will involve jargon, including technical terms, with which they are
simply not familiar and which require a personal input.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030536000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000157">The issue of
the fair access to care services—FACS—threshold is
crucial in Bradford. The idea of setting a national minimum standard,
as contained in the 2012 Act, is good, but the fear expressed by many
of our respondents was that that national minimum standard would result
in a levelling-down, not a levelling-up, of provision. That is because
the Lib Dem group in Bradford has fought hard to ensure that
“moderate” levels of need are supported, as opposed to
“substantial” levels. Scope has told us that in 2005 50%
of local authorities were operating on the basis of a
“moderate” threshold, but by 2012 84% of local
authorities had transferred to using a “substantial”
criteria threshold.</hs_Para>

that change in Bradford would mean that 800 18 to 64-year-olds and
1,300 over-65s would lose the support they receive? It may not sound
like a serious loss of support, because after all we are talking about
“moderate” levels of need. However, it pays for the
cooking, the cleaning and the support for learning opportunities. Such
opportunities encourage engagement and reduce isolation, and therefore
the loneliness that often accompanies old age. The long-term impact of
reducing loneliness means that it is a false economy in the long run to
save on things such as adaptations, which I will come on to in a
moment, and preventive support, which is how we regard the support for
people in “moderate” levels of need. It is a false
economy given the later costs that will be incurred by individuals, and
indeed by the state, in supporting those we have not dealt with at an
earlier stage of
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000159">The
issue of adaptations came through time and again. There were some
distressing case studies of people requiring special attention who were
let down by the system. I will mention one, although the report
contains more. I recently visited a gentleman who had had an
occupational injury. He was tetraplegic and after receiving fantastic
intensive support in Pinderfields, including occupational therapy, he
was returned to his own home, to another world. He received some
support—four times a day he was visited to help him get out of
bed with a hoist—but the rest was left up to him. He had no
idea. His wife was in despair, unsure about what financial support
would be available in future and how long the support they were
receiving would last. In addition, a ramp—a simple thing, some
might have thought—was taking months to arrive. The disparity
between the first-rate service in the NHS and the level of support
received once the gentleman returned home was stark and
depressing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000160">Approval
for the ramp was given, but its delivery and implementation was simply
dumped on the man’s wife, for her to sort out herself. A
temporary ramp was installed that the ambulance service refused,
for health and safety reasons, to use. That was the only ramp that she
could use to get him out of the door, and she had to do that on her own
because none of the services, for health and safety reasons, would use
it. That is not care; it is
careless.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000161">The
final part of the statement by the Secretary of State was about the
ultimate aim: where we would like to get to by the end. We want a good
place to grow old 
<?notus-xml column=204?>in, but that will not be achieved on the cheap. It is to the credit of
the Government that they have not waited until better times but have
identified the burning need to address the issue of the funding and
quality of social care. However, we must address the problem of how
this is funded. The measures have been proposed, and we will see how
the legislation
proceeds.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000162">We

funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000163">Mine
is unashamedly a Bradford perspective, but as with all research the key
is to look at the generalisations that stem from it. I hope that my
hon. Friend the Minister will take on board some areas that we have
identified in considering the national situation and carry out further
research on regional caps, adaptations,  the FACS threshold,
the contribution that changing the threshold will have on isolation and
loneliness, and  the subsequent increased costs to individuals
or the state of the failure to deal with what should be preventive
measures. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond to those

my hon. Friend, the coalition Government know how important it is to
reform the current system of care and support. The voices of the people
of Bradford reflect what we have heard from care users, their carers
and voluntary organisations across the country, regardless of who they
are or where they come from. They say that care and support needs to
change. We have to move from an old-fashioned paternalistic system,
where the council or the NHS knows best, to a personal system where we
give real power to individuals to determine what their priorities are,
what works for them and what makes them happy and contented in later
life, despite sometimes having acute care
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000166">My
hon. Friend rightly highlights the significant demographic challenge
facing us in years to come. About 14%—more than 71,000
people—of Bradford’s total population is aged 65 and
over. Bradford’s local joint strategic needs assessment for 2012
predicts that by 2033 the number of local people over 90 will triple
from 2,800 to 8,700. We should celebrate that. It is great that people
are living to be older and often enjoying great quality of life
for more years, but also many people live for years with more than one
acute condition, which presents a challenge for them, but also a cost
to 
<?notus-xml column=205?>society. Such a demographic shift will always be an
immense challenge. Only if the care and support system changes and
adapts can it meet the new demands and expectations of an ageing
population in modern
Britain.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000167">The
organisations that my hon. Friend mentioned are vital partners. This is
not something that Government or local government can do on their own.
The care and support White Paper, published in July last year, is an
important step towards addressing these challenges. Our reforms will
focus more attention on people’s well-being and independence
throughout their lives, instead of waiting for them to reach a crisis
point. They will also put people in control, giving them a far bigger
say in their own care and support, and ensure that services are
designed around their needs, rather than the needs of an
institution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000168">The
White Paper, together with the draft Care and Support Bill, will shape
the care sector for years to come. The draft Bill, which my hon. Friend
knows has been subject to pre-legislative scrutiny, sets out how we
will put the plans into law. For the first time, we will create a
single, modern statute, bringing everything together for adult care and
support. It is good that that is written in plain
English—English that people can actually understand without
being a lawyer—which is quite useful. That statute will be
clearer, fairer, and built around people, not processes, and around
individuals, not institutions. It will empower people in Bradford and
across the country to take
control.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000169">My
hon. Friend highlighted the importance of the reforms to funding
recommended by Andrew Dilnot. Last month, the Secretary of State for
Health announced groundbreaking proposals to cap the costs of long-term
care. That issue has been in the long grass for far too long.
Successive Governments have put it in the “too hard to
solve” category and just left it. As a result, ever more people
have suffered catastrophic loss, losing everything that they have
worked for. There is an acute unfairness in how the system almost
penalises people for having been prudent and careful throughout their
working
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000170">Individuals
currently have little or no protection against the cost of care in
older age. In Bradford, for example, some 5,000 people a year turn 65,
and around 500 of those people each year could face significant care
costs under the current system. Our reforms will ensure that everyone
gets the care they need. We are ending the unfairness of, and fear
caused by, unlimited care costs, while making sure that most support
goes to those in greatest need. People will be protected from having to
sell their home during their lifetime to pay for care.</hs_Para>

Government have committed to a £75,000 cap on care costs across
England in 2017. I note my hon. Friend’s concerns about the
cap’s geographical impact, and he proposes a regional cap as an
alternative. The cap provides the same financial protection for people
of equivalent wealth from different regions, and everyone will benefit
from more peace of mind. However, I would say to my hon. Friend that,
in some parts of the country, the costs of care are higher, so people
reach the cap more quickly because they have to spend more of their own
money. In a way, it is swings and roundabouts.</hs_Para>

thing I would stress—my hon. Friend was right to point this
out—is the significant increase in the range of means-tested
support. At the moment, if people 
<?notus-xml column=206?>have more than £23,250, they get no help at all; they are on
their own. That limit will be extended to £123,000. My hon.
Friend said the average house price in Bradford is £94,000, so a
substantial number of people there will get contributions towards their
care costs.</hs_Para>

spending review, we made clear our strong and ongoing commitment to
adult social care by prioritising an additional £7.2 billion
over four years—my hon. Friend raised concerns about tight
social care budgets. Independent research by the King’s Fund
supported our view that that should be enough for councils to maintain
services, provided they make sure those services are delivered
efficiently. Since that announcement of £7.2 billion, we have
added another £500 million. In the context of a challenging
local government settlement, that means that local authorities should
be able to protect access to care. Ultimately, however, it is for local
people and local authorities to determine their care spending
priorities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030536000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030536000174">We
cannot improve care and support simply by shovelling ever more money
into the system. My hon. Friend was right to say that we must do things
differently and work more efficiently to achieve better outcomes.
Critically, that will be about a partnership between statutory
authorities and the voluntary sector, including the organisations he
spoke warmly of, which can really make a difference.</hs_Para>

told us that the process of determining who is eligible for care and
support is confusing and unfair. Decisions are not transparent, and
they vary across the country. The result is that people are left
without the support they need. The draft Bill provides for the national
threshold my hon. Friend talked about. I understand his concern to
protect the moderate threshold that Bradford has managed to maintain,
and I applaud it for doing that. However, even if the threshold is set
at a higher level—it has not been determined yet—Bradford
will still be able to maintain a more generous system, if that is what
it chooses.</hs_Para>

Friend rightly focused on prevention as one of the key themes running
through our reforms. We want a care and support system that is
proactive and preventive, rather than reactive—repairing things
when they have gone wrong. Such a system helps people to stay healthy

their health throughout their lives so that they do not, we hope, have
to go into acute hospitals when everything goes wrong.</hs_Para>

Friend talked movingly about the problems of loneliness and isolation,
and it is critical that we challenge them. If people are on their own,
with no human contact, their mental and physical health will 
<?notus-xml column=207?>deteriorate. That is dreadful for them, but it is also costly for the

a word about integration. The White Paper sets out our ambition for
health, care and support to be organised around the individual’s
needs, rather than focusing on organisations and services. My hon.
Friend mentioned the case study involving the ridiculously long wait
for a ramp, which demonstrates how dysfunctional the system can be. It
is crazy that someone returning home needs that little adaptation to
maintain their independence, but it does not arrive for so long. That
puts them at risk of a fall, which would result in their returning to
hospital. That is a dysfunctional system. The Government’s
absolute focus on encouraging and incentivising areas to integrate
services across health and social care, and mental and physical health,
is critical to providing better care and support for
individuals.</hs_Para>

Local authorities should be working to meet the objective set out in
the vision for adult social care and provide personal budgets for
everyone eligible for ongoing social care. Preferably, that should take
the form of a direct payment to individuals, so that they can determine
exactly how they want the money to be spent. That should apply from

in her constituency and across London. More than four people stand per
square metre on all peak-time District line trains from Putney Bridge
to Earl’s Court. The same is true for Victoria line trains from
Finsbury Park to Victoria, for all Piccadilly line trains from Finsbury
Park to Holborn, for Bank branch Northern line trains from Clapham

more than four human beings cram into every square metre available just

some relief, of course, but such an attitude ignores the enduring

First, detailing the case for a new line, dubbed Crossrail 2, linking
south-west with north-east London. He will also notice the breadth of
support for Crossrail 2. It commands the support of London’s
businesses: 69% of members of the London Chamber of Commerce and
Industry say that Crossrail 2 is vital to London, and a ComRes poll
showed that 95% of London businesses believe that any cut to transport

why Crossrail 2 unites so many frequent foes is that the case for it is
utterly compelling. As Lord Adonis and his colleagues made it clear, it
is the only way that London will be able to cope with the challenges
that it will face over the next 20 years and handle the 700,000 extra
commuters who will be working in central London by 2031, and it is

still, the report sets out the case for a regional and suburban route
that will deliver immense benefits to London and beyond. It will
finally bring tube stations to Mare street in Hackney, and it will
double train frequency to places such as Kingston and Twickenham. It
will also free track for South West Trains to increase the number of
trains from Portsmouth, Basingstoke, Southampton and Farnham to London
Waterloo that serve stations throughout Hampshire and Berkshire. Most
importantly, it will provide a reliable train service and huge economic
benefits to some of the most isolated and deprived areas of the Upper

also be developed from Cheshunt through to Stansted airport, providing
a stopping service on new tracks to complement a more frequent and
faster Stansted express service. Not only could that mean better use of
the excess capacity at Stansted airport, it would mean that communities
with some of the highest unemployment rates in the country could
benefit economically from having an airport on their doorstep and a new
line connecting areas such as Northumberland Park, Edmonton, Tottenham,
Dalston, Hackney and Wood Green to central London, Clapham, Wimbledon
and Stansted station. It would clearly leverage investment from
businesses and developers, create jobs each year after it had been

number of runways and its total airport capacity? I think it has more
than any other city in Europe, with the exception of Paris, which has
one more runway. The problem in London is that we do not make good use
of the capacity that we have. The point that he has just made, which is
exactly right, is that by extending Crossrail to Stansted, for which
the current Mayor of London has been pushing hard, at a stroke we would
transform Stansted, which is only half used at the moment, into a

development. It is extraordinary that the line currently running from
Stansted to Liverpool Street is as chaotic, delay-prone and slow as it
is. Clearly, efforts must be made to improve that service. He is
absolutely right: a lot of attention has been paid to airport capacity.
That is not the subject of this debate, but it is clear that investment
in our train capacity, so that people can move around the city, will
take a fine eye and focus. I hope that it will command the attention
not just of the Mayor, as he rightly pointed out, but of the

Crossrail 2 is ambitious. Its ambition comes with a price tag, but the

business of kicking things slightly into the long grass as one
negotiates hard with the Treasury, but let us not forget that Crossrail
2 is quite long in the tooth. Part of the route was originally
conceived as early as 1901, only to be dropped five years later. After
the second world war, the idea of a Chelsea to Hackney line peppered
almost every London rail study. In the early 1990s a route was finally
safeguarded, and mutations of it have slowly been making their way
between Whitehall in-trays ever since. Successive Governments have
already had time to contemplate and consider the plan. It is now time

outlined, London’s congestion problems will come to a head

doubt be completed, owned and amended by successive Governments, it is
critical that we establish cross-party support now, before the
parliamentary cycle begins to gear up for the 2015 general election. In
that spirit, I invite the Minister to address the inaugural meeting of
the all-party group on Crossrail 2 that I am hoping to set up with
colleagues here and in the other place over the coming weeks. Most
importantly, will he detail exactly when he expects the review of the
safeguarded route to begin, with an outline of the process involved,

Government’s role is not only to take leadership on this issue

spending review outlined funding for the Department for Transport only
up until 2014-15, scrapping the long-term funding guarantee in 
<?notus-xml column=214?>previous spending reviews that provided a 10-year forecast of budgets.
In December 2012, therefore, we had the ludicrous scenario of Transport
for London publishing a 10-year business plan that could only outline
funding up until 2014-15. If that practice continues in the second
spending review later this year, TfL will still have no certainty over
its funding settlement after the 2015-16 financial year. It is clear
that we need a proper funding settlement and that that need is great.

announce his membership of the national union of Ministers and will he

the debate and on his powerful and eloquent support for Crossrail 2. I

Londoners travel out to businesses in Milton Keynes. That is
exemplified by the new Network Rail headquarters, which is based in the
centre of Milton Keynes. I want to make a short contribution to the
debate for two reasons: first, to talk about the improved connectivity
that a scheme such as Crossrail 2 could deliver; and, secondly, wearing

know the commuting line to and from Milton Keynes well, and the volume
of passengers into and out of Euston at the morning and evening peaks
is growing. Getting on a Victoria or Northern line tube train is an art
at times; it is not uncommon to let two, three or four trains go
through before being able to board one. The upgrade to the Victoria
line with the new stock has improved the situation, but I suspect that
it has merely bought time and that in a few years the line will be as
congested as ever. Having a line such as Crossrail 2 going through
Euston, therefore, would be a major benefit to arriving commuter
passengers. It would improve 
<?notus-xml column=215?>connectivity with different parts of London, make public transport more
attractive and encourage a modal shift, with all the environmental
benefits that that would gain. It would be a win-win for Londoners and
for people in the northern home counties and beyond travelling into
London. To strike a slightly confrontational note with the Minister,

second point is in the context of High Speed 2. If HS2 goes ahead with
its planned route into Euston, that will deliver a huge increase in the
number of passengers into and out of the station. For the reasons I
mentioned, I fear that the existing tube network will not be able to
cope. Yes, some passengers will get off at Old Oak Common and come into
central London via Crossrail 1, but not all will. I suspect that a
comparatively small percentage of the arrivals will want Euston as
their destination; they will want to travel on to other parts of
London. If they are faced with enormous congestion at Euston, the
attractiveness of HS2 will be diminished and its business case
undermined; however, Crossrail 2 feeding in more people to use HS2 from

improved transport links in London more generally, so it is important
that we are having the debate

between south-west and north-east London. I urge the Minister, when
considering Crossrail 2, to think more strategically about
the transport needs of London as a whole. For my constituents, one of
the most important issues in public transport is extension of the
Bakerloo line from Elephant and Castle, where it currently stops,
through Southwark to Lewisham and then to join the Hayes line. That
would provide huge benefits in relieving congestion on existing
transport routes to London, and would support growth in south-east
London and Canary
Wharf.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030538000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030538000047">I
want to take a couple of minutes to share with hon. Members some of the
reasons why that transport route is equally important to the strength
of London’s economy. At the moment, my constituents rely heavily
on overland trains, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham
said. The recent census figures show that one in five of the working
population in Lewisham uses trains to get to work, and the number in
Bromley is similar. At the moment, south-east London benefits from the
East London line, which runs through Honor Oak and Forest Hill to
Crystal Palace, but that skirts the western border of south-east
London, and the tube network does not extend into south-east London,
although we are fortunate in having the docklands light
railway.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030538000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030538000048">Overcrowding
on overland trains to London Bridge and Cannon Street is unbearable for
my constituents. I regularly take the train to London Bridge and it is
unpleasant to be stuck in the armpit of a stranger. Overcrowding during
the rush hour is intense and there is a desperate need to relieve that
congestion. The benefit of bringing the tube network to south-east
London would be felt not just in people’s quality of life, but
in the planned regeneration projects in south-east London.</hs_Para>

Lewisham are two of the fastest growing boroughs in London, and it is
projected that by 2030 Lewisham’s population will be 346,000,
which is 70,000 more than at the moment. The rise in Southwark’s
population will be similar. We have a terrifically young population who
want to access job opportunities  in central London. Those huge
population increases in south-east London mean that we must find a way
to transport people around. Lewisham plans to build 18,000 homes by
2026, and when new developments go up in our town centres my
constituents come to me to ask how people will get on trains because
they are already full. There is a desperate need in south-east London
to address capacity on public
transport.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030538000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030538000050">The
links from Lewisham in particular to Canary Wharf are strategically
important. Canary Wharf as a commercial and business centre has grown
very quickly. I understand that its working population is about
100,000, and I am told that by 2025 it will have doubled to 200,000. We
have read about the problems in the financial sector, but there will be
huge growth in that part of London. Linking the population of
south-east London to those opportunities by extending the Bakerloo
line, through a connection to the DLR, is terrifically important. The
centre of economic activity in London is shifting eastwards, so when
this and future Governments consider how to address strategic transport
needs they should look at London as a whole.</hs_Para>

century’s legacy will be. Whether it is Crossrail 2 or Crossrail
3, London is a fantastic world city that will continue to grow, and we
must find a way of moving people around and getting them from their
homes to their jobs so that they can enjoy the most this incredible

on securing the debate, and apologise for the fact that I was not here
at the beginning. His battle for Tottenham is akin to the one we fought

want to pick up on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Lewisham East (Heidi Alexander) about the need to absorb growth. It
takes me back to when I was mayor of Islington in the late 1990s. Angel
station was revamped from a grotty little station to a brand new one
with platforms so wide that you could park a car on them. That station
is already overcrowded. Canary Wharf just about manages to cope with
the crowds as does, arguably, Westminster, but it will not be
long—perhaps a decade—before there will too much be
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030538000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030538000055">When
we set up the mayoral system in 2000, there was a decision on the first
Mayor’s desk. His job was to develop transport and planning
strategies for London. After much thought and discussion, the then
Mayor, Ken Livingstone, decided that we would absorb population growth
in London instead of having another wave of new-town building with new
towns such as Milton Keynes. London was set to grow from then until
2015—we are still part of the way through that growth—by
the equivalent of a city the size of Leeds. All the experience that
hon. Members have outlined about the difficulty of squeezing on to
tubes, whether travelling from Milton Keynes or Hackney, demonstrates
that growth. Whenever I cannot get on the tube, I think back to those
discussions when I was a member of the London assembly with my right
hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham back in 2000. We are now seeing
the impact of that.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=218?><hs_Para UID="13030538000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030538000056">Part of that
strategy was to have a transport hierarchy. We encouraged people to
change their transport habits so that those who travelled by tube would
get on the bus, and the then Mayor greatly improved the buses. We then
wanted people who travelled by bus to walk and cycle. Cycling increased
massively after the 7/7 bombings, when the tragedy made people think
about their transport and get into the habit of cycling. I represent
the borough that has the highest number of cyclists of any borough in
London, and perhaps anywhere in England. The history of it is
long-standing, and it has grown with population
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030538000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030538000057">The
then Mayor invested massively in bus transport, and bus ridership rose
7% during the first two terms of the London assembly and Transport for
London. I am sure that the Minister is aware that Transport for London
is a model for a good transport authority. Sadly, there is a slight
reversal with the stealth cuts in bus services. The frequency of the
242 bus in my constituency has fallen from 10 an hour to around seven
an hour. It is the only bus serving the Clapton Park and Nye Bevan
estates to and from Homerton hospital, and with six bus stops on those
estates the cut in service is a big one for my constituents. When I
raised the issue with Transport for London, it argued that the East
London line, which I will mention in a moment, solved the problems.
Well, that is not the case for someone who lives on the Clapton Park
estate and who has to walk up the hill every morning, or for older
ladies or men who have to wait for the bus so they can take their
shopping home.</hs_Para>

has recently seen a similar reduction, with every other off-peak bus
turning at Hackney Central. That is fine for people who want to get off
there or anywhere between there and Victoria, but not for those who
live anywhere between Hackney Central and Clapton pond, as many of my
constituents do. I therefore urge the Minister to look back at the
glory days of London bus travel and to bear these issues in mind when
he looks at budgets and policy for buses. Unless the bus service is
good, the transport hierarchy will not work. People will not get off
the train and on to the bus, because they will not be sure the bus will
get them where they want to go on time. Once we lose that reliability,
things could start going backwards from the huge achievement we saw in
London.</hs_Para>

the issue of my constituency and borough, London was to absorb the huge
growth I mentioned. My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham East
described what has happened in her neck of the woods. Similarly,
Hackney grew by 30,000 people between the last two censuses. Those are
mostly under-fives, and I confess I have contributed to that, having
given birth in the past few years. There are also a lot of young people
in their 20s and early 30s. Another 30,000 people will be born in
Hackney by 2020, so there will be exponential growth. A lot of that has
been boosted by some of the new private and public sector housing
developments.</hs_Para>

putting public transport under great pressure, and we need to look at
how we change travel routes. Boosting the North London line was a great
move by Transport for London, and we all applauded the fact that it
took over the route. We had a disciplined campaign in support of the
East London line, which serves stations from Dalston Junction, slightly
north of my constituency —it was in my constituency when
it was built, but we then had a boundary change—right down to
New Cross. 
<?notus-xml column=219?>The line has been hugely successful—it is impossible to get a

learns lessons from the East London line campaign as we campaign for
the much-needed benefits of Crossrail 2. It was a disciplined campaign.
We were all urged to ask not for lots of whizzy things to make our
stations even more beautiful, but for basic stations and basic rolling
stock to ensure that we had the service running. Of course, we were
fortunate that there was an existing rail line. There were regular
meetings between local authorities, officers and elected Members from
across the board. Every time a problem came up, we discussed how we
would deal with it as a group, rather than striking out alone to argue
that Hackney should have something better than Tottenham, or that
Tottenham should have something better than Hackney, much as we might
have felt like doing that. We realised it was better to focus on
discipline and to achieve the ultimate end. The East London line opened
in 2010, and it has been a huge success.</hs_Para>

the London Assembly, I also represented Waltham Forest. The council had
a good plan at the time—this was between 2000 and 2004—to
get people into jobs at Stansted airport. The transport links were
there to make that easy. Hackney, which is virtually the same distance
away, but which did not have the transport links, did not have the same
jobs programme. The difference was phenomenal, and that has been one of
the things driving my support for these new transport links. I saw the
stark difference transport links made when I represented the boroughs
of Waltham Forest and Hackney.</hs_Para>

railway lines, there are also issues about homes. There has been a
housing boom along the East London line. That is quite a good thing. If
we are to change travel habits and travel patterns, we need
people not to go through the centre of London, so it is good to boost
our suburban and outer-London areas. However, there is also the issue
of prices and rents going up, which has a huge impact on many of my
constituents. I am delighted that, among other developments, Peabody is
building a number of affordable housing units at Pembury Circus, with a
mix of properties for rent, sale, social rent, part-buy and so on.
After a long campaign by me and many residents of the Kingsland and
Haggerston West estates, London and Quadrant Housing Association is
finally building there. Those changes are happening close to the rail
links, and that will make a difference.</hs_Para>

passing, although it is important, that Hackney is very much against
the Government’s proposal to allow offices to be easily
converted into homes under a light-touch planning rules. That would be
disastrous for my borough, where there are jobs, and where office space
is used properly by a range of creative businesses. Those businesses
are an engine room for the British economy. I hope bits of the
Government are having a 
<?notus-xml column=220?>word with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government
about the folly of his race to build inappropriate homes in the wrong
places. The occupants of No. 10 and No. 11 regularly appear in
Shoreditch, which the Prime Minister calls “Tech City”,
although it is still known as Shoreditch to the people who live and
work there, while someone else’s Department is saying that we
should turn vacant offices into homes. That would be a mistake. Those
properties would be chichi loft apartments for certain strata of
people, not homes for local families who live in overcrowded conditions
in my area. Although I want travel links to spur the building of
homes—again, building homes near transport links fits into the
hierarchy of transport because people have to travel less if they live
near stations—I do not want that to happen at the expense of our
valuable office space.</hs_Para>

through their Mayor and Transport for London, being more in control of
the lines that serve them and help them get to their jobs. That is a
good step. I hope we will see a similar openness and engagement from
the Minister on Crossrail 2. I know he is not in a position to wave a
magic wand or, more importantly, a cheque book at the moment, or to
give us absolute deadlines, but I hope that, in the spirit of openness

clearly a persuasive document—almost as persuasive as the
passionate speech by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Tottenham—but there are questions to be answered. Crossrail 2 is
an expensive project. The report costs it at about £12 billion.
How will it be paid for? What relationship does it have to HS2, which
was recently given the go-ahead by the Government, at a cost of
£34
billion?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030544000007">There
is a growing consensus that the completion of the second phase of HS2
will have significant consequences for the London transport system.
Again, the report makes that clear. Even without HS2, passenger
arrivals at Euston in the morning peak period are set to rise by 30% by
2031, and HS2 would perhaps double the number of people arriving at
that time. That would seem to make the Crossrail 2 interchange at
Euston essential. If HS2 and Crossrail 2 are interdependent schemes,
surely their planning and funding must be looked at together.</hs_Para>

question, however: where is the money to come from? It has been
suggested that the funding stream from Crossrail 1 could be redirected
to Crossrail 2, but has not that money already been
allocated to HS2? Obviously HS2 and Crossrail 2 cannot be funded at the
same time with the same moneys. Could businesses make a contribution?
After all, they will undoubtedly gain, as well as commuters. At the
time of Crossrail 1 the then Labour Government gave the Mayor the power
to introduce a business rate supplement. Could that happen with
Crossrail 2? Has the Minister had any discussions with the Mayor or
with businesses about contributing to the
cost?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0001.htm#13030544000009">Indeed,
what discussions have been taking place at all? I should like to know
how much preparatory work the Government have already undertaken on the
project. In particular, what analysis have Ministers made of the impact
on London’s transport system of HS2 without Crossrail 2? That is
the crucial
question.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000010">Transport
systems are naturally interlinked. One part affects the others.
Crossrail 2 is about London, of course, but it connects to other parts
of the country. Our transport policy needs to be nationwide. How does
the Minister think Crossrail 2 fits in with the bigger transport
picture? It is vital that essential transport

intelligent speech. His opening remarks rightly stressed the history,
from which, of course, we can learn. He is right: here we are
celebrating 150 years of London Underground. London has long relied on
transport for its prosperity. The first underground trains, in the 19th
century, brought prosperity to London and the suburbs, as the right
hon. Gentleman said, but that process has continued through the

future of London’s economy will depend on transport systems, and
the right hon. Gentleman is right to say we must think about what
London needs in the long term to meet the demands of the economy, as
well as of the people who live here. A modern, customer-focused
transport system should meet that rising demand. Several hon. Members
have referred to the demand forecast that shows that, without
additional investment, crowding, on which we have made some progress,
will return to unacceptable levels. There have been several comments on
the growth of this great city, and it is right to think about the
challenges that will arise as we try to meet demand for 2030 and
beyond. The debate about Crossrail 2 is an opportunity to consider how
to meet some of the
challenges.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000013">I

First. The hon. Member for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue) was right to
praise the work that Andrew Adonis did. The proposal was also supported
by the Mayor. I understand that it would provide a north-east to
south-west transport link that would complement the current Crossrail
project, and that it would complement and work alongside the tube
upgrade project. It would also have the potential to support increased
journeys right across the capital. As several hon. Members have pointed
out, it would also, of course, help to create jobs, both directly, in
construction, and indirectly, in communities. The right hon. Member for
Tottenham spoke about what it could do for his constituency, and it
would also have an effect in Hackney and the Lea Valley. Perhaps I
should declare an interest, because I hope that it will bring jobs to
Wimbledon

they will work in conjunction with Network Rail. Several hon. Members

the right hon. Gentleman was agreeing with me. Something particularly

Maidenhead, but some of the works further out at Reading. That is all
as a result of work on Crossrail. The linkages with Network Rail are

reaffirm that the Government will work with TfL to safeguard the route
for Crossrail 2, which is scheduled to start later this year. It is
essential that we do so, because we have agreed with TfL that the
previous safeguarding, which was last updated in 2008, would leave

obviously right, but, as Crossrail 1 comes to an end in about 2018, we
want a transfer of engineers, project managers and others on to
Crossrail 2. I suspect that that will be part of the Mayor’s

Gentleman’s point. That is why, in terms of the next stages, the
challenge for TfL—I could have gone into it in greater depth,
but he understood the point that I was making about why it is important
for TfL to lead—is to go from the London First report into
schematic detail and engineering detail. Those sorts of issues can be
thought about and a business case properly developed only once the
initial work is done. Clearly, one challenge for the Mayor and the

a comprehensive business case in the near future.</hs_Para>

Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch said, that I do not have a
cheque book in my back pocket and I will not be wielding it this
afternoon. I can, however, give this commitment: before the next
spending review, the onus is clearly on the Government to give serious
consideration to Crossrail 2, its business case and the options for
funding, and we will do so. The challenge, therefore, is for the Mayor
to come forward with a proposition—a business case—that
could be delivered in time for this spending review, and if not, it
potentially looks to be a post-election issue. We can commit to giving
the issue serious consideration, but the Mayor needs to develop that
business case.</hs_Para>

We have protected capital spending in spending round 10. We are
determined to invest in essential infrastructure to support the
economic recovery, both in London and nationally. We want to prioritise
the schemes that offer best value for the taxpayers’ pound and
the best growth potential. The business case must be developed and it
is essential, therefore, that the Mayor and TfL show that the
efficiency of the spending that they are using in this spending round,
and in this spending review period, can be continued. The Mayor needs
to ensure that there is the same rigour as has been seen—we
would like to see more rigour—in terms of the efficiency of how
he is spending the taxpayers’ pound when he develops the
business case. For instance, it is also clear that in central
Government we have borne down on administrative costs in that area.
Administrative costs across Whitehall in this spending review have gone
down by 33%, which is important. It is important to show that where we

efficiently.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000024">The

Government—I would expect nothing less—in terms of the
picture that he gave about investment in London. It was certainly not a
picture that I recognised. A massive amount of transport investment is
going into London. The Government have clearly, and rightly, recognised
that London is the economic engine of the UK economy. In the last
spending review, we provided TfL and the Mayor with a settlement,
despite the tough economic environment, that allowed progress on the
tube upgrade, Thameslink, and Crossrail. They have had certainty
through this spending round, and another settlement and spending round

33%. The Victoria line upgrade that was completed in January this year
gave another 21% capacity. Delays on the underground have been reduced

exactly the challenge. We have done these things to catch up.

Government are clearly committed to supporting transport in London. Of
course, it should not be the default position that the Government fund
everything. In a world of constrained public sector resources, it has
been recognised, rightly, that there is a role for alternative
financing mechanisms, such as tax increment financing and the community
infrastructure levy. I have no doubt that in formulating the business
case for Crossrail 2, the Mayor will be considering those as well. We
want TfL, 
<?notus-xml column=227?>London boroughs and the Mayor to share in the profits of London’s
growth, giving them a much greater incentive to invest in
business-friendly measures and to work with business to develop the
measures that will ensure the regeneration and continued growth of this
great city. That is one reason why some of those important changes took
place in local government
finance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000037">The

group and the local community, a campaign to save Erdington walk-in
centre—a centre at the heart of our local community and
considered one of the best of its kind. It is being threatened with
closure as a consequence of a review by the Birmingham and Solihull
national health service of all walk-in centres in the city. The threat

walk-in patients from 8 am to 8 pm, seven days a week, including bank

centre. The centre participates in accident and emergency diversion
when necessary and accepts some category C ambulance referrals. It has
close links with two other units in the same building—the New

would be forced to go to A and E. However, because Paul was able to

A and E departments are themselves being closed. Before the 2010
general election, the Prime Minister toured marginal seats, promising
to save accident and emergency facilities in a cynical attempt to win
votes. He promised a “bare-knuckle fight”—those

and a half years into this Parliament, we have seen broken promise
after broken promise from the Prime Minister on the national health
service. Not only has he cut NHS spending in real terms but his
Government’s reckless approach to top-down reorganisation is
creating increasing pressures and consequently casualties, which might
include the walk-in centres on Erdington High street and in
Kingstanding in my constituency. The message before the election was
one that valued those walk-in centres; the message after the election
has been very different, with more and more services being
closed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030538000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030538000086">What
has been the response of the Government thus far to the closure of 54
walk-in centres nationally since 2010? They have made the local NHS
responsible for NHS walk-in centres. It is true that the last Labour
Government realised that local people best know what is in their
interest, so allowing health and well-being decisions to be taken
locally, including through primary care trusts. Given what is now
happening, however, I have to say to the Minister that if he dams the
river at its source, he should not be surprised if the water runs dry
downstream.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030538000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030538000087">In
conclusion, the Erdington and Kingstanding walk-in centres both provide
accessible high-quality medical care to thousands of local people. I
again stress that the Kingstanding one is located in one of the poorest
wards in the whole of Britain. There is no alternative service within
the immediate locality. If the vital centres on Erdington High street
and in Kingstanding close, the hard work of the dedicated staff that
has gone into the development of the walk-in centres will be wasted, as
will the considerable investment that has gone into them, and local
people will again have to travel miles for their urgent care
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030538000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030538000088">The

blow. That is why, with the user group and the local community, I have
led a campaign against closure for the past five months, and that is
why I bring this unmistakable message from the community I represent to
Parliament today. I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to meet
representatives of the patient and user group. It is right
that the case for the walk-in centre be heard on the Floor of the

to the local context, it would be remiss of me not to pick up the
issues of national consequence raised by the hon. Gentleman. This
Government will have invested £12.5 billion more in the NHS
between the last election and the one in 2015, which is providing some,
albeit small, real-terms growth in the NHS budget. Even though we are
in difficult economic times, the Government have made a clear
commitment that the NHS is a special case that needs further
investment, which we are providing. It might be worth the hon.
Gentleman taking that up with one of his Front-Bench colleagues, the
right hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), who in contrast said that
such investment was irresponsible. Indeed, the Labour party running the
NHS in Wales intends to make an 8% real-terms cut in its budget. It is
worth reflecting on the reality of the situation before getting drawn
into any political
rhetoric.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030538000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030538000091">The
hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington is right to raise the specific
pressures on A and E. We know that A and Es are being accessed by
increasing numbers of patients, and we know from history that one key
driver of that was the previous Government’s decision to
contract out out-of-hours GP care away from local GPs. One direct
consequence of that has been additional pressures on accident and
emergency departments. In many ways, that pulls against what he spoke
about and what I believe in, which is the need to deliver more and
higher-quality care in the community. That cannot be nine-to-five or
nine-to-six care in the community; it has to be all-day, 24/7 care,
which is what integrated good health care looks like. I believe that
the decision was bad. I saw its consequences when I worked as a
casualty doctor in A and E. We have lived to regret it, and it has been
badly to the detriment of
patients.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030538000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030538000092">The
report on the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust graphically
outlined the fact that targets have often got in the way of front-line
patient care. That is why this Government, when they came to power,
relaxed the 98% target for the four-hour wait in A and E and set it at
95%, which doctors, nurses and my fellow health-care professionals said
was in the best interests of patients. Too often the four-hour target
meant that a patient who perhaps had a broken toe was given priority
ahead of a patient with potentially life-threatening chest pain. That
was not good medicine or patient care, but showed targets getting in
the way of looking after patients effectively, a lesson that was
graphically depicted in the Francis report on the Mid Staffordshire
trust. We must learn such lessons and acknowledge that although targets
can have a place in health care, we have to trust and listen to
front-line health care professionals if we are to deliver high-quality
care for
patients.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030538000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030538000093">On

delivery of care and facilities to improve patient outcomes, develop
services closer to home and, most importantly, save lives. We are clear

local health-care services, strengthened arrangements for public

would be wrong not to talk about the winter pressures faced by the NHS.
In response to those pressures, we have put about £330 million
of additional money into the NHS to deal with them. I am aware that
local hospitals in the Birmingham area recently issued a statement
advising patients to attend A and E only for matters requiring urgent
attention, because of the pressures of demand experienced by emergency
departments. There is always more pressure on the NHS during winter
months, with more demand on urgent and emergency care services, and
this year is not different. During October and November 2012, NHS
Midlands and East scrutinised winter plans, escalation triggers and
protocols across its health economies, and it is monitoring pressure on

learned from my recent visit to PRM Green Technologies was very
interesting. Here was a local firm exhibiting strong and sustained
growth, and providing much-needed jobs for local people; in fact, it
recruited especially from the disadvantaged and long-term unemployed.
Yet it appears to be deliberately operating at a competitive
disadvantage, because it has long been the IT recycling
industry’s standard to charge end users and organisations,
including public bodies such as schools and hospitals, to dispose of
all their old, unwanted and end-of-life IT equipment. However, PRM
offers that service for free while remaining a profitable
business.</hs_Para>

organisation has finished using its IT equipment—whether that
equipment is computers, laptops or other hardware—and wants to
get rid of it securely, which is an important issue that I will come on
to in a minute, the accepted practice is to pay a firm to collect the
equipment and take it away. There are sensible reasons for doing so,
because a company is paying not only for its items of IT equipment to
be collected as people might pay to have household waste collected but
for a service whereby the data left on them will be wiped and they will
be securely recycled. That is especially important if there is
sensitive material on the equipment, as might be the case if the
computer had been used in a hospital to store medical files, by the
police for criminal records or by a school or care home to store data
on vulnerable children. The last thing that we want is British police
computer data ending up for sale on second-hand computers in Iraq, as
has happened
recently.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000045">However,
PRM Green Technologies in Cannock offers all those services—the
collection, the secure recycling and the data wiping—for free,
and does so at a national level. Its business model does not charge the
service user a single penny to recycle their redundant and end-of-life
or damaged IT equipment. As I learned on my visit, the company already
has more than 4,000 customers, who enjoy a service that is
completely—100%—free of charge.</hs_Para>

this important, and why have I secured the debate? Well, I have a
simple question this afternoon: if this service is available for free,
to nationally agreed standards of data cleansing, why would any
organisation—public or private—pay for the same service?
If we think about it, this process has the potential to be incredibly
important for the public sector as a whole, which, as we know, is
already struggling to deal with budget reductions in this age of
austerity. If a school spends money on paying to have its old IT
equipment recycled, that money cannot be spent on teachers, sports
facilities or a new playground. If an NHS trust spends money on paying
to have its old IT equipment recycled, that money cannot be spent on
doctors, nurses or medicine, and if a council spends money on paying to
have its old IT equipment recycled, that money cannot be spent on
libraries, leisure facilities or resurfacing roads, which are services
that we know all our constituents rely on and prioritise.</hs_Para>

just one example. Many of PRM’s customers are education
providers, such as schools, colleges and universities. The company
calculates that it alone has saved the education sector in excess of
£5 million, which is the same amount of money that could have
employed a total of 237 teachers. Just imagine what that could mean if
the system were rolled out nationally? If a small company from Cannock,
with 28 employees, can effectively pay the salaries of 237 teachers,
how many more teachers could be provided nationally if school budgets
were better managed? This one firm also has 17 local authorities on its
books, as well as three NHS health care trusts. Again, think of how
many council staff or medical professionals could be employed if all
the other local authorities or health care trusts in the UK did not
waste their budgets on paying to have their old IT equipment
recycled.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000048">I
have a number of questions for the Minister. First, what can the
Government do to make public bodies aware that there are
companies—not just PRM in my constituency but other
companies—that will absorb all the costs of recycling all of
their old IT equipment? Secondly, what can we do to ensure that public
bodies do not waste their budgets on IT recycling and instead spend
every penny on the front line? Thirdly, will he start the process with
his own Department and write to me to say whether the Cabinet Office
spends any of its departmental budget on disposing of its old
computers? Finally, will his Department write to the other Whitehall
Departments to ask similar questions of
them?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000049">I
ask those questions now because if so many organisations, bodies and
individuals can already see the benefit of using PRM—not only
once, but time and again—why are more sections of society,
industry and Government not waking up to the fact that, even in these
austere times, there are companies run by individuals such as those
sitting in the Gallery today that will charge nothing for IT recycling?
If they did wake up to that fact, they could—indeed,
would—make a difference to their organisation’s ability
to serve the public.</hs_Para>

that, we need to go slightly further. We must ask ourselves what
challenges, real or perceived, prevent Government Departments or larger
parts of the civil service from availing themselves of such a service
provision for no cost whatever, and therefore from providing far
greater value for money for the taxpayer?</hs_Para>

to PRM when I visited its facility, I learned that
the biggest issue regarding Government assets would
appear to be security. The feedback that PRM receives is that the
possibility of events such as data being lost, assets going untracked
and personnel entering sites without the correct checks being in place
presents great concerns.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030544000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000052">People might
ask, “Are companies that perform this service for free actually
capable of providing the level of data security required, and yet still
maintaining zero costs?” To do so, all of a company’s
staff would need to be vetted to BS7858 standards. Its premises would
need to protected by several layers of physical security, including two
external rings of steel, 24-hour security guards, CCTV monitoring 24
hours a day, monitored alarm systems, internal access control and
interior steel cages that are protected 24 hours a day. All that
security is needed to ensure that the data remains secure once it has
been collected from an organisation and before it is deleted and wiped.
A company would need to destroy data assets using Government-approved
software and devices, as well as special shredding techniques. Its
vehicles would need to be fully liveried, satellite-tracked and have
CCTV on board, to further protect the assets that the company carries
on behalf of its service users. Surely a company cannot do all of that
without charging its customers. Well, companies can and do. PRM does
all that, and other companies around the country do it too. Quite
simply, there is no catch. And if PRM and other companies can do that,
concerns about data security need not be valid and need not be a reason
to continue with existing paid-for IT collection
contracts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000053">How
does PRM manage to offer such a service? It does so because it extracts
every little bit of residual value from every kilogram of every item
that it collects and processes, and because it has chosen to model its
business in this way it ensures that it extracts maximum value from IT
equipment, therefore guaranteeing minimum waste and landfill. If a
company has to absorb its own collection costs, not least the petrol
and the vans, let alone the infrastructure that I have described, it
makes sure that it extracts every bit of residual value from every
kilogram of every item of IT equipment it collects, because it has
to.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000054">However,
here is the depressing bit. Although companies such as PRM Green
Technologies can offer that service, increasingly Departments and the
NHS are unable to respond to its unique offer. In initial contacts, PRM
often talks directly to the responsible IT department or the finance
department, but often it finds that current contracts blanket-cover all
aspects of a service, otherwise known as the dreaded outsourcing, or
facilities management. By way of a total tangent, these are the same
sort of all-inclusive outsourced contracts that led to the TV chef,
James Martin, discovering that Welsh hospitals could not buy Welsh lamb
to serve to their patients, because their outsourced contractor bought
all its lamb from New Zealand, even though lambs were literally grazing
on fields outside the hospital and local farmers could charge almost
50% less than the New Zealand imports. I digress, and that is a debate
for another time, but the point is valid. Even if a Department wanted
to be involved, it is often tied into a cost-making
exercise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000055">Senior
people in a Department or buyers in councils are often surprised that
this free service even exists. What should be most shocking of all to
the Minister is 
<?notus-xml column=237?>that often, their tendering model cannot cope with assessing tenders
that have a negative or zero value in the calculation. Perhaps the
Minister will think about that for second: because councils cannot
conceive of not paying for the service, the computer says no. That
being so, we must examine the charges that are incurred across every
part of Government and question the structure of contracts. Those
charges appear to be part of much larger and more complex contracts of
service provision, which we need to investigate to render them more
transparent for the public
good.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000056">What
can be done to ensure better procurement of goods and services
throughout the public sector, allowing schools, hospitals, police
forces and councils to avail themselves of a free IT recycling service?
Perhaps we as a society need to rethink our negative attitudes to
people who offer something for nothing. In this instance, that should
not apply, because as I have already explained there is always residual
value in IT equipment, which all providers need to ensure that their
commercial model is viable. In short, even companies that are paid to
collect unwanted computer equipment still need to be able to sell them
on or break them down for parts to be a viable, profitable business.
The difference is that some companies, such as PRM, have the social
conscience not to skim extra cream off the
top.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000057">All
that the organisations need to know, whether police forces, councils,
hospitals, or businesses, is one thing: where are their assets going to
end up? It makes more business sense for IT recycling providers to
ensure that they can extract maximum value from assets without charge
to the service user. If they get paid only for what they can repair,
refurbish and resell, or recycle in full, it cannot be in their
interest to dump or dispose of these items incorrectly, as they will
not get a penny for any item dealt with in such a manner. With
asset-tracking and reporting systems in place, the customer can be
further reassured of their good
intentions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000058">There
is no inherent greater security in a firm that charges to pick up IT
equipment, and then recycles it and sells it on, than in a firm that
picks it up for free before recycling it and selling it on. In fact,
the reverse may be true. If a company is making a margin on picking up
the goods, they arguably have less incentive to securely recycle them
and squeeze out every penny of margin, as they already have some cash
in the bank simply from collecting the
items.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000059">Perhaps
the greatest problem presents itself when the very people tasked with
ensuring that assets are disposed of correctly are poorly equipped,
through no fault of their own, to make an informed decision about how
to deal with that problem. For example, the head teacher of a primary
school, who deals with the school’s entire IT assets and
support, may receive little direction on how to approach the challenges
of safe and correct disposal of IT equipment while ensuring value for
money for their school. To that head teacher, paying for such a service
might seem a sensible, industry-accepted practice, not least because
they might never have heard of alternatives that could mean that they
could pay for a new classroom extension, playground, or even computer
room.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000060">I
do not know how to change those perceptions,  but I know that
the Minister, wearing his other hat,  has responsibility for
communicating the not entirely 
<?notus-xml column=238?>straightforward concept of the big society. In responding, perhaps he
will draw on his communications experience, and the power, leverage and
tentacles of his Department, in saying how we can change
people’s perceptions. Once the benefits are fully realised, many

Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office (Mr Nick Hurd):</Member></B> Mr
Weir, I am delighted that I did turn up, not least to serve again under
your chairmanship, and to listen to a crackingly good speech by my hon.
Friend the Member for Cannock Chase (Mr Burley). He is right. This
debate is a lot calmer than the previous one he initiated on trade
union reform, although not so well attended. However less spicy, he is
entirely right. We are debating the fundamental question of how
committed 
<?notus-xml column=239?>the Government are to getting best value for the taxpayer, because every
£1 we save by driving greater efficiency in the procurement of
goods and services is £1 we do not have to
cut from something else and £1 we can invest in the front-line
services that our constituents care about. That matters
enormously.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000067">I
congratulate my hon. Friend both on securing this debate and on the way
he made his case. As an excellent local MP, he is a great champion of
local businesses. I extend my welcome to the directors of PRM Green
Technologies, which seems to offer an excellent service, as is
substantiated by its 4,000 clients and counting. The company is clearly
working, and it is an example of a good British business that is coming
up with new solutions and offering real value at a time when we need to
challenge the system, which spends so many billions of pounds of our
money, to be more efficient and
effective.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000068">As
a Cabinet Office Minister, I felt genuine shock when I saw the attitude
that we inherited to public money. We embarked on a process of doing
straightforward, simple things to make Government procurement more
efficient, and it is genuinely shocking that we are already delivering
billions of pounds a year in savings to the taxpayer. That should not
be possible, but it is, due to the previous Government’s
attitude to public
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000069">The
debate draws out the system’s attitude to risk and how good
people are at buying things. Too often, and we are trying to break down
this frustration, procurement seems to be too much about process and
not enough about what we are buying and how we can get best value.
There is too much risk aversion and too much emphasis on box-ticking.
People are not asking, “What are we really buying? Do we really
need to spend this money? Isn’t there a smarter way of doing
this?” If there was ever a time to break down that culture, it
is now, because of the pressure to be more efficient in how we use
taxpayers’ money. That matters, because every £1 we save
is £1 we can put to more productive use for the benefit of the
people we
serve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000070">The
debate is also about the need to create the conditions to open up the
system to smaller, more entrepreneurial, more creative and more dynamic
organisations. There are such companies across the spectrum, in both
the for-profit sector and the not-for-profit sector. There is a similar
complaint about the difficulty of getting into a system that is geared
to buy from the big, the safe and the very expensive, which we must try
to break
down.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000071">I
have several assurances to offer my hon. Friend. The first may sound a
bit motherhood and apple pie, but I assure him that the Government
support recycling IT equipment for both financial and sustainability
benefits. I would expand on that if I had more time, but it is a point
of principle that is worth asserting. Recycling IT equipment matters to
us.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000072">We
are aware of the value of surplus and redundant IT equipment. Through
proper recycling, the Government may not only dispose of redundant
equipment at no cost but profit from the sale and reuse of the scarce
and valuable resources that it contains. We are voracious in trying to
get better value for the taxpayer, and we are working to ensure that as
much of that value as possible is extracted and returned to
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000073">I
refer my hon. Friend to the “Greening Government: ICT
Strategy,” which was published in October 2011—I am sure
he keeps a copy by his bed—which sets out how 
<?notus-xml column=240?>Government information and communications technology, including its
end-of-life reuse and recycling, will be made green. The strategy
includes the adoption of a clear waste hierarchy in which surplus
equipment is reused or refurbished to avoid the unnecessary procurement
of new equipment, thus saving money and reducing waste. The strategy
also includes the donation of surplus equipment to benefit big society
initiatives—I am grateful to him for mentioning the big
society—and the recycling and reuse of ICT equipment components
and materials. The strategy clearly articulates the value of recycling
redundant ICT equipment, and metrics are being introduced to ensure
that it is done effectively across all
Departments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000074">My
hon. Friend asked what we were doing to ensure that public bodies did
not waste their budgets on IT recycling but instead spent them on the
front line. The Government Procurement Service offers public bodies a
method for recycling ICT assets under the supported factories and
businesses framework agreement, RM722. The agreement ensures that
equipment is recycled responsibly and maximises the cash return from
the extraction of valuable components and materials, which has seen
limited but growing take-up since launch. In the financial year
2011-12, and in the current financial year to date, the agreement has
been used by at least  33 bodies, including schools, councils,
agencies and Departments, so it has made a decent
start.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030544000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000075"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Burley" PimsId="5528" UID="13030544000105" xid="1029" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/halltext/130305h0002.htm#13030544000105">Mr

the old employee’s laptop is not given to the new employee. The
policy is that the old machine must be destroyed and that the new

greater transparency on how public money is spent. Down to the last
£500, the public and companies such as PRM 
<?notus-xml column=241?>will know and will be much freer to challenge the spending of local
authorities. As we see leadership, and as we see more public sector
organisations showing initiative in doing things better, there will be
more information available about those that are not doing so. We in
this place, and people outside, will therefore be much freer to
challenge inefficiency and say, “You can do this more
intelligently. Look, they have done it over there.” We have not
had such information, and we are

Swinson:</Member></B> Blacklisting is an abhorrent practice. That is
why, in response to the findings of the investigation by the
Information Commissioner's Office into the Consulting Association, the
Government legislated in 2010 to prohibit the use of blacklists. Under
the Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010,
individuals who believe they are being excluded from employment because
of a blacklist should seek redress in the county courts in England and
Wales, or Court of Session in Scotland. Other rights under these
Regulations and other legislation, such as the right not to be refused
employment because of trade union membership, can be enforced in
employment
tribunals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030570000316" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/text/130305w0001.htm#13030570000316">For
individuals who were blacklisted prior to 2010, their
remedies lie under the Trade Union and Labour Relations Consolidation
Act 1992. We understand that some complaints by workers listed by the
Consulting Association have already been made to employment
tribunals. Actions were also taken using protections under the Data
Protection Act 1998, although these have now, to all intents and
purposes, been exhausted with regard to the Consulting Association.
Individuals who have been blacklisted by the Consulting Association may
also seek redress in the Courts: there is for example an ongoing class
action against a number of construction
employers.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13030570000021" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130305/text/130305w0001.htm#13030570000021">Copyright

the last 18 months the Department has had considerable success in
reducing the cost of its estate through consolidation and targeted
building disposals. This has seen the Department surrender four
leasehold office properties through a combination of lease breaks and
lease expiries as well as an administrative transfer of a property to
another Government Department. This has generated net savings of
£6.5 million net per annum over that period. The Department has
also successfully sublet surplus space across their leasehold office
estate over the same period, reducing the overall property costs by
approximately £6.44 million via additional tenant

so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when

all commissioners and providers in the new health system to plan
pathways of care which deliver the best outcomes for patients.
Commissioners will be able to use networks as a source of clinical
advice and. support in driving their quality improvement programmes
locally. Cancer is a priority condition for the first strategic
clinical networks being established from 1 April 2013. Cancer strategic
clinical networks will be supported and funded through network support
teams hosted by the NHS Commissioning Board. The support teams will
cover defined geographical areas and will also support networks for
other priority conditions or patient groups.</hs_Para>

prisoners the opportunity to find work, re-establish family ties,
reintegrate into the community and ensure housing needs are met. For

the most marginalised children to ensure equity access to quality
education. One of the first steps the MEC will take is to conduct a
study to identify the greatest education needs across the country and
the capacity of local partners. Criteria used for funding will then
include poverty, access to schooling and educational attainment.
Particular attention will be given to the needs of children in the
ethnic states and where educational and development data indicates the

We raised our deep concerns about these closures with a range of senior
Government officials and representatives. Sudan has a history of
expelling humanitarian workers. Despite this the UK is still delivering
our aid and humanitarian programme across Sudan. For example we will
provide 800,000 people access clean drinking sources and 3 million
people with emergency health and nutrition-related programmes by 2015.

than through one single monitoring report. The Department receives
information on local authority spending on arts and culture from the
Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). Ministers meet
with the Local Government Association to receive views and advice on
the general picture of local authority arts and culture. As I said in
my answer of 27 February 2013, <I>Official Report,</I> column 543W, the
Arts Council works closely on the ground with local authorities, and I
meet regularly with the Chief Executive of the Arts Council. The
