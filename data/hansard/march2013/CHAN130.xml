As the hon. Gentleman may know, we have released data today which show
that nearly 2,000 green deal assessments have been made, and already
that figure is out of date. There are more than 600 accredited advisers
and more than 600 installing firms have been accredited. Nearly
£30 million of ecos have been traded on eco-brokerage. The hon.
Gentleman should listen to the industry. I do not often recommend that
people listen to tweets, but if he looks at the tweets of British Gas,
GHE Solar, Toriga and Green Deal Shop, they will tell him and other

question as it suggests that she does not understand how the green deal
plans work. She should know, and I think she probably does, that after
an assessment has been made and an installation programme has been
booked, the green deal plan is signed only after the installation has
been completed and then goes on to the green deal register for the
green deal payments to appear on the bill. So there is quite a lag, as
the hon. Lady would know. We did not expect a huge number of green deal
plans to have already been signed. The key issue at this stage is the
green deal assessments and the green deal assessors, and we are making
huge progress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T09:37:25"></hs_TimeCode>,

but he will know that the public want to know how many people, having
seen their assessment, have signed on the dotted line for the deal.
Given that Nationwide is offering energy efficiency loans with an
interest rate of just 2.29%—less than a third of the interest
rate under the green deal—does the Secretary of State believe
that more people would take out the green deal if offered a better

I welcome Nationwide’s product because it shows that there is
more competition in the market. It shows what the green deal is
spurring. It is not just green deal plans that will be a mark of the
programme’s success; it is green deal self-funded plans, which
will be a result of the green deal assessments being made. They would
not be made in the way that they are if we had not gone forward, and

strongly support LED lighting. There are issues about whether different
types of lighting can 
<?notus-xml column=453?>come under the green deal because light bulbs can be taken away, and if
the cost of those is in the electricity meter for the next tenant or
the next owner-occupier, that would not be fair and would not,

workers who were made redundant in the early restructuring, the workers

problem is that the Government are not tackling the issue. The truth is
that the Energy Bill does not require the Government to set a
decarbonisation target. Even if such a target was set, there is nothing
under the Bill’s present arrangements to ensure that it would be
met. The Committee on Climate Change is absolutely clear: the
Government should set a decarbonisation target now, not in 2016, and
all the Government are doing is extending the uncertainty for another
two years. Was not the former Energy Minister,

advocacy of independent generators. He raised this issue during the
Committee stage of the Energy Bill. He knows that I am not
unsympathetic to his assertions about the difficulties that independent
generators face. I believe that contracts for difference will make it
easier for independent generators to access the market, as he knows,
because they will remove wholesale price risk and eliminate the
requirement to market renewables obligation certificates, which will
also reduce risk. I make this commitment: I think that we
need to look at this matter more closely and to do more. We need a more
plural and a more liquid market to create competition and drive down
prices.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13031445000029" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0001.htm#13031445000029">Wind

admissions in 2010-11. That is the context of our policy making and our

removing the “vicinity test” to ensure that anyone, no
matter where they live, can have input into a decision to grant or
revoke a licence; introduced a late-night levy, making those businesses
that sell alcohol late at night contribute to the cost of policing and
wider local authority action; and introduced the early-morning alcohol

sufficiently targeting problems such as irresponsible promotions in
pubs and clubs; health as a new alcohol licensing objective for
cumulative impacts, so that licensing authorities can consider
alcohol-related health harms when managing the problems relating to the
number of premises in their area; cutting red tape for responsible
businesses to reduce the burden of regulation, while maintaining the

There is a serious point here and it will emerge in this session, so
let me address it. There are young people who drink cheap alcohol in
excessive quantities and are price-sensitive when buying alcohol, so
they are likely to be deterred from buying alcohol, to a degree, by
minimum unit pricing. However, people on low incomes who consume
alcohol responsibly would pay more under minimum unit pricing, and a
number of representations have stated that the policy is unreasonable
on that basis. We have to weigh up all those representations and points
of view. The previous Government did not consider this matter at all.
We are considering it carefully and will announce our conclusions when
we are ready to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T10:41:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

unit price of 45p, which is what the Government consulted on—in

price a typical 12.5% bottle of wine at about £4.20. Obviously,
many bottles of wine currently retail at less than £4.20 but are
not sold at a loss. That, I think, is the point of confusion for the

characteristic warm reception for Liberal Democrat Ministers. There are
two strands to the case being made against minimum unit pricing, both
of which clearly have some force. One is about charging people who may
have low disposable income more than they would otherwise pay for
alcohol, even when there is no evidence to suggest that all those
people are drinking irresponsibly. The second is a wider liberal or
perhaps libertarian argument about the role of the state and the right
of the individual to make choices that he or she wishes to make, free
from a more prescriptive view by Government. Both cases were made to us

Browne:</Member></B> I do not accept that they have. I enjoyed the
conversation that I had and I recognise that there are harms caused by
alcohol. In fact, at the beginning of my answer to the question, about
half an hour or so ago, I talked about violent crime and how much of it
is alcohol related, about the atmosphere in town and city
centres—everybody in the House will know from their
constituencies how disconcerting many of our constituents find such
behaviour—and about the number of hospital admissions that are
alcohol related. I therefore recognise that there are serious concerns,
but there are issues that need to be balanced. Otherwise, we would
logically end up with the Government being urged to ban alcohol sales
altogether—as far as I am aware, nobody is urging us to do
that—or with a minimum unit price of, say, £5
rather than 45p. That would have a very big impact on alcohol
consumption, but there are other, competing concerns that would not be
addressed by going down that route. That is why a Government who govern
responsibly for the whole country need to consider all these
matters.</hs_Para>

I think that it is important, amid all the party political knockabout,
that we realise and respect the fact that this is a very serious issue
for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people across the

consideration. With regard to price sensitivity, there is good reason
to believe that different people in different circumstances are more
price responsive than others, which is why this is a harder issue to
tackle than it might appear after cursory inspection. I accept his
point that people who have become accustomed to drinking large
quantities of alcohol as a matter of course might be less price
sensitive than, for example, younger people who are looking to drink
alcohol to excess for the first time. Of course, we need to take a

are back. Having existed in this country for more than six centuries,
apprenticeships have through the ages provided the vehicle for skills
and trades to be handed down the generations. At their best, they are
an engine for social mobility and for giving employers and apprentices
alike the skills they need to prosper. Although apprenticeships
declined in the previous century, this century they have started to
recover and grow, both in number—500,000 started last year,
compared with the approximately 350,000 who started at
university—and in stature, becoming a career choice in their own

hon. Member for Blackpool South (Mr Marsden), to his place—I
think we will all agree that we must increase the quality of
apprenticeships and make them relevant to today’s economy. We
will not delay progress on making such improvements. Steps have already
been taken to require every apprenticeship to be a real job and to
mandate that, in most cases, an apprenticeship lasts a minimum of a
year, and today we are announcing that we will further strengthen the
provision of English and maths in apprenticeships. The employer
ownership of skills pilot is putting power in the hands of employers to
design qualifications and deliver apprenticeships in line with employer
needs, and we are extending apprenticeships to higher levels of skills
and into new professions, such as insurance, accountancy and the

need, however, to go further. Last year we published a report by the
former dragon from “Dragons’ Den”, Doug Richard,
on the future of apprenticeships. I pay tribute to his work in
producing that report, which called on us to put employers in the
driving seat, giving them more control over qualification design,
training delivery and funding. It called for quality and standards to
be raised across the programme and for a focus on outcomes, stripping
out bureaucratic processes. It also called for more open data, more
awareness and more employer engagement in
schools<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T11:19:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0001.htm#13031445000287">We
wholeheartedly agree with the principles and vision of the Richard
report, which, along with the response that we are publishing today,
will be placed in the Library, providing a programme of reform that
will be challenging for all involved in
apprenticeships—providers, the Government, employers and
apprentices themselves—which is absolutely right. Rigour and
responsiveness will be our guiding principles. The Richard reforms
build on the best of this historic programme, but will once again
attune it to the needs of the modern
workplace<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T11:19:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0001.htm#13031445000288">Specifically,
we agree that apprenticeships should be targeted at those in
new jobs or roles to train them for that role as a springboard for
their future careers; that employers should be at the centre of
designing apprenticeship standards and qualifications; and that
assessment should be largely at the end, more independent and graded.
We agree on the need to raise further the standards in English and
maths, and that employers 
<?notus-xml column=487?>should be given greater control of funding to ensure that it is directed
where it adds most value. Costs will be shared between apprentices,
their employers and the Government. We agree that more open and
accessible data are vital. We agree on the importance of improving
awareness and engagement with schools, so much so that the Prime
Minister has set out that it should become the new norm for young
people to go to university or into an
apprenticeship.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000289" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0001.htm#13031445000289">This

would be interesting to hear what Mr Richard makes of the

is a depressing pattern in the Government’s responses to new
ideas for apprenticeships. They pat their advisers on the head, but

apprenticeships with small and medium-sized enterprises, such as the
need for impartial face-to-face careers guidance for young people. They
voted here on Tuesday against the proposal of the Business, Innovation
and Skills Committee to use public procurement to boost apprenticeship
numbers. Now they have sidelined the key recommendation of Doug

Government response says only that they are moving towards improving
the attainment of level 2 functional maths and English. Why have they
ignored Richard’s key recommendation that people should have
level 2 functional maths and English before the completion of an

work-based learning to support entry to employment and apprenticeships,
as recommended by Mr Richard? Will he confirm that the Secretary of
State for Education will provide dedicated funding for face-to-face
guidance in schools to deliver improved awareness of apprenticeships

apprentices themselves. The apprentice of the year is a female engineer

apprenticeships are good for the whole economy; they are good for
tackling skills shortages; they are good for apprentices, but they are

the costs of apprenticeships because all three benefit from them. That

to anticipate and create a more sustainable structure to support people

sustainable, and auto-enrolment could give an additional 11 million
people access to their own pensions in retirement. The draft Pensions

number of people in this country are living in overcrowded
accommodation while many are receiving a subsidy in under-occupied
property. Although the Labour party, over many years, was perfectly

Budget may well afford an opportunity for some wide-ranging debates, of
which pensions could be one part. The measures on auto-enrolment will
support people in retirement. The draft Pensions Bill will give people
a much simpler and more predictable basis on which to judge the
state’s provision for retirement and what they may need to
maintain the standard of living they are looking for. Overall, after
years of failed experiments with stakeholder and other pensions, we are

of State why he, the Food Standards Agency and Sodexo had refused to
name the company which supplied mince and burgers adulterated with
horsemeat. The Secretary of State refused once again to name
Sodexo’s meat supplier, thereby preventing other catering
organisations from knowing whether their meat supplies were at risk,
despite the fact that in every other horse adulteration case, the
supplier has been immediately named. Yesterday evening Sodexo finally
revealed its two suppliers as Brakes, which supplied the burgers, and
Vestey Foods, which supplied frozen halal mince and frozen mince that
were adulterated with horse. The chairman of Vestey Foods is hereditary
peer Baron Sam Vestey, who is also Master of the Queen’s Horse.

have a duty to ensure that looked-after children are not at greater
risk of being drawn into the criminal justice system than other
children simply because they lack normal family homes. Poor behaviour
that would be dealt with in the family should not be an express route
into the criminal justice system. We heard one example of police being
called to a children’s home to investigate broken crockery. The
relevant authorities must also continue to provide support to
looked-after children when they get into the criminal justice system
and, even more, when they leave it. We were concerned that the relevant
authorities often seem to end their relationship of providing support
once looked-after children enter the criminal justice system,

example, minor offences that were the subject of cautions should
disappear from the register at the age of 18, to give youngsters a
chance to get a job and get started in life. I also commend employers

institutions over the years because the number in custody is now much
smaller. The Committee will continue to press its view that most of the

in small environments, where it is possible to devote sufficient

the Government produced their own, “Transforming Youth
Custody” document just as we were concluding our inquiry, so we
did not have the chance to work on it in detail, although I have to say
that there is not a lot of detail in it. One thing that puzzles us is
the Secretary of State’s idea of creating youth colleges to deal
with young offenders, because they are actually there, on average, for
only 79 days. We fully support and applaud his interest in, and
commitment to, sorting out the education of young offenders in custody,
but the concept of the colleges does not fit well with the rapid churn
of young offenders. In many cases it is important that we get them back
into the education system. We have therefore recommended that schools
and colleges could be incentivised to take young people back into
education after they have completed their sentence, whether it is a
custodial or community

often requires support as well; it is not merely bed and breakfast and
goodbye. There has to be some way of ensuring that an offender
reintegrates into society, or indeed integrates into society for the

prior to that, which is true of many looked-after

second part of the message I want to leave with the House is that we
need to ensure that new generations of children do not embark on crime.
In order to achieve that, as was mentioned in an earlier intervention,
we must develop early intervention. As with adult prisoners, so much of
the Ministry of Justice budget is necessarily committed to custody and
to prison by policies that have been pursued over many years, yet the
most important work of preventing people from getting into crime in the
first place is deprived of money.</hs_Para>

with David Nicholson saying that he could not recall ever having said
something like that and thought that he could not possibly have done

many whistleblowers, discredited. David Nicholson said in response to

hospital in, yes, West Midlands SHA, for its improvement in relation to
this very same mortality data. The Dr Foster data was

May 2007, however, people were aware of the data. The then chief

West Midlands SHAs play a strangely prominent role in this

find out what was going wrong, she commissioned the university of, yes,

there were places where an unhealthy local culture became even more

replaced with a local top-down, bullying style, which can be even
worse. I can remember the shock I felt on reading the first

Burnham:</Member></B> Foundation trust status was not a matter for
Ministers. It was a job for Monitor, so it has to answer that concern.
The hon. Gentleman is right that we had many discussions about a public
inquiry. He will remember that in July 2009, two months after I was
appointed Secretary of State, I brought in Robert Francis QC to conduct
an independent inquiry into what happened. I did not order a full
public inquiry and I will explain the reason why
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:09:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:09:02"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:09:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000539" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0002.htm#13031445000539">The
difficult thing about the fact that the Mid Staffs board was holding
more meetings in private was that we in this House had passed up our
powers to intervene to stop it. That is another lesson we must learn:
that the FT reform was naive in thinking that local autonomy would lead
to improvement in all cases. In a national health service, there are
areas where national direction is needed, and when things go wrong,
there must be immediate powers of intervention, which, on my arrival in
the Department in June 2009, I found I did not have. Foundation trust
policy needs to be reviewed and adjusted to mitigate those
dangers, including through a reconsideration of the power to
de-authorise a failing foundation trust, which was recommended by the
first Francis report, but repealed by the Health and Social Care Act
2012.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000540" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0002.htm#13031445000540">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:09:54"></hs_TimeCode>
also need to consider targets and how they are used. Targets helped to
deliver the lowest waiting times in history and that must not be
forgotten. However, in places, they reinforced negative management
practices. In focusing on only part of the patient experience, there
was not sufficient focus on the overall patient experience and the
whole person—a particular problem when it comes to caring for
very elderly people whose needs are a blur of the physical, mental and
social.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000541" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0002.htm#13031445000541">Robert<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:10:17"></hs_TimeCode>

second area where more transparency and accountability is urgently
needed is on staffing levels. If the Government are not yet able to
commit to all the recommendations, I ask them to expedite their
response to Robert Francis’s important recommendation on
patient-staff ratios. The board of Mid Staffs embarked on a dangerous
programme of staff cuts, and yet public and staff representatives had
no outside guidance to challenge it. The chief nursing officer said
yesterday that staffing should be a local decision. Surely the lesson
of Mid Staffs is that there is a need for much clearer
national standards and guidelines, as suggested by the Francis
report?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000550" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0002.htm#13031445000550">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:12:43"></hs_TimeCode>

services do not have adequate staffing levels. Surely that should ring
alarm bells in the Department as it suggests that parts of the NHS are
already forgetting the lessons of the recent
past.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000551" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0002.htm#13031445000551">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:13:05"></hs_TimeCode>
third area on which we need a clear statement from the Government today
is the accountability and transparency of all organisations providing
NHS services. Under “any qualified provider”, the
Government are persisting with their assumption that all NHS contracts
should be open to full competitive tender. Despite a promise to rewrite
the section 75 regulations that are being made under the 2012 Act, my
reading of the rewritten regulations is that regulation 5 will not let
doctors decide, but will in effect force clinical commissioning groups
to open tender for contracts. That raises the prospect that there will
be a significant increase in the coming years in the number of private
and voluntary sector organisations providing NHS services.</hs_Para>

same strictures on freedom of information and whistleblowing. If action
is not taken, we face the prospect of a serious reduction in
transparency and accountability. Our attempts to find out new
information under FOI requests on providers selected under AQP have hit
the brick wall of “commercial confidentiality”. I say to
the Secretary of State that that is not good enough. Accountability and

should start by remembering why we are having this debate. Truly
shameful things happened at Stafford hospital. Patients were left
unwashed for days, sometimes in sheets soiled with urine and excrement.
Relatives had to take bed sheets home to wash them because the hospital
would not. Patients with dementia went hungry with their meals sitting
right in front of them, because no one realised or cared that they were
unable to feed themselves. If we are to prevent that from happening
again, accountability for what happened is vital. I will talk plainly
about that, including about the role of Sir David
Nicholson<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:19:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the desire to celebrate success got in the way of speaking out when

does that accountability lie? Sir David Nicholson has been the focus of
much attention, and as a manager in the system that failed to spot and
rectify the appalling cases at Mid Staffs, he bears some
responsibility. As he said, the focus was lost, and he has apologised
and been held to account by this House and many others. However, I do
not believe that he bears total, or indeed personal, responsibility for
what happened. He was at the strategic health authority for 10 months
during the period in question, overseeing 50 hospitals at a time when
his main responsibility was the merger of three SHAs into one. He
consistently warned both Ministers and managers of the dangers of
hitting the target and missing the point.</hs_Para>

there would have been no Mid Staffs; others bear far more direct
responsibility and the

what went wrong lies with the board of the trust.

David Nicholson told the Health Committee last week that in the NHS as
a whole, patients were not the centre of the way the system operated.
Which party was in power when that culture was allowed to operate? If
Sir David has been held to account, so too must the Labour party be
held to account. The Francis report rightly states that Ministers were
not personally responsible for what happened at Mid Staffs, and I have
no doubt that no Labour Minister would have condoned, knowingly allowed
or wanted the events at Mid Staffs to happen. We also know from the
report that the pursuit of targets at any cost was a central driver of
what went wrong. As the report set out, above all Mid Staffordshire NHS
Foundation Trust failed to tackle an “insidious negative
culture” involving a tolerance of poor standards and a
disengagement from managerial and leadership responsibilities. It went

right hon. Gentleman talked about waiting times targets. Let us be
clear: there is an important role for targets in a large organisation
such as the NHS. Without the four-hour A and E target, or the 18-week
elective 
<?notus-xml column=527?>waiting time target, access to NHS services would not have been
transferred and I accept that the previous Government deserve credit
for that. It was right to increase spending on the NHS, although it is
curious that Labour now wants to cut the NHS budget. Labour did
however—this is where Labour Members should listen rather than
barrack—make three huge policy mistakes, and the right hon.
Gentleman must accept that it is not simply a question of Government
policy not being implemented in every corner of the NHS. Those three
mistakes contributed to the culture of neglect that we are now dealing
with.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000589" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0002.htm#13031445000589"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:26:49"></hs_TimeCode>The
first mistake—a huge mistake—was that Labour failed to
put in place safeguards to stop weak, inexperienced or bad managers
pursuing not only bureaucratic targets but targets at any cost. That is
exactly what happened at Mid Staffs, where patient safety and care were
compromised in a blind rush to achieve foundation trust status.
Secondly, Labour failed to set up proper, independent, peer-led
inspections of hospital quality and safety that told the public how
good and safe their local hospital was. Instead of a zero-harm attitude
to patient safety, we have a culture of compliance and the bureaucratic
morass that is the current Care Quality Commission. Thirdly, Labour
failed to spot clear warnings when things went wrong. The Francis
report lays out a timeline of 50 key warning signs between 2001 and
2009. Why did Ministers not act sooner? If those warnings were not
being brought to the attention of Ministers, why did they not build a
system in which they were? Instead, there was a climate in which NHS
employees who spoke out about poor care were ignored, intimidated or
bullied<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:28:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

running sustained deficits and management was required to bring that
health economy under control. There is no choice between quality on the

the Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper) said, particularly about
what seems to me, too, to be a growing public body desire for secrecy.
This is happening not in the national health service alone, but in many
other bodies. Indeed, as my hon. Friend well knows, it is happening in
this House. I am concerned about a number of issues—how staff
are treated, getting rid of the 
<?notus-xml column=534?>telephone exchange and a whole number of other
decisions taken up there somewhere. We, as Members who work here, have
very little

is important for us to remember the Nolan principles of public life to
which every public body is meant to sign up—accountability,
openness, honesty and leadership. I do not want to say much
specifically about what happened in Mid Staffordshire, but it was
appalling. As someone who has had a good and well-led hospital in my
constituency for many years, I find it almost unbelievable that all
that could have happened in the Mid Staffordshire hospital with so few
people seeming to know what happened or to speak out about it. Then,
when it was pointed out, no one listened. That provides a terrible
warning about what can happen. We all think that we know what is
happening in our constituencies, but we do not always, as this episode
has shown.</hs_Para>

others, and the body is now growing to be almost an entity in itself,
making decisions, sending out publicity and getting further and further

right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson)
was Secretary of State for Health, some of the decisions he made in the
Health Act 1999 were more about accountability than anything that has
been done since by any Government. For example, he instructed NHS
chairmen to hold their board meetings in public, while non-executive
directors were required to live in the area served by the
trust—a crucial step that fundamentally changed St
Thomas’ hospital when we had a local chairman who knew the area,
was involved in the hospital and cared about it. She spent all her time
as chairman wandering around the hospital trying to find out about
everything that was going on: she was accountable to everyone. That was
crucial to the public, too, as they knew that they had people on the
board who knew what was happening in the
locality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:55:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000641" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0003.htm#13031445000641">I
believe that one of the first responsibilities of non-executive
directors—they are not part of the management —is to
visit the wards, to talk to patients, to collate local concerns and to
talk to MPs, local councillors and the local authority. That was always
happening. We had a very good system. There were concerns about the
treatment of the elderly at one stage in one of the wards for elderly
people at St Thomas’, but they got dealt with
very quickly because we had a responsive chairman and a
responsive board. A lot of that happened when
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:56:01"></hs_TimeCode> right
hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras

for them. I have had a well-led foundation trust up to now, but I did
not feel that this was the right way ahead for the national health
service at the time. We have got them, however, and some foundation
trusts saw fit to erode the principles as financial considerations took
precedence over clinical standards on many board agendas. The
foundation trusts still remain the chief executive

thing the King’s Health Partners are doing in the name of

Parliament have asked for. Recently, on 28 February, we heard from the
chairman of Guy’s and St Thomas’, who was previously a
permanent secretary at the Department of Health. That takes me back to
one of my earlier points about people moving around within the health
service. It is always somebody who has been someone else in somebody
else’s patch that gets a job with another NHS trust. This
chairman wrote to say that the project is forging ahead with a full
business case. William McKee, who brought together trusts in Northern
Ireland, has been appointed and we are told that he is going to spend
at least £5 million to bring about the business case to show why
this will be such a wonderful idea.

different bodies is being allocated, what the precise budget will be
and how it will be spent by whom. The whole accountability thing is

the Secretary of State, the one thing I would want to look at would be
clinical outcomes in hospitals. If that is beyond Secretaries of State,
one is prompted to ask why they are in post. If those figures had been
looked at earlier enough, we might not be having this debate.</hs_Para>

which I want to widen and, I hope, put on a more consensual
footing.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031445000699" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0003.htm#13031445000699">I have a
constituent whose grown-up son tragically died of leukaemia some time
ago. He went to the doctor many times and was diagnosed as a young,
healthy man with glandular fever. A blood test was made far too late,
and he died. After the funeral, the mortified doctor wrote to the
parents and apologised frankly for her failure and her error. There was
no litigation or talk of system failure; there was simply a frank
admission of individual human error and a sincere apology,
which was accepted.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031445000700" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0003.htm#13031445000700">In many cases
of NHS failure, there is no one individual to blame, so people talk of
systems and cultures, which we have talked about constantly today. No
one individual can be held entirely to blame for the system, so it
always seems that no one person is to blame or is prepared to take the
blame—even those who manage and design the system, such as Sir
David Nicholson.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031445000701" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0003.htm#13031445000701">When a
hospital performs badly, and the one in Mid Staffs is simply the most
telling example, some of the reasons lie in external factors: in the
targets imposed on it, in the requirements made of it—becoming a
foundation trust is one it could have done without—and in
directions that impaired it. The NHS reorganisation certainly got in
the way, according to Francis. When outcomes are poor, it can be hard
to determine exactly how to apportion blame and responsibility. Do we
blame those who witnessed what went on and did nothing; those who
failed to notice worrying trends; those who did notice them but covered
them up; or those who could have intervened from on high but did
nothing? In one sense, they are all 
<?notus-xml column=542?>responsible—and some are more responsible than others. But we
live in a very harsh and judgmental climate, as was said earlier, and
we forget that people at every stage have mixed motives—good and
bad—for not kicking up a fuss, for covering up, for not
intervening. Some are good—usually, they are bad—but in
most cases institutional or personal reasons outweigh the concern for
patients. There are quite legitimate fears that the hospital or branch
will be criticised or seen as underperforming, which will be bad for
morale in hospital, or that one’s career will be in
jeopardy—a legitimate concern—or that one is getting a
colleague into trouble. Institutional or personal goals get separated
from the avowed patient-centred mission of the NHS. Frankly, that is
all too human an outcome, and it has always happened to some extent.
The NHS is full of very good people, but it is not yet staffed by
saints. All of us at some time cover up for colleagues.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031445000702" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0003.htm#13031445000702">However, we
always try to find in an institution a way of correcting for this,
which is why we have professional standards in the medical profession
and an NHS constitution. It is why we need true accountability, good
complaint-handling, protection for whistleblowers, duty of candour, the
learning of lessons and, of course, proper redress. That is why we have
had legislation on the NHS constitution and increased democratic
scrutiny, introduced by both Governments, which I applaud. I am not
entirely certain what has happened to the NHS redress Bill, but I
applaud that too.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031445000703" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0003.htm#13031445000703">However, we
build other sorts of incentives into the system, and it is as well to
record them. They appeal to a different aspect of human nature, a more
selfish side, perhaps out of realism, perhaps because of an ideological
conviction that that is how people work. We model hospitals on
profit-making institutions. We make survival dependent on competition
with other profit-making institutions, which have gagging clauses in
their contracts for good reasons—their competitors. We try to
modify clinician behaviour not always by appealing to clinical
judgment, but by appealing to the pocket. Therefore, we should not be
surprised if the moral atmosphere, at times, becomes a little cloudy.
We, as legislators, are partly responsible for that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031445000704" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0003.htm#13031445000704">If we turn
the NHS into a set of businesses united by a corporate brand, should we
be surprised if occasionally, individual branches put their interests
ahead of those of their patients, choosing to satisfy those who
pay—the Government—rather than the patients they
serve?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031445000705" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0003.htm#13031445000705">There are
many good things that we can do and would wish to do. We can make the
complaints process easier. We can assign accountability better, so that
an individual’s job and survival in an organisation depends on
serving the patient, not on always doing what the institution
necessarily requires. We can ban gagging orders, and I applaud the
Secretary of State’s move in that direction. We can improve
inspection, not by making it more ferocious—we do not need to do
that—but by linking it better to improvement. Above all, we need
to start thinking about what we want the NHS to be. If we are unhappy
with the culture, exactly what sort do we want to have? Do we want the
moral enterprise that Bevan envisaged—a contract on behalf of
the hale and hearty, to protect the sick and vulnerable—or a set
of businesses that sink or swim depending on how good they are at
getting state funding? We can either rediscover the moral purpose of
the NHS, or regard it as an 
<?notus-xml column=543?>organisation that brings to book from time to time the businesses that
work within it, independently of the Secretary of State.</hs_Para>

I know which I prefer, but I have to record that currently we exist in
a strange kind of moral limbo. We are judging an institution that looks
very different from the original NHS, according to the high standards
and moral mission Bevan set. I have a lot of sympathy with the remarks
of Harry Cayton of the Professional Standards Authority, who said in
<I>The Times</I> only this week that the NHS must rediscover its
“moral purpose”. We exist in a kind of moral fog, a state
of limbo, and if we want to know who is accountable for that, it is

so far only, trust special administrator, who was appointed to the

Member for Charnwood (Mr Dorrell), who is the Chair of the Health

that accountability and transparency are interlinked: we cannot have

the most interesting thing, and I accept that the current Secretary of
State has had this matter dropped in his lap.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:31:24"></hs_TimeCode>If this was
always about the whole of south-east London, why when the former
Secretary of State had a meeting in July to discuss this did he invite
the Members who represented Bromley, Bexley and
Greenwich—rightly, because they cover the South London
Healthcare NHS Trust area—and the Members for Lewisham? One
could say that it was because they were looking more widely. Of course
that is so, but he did not invite the Members representing Lambeth or
Southwark. However, when we met this Secretary of State in January,
after the TSA’s final report had been published, the Members for
Lambeth and Southwark were included; we were told that this was a south
London-wide issue. The reason for the discrepancy is obvious: they knew
what they wanted to do. They wanted to get an old plan that NHS London
had fostered to try to get Lewisham hospital closed. That took place
under a proper clinical review under “A picture of
health” four years ago, which concluded that Lewisham hospital
deserved to survive and that the services it provided for the people of
Lewisham should continue.</hs_Para>

10,000 people marched in November to oppose the proposals. When the
final report came out, 25,000 people marched because of the
outrageous actions of this administrator and the activities he has
undertaken. The manner in which he dealt with the consultations was
dismissive, disdainful and high-handed. Whether the objections were
from members of the public, GPs or other clinicians, he behaved in line
with the instructions from his bosses, which were simply to close
Lewisham hospital. The people of Lewisham will not stand for
it.</hs_Para>

the Francis report is of great importance. Mr Francis rightly dismisses

unnecessary because Stafford hospital was a solitary

a lack of willingness to shout and continue to shout for help when it

just last week, when, as the shadow Secretary of State rightly said, a
report to Monitor suggested removing most emergency, acute and

That comes on top of disgraceful threats—even death
threats—that she has received over her work in revealing what

me make it clear that the proposals in the Monitor report are, in the
main, a consequence of the financial and clinical pressures that all
acute trusts, particularly the smaller ones, are facing.
Stafford’s circumstances have done a little to hasten changes,
but what happens at Stafford now will face all other such trusts in the
coming years. That it is why it is so important that Monitor and the
Secretary of State come to a good solution for Stafford, and indeed
Cannock, and I will continue to work with them and with my hon. Friends
on that. Nobody should take from the Monitor report the message that
whistleblowing or more transparency will result in threats to their
local services. Indeed, Monitor would be acting contrary to section 62
of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 if it acted in such a
manner.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000726" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0003.htm#13031445000726">Let
me raise another, perhaps more justified, fear of the unintended
consequences of transparency. Only this week, I heard of a case where a
patient could have a life-saving operation, but his chances of
surviving it are only 50:50, yet without an operation he will die. Some
surgeons are, even now, reluctant to take on the operation because if
the patient dies, it will be counted against them in their personal
mortality statistics. That is an 
<?notus-xml column=546?>unintended consequence of transparency, so transparency has to be
balanced with understanding the context; otherwise, we will end up with
a risk aversion that is so great that patients will suffer.</hs_Para>

variable, clinical standards, which are set almost in a vacuum by the

number of specialisations in the UK—we have 61 as against
Norway’s 30—which is driving up costs and driving out

is a debate about accountability and transparency and, as others have
said, we also need a debate in Government time on the Floor of the
House on the Francis report. On the question of accountability and
transparency, I want to start with an issue that has not yet been
properly considered in the debate: the role of the Secretary of State
under national health legislation. Section 1 of such legislation
clearly states the duties  
<?notus-xml column=550?>of the Secretary of State, and always has done. I was astonished, as I
made clear at the time, when the right hon. Member for Kingston upon
Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson) left out that part of the question
of accountability.</hs_Para>

not need to go into the full details now, but only the other day I

said that the matters I raised were both serious and urgent and that
they required the personal attention of the Secretary of State. I have

necessity of chasing and following up in the Department. It is probably
a question of the correspondence unit in the Department and the private

clear that the guidelines were not complied with and were not operated

<?notus-xml column=551?>there was a failure within the Department and by successive Secretaries
of State. The shadow Secretary of State acknowledged in his evidence

receive a P45 now. What I am saying is that, sooner rather than later,
it is essential that he departs his post. I disagree with the Secretary
of State and therefore also, I admit, with the Prime Minister on this
matter, and so do many others. Accountability must mean what it says,
and in this context it means carrying the can. The whole saga took
place on Sir David’s watch, even though he was not at West
Midlands for more than a certain time, and the problems that have
arisen carry with them issues of accountability.</hs_Para>

relation to Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, there are three

was<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:09:33"></hs_TimeCode> the

whatever it means, more important than patient care? We know locally
that they wanted to prove that their foundation trust policy was a
success, and that took priority over what it really meant for patients

cross-party support for a public inquiry, but not so. I presume that
Labour Members now support the findings of the Francis inquiry. There
were certainly many Labour MPs at the all-party health group meeting
with Robert Francis on Tuesday, but I want to know how many of them
were among the 260 Labour MPs who voted against a Commons motion

responsible for advising Ministers on legislation are not aware of what

thought that community services were still expanding, as they had been
up to 2010. They did not have a picture of the services. Indeed, they
told us that there was no routine collection of waiting times for
mental health services and they did not have data on readmissions. They

unexpected cardiac arrests, surgical 
<?notus-xml column=558?>site infections, sepsis and other harms. Because harm tends to be caused
to patients much more over the weekend—we have seen many
examples of that in the cases that we have looked at—the trust
has moved back to seven-day working in an attempt to achieve the same

believe that having the right nurse staffing ratios is vital to patient
safety, but that issue keeps being glossed over by NHS leaders and
Ministers. I have asked questions about it repeatedly in this House.
Salford Royal uses a safe staffing tool to ensure that it works
to safe staffing levels. There are minimum staffing requirements
throughout the hospital and incident reports are completed if the
ratios are not met. Each division reviews its staffing establishment
every day and escalates concerns if the numbers fall below the minimum
safe level<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:21:39"></hs_TimeCode>.
Salford Royal is a mentor site for nurse rounding which, as we have

right hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley gave examples that showed
the impact of hospital-acquired infections. All the work that is done
to reduce MRSA and other infections is crucial. As in the other
examples of flattened hierarchies that we have heard about, anyone at
Salford Royal can challenge others on issues related to infection
control. There is also mandatory training in aseptic non-touch

final point is about transparency. Patients and families can check the
harm data, because they are shown on a whiteboard at the entrance to
every ward. The board records not only how many days it is since the
last MRSA infection or pressure ulcer, but provides assessment scores

staff to feel accountable for the standards on their ward. We need that

catastrophic failure at all levels of patient safety, while other areas

not go wrong? The failures at Mid Staffs, and the fact that more than

life “listening in horror”—how shocking! It is

chilling evidence that we heard from Nicola Monte. She spoke of her
experience of being barrier-nursed in Stafford, and said that a nurse
came into her room and berated her saying, “I have been off sick
because of you complaining about me. Do you realise the suffering you
have caused me?” Too often, staff end up feeling that they are
victims because—as they know—they are often scapegoated
for what are system failures, often by management. That runs throughout
the NHS; the response to complaints is defensive and dismissive and
that must change if we are to implement what Robert Francis rightly

deal with anything that has gone wrong is to stand up and say,
“Sorry, I got it wrong.” However, there is a problem. We
are asking people in the NHS to operate in two different worlds. If
something goes wrong in the hospital, the GP’s surgery or the
clinic, we say: confess straight away. That is one world—the
official world. People then get in their car, drive out of the car park
to go home and bump into another car. What happens? Their insurer says,
“Whatever you do, don’t accept any
responsibility.” We need to recognise the clash of different
worlds that people live in.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Sir Richard Shepherd) introduced
the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 to protect whistleblowers, I
made sure that the Labour Government supported it, and that the
provisions covered the national health service. There were those who
did not want it to cover the NHS. I am delighted to say that I
anticipated that some might want to have disappearance clauses in
contracts—gagging clauses—and issued a circular that
prohibited them. Any health body that has inserted such a clause is
breaking the terms of the circular that was sent out in my name in
1999.</hs_Para>

also established the Commission for Health Improvement. It was intended
to monitor and improve standards, and it was the first time in the
history of the national health service that such a body had been set
up. At that time, there was no machinery in the NHS for identifying
good or bad practice, or for promoting good practice more widely and
eliminating poor practice.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:35:05"></hs_TimeCode>I also required
all health boards and chief executives to be responsible for the

hon. Member for Stafford rightly said that if transparency is to be
based on experience and on data, those data have to be fair. We cannot
have a situation in which someone who performs regular, straightforward
surgery is compared favourably with someone who treats people in
desperate circumstances and therefore has a greater chance of the
operation or treatment going wrong. Everyone in the medical profession
has got something wrong, and some have done so quite a few
times.</hs_Para>

we are to have transparency in the provision of services to NHS
patients that are paid for by public money, that transparency must
apply not only to the NHS providers but to any other franchised
provider of services. I know from experience that, when our lot were
selling off a GP practice in my constituency, we were told that we
could not find out the terms of the contract because it was
commercially confidential. If we had been able to see the contract, we
might have spotted that it enabled the contractor to leg it if things
got difficult, which is what it duly did.</hs_Para>

keen Government Members might be on involving the private

making whistleblowing a duty, and that duty of candour 
<?notus-xml column=562?>must apply to any private sector provider. We cannot have them hiding
away behind their private profit-making efforts.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:37:47"></hs_TimeCode>We must also
ensure that, when anything goes wrong, the Secretary of State will
answer to the House of Commons. We do not want anyone coming along and
saying, “It wasn’t me, guv, it was the commissioning

the Member for Stone (Mr Cash) has been repeatedly assured that there
is no problem. I raised the issue in some detail with Sir David
Nicholson in the Public Accounts Committee on a number of occasions,
and I was constantly told that there was no need for change, so does
Sir David agree with today’s announcement? Indeed, is a change
being announced? Will the Secretary of State confirm that this

mediation, and will it apply

Dr Foster data; and even though the figures were high when he was the
chief executive of the strategic health authority that was responsible
for Mid Staffordshire. He did not know about gagging clauses when he
was the accounting officer; he did not know about fixing mortality
codes, yet they are now subject to police investigation. As he told the
Health Select Committee, he did not know about judicial

people stymied; people thinking it is helpful to give half a rumour to

leaning over them, but done genuinely in privacy so that GPs can get a
proper report of what is happening. There will be real-time alert

the Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) because it shows
that accountability is not just about supervising organisations,
regulators, targets, safeguards, mechanical things and statistics.
Accountability is about creatively getting the intelligence into the
system about what is happening and reacting to it positively, welcoming

<?notus-xml column=573?>it and generating the complaints so that more
intelligence comes into the system. That is the kind of accountability
we
want<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:18:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000928" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0004.htm#13031445000928">As
Chairman of the Public Administration Committee, I feel I can add a new
dimension to the debate because of what we are thinking about in our
inquiry on the future of the civil service. We need to ask ourselves,
“What does accountability feel like?” We think we know
what accountability feels like, but my goodness, it goes up and down a
bit. During the previous Parliament we felt very accountable in some
periods, every single one of us. What do we want accountability to feel
like in the health service? With the greatest respect to
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:19:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Wycombe (Steve Baker), the lawyers must be the last
resort. We do not want accountability to be about finger-pointing,
blame and holding people to
account.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:19:20"></hs_TimeCode>
Indeed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:23:08"></hs_TimeCode>, that is
part of the disease that afflicts the health service. We want
accountability to be about nursing staff on the ward feeling
accountable to each other for sharing information, accountable to the
patients and welcoming the information they receive from them, and
accountable to their managers and holding them accountable for what
they do not feel is being done, in an atmosphere of trust and
co-operation.</hs_Para>

is chilling about the Mid Staffordshire story is the question of what
accountability felt like in that hospital at that time? To whom did
people feel they were accountable? What did they feel they were
accountable for? There must have been an almost an atmosphere of
“Apocalypse Now” in the hospital, in which nobody knew
where to turn.</hs_Para>

the evidence we are receiving about the civil service, we have had
powerful testimony from an adviser to our Committee, Professor Andrew
Kakabadse of Cranfield university, who rather chillingly points out an
obvious truth. Very few people who work in a failing organisation do
not know that it is failing. Most people in a failing organisation know
that it is failing. What is wrong? The answer is that they do not know
how to talk about it. They do not know what to say, who to
tell—or, if they try to tell people, it will be bad for
them—or what to do. So people often just leave failing
organisations, saying, “I can’t do anything about
it.” I bet most of those on the board of the hospital trust knew
it was going wrong and did not know what to do. There is this idea that
this was just an isolated case, but it represents a systemic failure.
There is absolutely no escaping that.</hs_Para>

remember the Paddington rail crash. One’s instant reaction was,
“Well, the driver went through a red light; it must have been
his fault,” but everybody knew that there must have been
something much more fundamentally wrong. Something was wrong with rail
safety. In aviation, when there is a plane crash, it is very rarely the
pilot’s fault. Even if it is down to pilot error, that will be
down to pilot training and that will be a system failure. We need to
look at this issue in an holistic and sensible way.</hs_Para>

reaction of the NHS to the Francis report was immediately to reach for
statistics and to start doing things. It immediately started a storm
around our local hospital, the Colchester General, by latching on to
one statistic and naming it as one of the hospitals being investigated,
even though—I have written to Andrew Dilnot at the UK Statistics
Authority and got a reply from him—a single statistic should
never be used in such a fashion. In fact, the Colchester General is in
the 
<?notus-xml column=574?>top quartile of its class of hospital, so that was
entirely unnecessary. My wife has just had a knee replacement in that
hospital. I was completely confident that she would get good nursing

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:23:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin) and give a south
Essex perspective on this issue by speaking about the Basildon and
Thurrock Foundation Trust. It was found to have significant failings
and high mortality rates in 2009, which led to regulatory intervention,
on which the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:23:38"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) will recall delivering a
statement to this House. At that time, the Care Quality Commission
voiced its lack of confidence in the management at Basildon, but there
was no change and no one was held to account.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031445000936" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0004.htm#13031445000936">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:23:53"></hs_TimeCode>
we all know—and as my hon. Friend has eloquently
explained—institutions fail when they are poorly led. In the
event of failure, senior management need to step up to the plate,
either to take a grip of matters and force change or to take
responsibility. The failure in accountability at that time has no doubt
held Basildon back. Subsequent CQC inspections found Basildon failing
in terms of care and welfare, safety of premises, safety and
suitability of equipment, nutritional standards, dealing with serious
incidents, record keeping and cleanliness. That is simply not good
enough.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031445000937" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0004.htm#13031445000937">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:29:28"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:30:19"></hs_TimeCode>
I challenged the hospital management, the response was invariably,
“We’re no worse than anyone else; we just get more
scrutiny.” Indeed, in one letter the then chief executive
criticised the sensational reporting of some unnecessary deaths at the
trust and asked for my assistance in acquiring more positive media
coverage, a clear example of the complacency to which the Prime
Minister referred when he made his statement to the House on the
Francis report. There simply has not been sufficient urgency in
addressing weaknesses. That led me to conclude that the trust would not
improve without a change in leadership—the same conclusion the
CQC reached in
2009<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:25:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000938" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0004.htm#13031445000938">I
also have some wider reflections on the systems of governance. At
Basildon, the board clearly failed in its duty to provide effective
challenge and to hold the management to account. I think that we need
to give a clear indication to directors of foundation trusts that in
the event of poor performance, the buck stops with the board. They are
accountable and they need to accept that responsibility.</hs_Para>

must say that I found the CQC a very positive ally in seeking
better performance at Basildon. I know that it has been criticised by
some Members, but my feeling 
<?notus-xml column=575?>is that its powers were quite limited. It certainly
had no power to hold senior management to account, a power that is
reserved for Monitor. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:26:06"></hs_TimeCode> has made
his comments about the CQC, but I think that he really needs to look at
Monitor. In my experience, the work of Monitor has been very
disappointing. In Basildon it was not keen to take any enhanced action.
Its view was that the trust was not doing as badly as it had been in
2009 and so the direction of travel was positive, even though it was
failing to meet the basic standards of care that the public should be
able to expect. I do not think that is good enough. It goes to the
heart of what we are debating today: the collective failure of
institutions in the NHS to hold people to account when things go wrong.
I urge my right hon. Friend to look at whether Monitor is really fit
for
purpose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:26:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000940" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0004.htm#13031445000940">Since
I started challenging Basildon and Thurrock NHS Foundation Trust, I
have been very heavily criticised, as if by holding the hospital to
account for its performance I am attacking the NHS and its staff. The
contrary is true. If we really believe in the NHS and in providing the
best possible health services for our constituents, we must challenge
it when things go wrong. We should have zero tolerance of failure. Do
we not owe it to the staff who do their job well to ensure that those
who do not are disciplined and held to account for poor
conduct?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000941" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0004.htm#13031445000941">Thankfully<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:28:03"></hs_TimeCode>,
Basildon and Thurrock NHS Foundation Trust is now under new leadership.
There are new non-executive directors who will provide a challenge. We
have a new chairman, a new chief executive and a new medical director,
and I am encouraged by the messages I have received from them. However,
when senior management have been excusing poor practice for so long,
there is a need for profound cultural change to get things fixed. An
NHS with a stronger emphasis on accountability would have allowed us to
start that process in Basildon so much sooner and to save
many lives.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:28:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Wycombe (Steve Baker), by extending the provisions on
criminal liability so that in the final analysis charges of wilful
obstruction of complaints and wilful neglect can be preferred? Had such
sanctions been in place 10 years ago, we would have seen charges
preferred at Mid Staffordshire, and then we might have seen the
interesting spectacle of Ministers and former Ministers being called to
the witness box to give evidence in defence of those public officials
who were claiming that they were only obeying orders and pursuing the
policies of their political masters. I think that sort of sanction
would be enough to focus the minds of any Minister, past and present,
even those who wriggle and twist to try to avoid their
responsibilities.</hs_Para>

I wish to make a point about culture change. We have had the report and

great strides forward as part of a culture change in Staffordshire. I

gifted young man who is pursuing a degree at Wolverhampton university
but suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, which means that he can
barely move. He has round-the-clock care from a team of carers. When he
needs to cough, those carers have to compress his torso—that is
the kind of help that he needs.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:30:43"></hs_TimeCode>, those
at the Staffordshire NHS cluster seem to have forgotten his needs and
want to change his care package, against his wishes, against the wishes

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:33:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bristol North West (Charlotte Leslie) on securing this
very interesting debate, which has covered lots of issues to do with
accountability and transparency, not only at Mid Staffordshire but
throughout the entire country. It is clear from the speeches by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:33:21"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd) and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:33:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Wycombe (Steve Baker) that these concerns go beyond the
appalling events at Mid Staffs. My own constituents need reassuring
about their patient care, the quality of the information they are
receiving and, 
<?notus-xml column=577?>unfortunately, the mortality rates at Medway Maritime hospital. Like
other hospitals, it is now under investigation, and we await the
outcome with interest.</hs_Para>

often takes a very long time for the truth about these matters to be
completely uncovered. In the past, the quality of patient care has, in
many respects, been secondary to the hospital meeting its targets. That
is a shame, and it is part of the culture that we need to change. I do
not want to believe that there is a culture of cover-up in the NHS.
Like my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:34:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston), I think that all those who
work in the NHS—the nurses, the doctors and the
consultants—do a brilliant job in delivering good quality care
and the best patient outcomes. Unfortunately, that was not the case at
Mid Staffs, and concerns about quality of care and mortality rates are
spreading. As I have said, constituents are now concerned about the
care they receive at the Medway Maritime
hospital<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:34:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000951" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0004.htm#13031445000951">The
trust is always incredibly good at responding to my questions, whether
they be about what I consider to be the high use of the Liverpool care
pathway at the hospital, constituent complaints, dementia care or
specific patient services. However, I fundamentally believe that if a
constituent has to involve an MP in a complaint, the system has failed.
There is a growing perception that if someone complains, it is their
fault and they are in the wrong, while the hospital paints itself as
the victim of the complaint rather than the other way around. That is
wrong<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:35:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000952" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0004.htm#13031445000952">The
Medway Maritime hospital is under investigation for higher than
expected hospital standardised mortality rates, and there is currently
a specific outlier alert on septicaemia. Worryingly, this is not the
first time this has happened. Discrepancies in coding were highlighted
way back in 2008 with the discovery that 8% of deaths were being
recorded as end-of-life care when the proportion should have been 37%.
Adjusting the mortality index to exclude those deaths reduced the
hospital’s score by more than a third. A clear manipulation and
distortion of the information only served to damage the best outcomes
and services for the patients. I hope that that will not happen again.
However, as an outsider it appears to me that the complexity of coding
is part of the problem with the lack of
transparency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:36:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000953" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0004.htm#13031445000953">A
culture of bullying and its suppression within the NHS has been
mentioned. The latest staff survey at the Medway Maritime
hospital shows that there is still a perception that bullying is
widespread. If we want to improve standards in patient
care—which is a key aspiration for the newly restructured
NHS—that has to be one of the most important issues to address.
I welcome today’s announcement by the Secretary of State, but
may I make a practical suggestion that was put to me by a GP this
morning? One of the problems with the system for complaints is that
they stay within the hospital—they go up to the management board
and do not really go beyond it. Instead, complaints could be delivered
on a quarterly basis to the new clinical commissioning groups, which
would enable people outside the hospital structures to look at
potential trends and patterns of poor quality, and at whether there are
concerns about specific consultants. We could end up taking the
responsibility from the hospital, having the outsider look in, and
making more practical
changes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:37:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

transparency in the NHS is not just about honesty and accountability,
but about better communication. As the most recent ombudsman report
highlighted, the common pitfalls are also the result of equivocal
language over care, the use of technical language and the failure of
insincere apologies. We need to learn the lessons of the Francis

are many reasons why someone might remember the last time they saw
their mother, but
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:39:38"></hs_TimeCode> experience is
overshadowed by a sense of guilt. During my mother’s long stay
in hospital—she had been in and out—my brother, who lived
abroad, had often been with me and he persistently picked up that the
pervading culture on the ward was that he who shouted loudest got
attention. My mother would describe how much pain and discomfort she
was in—other Members have mentioned similar problems—and
say, as elderly people do, “Don’t make a fuss.” To
his credit, my brother dealt with it by shouting loud. On that last
day, my brother was not with me because he had returned abroad.
Unfortunately, I did not shout that day. I went back to the election
and my mother sadly
died<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:39:54"></hs_TimeCode>. I am not
drawing a comparison with what happened in Stafford, but many patients
and relatives will recognise that one has to shout loudly to get heard.

2005, to their credit, the last Government were increasing spending on
the health service. However, that suggests to me that the answer to
improving outcomes and care is not about money. We can pour a lot of
money in, but it will not do the trick. It has its role, but it is not
the final driver. I hope that one of the legacies of Francis will be
that we can recognise that the debate needs to move on. It should not
be a bidding war between different political parties and ideologies
about money. It should be about the thing that matters most: will
patients get better, will they receive quality care and will they be
treated with respect and dignity, come what may?

Members have said, perhaps we can step aside from politics. I am not
naive and I do not believe that that will happen. However, every time
we debate these matters, let us remember that we have a far greater
chance of achieving what we are here to do, which is to provide a
health service that is the envy of the world, if we have a mature
debate. I say cautiously and with respect that in the light of Francis,
our health service cannot currently be the envy of the world, but its
ideals are most definitely the envy of the world. We have a duty in
this place to set the standards that will make it the envy of the world

am very conscious of the time, but I would like to make one quick
point. We have heard a lot about the culture, but we cannot change it
just like that. Culture is thoroughly and utterly inbred within any
institution. It starts with the new people it trains—the
includes the 
<?notus-xml column=579?>people who are there now—and it touches
everything that it does. Everything that an institution does should
reflect its culture, and changing the culture therefore takes
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:42:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000960" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0004.htm#13031445000960">Where
I disagree with some in this House is in my belief that leadership is
where culture starts. This House, managers in hospitals and trainers
all have a role to play. However, every time I consider the role of the
current chief executive, Sir David Nicholson, I come back to the point
that although he has voiced sentiments that I welcome in that he said
that to achieve care we need an open, transparent and care-led culture,
that it is vital for staff to be seen as an asset, and that it is vital
for staff to be able to challenge their leaders, the reality is that he
is a command-and-control manager. That is his legacy and others have
paid a price for it. I believe that his departure, whenever it may
happen, is absolutely necessary to change the culture because we need
to start at the top and feed it throughout the business. I say that
with a heavy heart, because I do not believe that we should be chasing
scalps. However, as I said at the beginning, we should be chasing the
ultimate outcome of serving our patients and that is one way of doing

scapegoats. We must remind ourselves what a scapegoat is: it is
somebody who gets the blame for somebody else’s behaviour. The

this debate. If we cannot find out, we must produce a system that has a
mechanism for
responsibility.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031445000963" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/debtext/130314-0004.htm#13031445000963"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:44:34"></hs_TimeCode>When

management is also about culture because we must be able to trust
people when we ask for something to be done, and know that the message

too much buck-passing and evasion, and that will not help us arrive at

Government have introduced a new minimum income threshold of
£18,600 for someone who wishes to sponsor the settlement in the
UK of a spouse, partner, fiancé, fiancée or proposed
civil partner whose nationality is not that of one of the European
economic area countries. A higher threshold applies if the
partner—I shall use that term as shorthand from now
on—has a child who requires sponsorship, too. It is
£22,400 for one child and an additional £2,400 for each
further child. There are also rules about adult and elderly dependants,
which I do not have time to address here. The British Medical
Association, among others, has raised concerns with me about the

rules<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:57:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

time to address them in detail tonight. I will just say that no newly
married couple wants to contend with delays when one partner is trying
to join the other in this country, and it would be helpful, and humane,
if such cases could be speeded up, especially when they comply with all
the rules and it is just an administration problem that is holding

migration at acceptable

to look after his elderly parents who are recovering from cancer. They
used to go on a fairly regular basis to visit him, his wife and child,

job in Thailand, which he has held down for a long time. It is a decent
salary according to local rates, but it is not the equivalent of the
£18,600 earnings limit in the UK. It is enough to provide him
with the same living standards in Thailand as he would have if he were
on that sort of salary in the UK—it is obviously a lot cheaper
to live there. Under the new rules, Mr X will have to leave his wife
behind while he finds work in the UK, which he is not prepared to
do—by which I mean not that he is not prepared to find work, but
that he is not prepared to leave his wife behind. They are now
considering moving to Spain instead, so that he is reasonably close to
his parents and it will be easier for his wife to join him, perhaps

years’ time. Wages in the pub trade are not particularly high,
so it is likely she will start on a salary below £18,600. As I

£75,000 because her husband could get a well-paid job, but under

Hong Kong to get away from him—but divorce is illegal in the

me first set out a bit of background to put this matter in context. As
part of our general reform of the immigration system across all the
routes coming to the United Kingdom, we undertook a major overhaul of
the family routes. There were three aims: to prevent burdens on the
taxpayer, to promote integration, and to tackle abuse.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T17:12:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bristol East’s focus has been on the financial requirement,
which is the minimum income threshold of £18,600 a year to be
met by those wishing to sponsor a partner of non-European economic area
nationality to settle in the UK, with higher levels for those who also
sponsor dependent non-EEA national children.</hs_Para>

point of the requirement is to prevent burdens from falling on the
taxpayer and to promote successful integration. To put the story round

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T17:12:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

hon. Lady raised the point about no recourse to public funds, which has
always been in place, and suggested that was a sufficient protection
for the taxpayer. The problem with that is twofold. First, under the
immigration rules only some things the taxpayer funds are classed as
public funds. The things that are not considered as public funds are
NHS costs, social care, contribution-based jobseeker’s
allowance, incapacity benefit, maternity allowance, retirement pension
and statutory maternity pay. A range of funds, therefore, are not
excluded under the no recourse to public funds measure. If someone
comes to the UK under no recourse to public funds, we would still have
to provide health care to them, therefore, which may well be a burden
on the
taxpayer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T17:14:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the hon. Lady and

Harper:</Member></B> No, the hon. Lady misunderstands me, which I am
sure is my fault for not explaining the situation. The point is that if
someone comes here and we say they have no recourse to public funds,
they do have access to the NHS. I think the hon. Lady was arguing that
because someone on a modest income who brings their family member here
could not access public funds, that would not place a burden on the
taxpayer. My point was that if, for example, that person needed to
access the NHS, they could, and of course that burden would fall on the
taxpayer, even though the income-earner’s contribution to the

wider, issue concerns the way our welfare system works. The presence of
the partner may of course increase the benefits that the British
national is entitled to. Although the migrant might not be entitled to
housing benefit, for example, their presence may well increase the
amount that the UK citizen is able to claim. That may give rise to a
genuine issue about how our welfare system works—that is another
debate—but given how it works, it is not quite as simple as
saying that, because there is no recourse to public funds, there is no

Harper:</Member></B> The previous requirement, which I think has been
alluded to, was that applicants had to be “adequately
maintained”. The courts generally interpreted 
<?notus-xml column=590?>that to mean income equivalent to the level of income support for a
British family of that size, which was about £5,500 a year for a
couple at that time. Our view was that that level of income was not an
adequate basis for sustainable family migration and did not provide
adequate assurance that UK sponsors and their migrant partners could
support themselves and their children over the long term.</hs_Para>

previous regime also required quite a complex assessment, both for
applicants and caseworkers, of current and prospective employment

was highlighted by the independent chief inspector’s report of
24 January on the processing of applications under the old rules for
spouses and partners. Again, that was partly why we wanted a financial
requirement that was clear and transparent; applicants would know where
they stood, and we could make clear and timely decisions.</hs_Para>

minimum income threshold is £18,600 a year, with a higher amount

Migration Advisory Committee. It gave us a range of figures and that
was at the low end. Its figures went up to about £25,000, a
level at which someone would be making a net contribution to the
Exchequer. The £18,600 level we settled on is broadly the income
at which a couple, once settled here, cannot access income-related
benefits. It is not an exact match, but it was as close as we can get.

Harper:</Member></B> Let me just develop the point, because either I
will answer it satisfactorily or I will not and the hon. Lady will then
be able pick up the point she thinks I have not answered adequately,
rather than getting in first. I will make two points. First, we do not
take into account the previous income of the migrant partner when they
apply for entry clearance mainly because what someone happened to be
earning elsewhere is no guarantee of their finding work here. However,
in the case she highlighted of the female British citizen with a South
African husband and in the case that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T17:23:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Slough mentioned of the skilled science 
<?notus-xml column=591?>teacher, although the partner may not be able to get
entry clearance to come to the United Kingdom as a spouse, they would
of course be able to apply under our tier 2 skilled working visa to
come to the United Kingdom. They could then get entry clearance on that
basis and once here in work, earning an income, they would be able to
switch into the family route. They could then show that they could earn
that level of income and that would then be taken into account. So
people who would be able to come here to work in a skilled job could
come here under an alternative route and once they have established the
fact of earning that level of income, they would be able to change
their status under the spouse route, with the appropriate route to
settlement. So certainly the South African husband could follow that
route and it would work for
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T17:24:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

that only if his job could not be filled by a UK person. He is a
computer programmer and, obviously, there are a lot of those in this
country already, so he would not meet the criteria: no employer would
say that the skills they required could be met only by him and not by
anyone else. He has worked in the UK for six years under a work permit
and it was unfortunate that the couple left the UK for a short time and

and they have to undergo a resident labour market test. So if he has a
particular employer in mind, the rules may be a little more inflexible
in the sense that he may not be able to say a specific employer, but if
he has skills to offer, there are many occupations in which there is a
shortage of people. If it is an occupation on the shortage occupation

be used to make up the difference. We look at the amount of savings
above £16,000, which is the threshold that is generally
disregarded for income-related benefits. If someone holds savings for
the period that they are hoping to come to the United Kingdom, which
would be 30 months, the savings count as long as the applicants have

Ottaway</B> (Croydon South) (Con):</Member> I am pleased to open this
debate on the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs report on the human
rights work of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. We are lucky to
live in a functioning, flourishing democracy, underpinned by the rule
of law. Sometimes, we are accused of going too far in our quest to
protect the sanctity of human rights, particularly those of criminals
who seek refuge on British shores, but it is a price that we pay for
freedom and a fair society. The question is whether we have a moral
duty to export the values and rights that we hold so dear. Of course we
do, but perhaps not at the expense of our national interests. Matching
the UK’s support for human rights and democratic values with its
pursuit of trade, security, energy and strategic interests is central
to much of the Foreign Office’s work.</hs_Para>

decades, some have argued that stability required highly controlling
regimes, and that reform and openness would put that stability at risk.
So, the argument went, countries like Britain faced a choice between
our interests and our values. And to be honest, we should acknowledge
that sometimes we have made such calculations in the past. But I say
that is a false
choice.”<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:32:02"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13031443000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000012">A
careful balance needs to be struck between our interests and our
values, and the Committee’s report on the Foreign
Office’s human rights work in 2011 explored that. In general, we
found that the Foreign Office, which I congratulate on its report, was
doing a lot of excellent work, at times under difficult circumstances,
but we believe that Ministers should be bolder in acknowledging
contradictions between the UK’s interests overseas and its human
rights values. Such contradictions are a theme that recurs constantly
in inquiries by the Foreign Affairs Committee. A good example is our
report on the Arab spring; some witnesses thought that a conflict
between the two could not always be avoided.</hs_Para>

Committee’s human rights report concluded that, in pursuing
interests alongside values, the UK runs the risk of operating double
standards. It urged the Government to be more transparent and to set
out the contradictions in the public domain. The Government rejected
our recommendation, but I invite the Minister to consider whether the
approach that we proposed would in fact be more open and realistic.
Could it expose the Government to less criticism in the long run,
without sacrificing our
principles?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000016">The
Committee noted that nearly two thirds of the FCO’s report was
taken up with commentary on human rights in countries of concern. The
section on countries of concern is a valuable source of information,
but it has difficulties, such as certain controversial omissions and
vague criteria, although I note that the Government response says that
the FCO will report fully on the criteria in its next report. We warned
that the list of countries of concern would lose credibility if
political and strategic factors were allowed to colour decisions on
designation. Such decisions, we said, should be based purely on the
assessment of human rights standards and should stand up to objective
comparison.</hs_Para>

which we questioned the Foreign Office’s judgment. At least 35
people died and 2,000 were arrested following repression in early 2011.
The report by the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, although
substantial and respected, is being implemented slowly, and there is
still much to be done. I am keen to keep an open mind on the issue, as
we are still in the midst of our inquiry into the UK’s relations
with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and have yet to hear their
Governments’ side of the argument. However, the injustices in
Bahrain in February and March 2011 were undeniable, and the events in
Bahrain did not seem any less serious than those in other countries
that were listed as countries of concern. I know that the Foreign
Office is not persuaded—it says that Bahrain has a better record
than many countries in the region—but it is only fair to give
notice to the Minister that one of the first things that Committee
members will do when the FCO publishes this year’s report is to
turn the pages to see whether Bahrain has been designated a country of
concern, as we believe it should be.</hs_Para>

with assurances was another area highlighted in the Committee’s
report. Countries receiving deportees from the UK give assurances that
their human rights will be respected on their return. Arrangements are
already in place with Jordan, Lebanon, Ethiopia, Algeria and Morocco.
As a Committee, we are aware of the widespread criticism that promises
by Governments with a chequered record of treatment of detainees are,
to quote one of our witnesses, not worth the paper that they are
written on. The case of Abu Qatada, which has provoked great anger and
frustration in recent weeks, is a prime example. I welcome the
Government’s response that David Anderson, QC, the independent
reviewer of terrorism, will conduct a one-off review of the policy on
deportation with assurances and that the conclusions will be made
public. However, the Committee asks the Foreign Office to provide more
information on the arrangements for monitoring detention conditions.
The Foreign Office agreed in its response to provide details of the

concluded that the DWA arrangements are of such significance in

that memorandums of understanding are not legally binding, but I hint
to the Minister that the FCO missed the point slightly. We are talking

devoted a section of our report to the FCO’s use of public
pressure such as sanctions, boycotts and the like, but sometimes
private pressure is the way forward. Sir Tom Phillips, the former UK

generally accepted that there are occasions on which public pressure,
particularly concerted multilateral action, can be valuable in
indicating widespread disapproval of a foreign state’s human

sanctions on Iran have been effective in contributing to the current
parlous state of the country’s economy, but it would be harder

there are still some 200 political prisoners in Burma. We urge the FCO

Perhaps the Government have already done exactly that, but we do not

FCO to strike a better balance, so that its global influence and
credibility grow stronger. We live in an age of 24/7 news, where
intelligence can be disseminated worldwide at the click of a button. We
also have the unprecedented emancipation of previously suppressed
peoples, and they might be suspicious of the motives of foreign
countries meddling in their affairs. It would therefore be a naive

Gapes</B> (Ilford South) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I am grateful to be
called early, Mr Havard. I begin by taking up the question on Russia,
which my friend the Chairman of the Committee, the hon. Member for
Croydon South (Richard Ottaway) left us with. The chairman of the Duma
international relations committee, Alexei Pushkov, was on
“Newsnight” yesterday, and I am sure the Minister will
have been shown a transcript of what he had to say. He said—I am
paraphrasing, because I do not have a transcript—that Blair and
Brown were hostile to Russia and raised questions on human rights and
other matters, but that David Cameron’s attitude was different
and the British Government have a new approach. Will the Minister
clarify the Government’s position, given that there have been
discussions with the Russian Foreign Minister and Defence Minister in
London in the past week?</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=149?><hs_Para UID="13031443000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000031">Is there a new
approach that downgrades human rights concerns about events in Russia
and ignores the murder by polonium on the streets of London of a man
with connections with Russia and the UK? We also have outstanding
issues, which date back to the harassment of our ambassador in Moscow,
and I understand that harassment of British diplomats is ongoing. There
are also issues relating to the British Council. To coin a phrase, has
there been a reset of relations with Russia, such that human rights and
concerns of a bilateral nature are no longer on the agenda, or is Mr
Pushkov mistaken? I hope he is, but it would be interesting to hear
from the Government whether that is the
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000032">The
second thing I will talk about is Sri Lanka. I have a long-standing
constituency interest in Sri Lanka, because many of my constituents
fled from the terrible violence of the Sri Lanka civil war. I also have
many constituents who came to Britain several decades ago and did not
flee from that war. They are happily settled in the UK and have a
different narrative to tell. I am increasingly concerned that there is
a policy to remove people back to Sri Lanka following the civil
war’s end when we do not have the necessary guarantees about the
human rights situation and the treatment of those individuals on their
return. In our Select Committee report on the matter, we referred to
concerns of that kind, as well as to the policy and relationship of the
FCO and the UK Border Agency on decisions about the human rights
situation in Sri Lanka and the forced removal of Tamil people living in
the UK. The Government have recently had to respond to a freedom of
information request from an organisation called Freedom from Torture,
which I understand raised some further concerns.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031443000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000033">When the
Select Committee raised the issue, we were told that there are no
credible allegations on the torture of individuals who have been
returned to Sri Lanka. We were also told that the Government do not yet
have substantiated evidence that people who have been returned have
been mistreated. We asked about the processes they go through, how they
check, who they speak to and how they gather information. A substantial
section of the Government response refers in passing to those issues,
but I will not quote it now. Do the Government still believe that there
are no credible allegations? Are there still no substantiated cases
where there is evidence of mistreatment?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031443000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000034">I understand
that in response to a freedom of information request, which was issued
on 6 February this year, it was suggested that a number of people who
had been forcibly returned to Sri Lanka have been subsequently given
asylum, or at least a leave to remain of some kind, in this country.
How many of those are Tamils who were returned due to concerns about
their mistreatment? I have been told—I do not know whether it is
correct—that there are either 13 or 15 people in that category.
It would be helpful to know how many of those allegations of torture
were found to be credible, because that information is not in the
public
domain.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000035">Given<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:50:18"></hs_TimeCode>
that we have concerns about what is happening in Sri Lanka—about
the treatment of opposition figures and journalists, and about the very
large military presence in the north of the island—is our
Government’s position still the same, as regards the
Commonwealth Heads  of Government meeting that is supposed to
be held this year in Colombo? Some other Commonwealth
countries —no doubt this will be debated later this
afternoon—have said that they will not send their Prime
Ministers or 
<?notus-xml column=150?>leaders at a higher level. Canada has made its position on that clear.
Is it still the British Government’s position that it is too
early to judge? If so, what criteria will need to be met before our
Prime Minister attends that Commonwealth meeting?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031443000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000036"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T13:50:40"></hs_TimeCode>Finally,
I want to raise a general point about the need for human rights issues
to be at the centre of the approach to such matters internationally. I
was concerned when the UK Border Agency and the Home Office started to
have a lead role on some of these issues. Potentially, there is a
downgrading of the concerns that are expressed by Human Rights Watch,
Amnesty International and other organisations that look at those
matters worldwide. If the approach in Government is that policy
priority is given to economic benefits—or other matters, but
that human rights issues are subservient—and if we have a policy
that is driven by the desire to keep down the number of foreign
nationals coming to the UK, that raises concerns about how we will deal
with people who are at risk of persecution, torture, and even of their
lives, because other criteria are being given priority by the
Government. I hope that that is not the case, and I will be grateful to
hear the Government’s

<hs_Para tab="yes">I want to raise a particular
aspect of human rights in the context of China, and it concerns the

an

on the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills website, for the
third quarter of 2012, the Government have stated that they approved
arms export licences for components for military electronic equipment;
equipment for the use of military communications equipment; military
communications equipment; military electronic equipment; and technology
for military communications equipment. Will the Minister explain how it
is that when the British Government have signed up to the EU arms
embargo on China, they are still none the less approving military arms
export licences to China for the type of equipment that, on the face of

the freedom to express, the freedom to criticise and the right of
peaceful protest. The laws that are now being put through the Duma,

not entirely as I would have wished. It contains no reference to the
right of peaceful demonstration or protest and instead of referring to
“a free media” refers to “a free and responsible

irresponsible to snuff out freedom of expression. We have made a

the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley) on
how the late Robin Cook, as Foreign Secretary, introduced the concept
of an annual human rights report from the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office. In return, the Foreign Affairs Committee must monitor it and
put forward proposals, and then we get a debate in Westminster Hall,
which seems to be a poor return for the amount of work put in by both
the FCO and the Committee, particularly as the debate is limited to an
hour and a half. I reiterate what I said last year, and I have said
every year about the debates: the debate should be for at least three
hours, in the main Chamber on a Thursday afternoon or another
appropriate time—possibly in Government time. If we are to be
taken seriously as a country concerned with human rights and with the
influence that we can bring to bear on human rights around the world,
we have to take ourselves seriously. Although I respect all hon.

wanted to raise many issues, but I shall try to be brief to take on the
points you made, Mr Havard, about the length of the debate. We should
consider the fact that the parliamentary process of human rights
monitoring is complex. We have the Human Rights Act 1998, which applies
to UK law. I am a strong supporter of it and our participation in the
European convention on human rights and the European Court Of Human
Rights. You, Mr Havard, chair the Joint Committee on Human Rights,
which the 1998 Act set up. I welcome the Joint Committee and its work.
It has been a valuable way to monitor what has gone on, but I remain to
be persuaded that, with all the other responsibilities the Foreign
Affairs Committee has, it would not be better to have an international
human rights Committee of the UK Parliament to deal with international
human rights issues and to put forward the strong cases that many
Members make on many occasions about human rights issues around the
world.</hs_Para>

have moved on, in that Britain is a signatory to the International
Criminal Court and our courts have pronounced a universal jurisdiction
for human rights offenders and potential war criminals where there is
prima facie evidence against them.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:19:06"></hs_TimeCode> was a huge
step forward. We have spent a lot of time raising human rights in Chile
and the need to put General Pinochet and others on trial for what they
did there, so I welcome the universal jurisdiction declaration. Much
less welcome however is that Parliament has reduced its applicability
by limiting the arrest warrant to an application by the Director of
Public Prosecutions rather than an application from an individual
citizen to Westminster magistrates court. That has not done our
reputation much good.</hs_Para>

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:29:45"></hs_TimeCode> welcome the
way in which our representatives at the Human Rights Council in Geneva,
which I quite often attend on behalf of a non-governmental

death penalty, the UK representative gets up and objects to its use in
that jurisdiction; I absolutely welcome

non-participation of certain countries in it, particularly the United
States, obviously weakens it. Since the first world war, the US has had
mixed feelings about involvement in any international organisation.

delegation with colleagues from the Liberal Democrat and Conservative
parties, organised by Interpal. The issue of human rights and the

1.7 million people are in a prison called Gaza, with very limited
access to Israel and no access whatever, as far as I can see, to the
west bank through Israel. The population is imprisoned unless Egypt can
be persuaded to open the Rafah crossing fully, which would in turn make
Gaza part of Egypt rather than part of Palestine. That may well be the

final general points are about thematic issues. Dalit people in India
and many other countries suffer a collective abuse of human rights
because of a perverted view of Hinduism. Hundreds of millions of people
suffer from that. We have an opportunity to support what the House of
Lords has done and defend its amendment to our legislation that would
mean that it will be illegal to discriminate by caste and descent in
this country. That is illegal in the Indian constitution, but
collective discrimination takes place on a massive scale.
While<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:29:45"></hs_TimeCode> the

programmes, which ensures that that does not happen in any project that

is therefore important that Saudi Arabia is mentioned in the report,
that China is covered in detail and that such very sensitive areas as
Israel and the Palestinian territories are also included. It is notable
that the Foreign Secretary has been increasingly robust and assertive
in his comments on Israel. He has talked about Israel not just
generally, but specifically in relation to the settlements. He has also
spoken about the potential for the European Union to take further steps
in its relationship with Israel—that is very beneficial
economically—and the consequences that might flow from Israel
simply not abiding by the international community’s expectations
about respecting Palestinian human rights.

arms trade has been mentioned. The coalition was quite right to revoke
a whole series of 170 or more arms licences across north Africa and the
middle east. The licences were inherited from the Labour Government, 
<?notus-xml column=159?>as we have sometimes pointed out, but even the coalition did not act on
them quickly. It was only the Arab awakening that
highlighted the importance of revoking those licences, because arms
were being supplied to almost every regime, of whatever record on human

Libya and other dictatorial regimes then in

negotiations that will soon resume in New York. The Minister who

robust treaty. However, we must not allow the qualms expressed by the
United States last year at those negotiations to scupper that important
global process and the progress that is being made towards a robust
arms trade treaty. Last year, when the American election was imminent,
its position was understandable, but we must not allow domestic
American politics to jeopardise a massively significant international
initiative that I hope will help to protect human rights all over the

security policy, the well-established building security overseas

the Ministry of Defence, the Department for International Development

clearly to recognise the human rights of the Tuareg and of other
peoples in the north of Mali, and had not provided the breeding ground
first for the civil war and then for the incursion by foreign al-Qaeda

policy also has an impact. We think of it as completely unrelated to
human rights, but if, for example, we decide to accept European biofuel

Friend the 
<?notus-xml column=160?>Member for Tonbridge and Malling about China are very important.
The issue is significant not only in relation to
human rights within China’s borders—where those borders
lie is arguable; it is now accepted that Tibet is part of China, but
the ongoing human rights situation there is very serious—but in
relation to the influence, support and friendship that China has given
to some quite odious regimes over the years, from Burma to North Korea,
Sudan and Zimbabwe. If China is to become a responsible member of the
family of nations, I am afraid that it really needs a responsible
record on human rights around the world.
Unfortunately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:37:00"></hs_TimeCode>,
the current example in Syria shows that it is another country to add to
the list, alongside Russia. Both Russia and China need to step up to
the plate and to support the international community in taking on the
murderous Assad

processes. High-profile cases, such as the case of Abu Qatada, have
coloured the whole public debate. We must not return people to
countries where they are at risk of torture and there is a risk that
human rights are abused. In a way, it was important that it was not the
dreaded European Court of Human Rights, but the British Special
Immigration Appeals Commission, that eventually kept Abu Qatada in the
country. That case is still to be resolved, and we should probably not
discuss its details in this Chamber. It is important, however, that our
approach to such issues is not dictated by the <I>Daily Mail</I> and
the<I> Daily Express</I>, but by a real concern for human

it is important to have a robust arms trade treaty, and Britain should
play a strong part in that. We should not only preach and produce
reports about human rights, but act in international forums in a way
that reinforces human rights. That is sometimes a difficult balance to
strike. It was difficult for Robin Cook, with his ethical foreign
policy. It was probably quite difficult for the former right hon.
Member for Midlothian, the proud Liberal Prime Minister William
Gladstone, all the way back in 1876, with his Midlothian campaign, when
he was the first politician to make human rights absolutely central to
British politics. I am very proud to stand in that tradition. I am also
proud to support the coalition Government when they have raised human
rights, but they must act as well as

right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling used his expertise to talk
about North Korea and Russia, as did
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:40:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ilford South (Mike Gapes). Last year, I went to Moscow
to observe two days of the trial of Pussy Riot, which is an issue that
is quite dear to my heart. This year is the 10th anniversary
of Khodorkovsky’s arrest, and the two band members were held in
the same glass box that was used to contain him when he came to court.
From the people I met on that visit and from the numerous events that I
have been involved in since calling for the release of the two
remaining members of Pussy Riot who are still being held in penal
colonies, it is clear that the human rights situation in Russia has
deteriorated significantly. Human Rights Watch said recently that 2012
saw the worst crackdown since the fall of the Soviet Union. It will be
interesting to see how that is addressed in next year’s
report<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:40:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000097">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:40:54"></hs_TimeCode>

in Sri Lanka. I am also speaking in the next debate about Commonwealth

hon. Friend the Member for Islington North and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:41:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) discussed in some detail the matter of
Israel and Palestine. I will not refer to it here, as it is a topic
that is discussed in quite some depth elsewhere. For example, in
Foreign Office questions last week, about half of the questions on the
Order Paper were about Israel and Palestine. None the less, let me echo
the concerns that have been expressed, especially about the failure of
international law to make any progress. It is all very well to condemn
the human rights situation, the illegal settlements, the route of the
wall and, of course, the abuses on the other side, but there is always
this sense of déjà vu; what can the Foreign Office do to
address those issues, make some progress and try to ameliorate the
situation for the many people who suffer human rights
abuses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:42:15"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000099">Let
me turn now to the detail of the report. Last year’s report
noted the Foreign Office’s decision to omit Bahrain from the
list of countries of concern in its 2010 human rights report, which was
described as a “glaring omission” by Human Rights Watch.
The Government’s response last year argued that many of the most
serious events in Bahrain fell outside the 2010 period covered by the
report, but that they undertook to ensure that next year’s
report—the one we are discussing now—would address them.
None the less, Bahrain is still not included as a country of concern,
and the Committee has once again concluded that it should have
been.</hs_Para>

FCO’s report included a case study of Bahrain, but Human Rights

elaborate on the reasons for 
<?notus-xml column=162?>including Bahrain as a case study rather than as a country of concern,
and tell us who was involved in taking that
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:43:07"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000101">Will
the Minister commit to introducing more transparency and clear criteria
for the designation of countries of concern, especially as Human Rights
Watch have described the current rationale as “vague and
unconvincing”? I also echo the questions that were posed about
the Bahrain grand prix. It was a matter that we discussed in some
detail last year. There seemed to be a lack of clear guidance as to
whether it was appropriate for the 2012 grand prix to go ahead. Will
the Minister advise us on the FCO’s position on the 2013 grand
prix<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T14:43:42"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000102">Boycotts

the Government’s approach last year. Indeed, with the Euro 2012
matches in Ukraine, the Minister seemed to suggest that the Government
would keep the attendance under review. It was said that if the England
team progressed to the later stages of the tournament, the Government
might be prepared to attend, but they would boycott the earlier stages,
which seemed rather inconsistent and gave the impression that the
Government were willing to attend if they received good PR and a nice
photo opportunity back at home but were not too bothered about the
earlier stages of the game.</hs_Para>

Kyi become President of Burma. I wanted to mention my visit because it

Britain stands for democratic freedoms, universal human rights and the

connected with the Commonwealth to be
raised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:05:51"></hs_TimeCode>, as much

some issues affecting
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:06:08"></hs_TimeCode>. It is a
rather good week, apart from being the week in which Commonwealth day
occurs, because the new charter has been signed by Her Majesty the

recognise in this

might be asked, what really is the Commonwealth? To even pose the
question is a reminder that many people are unaware of the existence of
the Commonwealth in their daily lives. That is worrying in respect of
the Commonwealth concept having meaning and if people are to understand
its breadth and the opportunities it
provides<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:07:00"></hs_TimeCode>. It is,
importantly, a voluntary association. Nobody has to be a member of the
Commonwealth. The modern Commonwealth is not a British Commonwealth; it
is the Commonwealth of
nations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:07:14"></hs_TimeCode>, in
which there should, indeed, be parity of esteem. It is an example of
countries slowly edging together, towards wider circles of
understanding and co-operation, beginning to see that there are
opportunities that were perhaps not recognised 10, 20 or 30 years
ago.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000164">The
Commonwealth embraces one third of the world’s population, and
half of the population of the Commonwealth is under 25. We should be
particularly concerned about that young section. Just as we tend to
accept the world as it is at the moment we are born, so the
Commonwealth can pass over the heads of many young people, weighed
down, perhaps, by what they see as immediate issues around them, rather
than realising that they are also part of this greater
entity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:08:13"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Commonwealth must have meaning for them. That is why there is
particular importance in the promulgation of the charter, affirming the
commitment of the

is correct that we should ask all members of the Commonwealth
continually to assess themselves, and be assessed, against those

degree of tolerance has to be allowed. There is never going to be a
rigid standard to which at all times all nations are going to conform,
for a variety of reasons. Indeed, looking at our systems of government,
it could be argued that none of us are perfect. It is not too clever
for British politicians to say to their partners in the Commonwealth,
“You should be doing more about the representation of women in
your Parliament”, when we in this country have not attained the

achieved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:09:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000166">We
cannot always expect the laws in certain other Commonwealth countries
to conform to where we are; we have changed our minds on some issues,
and the laws in our country have developed. We need to be careful about
the extent to which we scold other countries for not marching in step
with us. What is needed is a process of persuasion—sometimes
rather slow persuasion—to move countries towards what might be
seen as full conformity with the values of the charter.</hs_Para>

concluding the wider debate that preceded this one, the Minister
mentioned the upcoming Heads of Government meeting in Sri Lanka. I
visited that country for last year’s Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association conference. I had the privilege of giving a lecture in the
series commemorating the late Lakshman Kadirgamar, Sri Lanka’s
former Foreign Minister. He was a contemporary of mine at university,
whom I admired then and whom I grew to admire even more during his
legal and political career. In my lecture, I laid down views as to what
our friends in Sri Lanka needed to do to give confidence to their
partners in the Commonwealth and to ensure there was full-hearted
support for their hosting of the Heads of Government meeting later this
year. It is perhaps worrying that they have not yet demonstrated, to
the complete satisfaction of their friends in the Commonwealth, that
all is moving in the right direction.</hs_Para>

must, therefore, continue to be persuasion so that countries understand
the importance of adhering to the values of the charter. The
Commonwealth ministerial action group must take a more active role in
chivvying, to ensure that people are not allowed quietly to forget,
reject or abrogate the principles behind the charter.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:12:02"></hs_TimeCode>The CPA has a
valuable role to play in that respect. It is not as effective as it
could be. It is divided into nine regions, and a lot of valuable work
is done, but more could be done if there was the will and if there were
the resources.</hs_Para>

does the CPA do? It concentrates on strengthening parliamentary
institutions. One has only to look around to see all sorts of possible
improvements. Some Members of the House would say that improvements
have to be made in the way Westminster works. We never reach a
destination; there is always a desire to see how much more we can
improve. However, bigger steps need to be taken in certain other
countries. Many of those countries 
<?notus-xml column=172?>will look to this country for guidance, including help from Clerks about
procedural matters or creating robust Standing Orders.</hs_Para>

the churn rate of Members of Parliament in the different jurisdictions,
people find themselves elected and then wonder what they have to do
next. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:13:39"></hs_TimeCode> can all
learn from the interchanges that take place under the CPA’s
auspices; we can learn from each other. We might say to someone,
“Well, that’s interesting: I have that problem, but I
didn’t know you had it as well. How do you tackle it?”
There is mutual advantage in such exchanges. Similarly, strengthening
parliamentary institutions is a topic for almost never-ending
discussion.</hs_Para>

are also the diplomacy aspects. When parliamentarians talk to one
another, whether in structured seminars or on their margins, when one
meets afterwards for a meal or a drink, we begin to understand each
other’s problems and points of view. That is not megaphone
diplomacy; it is about quiet discussion and respecting the people we
are with. There lies the strength of the interchanges I mentioned. Such
things are, no doubt, easily mocked by the press. If someone strays
outside their own jurisdiction to visit another, that may be
seen as being somehow a diversion from their main duties,
but it should not be, because such exchanges are extremely valuable.
Strengthening Parliaments across the Commonwealth to improve the
quality of governance is the key to their ultimate success in ensuring
the prosperity and welfare of their people.</hs_Para>

course I acknowledge what my hon. Friend says, as well as the need for
many of the organisations he mentioned to work together. In some cases,
what these different interests are trying to do overlaps, so if they

CPA has the advantage of embracing the small states and the overseas

established the principle that the Commonwealth Youth Parliament should
meet every year, because it has met just five times over the past 50 or
60 years, which is not enough. Young people expect continuity; they do
not want to be picked up every now and then, asked, “Are you
interested? Have you got something interesting to say?” and then
forgotten about. There needs to be a continuing process whereby young
people’s voices are heard at the highest level.</hs_Para>

Member for Saffron Walden (Sir Alan Haselhurst) on the Administration

am conscious of the time and will restrict myself to brief observations
on five areas. As has been mentioned, the CPA has a vital parliamentary
strengthening role, as do the Commonwealth institutions themselves. The
right hon. Gentleman was right to speak of a two-way learning process.
The process at the general election was not all it could have been.
There were queues in many cities, because of poor administration. In
the light of the way many other Commonwealth countries run their
elections, we may need to learn from them. There was also noteworthy
turnout on a couple of recent occasions. I am wearing my Falkland
Islands cufflinks for this debate: I received 
<?notus-xml column=174?>a letter today from the Minister about the 92% turnout in the
referendum. If only we could have that in Northamptonshire or
Dunfermline, I am sure that we would get similar acclamation. Turnout
was similar in recent elections in overseas territories such as the
British Virgin Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands, at 80-plus per
cent, which shows that we have things to learn. I hope that the

reason why I welcome the enhanced role of the ministerial action group,

the trade and investment side of the Commonwealth is crucial.
Commonwealth trade is worth £3 trillion—not dollars, but
sterling. Indeed, the GDP of Commonwealth countries will overtake that
of the EU by 2015. The opportunities are huge, and it is essential that
Britain should make the most of them. I believe that we can do that and
use some of those shared values—particularly shared legal
systems and philosophies on regulatory frameworks—to our
advantage. What does the Minister intend to do, along with UK Trade

opportunities in

role that the Commonwealth could pursue with enhanced vigour relates to
regional trade integration. Trade Mark East Africa involves mainly
Commonwealth countries and has been a great success in breaking down
trade barriers between them. Above all, single points of entry between
different countries have obviated the need for multiple checks at
borders. The same is true also of a tripartite agreement that has been
pioneered by the Southern African Development

Friend the Member for Saffron Walden, briefly. One of the key aspects
of a recent White Paper on the overseas territories was enhanced
engagement by other Departments. A unique selling point of that White
Paper is that it harnesses the power, influence, knowledge and skills
of other Departments to the benefit of those tiny territories, which
lack capacity. I suggest that the Commonwealth can also play an
important role in that approach. For example, it helped when the Turks
and Caicos Islands had to go into special measures and came under
direct rule. Thankfully, home rule has now been restored; but in the
interim period, Canada put a great deal of effort and investment into
the islands and, for example, seconded a police commissioner and deputy
police commissioner there. Both those officers made a significant
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:28:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000193">I
want to mention the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting that is
scheduled to take place in Colombo. I feel strongly that the future
credibility of the Commonwealth is closely linked to its ability to
uphold and protect the values set out in the new charter. We must be
completely realistic. In spite of numerous warnings and the
announcement of red lines, the conduct 
<?notus-xml column=176?>of the Sri Lankan Government and especially their attitude to

measures in an assault on democracy, including the harassment and
arrest of members of the Opposition. Former President Nasheed had to
seek refuge in the Indian high commission, and, having left the high

want briefly to touch on a couple of issues that we have not yet heard
about in this debate: the importance of collaboration on education
across the Commonwealth and the importance of reaching out to students
from across the Commonwealth, as the Prime Minister  recently
did in India, to persuade them to come to study in the UK. In his
speech in 1961, my father said that  we should seek to create a
Harvard Business School for the Commonwealth. If we had such an
institution, it would be enormously valuable in the 21st-century world.
We should be looking at the opportunities for Britain  to reach
out, to engage and to play an active role in the Commonwealth, and we
should ensure that we are humble about our position. We should feel not
that we own that organisation but that we are an active and
engaged member along with the other major powers and great nations that
form the 21st-century
Commonwealth.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13031443000314" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000314"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:39:35"></hs_TimeCode>3.39

want to make four brief points; first, to commend the Select Committee
report and the Government’s positive response to many of the
recommendations. As a Parliament, it is good that we understand that
the Commonwealth is a vital part of our foreign affairs, that it
consists of our oldest friends and that the club of which we are the
oldest member—or, the oldest club of which we are a
member—is one that we sustain, encourage, build up and support.
I have always been a fan of the Commonwealth, not to the exclusion of
support for  the European Union or the English-speaking world,
but because they are all complementary. It plays to our strengths but,
under all Governments, we have never 
<?notus-xml column=179?>given the Commonwealth the priority that it deserves. My first request
to the Minister therefore is for the Government, as suggested by the
Select Committee report, to look at and beef up our commitment to
Commonwealth in all ways and all Departments,  to show that we
want to be a serious
player<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:40:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000214">Various
areas could be usefully prioritised. In a second, I will come back to
one that has already been the subject of a debate, but last week we had
a good debate in the main Chamber about the death penalty elsewhere in
the world, about the people on death row in India with the return to
executions in that country. We could reasonably seek to persuade those
Commonwealth countries that still have the death penalty that it is not
a necessary part of a law and order policy, which is better without it.
To work with our friends in India and other countries would be
helpful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:41:31"></hs_TimeCode>. We also
need to persuade other countries such as Uganda that persecuting
homosexuals is not appropriate for a Commonwealth Government. We need
to ensure the right support for people of all backgrounds, colours,
castes, faiths, sexes and sexuality, irrespective of where in the
Commonwealth they
come<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:41:48"></hs_TimeCode> from. I am
also keen that we elaborate and clarify our commitment to the
educational exchanges which have been touched on for students from
Commonwealth countries. We have cut back on Commonwealth student
scholarships, which is a short-sighted failure, because building up
historic links that have been present for a long time is hugely
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:42:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000215">Secondly,

Friend the Member for North West Norfolk (Mr Bellingham), recently a
Minister in the FCO. We cannot be supportive of the Commonwealth Heads
of Government meeting going on in Sri Lanka without a sea change in the
attitude of the Sri Lankan Government. I do not have an antipathy to
Sinhalese people, a Sinhalese Government or a Sinhalese President but
clearly, over the years, the minority communities and in particular the
Tamils have been ill served. Tests include the disappearance and
assassination of journalists, one of the lowest rated categorisations
for press freedom in the world and an inability for foreign countries
and agencies such as the UN or the Red Cross to be present in the
country freely. Sri Lanka has to change. I know the FCO position and
that we are withholding our engagement, but unless there is significant
change our response needs to be
stronger.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000216">Thirdly,
I have had a long interest in Cyprus. I congratulate President
Anastasiades on his recent election as the President of Cyprus. There
is an opportunity to resolve the half-century of dispute over
Cyprus—in effect, since its independence from the United

I have a request that the Minister knows is coming: the Commonwealth
Youth Exchange Council, in which I have had a part over the years, has
lost its funding from the British Council and needs about
£100,000 a year in public support to keep it going. It does

Commonwealth is an extraordinary and wonderful organisation of which,
frankly, we do not make enough. I am delighted to have the charter
described in a little detail by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Saffron Walden. In particular, I praise article IX, which recognises
the need for sustainable development, and article X, which declares
that we need to conserve our natural
ecosystems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:45:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000220">The
only country that I want to mention specifically is the Maldives, so I
am glad that the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:45:30"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Ilford South (Mike Gapes) did so as well. I declare my
interest, which is as chair of the all-party British-Maldives group. I
do not wish to be critical of our Government, whether past or present.
President Gayoom, however, had led the Maldives for 30 years, and
democracy is not easily developed or won. We gave plenty of support to
the elections in 2008, but the idea that that was fine, that democracy
was then up and running and that we could move away could not be
further from the truth. Without boring the Chamber and going into lots
of detail, a number of issues should have been dealt with more
robustly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:46:28"></hs_TimeCode>, as the
hon. Gentleman said. Nevertheless, I meet regularly with the high
commissioner, and I am glad that the upcoming elections appear to be on
track. At our meeting only two weeks ago, I was reassured that the
elections would be fair and free, with former President Nasheed a
likely and unhindered participant. Perhaps my right hon. Friend the
Minister might reflect on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:46:50"></hs_TimeCode> and, when
he has time, write to us in a little more
detail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:46:59"></hs_TimeCode>. The
point I wanted to make is that the Commonwealth should help in every
way it possibly can, not only with observers but in the build-up to the
elections. Some may say, “Oh, the Maldives, wonderful holiday
resort”, but life in the Maldives for many people is not like
that. It would be a great shame if we abandoned this fledgling
democracy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T15:47:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000221">I
am optimistic about the future of the Commonwealth. I salute the
charter, which sets out clearly some important principles to which all
Commonwealth nations should adhere and probably already do. That is not
to say that there are not huge challenges: many hundreds of millions of
Commonwealth subjects still live in poverty; many children do not have
access to education; and AIDS is still rife in many member states. I
would not claim to have all the answers, but we are much stronger
working within the Commonwealth than alone. Our shared cultures and
close trading ties are pivotal, and I hope to see a renewed and
continually developing Commonwealth emerge over the coming

Commonwealth is an extraordinary organisation and family of nations,
bringing together shared values, often a shared language and shared
culture, with sporting links and many other dimensions of what I
suppose these days we call soft relations or soft power. It
is important to emphasise the importance of the Commonwealth as an
avenue for the exercise of soft power, in contrast to many much more
formalised, rigid and confrontational international arenas. The
Commonwealth is enormously important in

Commonwealth members deserve particular attention; the one probably
most at risk in terms of the shared values and international relations
is Pakistan. The Commonwealth and the British Government should
certainly be doing their utmost to support the traditions of democracy,
freedom, peace, security and human rights in that country, while not
underestimating the threats posed to it by internal and external
forces. The terrible but inspiring case of Malala Yousafzai, who had to
struggle first for her education and then for her very life against
some of those forces, is instructive. Perhaps it has started to shift
some of the political forces within Pakistan. The more that we can
celebrate the courage of people such as Malala through the Commonwealth
and other arenas, the more that we can support Pakistan in protecting
those traditions.</hs_Para>

innocent, as we understand that her personal commitment to the
Commonwealth is strong. If she attends, it will be difficult for the
British Government not to attend, because we would not want to
embarrass Her Majesty. If she does not attend for other reasons, it
might provide an opportunity to reflect on whether Britain should
attend the meeting. At the moment, only the Canadian Government are
saying that they will not attend, but we must reflect on the situation

human rights that we have experienced, but it is something of a matter
of shame that no fewer than 36 of the 58 countries where capital
punishment is still lawful are Commonwealth countries and
that many of those countries still criminalise homosexuality and have a
hostile response to gay rights. When the Prime Minister
called for Commonwealth countries to reconsider the criminalisation of
homosexuality, some countries responded positively—Malawi began
to repeal legislation—but others, such as Uganda, went in the
opposite direction. It is important to emphasise the totality of human
rights for all Commonwealth citizens.</hs_Para>

development and the duty to protect the environment. It includes access
to health, education, food and shelter, essentials that some
Commonwealth citizens can now take for granted but that remain
unobtainable for far too many. In many ways, the charter illustrates
the diversity, and indeed inequality, within the Commonwealth. It could
provide a basis for reducing the inequality while continuing to respect
and celebrate the diversity. I agree entirely with the right hon.
Member for Saffron Walden that we should not enforce exactly the same
criteria across the Commonwealth; we should tolerate diversity within
the Commonwealth and accept people’s right to their own way of
doing things. However, in some areas, we must try to unify the
Commonwealth around a certain set of values.</hs_Para>

area of concern that is touched on in the charter’s clauses on
human rights, the rule of law and justice, but it is not explicitly
referenced. As the Foreign Affairs Committee has noted, 36 of the 58
countries where capital punishment is lawful are Commonwealth members.
Although some of those countries are abolitionist in practice, in that
they do not carry out the death penalty, their citizens are still
sentenced to death and so remain on death row indefinitely. The
UK’s long-standing position is to support the abolition of the
death penalty in all circumstances. Will the Minister tell us to what
extent we have led discussions on the death penalty and LGBT rights
within the Commonwealth, with respect to other countries’ rights

I want to touch on the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, which
has been mentioned by several speakers, both in this debate and the
earlier one on human rights. I was interested to hear the Minister say
that the UK Government’s position on whether we would attend
CHOGM was not decided. In a previous debate, I got the impression from
one of his colleagues that it was fairly set in stone that the UK would
attend and that the UK Government were not prepared to use the fact
that CHOGM is approaching in Colombo in November as leverage to try to
persuade the Sri Lankan Government to do more on the human rights
agenda. The right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon
Hughes) suggested that that was an ideal opportunity, and I think the
hon. Member for North West Norfolk (Mr Bellingham) mentioned that as
well. It is important that we do not just allow Sri Lanka to use the
CHOGM to promote the regime and present itself as a wonderful country.
It is in some respects a wonderful country—it is an amazing
country to visit on holiday—but we should use the intervening
period between now and November to put pressure on the Government to
make some
progress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000245">As
I have said, I apologise if I have dwelt too much on the negative, but
it is because I think the Commonwealth has achieved a great deal. I was
in Uganda a few years 
<?notus-xml column=185?>ago, just before it was due to host CHOGM. It was interesting that
people all over Kampala were not at all interested that the
Prime Minister or any other UK politicians were
coming to visit; they were interested that the Queen and Prince Charles
were coming. All their questions were about that. It was clear to me
how important they felt their place within the Commonwealth was and how
privileged they felt to be able to host CHOGM that year. CHOGM is
immensely valuable for Britain and the other countries that take part,
but we should also use it to try to make progress on progressive values
and to address the issues of poverty within the Commonwealth, as well
environmental issues and all those other issues, otherwise it becomes
something to celebrate, but not something that helps to change the
world.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_14_PT_1/014637FE7C26A82C25816F380CED4A2D9D7D4137" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="14 March 2013">Thursday

day. Her Majesty is, of course, a staunch advocate of the
work of the Commonwealth, which she heads. The
charter’s agreement marked a major milestone in the promotion of
democratic values across the Commonwealth. For the first time in its
64-year history, the Commonwealth has a single statement defining the
core values for which it stands. They are the values that member
nations think are important enough to bring together in one single
document; values which affect the lives of millions across the
Commonwealth every day.</hs_Para>

Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) and several others have made
clear, it is simply untrue to say that all Commonwealth countries
already adhere without exception to every value in the charter. By
setting them out and agreeing to aspire to them, however, we are on the
road to ensuring that they become common currency across the
Commonwealth. I agree with the hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry
McCarthy) and the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark
(Simon Hughes) when they talked about the role of the charter and what
Commonwealth countries can do on LGBT issues. We fundamentally believe
that we should do much more and we remain concerned by recent attempts
in several Commonwealth states to introduce punitive laws on
homosexuality. As is well known, the coalition Government are committed
to upholding the rights and freedoms of LGBT people in all
circumstances. We are clear that discrimination is never acceptable. It
is important that these countries agree and have a goal to aim towards,
because the Commonwealth’s future credibility is closely linked
to its ability to uphold and protect core democratic values.</hs_Para>

years the Commonwealth’s reputation as an organisation based on
values has been tarnished by a perceived silence on human rights
concerns. We have heard today about concerns on the political will in
some Commonwealth countries to uphold the values to which they have
committed under the charter. That undermines the credibility of the
Commonwealth, which is why we are working to strengthen how the
Commonwealth promotes and protects its values. We believe that the
commitments in the charter should be upheld, adhered to and kept under
constant review. Making the Commonwealth ministerial action group that
acts on those concerns stronger and more proactive is crucial. The
group responded well to the crisis in Maldives, which I will come to in
a minute, and its continued engagement is
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000254" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0001.htm#13031443000254">In
common with other international organisations, the Commonwealth must

considerable challenges in building a sustainable peace for all Sri

the Member for Southend West (Mr Amess). We support the
Commonwealth’s work on the Maldives. CMAG’s decisive and
timely engagement with the Maldives during the political crisis last
year was a demonstration of its commitment to implement a stronger
mandate. As the Commonwealth continues to offer technical assistance to
help strengthen 
<?notus-xml column=189?>the judiciary and other key democratic institutions there, the UK will
maintain contact with all parties in the Maldives and with engaged
international partners. Our shared goal is a stable, peaceful and
democratic future for the Maldivian people. We welcomed, at the time,
the appointment of Sir Donald McKinnon in March last year as the
Commonwealth special envoy. He has used his extensive expertise and
experience to work with all the parties. Both he and the Commonwealth
secretary-general have stressed the importance of moving forward to
“free, fair and inclusive” elections in the
Maldives.  Sir Donald was most recently there in January. We
have sought and received assurances from President Waheed that any
trial of former President Nasheed will be fair and free from
political interference. We look to the Maldivian authorities to ensure
that due process is followed and that legal proceedings are
fair and transparent.</hs_Para>

is pretty evident from everything that has been said that we are all
conscious here of the need for good governance at the centre of any

made the suggestion to the Sri Lankan Government a few months back and
also to the Commonwealth Secretariat that perhaps it would be
helpful—reassuring, indeed—if we were to stage a
Commonwealth democracy forum as part of the proceedings of the CHOGM,
because parliamentarians other than the Heads of Government have not
had a particularly prominent role at a CHOGM. Many other organisations
of a civil nature have done that, so it is rather strange that
parliamentarians have been somewhat subdued in this context. The idea
has not so far been progressed, but I think that it would be a useful
symbol, linked with the charter, to show what parliamentarians are all
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-14T16:22:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031443000274" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/halltext/130314h0002.htm#13031443000274">If

historical payments to one using area payments), welcomed the revised
text and its lower level of ambition. The UK along with some other

Commission presented the new smart borders package aimed at enhancing
EU border security and strengthening the Schengen area through an

had been extensive consultation and analysis in the preparation of the
proposed package, and £949 million has been earmarked in the
external borders element of the internal security fund for development
costs. Despite some positive welcomes for the package, the high
implementation cost dominated the exchange of views with calls for
lessons to be learnt from other large scale IT projects. Many member
states pressed for the inclusion of law enforcement access and
biometrics from the start of the system in order to justify the cost
and ensure added value in tackling illegal immigration. The presidency
noted the exchange of views and looked forward to discussions at expert
level. The UK will not be participating in either component of the
smart borders package as they build on the part of the Schengen
agreement in which the UK does not participate. However there is value
in the successful introduction of an entry/exit system that would

recognising the success of the French-led military effort, member
states acknowledged that much remained to be done to develop police and
criminal justice capabilities in the region. The counter-terrorism
co-ordinator, supported by the UK, stressed the importance of work to
counter extremist narratives and the need to strengthen aviation
security. The UK argued that terrorist groups in the region had
benefited from ransom payments and restated the long-held position of
the UK Government not to pay ransoms or grant other substantive
concessions to hostage-takers. The UK also noted that data-sharing, in
particular passenger name records, was vital for detecting individuals
travelling to conflict zones. Finally, the UK highlighted the
importance of sending a clear signal that terrorist attacks on EU soil
would not be tolerated. If there was compelling evidence linking the
military wing of Hezbollah to the Bourgas attack, the UK said that the

the need to continually lay further rules changes to

Expenditure on plants is set to be approximately £450 per annum
with effect from March 2011. Data for 2005 to 2008 based on yearly
costs as HQ facilities management contract runs from July to July.
Costs previously covered cover site visits by an outside
sub-contractor, as well as maintenance and replacement (where
necessary) of plants located in the lobbies and public areas of Great
Minster House, London. Expenditure in 2010-11 also includes termination
cost of maintenance

expenditure on pot plants relates to the interior landscaping of the

generating. As a consequence, interior landscaping (plants and flowers)
are necessary due to the need to ensure the facility demonstrates a
professional outlook and provides an image that is comparative with
similar venues. The expenditure incurred for the RLDC relates to the
rental of the displays. There are also interior plant displays in some
of the public areas of the local vehicle registration offices. The

any spend on plants or trees cannot be split out from the service

the new limits recognise the difficulty in forecasting such price
changes. The effect that MARPOL Annex VI would have on diesel prices

Robertson:</Member></B> The lessons learned from the Future Libraries
Programme, a joint Local Government Association (LGA)/DCMS initiative,
were published by the LGA in “Local solutions for future local
library services” in June 2012. The publication includes advice
and examples of shared services work being undertaken by local
authorities, as well as the potential benefits that can be derived. In
addition, Arts Council England (ACE) developed the Library Development
Initiative to test new approaches to library service delivery,
including shared services. LGA and ACE have also now engaged directly
with nearly 100% of elected councillors with executive responsibility
for the library service through joint leadership seminars and peer
support, and this included learning about models for shared library
services. A crucial part of the LGA's work is to spread best practice,
including shared services, and they also have a wider programme looking
at shared services across all kinds of services, not just libraries.
The Department will continue to engage with LGA and ACE and provide
further information relating to sharing services as it becomes
available.</hs_Para>

18-month period. Where the condition is unlikely to change
significantly in the longer term, cases will be looked at again at a

there is already a considerable focus on the performance of vulnerable
pupils with SEN in accountability arrangements, and this will continue.
In particular Ofsted's inspection framework has been revised to provide
a renewed focus on SEN since September 2012. It ensures that, in
evaluating the achievement of pupils in a school, inspectors consider
how well disabled pupils and those who have special educational needs
have achieved since joining the school. The changes also ensure that
inspectors give a similar consideration to those eligible for the pupil
premium. Together this means that outcomes for vulnerable children and
young people with SEN are central to the inspection
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031451001427" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/text/130314w0003.htm#13031451001427">We
shall also continue to collect and make available information about
performance by specific groups, including those with SEN. Schools
themselves have to publish a range of information for parents,

The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology
developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO), which
uses 48 indicators for alcohol-related illnesses, determining the
proportion of a wide range of diseases and injuries that can be partly
attributed to alcohol as well as those that are, by definition, wholly
attributable to alcohol. The application of the NWPHO methodology has
recently been updated and is now available directly from HES. As such,
information about episodes estimated to be alcohol related may be
slightly different from previously published
data.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">2.
Alcohol attributable fractions are not applicable to children under 16.
Therefore figures for this age group relate only to wholly-attributable
admissions, where the attributable fraction is one.</hs_TableFooter>
<hs_TableFooter Justify="left">3. These figures are
not a count of people and do not represent an actual number of
admissions that were attributable to alcohol. Alcohol attributable
fractions (AAF) are based on the proportion of a given diagnosis or
injury that is estimated to be attributed to alcohol. Some diagnoses or
injuries will, by definition, be wholly attributable to alcohol and
have an AAF of one, others however will only be partly attributable to
alcohol and have an AAF greater than zero but less than one. Diagnoses
or injuries that are not attributable at all to alcohol will have an
AAF of zero. These figures are derived by summing all AAFs for the
relevant admissions and should therefore only be interpreted as an
estimate of the number of admissions that can be attributed to
alcohol.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">4.
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures
over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data
quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in
coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07),
and changes in NHS practice. For example, changes in activity may be
due to changes in the provision of
care.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><I>Source:</I></hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">Hospital

the health service for the next two years. It includes an objective for
the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS CB) to make measurable progress
towards making the national health service among the best in Europe at
supporting people with ongoing health problems to live healthily and
independently, with much better control over the care they receive. It
is for the board to decide how they will carry this out; the Government
will hold them to account, and the board will in turn hold clinical
commissioning groups (CCGs) to account, for the outcomes they
achieve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031460000342" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130314/text/130314w0003.htm#13031460000342">CCGs
will therefore have the primary responsibility for determining what
steps are needed to minimise the disability resulting from
musculoskeletal conditions. Early diagnosis will play a crucial part
especially for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and
ankylosing spondylitis. To support local commissioners, the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has published
clinical guidelines and other guidance on a number of musculoskeletal
conditions, and NICE Quality Standards for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid
arthritis and other conditions are in preparation. In addition the NHS
CB have recently announced the appointment of a national clinical
director for musculoskeletal conditions who will consider what other
steps could be taken at national level to support high quality local
commissioning.</hs_Para>

Soubry:</Member></B> The national health service next stage review was
commissioned by the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr
Brown), the then Prime Minister, and reported in 2008. The report was
based on the contributions of a wide variety of organisations and
individuals, primarily under the auspices of the strategic health
authorities, who themselves published their own strategic vision
documents, upon which the final report drew considerably. The national
review team was led by Professor the Lord Darzi of Denham, the then
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department, with
contributions from many other Ministers. The purpose of the review had
been to seek contributions from people and organisations with direct,
local experience of the NHS. The review was therefore a year-long
process that involved thousands of clinicians, NHS staff, patients,
stakeholders and members of the public. The review was widely
acknowledged at the time (for example, in the introduction to the
report) as having been a joint enterprise across the Department, the
NHS and other interested groups (such as the medical Royal colleges) as
well as representatives of patient groups.</hs_Para>
