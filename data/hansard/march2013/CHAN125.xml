identity. That is an important way of ensuring that the protests come
off the streets and that we find a genuinely inclusive way to decide on
these issues. The Belfast agreement gives guarantees on protecting
identities of Irishness and Britishness, and it is now time for the

pensioners are exempt, people with severely disabled children are
exempt and people who need round-the-clock care are exempt. Those

government—the biggest banking bust in our history, the build-up
of the biggest deficit in our history. All the mess that we have to
deal with now was delivered by him and his henchmen in 2008. Before we
go on to the spare room subsidy, let him get to his feet and apologise
for the mess that he left in this country.

the spare room subsidy, pensioners are exempt, people with disabled

clear, because the Prime Minister obviously does not understand it. His

died in the first two months of this year than in the whole of the
first year of the conflict. The total estimated death toll is now more
than 70,000. The regime has used Scud ballistic missiles against
civilian areas, and the UN commission of inquiry for Syria has found
evidence of grave human rights violations, war crimes and crimes

a systematic policy of rape and sexual violence by the regime’s
forces and its

a diplomatic breakthrough remains, of course, our objective. Last week,
I discussed Syria with the new US Secretary of State John Kerry here in
London, and with other close partners in a core group meeting of the
Friends of the Syrian People in Rome. In Rome, I met President
al-Khatib of the Syrian National Coalition, and welcomed his brave
announcement that the National Coalition is open to direct talks with
members of the Assad regime. We continue our efforts to develop common
ground with Russia. I will have talks with Russian deputy Foreign
Minister Bogdanov later this afternoon, and next week with Foreign
Minister Lavrov, also here in London. At the end of January, the UN and
Arab League special representative for Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, set out
a credible plan for the establishment of a transitional authority in
Syria. We are working with allies to achieve, if at all possible,
Security Council backing for a transition process, and I am meeting Mr
Brahimi again this
afternoon<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T12:37:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0001.htm#13030658000191">However,
the fact remains that diplomacy is taking far too long and the prospect
of an immediate breakthrough is slim. Each month of violence in Syria
means more death, wider destruction, larger numbers of refugees and
bloodier military confrontation. The international community cannot

more active efforts to prevent the loss of life in Syria. That means
stepping up our support to the opposition and thereby increasing 
<?notus-xml column=962?>the pressure on the regime to accept a political solution. What we face
is not a choice between diplomacy on the one hand and practical
assistance on the other; helping the opposition is crucial to bringing
about a political transition and saving lives, and both must be pursued
together. We will always be careful in how we develop our policy, but
our readiness to develop it further should be unmistakable,

happens in Syria is vital to our national interest for three reasons.
The first is the growth of extremism. We should never forget that the
vast majority of those opposing the regime are ordinary people trying
to defend their communities and gain freedom for their country.
However, Syria today has become the top destination for jihadists from
anywhere in the world, and we are already seeing a rise in sectarian
violence and attacks using improvised explosive devices, including car
bombs. We cannot allow Syria to become another breeding ground for
terrorists who pose a threat to our national
security.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0001.htm#13030658000193">Secondly,
the crisis is undermining the peace of the region. On top of the
refugee crisis, there have been reports of clashes on the Iraqi border
and in Lebanon. We are increasingly concerned about the regime’s
willingness to use chemical weapons and have warned the Assad regime
that the use of chemical weapons would lead to a serious response from
the international community. Those who order the use of chemical
weapons and those who use them will be held to account. There is also
credible information that, through its Revolutionary Guard corps, Iran
is providing considerable military support to the regime, including
personnel, equipment, weapons and direct financial
assistance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T12:39:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0001.htm#13030658000194">Thirdly,
we and our allies must always be prepared to respond to situations of
extreme humanitarian distress. Our foreign policy is inseparable from
upholding human rights, protecting lives and supporting international
law. We must assist the genuine moderate and democratic forces in Syria
who are in dire need of help and who feel abandoned by the
international community. The longer this conflict goes on, the more
human suffering, persecution of minorities, radicalisation and
sectarian conflict there will

these three compelling arguments, there will still be those who say
that Britain should have nothing to do with Syria, but we cannot look
the other way while international law and human rights are flouted, we
cannot step back from a crisis that could destabilise the heart of the
middle east, and it would be the height of irresponsibility to ignore
potential threats to our own security. I want to explain to the House,

volatile region in growing tension and political deadlock that has

steadily more active approach, learning the lessons of previous

rising by the day. Only today the United Nations announced that the

the number of casualties rises, frustrations too have been growing.
That has understandably led to renewed calls for the international
community to do more. The primary responsibility for the crisis rests
with Assad and his regime, but does the Foreign Secretary accept that
the deteriorating situation in Syria also represents an abject failure
by the international community and that it shares a collective
responsibility for that failure? It is right that efforts must now
intensify, but the key issue is the breadth of those efforts, how they
are channelled and how likely they are to deliver results.</hs_Para>

are some vital areas where the international community must better
co-ordinate and target its efforts. First, on international diplomatic
efforts, the stalemate at the United Nations Security Council is more
than just frustrating; it is deplorable. The case must be made to
Russia and China that supporting or aiding Assad not only harms Syria
but harms their own interests, and indeed their standing in the wider
region. Will the Foreign Secretary set out what representations he will

<?notus-xml column=965?>make to Foreign Minister Lavrov when he is in London next week on this
issue and the prospects of a change of position in the Security
Council?</hs_Para>

11 separate rounds of sanctions against Syria have already been agreed.
The issue at present is not necessarily new sanctions, but effective
enforcement of existing ones. Given the Foreign Secretary’s
recent visit to Lebanon, does he agree that more must be done to ensure
that countries fully comply with the existing sanctions to which they
have already signed
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T12:49:12"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0001.htm#13030658000210">Thirdly,
on international accountability, the responsibility for the crisis
primarily rests with the Assad regime, as I have made clear, and the
perpetrators must ultimately be held to account. Does the Foreign
Secretary agree that efforts to collect and publish the names of Syrian
army officers ordering the ongoing atrocities are vital? Such efforts
could serve as a clear signal of intent that those officers will face
the full force of international justice for their crimes—and of
course that includes the use of chemical weapons.</hs_Para>

of those offers has yet been accepted and nor can we make a judgment as
to the spirit in which they were intended, but will the Foreign

let me turn to the central issue of the UK’s support for the
Syrian opposition and the announcements in today’s statements.
It is right that the UK is at the forefront of co-ordinating
international efforts to deliver aid to those most in need, both within
and beyond the Syrian borders, and I welcome recent announcements to
that effect. Beyond humanitarian assistance, when it comes to our
support for the Syrian opposition forces, it is vital that all our
support must continue to be targeted and accountable if it is to be

reality that today’s Syria is replete with arms, and does he
also accept the great difficulties involved in guaranteeing the end use
of weapons, given the lack of clarity today about the identity, intent
and, indeed, tactics of some of the rebel forces? Does he accept that
it is perfectly possible that, if Europe or, indeed, the west more
generally, were to decide to arm the rebels, Russia or, indeed, Iran,

than pushing for the EU arms embargo to be relaxed, amended or lifted

understand that the frustrations of Government Members are growing, but
a strategy born of frustration is less likely to deliver than one based

Britain should be to work to unify the Syrian opposition, not to arm

see a de-escalation and a political resolution. Although the Government
have our support for their actions to provide the humanitarian and

would negotiate with members of the regime without prior insistence on
the departure of Assad. However, President Assad’s insistence
during his weekend interview that the regime is ready to negotiate is
something that we have heard for two years but that has never turned
into actual substance. Of course, we will discuss with Mr
Brahimi again this afternoon whether those statements can be used to
bring both sides closer together. It is part of his job to try to do
that. The evidence of the past two years, however, is that, in current

no alternative remaining. My right hon. and learned Friend has put the
case—for a long time, actually—for going much further
than I have proposed today in regard to the arming of the opposition
movements in Syria by western countries. The difficulties involved in
doing that have partly been set out by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T13:03:47"></hs_TimeCode> right
hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire South
(Mr Alexander), but we also have to recognise that that
conflict in Syria is already militarised. Opposition groups have access
to substantial quantities of weapons, and those weapons are already
inside Syria. There is such a flow of weapons. I therefore believe that
it is right for the development of our policy to be graduated, for us
to show our readiness to deliver increased assistance and for the
European countries and the United States to be willing to amend our
policy if the situation continues to deteriorate, but in a way that
will command general support and that will pose the least danger to the
increased militarisation of the conflict. That is why I think this is
the right balance to strike, rather than moving to the position that my

Gentleman. He accurately characterises the position, although it is
perhaps putting it too strongly to say that we are providing
“every kind of assistance” short of lethal equipment. We
are providing the assistance that I have set out today, and we will
provide other assistance of that nature for the protection of
civilians. That is an important requirement in the exemption to the UN
arms embargo, and we will interpret it exactly. The assistance has to
be for the protection of civilians. So the right hon. Gentleman went a
bit too far in his characterisation of the position. He is right,
however, to say that it would be a bigger and further step to decide to
send lethal equipment. We have taken no decision to do that, and we
have no current plans to do that, but it is necessary to be clear that
in a situation of this gravity, with its implications for the peace of

no-fly zone is, of course, that it is a response of a totally different
nature. It is a military intervention of the sort that we have been

require military force externally on a substantial scale. A good
argument of principle can be made for that on the basis of relieving
human suffering by doing whatever is necessary, but the willingness of
nations around the world to implement such a military intervention is
limited, for understandable reasons. Indeed, such a no-fly zone could
be achieved in practice only with the full participation of the United
States of America, so major practical difficulties are involved. What
we must not get into is saying that there are protected areas or
humanitarian corridors, but then not being able to protect people.

political and orderly transition should happen in Syria. There are
certainly terrible weapons, chemical and biological, in Syria, which is
why it is important to be clear that there is no military-only

chemical weapons are best safeguarded through a peaceful transition.
That is what we need to keep arguing for. Without giving additional

military intervention, rather than a move to any policy of support for
the sending of lethal equipment to Syria. There is a respectable case
for that, but as I said earlier to the hon. Member for Sheffield,
Heeley (Meg Munn), it would require the willingness of a large part of
the international community, almost certainly including the United
States, so that we were not making a false promise of safety to people.
Syria continues to have strong air defences with very modern equipment,
and the implementation of a no-fly zone would be a very large military
undertaking. It is important for those who advocate it to bear that in

the less support those forces receive from outside, the less will be
their chances of success in standing up to those extremists. We must

powers were able to agree among themselves about the situation and
about a solution, that would be an enormous step forward, just as it
would be a vital step forward if we, the five permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council, were able to agree among ourselves.
There have been some attempts. Last autumn, the Egyptian Government
convened a group consisting of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey to
consider the situation together and to see if they could agree on a way
forward. I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that they did not reach an
agreement, but that is not to say that such a group could not be
revived in the future. We have absolutely no problem with that. It did
not succeed before—the reason it did not succeed is that Iran

tried before, but it should be tried again. In any negotiated way
forward, a ceasefire would be a very important element of the early
part of the negotiations. My hon. Friend may recall that last summer
the United Nations envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, proposed a ceasefire to
coincide with Eid. For a short time there was some hope that the
proposal would be implemented, and there were many efforts to implement
it in parts of Syria, but within days the ceasefire had completely
broken down. Again, that does not mean that a ceasefire should not be
at the top of the agenda for negotiations, but as my hon. Friend will
have gathered, we do not have successful negotiations at the

International Development Secretary, who was here earlier, to announce
such things, and she announced at the Kuwait conference at the end of

increase—taking the total to £140 million. We are one of
the biggest donors in the world in trying to alleviate human suffering.
I hope that when the hon. Gentleman lists what I have said we will be
sending to the opposition he will cite the full list, including medical
supplies, water purification and measures to help prevent the spread of
disease. The need to alleviate humanitarian suffering is therefore at
the forefront of our minds, and that is what Britain is devoting by far

drew attention to the jihadists committing atrocities using explosive
devices, including car bombs. I have a British-Syrian constituent who
is on the verge of acquiring British citizenship who has immediate
family who has been killed by such a car bomb. She now wants to bring
her parents to the UK simply for them to have some respite from what is
happening there. They are faced with an incredibly difficult journey
either to Lebanon or Jordan in order simply to make the application to
come here, which now seems extremely difficult even if they were to end
up being successful and getting here. If the circumstances are as I

applications simply for the parents to come here for a while would
merit his support?</hs_Para>

in other countries. It is the responsibility of the countries that
receive the refugees to look after them, with international support,
and I pay tribute to the generosity of the people of Lebanon, Turkey,
Jordan and Iraq in what they are doing, and we are doing our best to
assist. That is the prime way for refugees to be assisted. My hon.

are 4 million out of the population of 21 million displaced or in

it is difficult to bring together something like the National

made to bring together those moderate and democratic forces, and it is

the refrain of some of the other countries on the Security Council and
of the regime has been, “We want to negotiate, but we do not

top. A political and diplomatic solution requires people much further

the south of Lebanon between Hezbollah and the Free Syrian army or

regime forces. I do not have any other evidence that I can cite about
Hezbollah, but that in itself is a great danger and is one of the
reasons we are assisting with the stability of Lebanon. In Lebanon two
weeks ago I announced additional British funding for the Lebanese armed

20 minutes in the UK, someone is diagnosed with a blood cancer such as
leukaemia. It could happen to any of us or to any or our family
members, young or old. As I speak, 1,600 people need a bone marrow
transplant from a suitable matching donor to treat blood cancer or a
blood disease. A matching sibling donor does not always exist and for
70% of patients the kindness of a stranger on a register of volunteer
donors is the last hope of life. For half those in need, that match
will not be found. Although bone marrow donation provides no
guarantees, the five-year survival rate following a bone marrow

match those of their donor. Among ethnic minority populations the range
of these markers is great, resulting in a greater
range of tissue types and a reduced chance of a successful patient and
donor match.</hs_Para>

educating young people about how they could save a life, a true example
of how our education and health services can join up in a very simple
way to solve a national problem. That was the belief of Adrian Sudbury
after whom the call for this law, Adrian’s law, is named. Adrian
was a 25-year-old journalist when he was diagnosed with leukaemia in
2006. As he learned about his treatment, he discovered that young
people were not regularly informed about becoming donors and realised
that many more people like him could be helped if donation was far
better understood.</hs_Para>

campaigned alongside friends and family for an
education project to equip 16 to 18 year olds with the facts
about bone marrow, blood and organ donation and to bust the myths
around those donation processes. That campaign became “Register
and Be a Lifesaver”, the education project managed by Anthony
Nolan and NHS Blood and Transplant that started shortly after
Adrian’s death in 2008. The programme has been run with the
support and drive of Keith and Kay Sudbury, Adrian’s parents,
with Keith’s background 
<?notus-xml column=985?>as a head teacher being invaluable. I pay tribute to Adrian’s

a short, flexibly delivered training session that needs to last only 30
to 40 minutes, pupils learn that 7,000 units of blood are needed every
day and that each one can help three people. They learn that 90% of
people think organ donation is a good idea, but just 31% are on the
organ donor register. They also learn that bone marrow donation is much
like giving blood, for the most part. Once given the absolute facts,
young people can decide for themselves about their potential to help
someone in need, and decide they do. In October 2012 Anthony Nolan
changed the joining policy governing its bone marrow donor register to
allow young people from the age of 16 to sign up. In the five months
since that change, over 1,800 young people decided to join the bone
marrow donor register after learning the facts. Indeed, since the whole
project began in 2009, more than 1,400 young people have joined the
organ donor register and 5,000 have signed up to donate

this is not just a numbers game. Reaching more young people, and
quickly, will help us find matching donors and reduce the number of
people who die while waiting for that lifesaving match. There is also
the question of donor availability. A clinician prefers a younger bone
marrow donor for their patient, as a younger donor is less likely to
have any health conditions that prevent them from donating or that

need for donors is clear. The solution is also clear. Anthony Nolan has
asked young people, who make the best donors, to consider the power

Education on citizenship is heralded as a means to embed our
responsibility to our communities, creating a generation committed to
volunteering, so why not, by the same measure, consider education on
donation as a means to ensure a healthy future for those who need blood
transfusions and organ or bone marrow transplants? We have a
responsibility to uphold access to the best

Anne Begg</B> (Aberdeen South) (Lab):</Member> On 22
November last year I was privileged to launch in the Chamber a Work and
Pensions Committee report entitled “Universal Credit
implementation: meeting the needs of vulnerable claimants”. That
day I was the only one officially allowed to speak. As a result there
are a number of hon. Members who are—I was going to say
frustrated—itching to speak. I hope they will have the
opportunity to do so
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000329" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000329">That
day showed that there was huge interest in various aspects of universal
credit and its implementation, so it is excellent that we have the
chance to have this debate today, especially as the Government have now
published their response to that report and we can look in more detail
at the issues raised by the Select Committee. I expect hon. Members
will also raise their own issues that we did not examine.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T14:06:36"></hs_TimeCode> is a good
time to revisit the findings of our report to see whether, three and a
half months on, the Government have made progress in addressing some of
our concerns. This has become more urgent because the first claimants
in the pathfinder areas will begin to be assessed for universal credit
in just over a month, and the roll-out for new claimants begins in
October this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T14:06:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000330" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000330">Universal
credit is the Government’s flagship welfare reform. Everyone of
working age who claims one or more of the many income-related benefits
will, over the next four years, be moved on to universal credit. Some
8.3 million households will be affected once it is fully rolled out.
Not all of them will be on the new universal credit, but they will be
affected in some way, so if universal credit does not work in the way
that it is designed to do or if the IT fails to deliver, it has the
potential to cause a great deal of stress and anxiety in families who
depend on the state for some or all of their
income<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T14:07:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000331" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000331">The
size of the Government’s ambition in introducing universal
credit became clear to the Select Committee as we began to receive
evidence. Such a large-scale 
<?notus-xml column=988?>reform of the benefits system has so many aspects to it that
we realised we would not be able to cover all the provisions
in detail. We did not have time to explore fully
all the incentives and disincentives to see which families would be
better off and which would be worse off, who would lose money and who
would manage to survive. Other questions were raised with us that we
did not deal with in as much detail. Would families with high child
care costs be better or worse off, for
instance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T14:08:16"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000332" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000332">We
did not have time to interrogate properly how robust the
Government’s often repeated assertion is that under universal
credit all people would be better off in work than not in work under
all circumstances. Some doubt has been cast on whether that will be
true. We know that under the system there will be notional losers,
although the Government have promised that there will be some cash
protection. We were aware, for instance, that second earners in the
family may not mean that the family is better off under universal
credit. We were aware also that families with particularly high child
care costs might not be better off once those are factored
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T14:09:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000333" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000333">The
reason it is often very difficult to reform a complex welfare system,
as we have in this country, is that there can often be
unintended consequences, and I am sure UC will be no
different. I am fairly sure that Ministers will admit that that is
bound to be the case. Even if everything goes incredibly well, there
will be unintended consequences.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T14:09:08"></hs_TimeCode>The real test
for the Government will be how adept and quick the Department for Work
and Pensions is in dealing with the inevitable blips; how it irons out
the kinks, how it ensures that families do not face difficulties while
it sorts out any problems and how quickly it responds when the
inevitable difficulties
arise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000334"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T14:10:06"></hs_TimeCode>It
would have been impossible for the Committee to give detailed
consideration to every aspect of universal credit, so we decided to
concentrate on its implications for vulnerable claimants, which
explains the report’s title. Not all benefit claimants are
vulnerable; far from it. It is worth remembering that most people of
working age who receive benefits are in work and are not dependent on
the benefits system for all their income. However, it is probably true
to say that all vulnerable people are benefit claimants. It is
therefore imperative that the Department takes account of that and does
not design a system that can be accessed only by people who can manage
their lives fairly well. It must also be easy to navigate for someone
who finds life a struggle. I mean someone who struggles to pay their
bills, struggles to follow basic written instructions, struggles with
poor health, struggles to use public transport, struggles to heat their
home or struggles to put a nutritious meal on the table—someone
who just struggles with daily living. Those are the people who face a
complete overhaul of the benefits they receive. It was to those who
might find the introduction of universal credit a real challenge that
the Committee paid most
attention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T14:11:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000335" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000335">The
biggest barrier a vulnerable claimant might face is making a claim in
the first place, because the Government are determined that universal
credit will be an online benefit—“digital by
default” is the phrase they use. The application will be made
online, any change in circumstances or other information will have to
be reported online, as will any change of earnings, but the sting in
the tail is 
<?notus-xml column=989?>that the information might come from Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs, so obviously the information has to get from HMRC to the DWP
computers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000336"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T14:12:19"></hs_TimeCode>The
most important aspect of universal credit’s delivery will be the
IT. If it goes wrong, the whole system will grind to a halt. However, a
digital system, in order to work, requires users—in this case
the claimants—to have access to, and be able to use, the
internet. There is still great concern that the people who need to
apply for universal credit will not have access to the internet, or
indeed to a computer, in order to make the claim in the first place and
that, for those who are not computer literate, there might not be
sufficient help for them in the right
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000337" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000337"><Member ContinuationText="Dr Eilidh Whiteford" PimsId="5544" UID="13030658000997" xid="1003" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000997"><B>Dr

greatly. We were told that as many as 80% of claimants might struggle
with some of the IT and that as few as 20% would not have internet
access. Although some people might be able to use Facebook and other
social media sites, that is quite different from making a claim that,
by its nature, has to include very personal information. Many people
who do not have a computer at home might not be able to use computers
in the public domain, such as those in internet cafes, because of
security issues. There are many questions about access to computers and

that point. The Government said in their response to the
Committee’s report that there will be a telephony system, which
is good to know, although I understand that there will be no paper
application form, so no one can phone up to request one. They expect
about 45% of initial claimants to use that system to complete their
claim. However, the person at the other end of the line will be using
the same interface that online claimants see, so it will have to be
designed in a way that works and is easy to understand. Access to a
computer is one thing, but the customer-facing interface must also be

trumpets the fact that there will be computers in

about three terminals per office, and I am not sure whether

not very clear about that. It does say that staff will be available,
but it is very vague: it does not say how many or how much time they
will have. Jobcentre Plus staff are already overworked. Will they have
the time to sit down alongside someone until they have filled in their
whole claim, or will they just get the screen up and leave them to it?

big area of concern about UC is that it will be paid once a month into
a single bank account for each household. The Government’s
response says that the Secretary of State has powers to vary the
frequency of payments, but this would be time limited. It also says
that the Department for Work and Pensions will try to identify
claimants with, for instance, mental health or addiction problems who
might not manage monthly payments, but suggests that help will be
provided for only a limited period. The Government seem to think that a
drug addict will somehow be able to learn how to budget properly after
a couple of months. The essential problem is that getting a whole
month’s money in their hand at once might be too tempting. I do

being able to manage payments, particularly the big bulk of money that

come out on the day after the money goes in, not the day before; that
is another potential problem. Banks will need to be sensitive to this
market. So far they have been very reluctant to provide products that
will cater for these people, simply because there is not a lot of money

realise the importance of this, but the Government will need to do a

of the problems with passported benefits is that the Government have

is important for other Departments to know how passported

is one benefit change that flies in the face of all of this and
undermines what UC was intended to do. The localisation of council tax
support will add complexity back into the system and introduce local

that the customer-facing screens must be right and that, behind that,
the programmes must calculate what a claimant should get and pay it
into the bank. Those computers will have to speak to the HMRC computers
so that the real-time information can be fed in. However, because of
the proposals on council tax support, they must also interface with the
local government computer system, which apparently is called ATLAS. I
do not know whether that just applies to England and Wales. That is
another potential IT difficulty that could cause problems for people.

their way to the right place at the right time, so that all the people
who will be relying on it for their universal credit payments will
receive the right amount on the right day, especially as the system

is worth saying, as the Committee noted in its report, that there is
broad agreement with the principle of a single payment that makes it
easy for people to move in and out of work, with their income going up
or down so that they get the right benefit at the right time. We all

is not to say that people are not in a mess now. We all have
constituents who have struggled with the existing system of multiple
claims. There are people whose tax credits have gone wrong, perhaps
because their income has changed during the year and they have
forgotten to notify HMRC or HMRC has lost the notification, who have
ended up with a large bill at the end of the year that they were not
expecting and did not have the money left for. We are not trying to
reform an ideal system or even a good or acceptable system; we are

the Government promised that by 2014 there will be a separate app for

next area of concern is the single monthly payment per household, and
making that replicate what most people in work receive as a salary is a
sensible step. We are not talking about people who only receive
benefits; people in work will receive universal credit on top of that,

money, at which point their benefit will drop. In an ideal world, a
single monthly payment that matches timing with salary must be a step
forward. We are trying to help people get back into work and not face
extra barriers created by the benefit system. Clearly there are issues,
however, and some people will not be able to cope with one single
monthly payment. We must consider how we will help them through that,
deal with the exemption system, and find out that they are not coping
before they get into so much debt that they cannot get out of it.

universal credit soon, and we must understand what their bank accounts
will look like to ensure the system works. I have heard lobbying groups
present interesting ideas about the real advantages of the jam jar
system. People can choose to have their rent payment moved into a
separate account so that it goes out on the right day and they cannot
accidentally spend it on something else. Applications that use payment
cards or jam jar bank accounts can produce useful solutions. Perhaps we
can introduce a system under which people have the chance to choose
their preferences. People must choose to set money aside for certain

am a little concerned that we will end up with two different reporting

their monthly profit or income based on some kind of calculation, yet
for tax purposes they will have to use a completely different
calculation. That could leave them with two different sets of books and
calculations which could be hugely complicated and they may end up with
some true-up at the end. Hopefully, people can get some assurance that
what is expected for universal credit is the same as HMRC expects at
the end of the year. It could be nice and simple—people could
hit a “total” button on the universal credit system and
it will say what their annual profits have

overriding concern is that some people—for a variety of reasons,

more frighteningly, no one would know that. I have had occasion to
raise individual constituency cases with the Minister. I also remember
raising with the Secretary of State the case of an individual who is
agoraphobic. He has not been outside his house for 35 years. His
elderly mother is responsible for maintaining and caring for him, but
she is not going to live for ever. The Secretary of State said—I

second concern is the security of the individual’s claim. They
will be expected to access terminals in internet cafes and public
libraries or use their phone. We are all warned to hide our phones
because they could be stolen, and heaven only knows how long it would
take to fill in the form over the phone. I am especially concerned that
it would be more than possible for someone to steal an
individual’s details to defraud the benefits system. I have
asked whether someone could be validated to make a claim on behalf of
an individual, and I have to say that I did not get a categorical
answer that calmed my concerns. I know of cases under the existing
system in which someone who regularly claims benefit has a lot of
friends on the day the money is paid, but they disappear with the money
about half an hour later. This is already happening to some of the most

details of its delivery to the most vulnerable in our society are a

and that the voluntary organisations that have been of such wonderful
assistance to our constituents—such as citizens advice bureaux,
voluntary organisations and local authorities—are seeing a big
diminution in staff numbers, so even fewer people will be able to
afford advice to someone who simply cannot handle what happens when
they look at a monitor. Added to that is the possibility that the
Department’s budget will be drastically slashed. If the Ministry
of Defence makes its case for money to come out of the DWP, the
resources to assist claimants could be greatly
diminished.</hs_Para>

concerned about the possibility of the Department having to slash its
budget even further—I have already mentioned the MOD rolling its
tanks on to the Department’s lawn. The Secretary of State is
already saying that because of the supposed invasion of these shores by
new citizens of the European Union he will have to address the whole
issue of welfare benefits all over again. I suspect that has a
political basis and has nothing to do with the delivery of benefits,
but if there are to be reductions—no one has argued that the
Government have managed to tackle the issue of our as yet far from
booming economy—these issues will come into play further down
the line. There will be more and more complexities for many people who
already find every single day of their lives a struggle, from the
minute they open their eyes in the morning until they go to bed at
night. Those are the people on whom we need to concentrate and I hope
that the Department will do just

de Bois</B> (Enfield North) (Con):</Member> It is to the credit of the
Secretary of State and the Government that, as we have seen so far
today, the issue being debated is not whether we should try to
introduce universal credit into the welfare equation. The level of the
debate has been fascinating, and I commend the Chair of the Select
Committee on her contribution. I was particularly taken by her succinct
and well made observation that whichever political party brings in the
change, there will be unforeseen consequences, and the issue is the
Department’s ability to deal with those consequences. We cannot
do much more about them—by their very nature they are
unforeseen—but the House will rightly look to the Department to
work as assiduously and quickly as possible, because they will affect
people’s real
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000411" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000411">It
is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Hampstead and Kilburn
(Glenda Jackson). I have yet to agree with her on anything, but she
touched on the subject of individual fraud. I do not wish to alarm her,
but I calculate that the bank account running the universal credit
system will be one of the largest in the world. I hope our security
systems and advice are up to scratch, because that would be an
expensive fraud for all of us. I am not making light of it, but
individual applications may be a smaller part of the problem if our
security advisers have taken care of that one. I am sure that they have
and that there is nothing the Minister needs to lose sleep
over.</hs_Para>

is to the credit of the House that, in discussing whether universal
credit is a good idea, we have not 
<?notus-xml column=1001?>entered into yah-boo politics. However, while the House rightly focuses
on vulnerable citizens who may be caught up in the changes, it is
important that we do not reduce the issue to a denominator that means
we should not press ahead with them. We should all aspire to change,
and not hold back because of a fear that smaller groups have the
potential to lose out. Of course, they must not lose out as a result of
some of the issues I will come on to talk about.</hs_Para>

is important that we distinguish between vulnerable people and those
who presently do not have skills. I am not sure that someone who cannot
complete an online form is vulnerable, but I argue that they are
unskilled. Our goal surely must be for 100% of benefit claimants to be
able to claim online, notwithstanding the hon. Lady’s
self-declared inability to do so, something with which I understand
perfectly and empathise. It must be our goal. It would be more
economical and user-friendly once people are conversant with
it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030658000414" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000414"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:02:03"></hs_TimeCode>In
my constituency, if I accept the statistics suggested for those unable
to complete a claim online, 600 out of 3,500 claimants may not be able
to do so. However, I would rather find a system that suits the vast
majority of people, and then work hard to bring others up to scratch.
It is good to see the use of computers and advice being available in
jobcentres. Three computers in each jobcentre may not be
enough—although I suspect we will probably have more in areas of
greater need, and fewer in areas with less need—and it is right
that the telephone service will be in place for a considerable time.
However, I want us to aspire to better systems and not be
held back. It is crucial to seek to get everyone online not just to
meet the needs of universal credit, but for the development of personal
skills. We cannot run from the digital age. It is here and we will all
have to use it whether we like it or not. Whether we are luddites or
reformers, it is here and that development must be one of the fringe
benefits of what we are trying to do.</hs_Para>

direct payments to landlords, my understanding—I am very happy
to be corrected if I am wrong—is that under the
Government’s pilots the majority of people are meeting their
rent payments in full and on time. My understanding is that in the
first four months, from more than 6,000 social tenants who were paid
their housing benefit directly, rent collection rates stood at 92%. If
that is accurate, it indicates that the pilots are travelling in the
right direction. Of course, that means 8% are not doing well. However,
I support the view taken by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:04:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Battersea (Jane Ellison), who argued that we will be
able to invest more time to bring that 8%—if that is what the
figure turns out to be—the care and attention they need. I
recognise the cynicism mentioned by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:04:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hampstead and Kilburn, but that is what we are here to deal with.
We should not allow ourselves to repeat the mistakes of the past. We
should learn from the past and be able to put extra time and resource
into looking after those people so that they become more
self-reliant.</hs_Para>

self-reliance, in the past decade or 12 years or so, approximately 2
million children were brought up in households where no one was
working. No Government ever set out to achieve such a thing; it has
happened for 
<?notus-xml column=1002?>a number of reasons. However, it has contributed enormously to creating
a state of mind whereby so many people look at what they cannot do, as
opposed to what they might aspire to do. From a life of dependency, I
am sure that they would prefer to move to a life of independence. I
welcome the inherent measures in universal credit and the wider welfare
reforms, because they enable people to move towards taking
responsibility for improving their own lives, finances and skill sets.
The state will never be able to do everything for everyone—that
philosophy is wrong. We have almost empowered a generation to believe
that the state will provide them with an answer to their problems. That
is not the case in the real world—we know that. I therefore
welcome the measures warmly, as they will provide a step-change for
people towards independence and taking more control over their
lives.</hs_Para>

listen carefully to the members of the Select Committee, who have been
extremely thoughtful in discussing potential areas of weakness. As a
constituency MP, like all of us in this House, I inevitably attract
people who are caught up in grey areas. We have a duty—indeed, a
passion—to help advise Government where those grey areas are and
to make recommendations for changes. Sometimes we fight the bureaucracy
that can so often stifle individuals, many of them vulnerable, into
almost giving up hope of receiving the help that we have decided they
deserve. I fully anticipate that there will still be work to do, but I
engage constructively in that process, because I recognise that any
system that is introduced is bound to create a grey area in which some
people will be trapped. However, that is not a reason not to proceed;
it is simply a reason to be flexible and to move forward, advise and
gain consent to deal with those issues.</hs_Para>

conclude by saying that the House is at its best when it is arguing
about detail and trying to highlight potential flaws. I welcome the
cross-Chamber support for the big idea of this reform. The shadow
Secretary of State has been characteristically robust on many
occasions, and I am sure he is being so on Twitter right now. Some of
his public remarks predicting complete doom and gloom for the system
are perhaps uncharacteristic, because the mood of the House seems to
be, quite sensibly, “We are behind this. The Government may not
have got everything right and we will watch them on that score.”
That is probably the right way to go and I hope that he genuinely

shadow Secretary of State knows the history of Government IT systems.
Given that history, it is inevitable that there will be some genuine
concerns. When I was rolling out IT systems in my company, it filled me
with horror; I knew we would end up exceeding the budget and that the
timetable would come under threat. In those days, we dealt with it by
shadowing the new system with the old system. I give credit to the
Government for not having gone for the big bang effect and for seeking
to roll out the system gradually. Had I been in their position, I would
probably have made the same decision, but the proof will be in the
pudding. Nevertheless, they have learned from previous mistakes. I was
delighted to hear the Minister’s confident assessment, which I
have no reason to doubt, and I think they have taken every reasonable
step. Will there be problems? I am certain of it, but I do not think

the Minister will be aware, social security provision is devolved to
Northern Ireland and implemented under a separate system known as
parity legislation. In a previous life, I had to implement some of it.
Under that system, we normally have little scope for variation, which
means that we will be subject to the worst elements of these measures.
I welcome the flexibility arrangements the Government introduced in
Northern Ireland enabling split payments—two payments a month,
rather than one—and payments to be made directly to landlords,
rather than to the claimant, but the core of the changes remains and
will be extremely damaging for our people and economy.</hs_Para>

introduce that flexibility. Earlier today, I asked the Minister of
State in the Northern Ireland Office about this subject in Northern
Ireland questions, but his reply left me aghast: he said we should be
getting more people into work. That is fine and laudable, if the work
opportunities are there, but they are not, so let’s get real. We
need to support these people, not marginalise and persecute them. These

me turn to the cost of universal credit. The rationale given by the
Government is that the legislation is about making work pay and helping
people into work. However, the driving motivation appears to be cutting
costs, with those on welfare easier to scapegoat than the tax avoiders
in society. Moreover, the figures suggest that, rather than saving
money, the changes will increase the welfare budget. The
Government’s own impact assessment suggested that £2
billion was set aside to fund the transition to universal credit in the
2010 spending review period and that net transfer payments from the
Government to households would be around £0.3 billion higher
once universal credit was fully implemented and transitional protection
exhausted, while the Institute for Fiscal Studies has valued the
long-run cost of universal credit at around £1.7 billion in
2014-15 prices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:20:18"></hs_TimeCode>.
Furthermore, it has been stated that £18
million—£13 million in resource and £5
million in capital—will be delivered to Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs to cover the costs associated with implementing
universal
credit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:20:33"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000439" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000439">That
suggests that the new system will be not just ineffective, but
expensive. Experience suggests to me that the costs of such a project
are likely to go up rather than down, once the projections meet the
reality, as was the case with the change from incapacity benefit to
workplace capability assessments. That has been a difficult
issue in Northern Ireland and a traumatic experience for those who have
been put through it. The resulting volume of appeals—a high
proportion of which were successful—illustrates just
how ineffective the changes were. I feel—I suppose I say this
with a certain level of temerity—that the Government do not seem
to be heeding that lesson. I fear that there will be an even

to that, universal credit is to use digital self-service by default.
That might sound good, but I have had little reassurance about the fact
that the most vulnerable in society—particularly the
elderly—are less likely to have access to computers or to be as
proficient with newer technology. Reference has already been made to
that issue in this debate, as well as to access to the internet and
broadband, so I will not dwell on it further. However, notwithstanding
our position on welfare reform and universal credit, I say to the
Minister that it is important that the delivery of this benefit does
not impact further on the vulnerable and disadvantaged in our
community. It is important that the right systems are in place to
ensure delivery is enabled, so that the most vulnerable can live a good

while praising the Committee for its scrutiny, the issues it has

presentations. We looked at mind-bogglingly complicated graphs of the
current benefits system and the tapering. We were told by academics who
were more expert on this than we could ever be that, without
significant change and proper tapering, the cliff edge would continue

for the Department for Work and Pensions, but it is not designed to do
so. The Government estimate that it will cost £2 billion more to
ensure not only that universal credit supports the people who need
support—which is, of course, the primary purpose of any benefits
system—but that it has smooth and transparent incentives to
work. It will, however, lead to longer-term savings for the taxpayer,
because it will make work more financially beneficial. That will also

Mulholland:</Member></B> Absolutely. During the previous Parliament,
there was consensus on the Committee, in the House and, indeed, among
Members on both Front Benches that we need to do more to ensure that
the benefits system is targeted on those who need it most and that it
makes financial sense for those who can and want to work—whether
that be full or part time, as appropriate to their other
commitments—to do so. No one is suggesting that that is an easy
challenge—it certainly is not, as the Committee fully
acknowledged during the previous Parliament—but it has to be
taken on and I am delighted that the Government have chosen to do so.
It is also crucial to ensure that lessons are learned from the
pathfinders. I remember looking at some of the pilots in the previous
Parliament. It is essential that, during the implementation stage, the
Department always takes full heed of the lessons and then makes changes
as appropriate.</hs_Para>

want to comment briefly on a few of the issues that the Committee has
rightly focused on. We can all agree that it is essential that
universal credit works for everybody—for all claimants, not just
the majority. It would not be a success if a group of people were
significantly disadvantaged by its introduction, which is clearly not
the Government’s intention.</hs_Para>

the move to a single monthly payment, I do not think anyone would
disagree with the principle that it makes sense for people to have a
sense of the money that they are given, to enable them to pay their
rent and buy food, and that it is helpful for them to budget, as that
will equip them to do so when they find work, as we all hope they will
if they are able to do so.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:34:43"></hs_TimeCode>The Committee
was right, however, to raise its concern that the switch to a monthly
payment presents a significant challenge for people and families on a
low income, and the Government have rightly responded to those
concerns.</hs_Para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:35:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Aberdeen South will remember that we had exactly the same
conversations when the local housing allowance was introduced. We must
accept that, although the arrangements will work for some people, there
must be a swift acknowledgement in cases where they are not working,
before huge arrears can build up. Will the Minister clarify that such a
safeguard will be put into the system, so that if things start going
wrong, alternative arrangements can be made as swiftly as possible?
Those could involve direct payments to the landlord, fortnightly
payments or the splitting of payments. I will be interested to hear a
reinforcement of the Government’s response to the Committee on
that matter.</hs_Para>

the digital question, I believe that it is perfectly sensible to move
to an online benefits system. That is happening throughout the welfare
system and throughout many parts of the public sector, and it will
result in a welcome reduction in costs, as long as we get the IT right.
I am now a member of the Public Administration Committee, and this is a
matter that the Committee will be looking at, following the publication
of its critical report on the disaster of the NHS IT system.</hs_Para>

have rightly expressed concern, however, about those who do not have

to afford the necessary technology—a PC or a smartphone, for
example—and older working people who are approaching pension age
might never have had any experience of that technology. The Committee
has therefore rightly pushed Ministers on this point, and alternative
provision has been made, including contact by phone or in writing, or
through a home visit. It is right that that should be spelled out so
that we can be clear what will happen to those people who cannot
reasonably access the internet. I urge the Minister to keep that matter

final point relates to information. Any change in the benefit system
will lead to anxiety for people even, ironically, when the changes
could have a positive effect on them. It is therefore essential that
they should be provided with clear, simple and adequate information,
and signposted to where they can get advice. That also applies to MPs,
because we have all had people asking us for advice on the effect that
the measures will have, and we should have at our fingertips all the
knowledge we need to advise them as the changes come

Department for Work and Pensions to work with Citizens Advice to
produce an information leaflet on universal credit. It is the ideal
organisation to do that. I understand that, having written to the

early 20s and earning less than £10,000 a year. Another excluded
group of 1.5 million people who earn less than £20,000 range in
age from about 25 to 50. Then we have a group of 2.2 million people in
late middle age who are uncertain, but open to persuasion that going
online would be a good idea. These are large numbers of people, and
they are precisely the people who will be making applications for
universal credit. The crossover between the digitally excluded and the
universal credit applicant is absolutely huge.</hs_Para>

there are questions to be asked about whether the Government’s
IT system will be up to scratch—we all remember the problems
that arose with child support and tax credits—but the question
in this instance relates to the capabilities of the population, and
that is the other issue that the Government are completely ignoring.
The last Labour Government spent more than £400 million on
digital inclusion. Between 1999 and 2003, £396 million from the
capital modernisation fund and the New Opportunities Fund was spent on
enabling people to go online, and in our latter years in government we
invested £30 million over three years in UK online centres,

or 10 million more people need to be enabled to go online, the
Government ought to consider investing serious resources in a digital
inclusion programme, but the DWP is spending £1.5 million, as

There are 5 million or 10 million people whom we need to help, and we
have a budget of £4 million—just for 2013-14; it does not
cover later years. Given the rate at which this seems to
work, that will help about 125,000 people. The level of resources and

Perhaps Ministers think that their “digital by default”
programme will enable them to make people interested and to motivate
them. I can hardly think of a worse learning environment than someone
facing the stressful situation of their family’s income
depending on whether they succeed or fail in the test. I can hardly
conceive of a worse way of motivating people. People learn best when
they are relaxed and are enjoying themselves in a friendly, warm

will be left with £23 a week; we know that because it is what
our constituents tell us. The Minister is looking puzzled. That is what
they will be left with once the cost of all their utilities has been
stripped out. Based on what my constituents tell me utilities cost
them, I have taken away £20 for heating, £10 for
electricity, £6 for water rates and £4 for bus fare. That
leaves them with £23. I have not included any money for a mobile

urge the Minister to look again at this. Exactly where across the

have made clear, filling in one of these forms will take at least half
an hour. In my constituency about 3,000 people will be eligible for
universal credit. Although it is being phased in so that things will
not happen all at once, if we say half of them can manage on the new

Drax</B> (South Dorset) (Con):</Member> I am grateful to have an
opportunity to speak in this debate. From what I have heard, there
appears to be a general consensus, with which I agree, that there is
room for the universal credit system. Its aims are laudable; our
welfare bill is too big and we have to tackle this problem. I think all
Members across the House will agree that this bill cannot continue to
grow. It is simply unsustainable. My view, which I am sure many share,
is that for too long the poor and vulnerable have been trapped in a
welfare mire. How often have we heard our constituents say,
“There is no point working a bit longer because if I do that I
will lose my benefits”? So clearly we have to examine the system
and make it fairer, encouraging those in this trap to put in the extra
hours as that will be beneficial for them.</hs_Para>

support the universal credit in principle; it will reward effort and
will be responsive to changes in circumstances—if it works. Many
hon. Members from both sides of the House have highlighted the word
“if”, and I hope that my adding to the ifs will not be to
the Minister’s chagrin. I have listened at great length to
Mr Kevin Hodder, the chief executive of the East Boro
Housing Trust; we debated this for a couple of hours. He has been in
this business for many years and has shared with me, for some time now,
his extensive knowledge and understanding of the benefits system. He
has done so for my benefit, so that I can understand my
constituents’ concerns. One or two of them—I suspect
there will be many more—have come to me with their worries about
the introduction of this new system.</hs_Para>

first risk, which has already been highlighted, is the reliance on one
computer system. There are 8 million or 8.5 million claimants—we
have heard the latter figure cited—so if the system goes wrong,
the risks are obvious. There is no room for error or delay because we
are talking about the most vulnerable in our society, and if the money
does not arrive on the day they expect it, they will face serious
problems. As far as I know, no Government national computer system has
worked; I remind Members of the armed forces payments system, the NHS
single patient record system, the tax credit errors and the collapse of
the Child Support Agency—all of us get many constituents
complaining about that. The problems were, in the main, the result of
computer glitches. The risk of relying on one gigantic system is that
failure would be catastrophic. Mr Hodder’s wise suggestion is
that universal credit software could be circulated to the local
authority housing benefit departments so that consistent rules are
applied<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:57:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Drax:</Member></B> I agree with the shadow Minister. When I was a
soldier, the great cry was, “Hope for the best and prepare for
the worst.” I am a little concerned that, on this policy, the
worst has perhaps not been prepared for. Will the Minister, when he
sums up, reassure us that there is a system in place that will
cope?</hs_Para>

dealing with the inevitable snags, community care grants and crisis
loans could be administered by the local departments if this computer
system were rolled out to them. The local housing benefit departments
in my constituency are already running down their offices, yet their
local knowledge could be invaluable in administering universal credit.
In the world of IT and computers, how often have our constituents rung
a telephone number and got a disembodied voice saying, “If you
want flowers, press 1. If you want somebody else, press 2. If you want
to go to heaven, press 3. And if you don’t want to bother us at
all, press 4.”? At that stage the person wishes they had slammed
the phone down and they give up the will to live. Although I welcome
IT—I am not a luddite in that sense—I am a great believer
in the human touch. Nothing beats eye-to-eye contact with constituents,
including, as in this case, the many who need help. If people lose that
contact with human beings—leaving aside the distress that will
be caused if the computer system goes down—there will be an
awful lot of concern, particularly among the elderly, many of whom do
not understand the system in any case.</hs_Para>

we know, universal credit is also intended to go online. As we have
heard from many Members on both sides of the House, that will be
unfeasible for many and could result in many incomplete applications.

of Mr Hodder’s concerns is about the receipt of a single lump
sum payment once a month. Although most of the population—75%, I
believe—receive their salary once a month, and although we want
to treat everyone in this country in an adult fashion, it is pragmatic
to realise that many of the people who will receive quite a lot of
money in one blow are not necessarily in a position to handle it and
have not been accustomed to it.
Welfare<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:00:57"></hs_TimeCode>
recipients are currently paid out of many pots and money comes in at
different times of the month, possibly to different accounts and
different partners. For example, child benefit is often paid to the
mother.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:59:48"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

of a single lump sum payment is likely to prove challenging for many,
at least at first. Mr Hodder suggests, and I concur, that
payments should be split 
<?notus-xml column=1015?>into two a month to lessen the stress of managing day to day. He also
points out that that would make recipients less of a target for payday
loan sharks, as the monthly benefit salary would not be so large. I
believe that there will be a rise in the number of those sharks, who
will prey on those who get their money one month, spend it and then
want more money to pay off their bills. The problem will therefore be
increased. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:01:41"></hs_TimeCode>The
money will also often go to one member of the family. If the husband is
abusive, for example, there will be a problem if the wife does not have
access to the money and it all comes in one
lump.</hs_Para>

Hodder’s main concern is the proposal to include housing
benefit, which was once paid to landlords, in that monthly lump sum. Mr
Hodder’s view, with which I agree, is that there is a
“huge risk” of non-payment to landlords—I think
that that is a pragmatic and realistic fear—because of wilful
non-payment or the inability of the tenant to manage funds over a
month. He says that the impact on his association and others will be a
rise in arrears and collection costs. They will need more staff, the
cash flow will be reduced and there will be less investment in social
housing. Private landlords are already saying that they will not take
on tenants who get their money first, for obvious reasons, so that
could also shut the door on the private rented sector.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:03:07"></hs_TimeCode>Further down the
line, arrears could lead to more evictions, more clogged-up courts and
more families being thrown on the mercy of local authorities, which are
charged with accommodating them in emergencies.</hs_Para>

my view, those are all unintended consequences, but the human cost
means that they matter even more. This ambitious shake-up is bound to
cause some problems and I think we all accept that there will be some.
Mr Hodder, myself and many people to whom I have spoken

thinking.</hs_Para>

Gilmore</B> (Edinburgh East) (Lab):</Member> When the Welfare Reform
Bill was in Committee, the Minister’s predecessor was fond of
the bookcase analogy. We were constantly told that what we were dealing
with at that time was an empty bookcase, which would shortly be filled.
Ministers and some Government Members who have intervened in the debate
today, rather than those who have spoken at length, tend to feel that
because most commentators, interest groups and parties think a unified
system that will take people from unemployment to employment is in
itself a good thing, that somehow means we should not be critical of
the policy or its

have reached a point where some of the books have appeared on the

Minister should appreciate that, as I understand it—he may
correct 
<?notus-xml column=1016?>us—the initial pathfinder will deal only with very simple cases
and people who do not have any complicated family situations, so it
will test only some elements of the system. After that, more books will
doubtless appear. However, one can have the same bookcase as someone

elements of payments, and who will be subject to very different

slightly different in Northern Ireland—credit unions are pretty

attitudes and capacities before the project got going; it proves
nothing about whether it is working. Further data published by DWP in
December 2012 showed that in four months 8% of rent had not
been collected. At that stage, 316 tenants had already been switched
back to direct payment to the landlord, and the range of collections
was actually greater than the 92% would suggest.

choice-based lettings system. It was possible to apply through a
newspaper, people could fill in a form in the more traditional way, or

I want to discuss a particular group—single parents. Some of the
problems I am going to consider do not necessarily result from
universal credit as such, but they will not be cured by universal
credit and may even be made worse. For many single parents, getting
back into work is not easy. There is a great deal of evidence that many
of them, when they do find work, find that it is low-paid and
low-skilled work. There is a high level of churn because of the type of
work or because of the practical difficulties that can arise. They may
find that arranging child care is unexpectedly expensive or
difficult—for instance, when they run into the summer holiday
problem. All these things can lead to a single parent who wants to work
finding a job and doing it for a period, but then having to leave and
go back to the beginning again.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:17:34"></hs_TimeCode>Skilling up is

the past few years, including under the previous Government, there have
been several changes to the rules for single parents, particularly
about their registering for work once their children reached certain
ages. Considerable flexibilities were built into the system whereby,
for example, a single parent would not be required to apply for a job,
go for a job interview or take a job where it would not fit with their
child care responsibilities. There are several such flexibilities, none
of which, bar one, are in the new regulations that have been produced
for universal credit. They are in guidance, but the problem is that
guidance is not legally binding and these matters are at the discretion
of an individual adviser.</hs_Para>

are currently 12 flexibilities, only one of which has been migrated
into the new regulations in its entirety; the other 11 are not there or
have been very much qualified. For example, under the regulations a
single parent is still able to restrict the hours they work, but only
if they can demonstrate that there are jobs with those hours available
locally. If there are not, they cannot have that flexibility, so
presumably they will have to look for a job that does not accord with
their child care responsibilities or look for one outwith their area,
which creates a whole new set of difficulties. Anyone who has had to
pick up their child from nursery at a fixed time and has experienced
the reception they 
<?notus-xml column=1019?>get when they arrive back late because the bus has been delayed will
know that working a long distance away is not

is not at all clear why these changes are being made. They might make
it more difficult for single parents to get back into work. If the
flexibilities are not there, the other problem that arises is
sanctions. If people do not have those flexibilities, they may be
required to take on a job—or to refuse a job—that does
not meet their needs. If they refuse to take the job, they can be
sanctioned. The level of sanctions was increased substantially in the
Welfare Reform Act 2012 and the number of people who are being
sanctioned is increasing. We are all seeing those people
already<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:20:42"></hs_TimeCode>. I would

which represents single parents, feels that getting skilled has been
made more difficult of late. Again, there does not seem to be anything
in universal credit that will help that situation. Previously, a single
parent with a very young child who was on income support got a fee
remission if they did a college course. That fee remission has been
removed, so although a single parent with a child under five can still
do a college course if they can fit it in around everything else that
they are doing, they have to pay for it. When they hit the requirement
to sign on for JSA, they will get fee remission for a course, but if a
job offer comes up that they have to accept, they will either have to
drop the course, which they might be part-way through, or continue the
course and be sanctioned. That is not the way to upskill
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:21:55"></hs_TimeCode>.

is serious concern that the structure of universal credit, far from
enabling single parents to work, will not be of great assistance and
might even be harmful. The Gingerbread report, “Struggling to
make ends meet”, with which I am sure the Minister is familiar,
points out that a single parent who is earning the minimum wage cannot
expect their disposable income to increase by much once they start
working 10 hours or more. We are talking about very short hours. For
anyone who does not understand, we are not talking about 10 hours a
day, but 10 hours a week. Somebody who works only three, four, five,
six or seven hours a week will be better off under universal credit,
but because of the structure of it, once they are working 10 hours a
week or more, they will not be much better off. For all that has been
said about universal credit making people much better off and
encouraging them to go into work, the structure is not quite as good as

Gilmore:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. The
concept of in-work conditionality, which is new to the UK, needs to be
fleshed out considerably 
<?notus-xml column=1020?>as universal credit rolls out. It is not at all clear how it will work.
It appears to mean that if somebody is working a low number hours, they
will be expected to look for more hours or for a different job in which
they can work more hours. It will be open to the DWP to tell
people that they have not made enough effort to do that and to sanction
them for it. That is supposed to make people better off; it is supposed
to be good for them to go through such a process, but if it does not
make them better off, it feels more like punishment than
assistance.</hs_Para>

report also looked at single parents who are not on the minimum wage
but earn a median salary, and it was calculated that they would be
worse off working full time than part time. They would not simply be no
better off, they would actually be worse off as their hours increased.
Again, that undermines the Government’s pledge to make work pay.
Part of the reason for that concerns things such as child care costs.
The cap on reimbursable child care costs has not been increased, and
those costs are rising rapidly in many places. That has a marked effect
on whether working longer hours and increasing earnings makes work
pay.</hs_Para>

categories of people, and the problems that we know about such as
eligibility, and issues such as employment and support allowance and

applications from October this year. We now know that hardly any new
applications will be treated as universal credit applications in
October this year and everybody else will be treated as applying for
existing benefits. As I understand it—the Minister will correct
me if I am wrong—only applications submitted in one jobcentre in
each region will be deemed to be universal credit applications, so that
is only nine jobcentres. Even then, it will only include people with
the most straightforward applications, because the IT will not be ready
to handle the
rest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000538" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000538">I
want to ask the Minister a specific question. For two years, Ministers
said that all new out-of-work benefit applications would be handled as
universal credit applications from October 2013, and all new in-work
benefit applications from April 2014. What is his current estimate of
those two crucial dates? Just how far have those milestones slipped?
Does he have any dates now that he is confident enough to give the
House for when those milestones will be
reached?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000539" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0002.htm#13030658000539">It
is not just I who am worried. The Minister has bigger problems than
that. Four times at the regular press conference this morning the Prime
Minister’s spokesman was asked to express confidence that
universal credit would be delivered on time and on budget. Four times
he refused to give that assurance.</hs_Para>

just the IT that is in trouble, but the policy too. Ministers have
failed to make crucial decisions, as set out in the Committee’s

is not a minor issue. The solution adopted on free school meals will
have a fundamental impact on whether universal credit has the intended
effect of making it worth people’s while to be in work.
If—as is widely suggested—the Minister and his colleagues
introduce a crude income threshold for eligibility for free school
meals and other passported benefits, they will create the most enormous
disincentive for people to get jobs and increase their
income—far worse than any of the cliff edges in the current
system of which they have been so critical. He really cannot delay

will remind the House of the aims of universal credit. It is designed
to avoid universally recognised problems in the current flawed system,
which traps people on benefits and makes them dependent on the welfare
state. It will ensure that work remains the best route out of poverty
and benefit dependence for those who can work, and is intended to be
radically simpler than the complex web of tax credits and benefits it
replaces. We made a deliberate choice here.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:42:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland) was right to
highlight a previous Committee report on the complexity of
the welfare system. Rather than replicating the current system, in all
its complexity, we are seeking to design a system that is easier for
claimants to understand and creates better
incentives.</hs_Para>

universal credit brings together in-work and out-of-work support into a
single monthly payment for those out of work or on low earnings. At
present, there are separate systems for out-of-work and in-work
benefits administered by different national and local agencies. A move
into work therefore entails a recalculation of entitlement, multiple
communications and possible delays and gaps in payments. As a result,
many people are not prepared to take the risk of moving into
work.</hs_Para>

the 16-hour-a-week rule, which means that people offered work have to
ask themselves, “Is it worthwhile my taking on this additional
work?” Many people have to go to the jobcentre to make a
better-off-in-work calculation. We cannot have barriers in place
preventing people from wanting to earn more, take on more hours and
look after themselves and their families.</hs_Para>

I said earlier, too many people are trapped into working 16 hours a
week by a system that means there is no point in extending their hours
because they would be worse off. I have even heard of people turning
down bonuses from their employers because they are concerned about the
impact on their benefits. What a tragic situation we are in, when a
system of benefits traps people in low incomes. What we need to
do—I hope Opposition Members will reflect on this—is find
a system that helps people to get back into work. That is one reason
why it is important to have in-work conditionality, to help people move
up the income scale and find ways to increase their earnings by getting
new skills, getting promotions and increasing their hours. In focusing
on how we resolve some of the exceptions in the system, Opposition
Members are in danger of losing sight of the reason for doing this: to
free people from a complex system of benefits that has trapped so many
out of

No, we have been very clear that we would have early implementation in

suggests that 92% of advertised vacancies require applicants to have
basic IT skills. Therefore, those without such skills are considerably
limited in  
<?notus-xml column=1027?>their employment prospects. By using the digital channel as the default,
we will be able to identify individuals who are struggling to manage or
who lack the basic skills to use online systems. In doing so, we will
be able to target support so that they can learn these essential
skills, thus improving their prospects of finding work. Work done by
the Cabinet Office on internet usage demonstrates that 78% of existing
benefits and tax credits recipients already use the internet. Our
latest figures show that more than 51% of jobseeker’s allowance
claims received by the Department are now made online. I think that
that demonstrates that people will be able to do it. We need to
encourage more people to go online and find ways to give that support.

hon. Friend the Member for Enfield North (Nick de Bois) made the point
that this is all about boosting aspiration. It is about enabling people
to manage their finances and to get into work, and we need to ensure
that we have a system that meets mainstream needs but also supports the
needs of more complex cases, rather than a scheme that is designed
entirely around the needs of the exceptions. It is important to get the

hon. Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore) referred to the fact
that we had discussed basic bank accounts when I was in my previous

research produced by the financial inclusion taskforce identified that
many of the people who did not have a bank account were those who
claimed benefit, and that many people who had had bank accounts had
ceased to use them. It is important to ensure that we put the right
financial products in place, but we must also give people the support
they need to manage their money so that they can remain banked, rather

non-payments. We have an obligation to try to move that 8% so that they
can pay their rent on time and meet their obligations. Also, this
change will encourage social landlords to think about the broader needs

to focus on the health issues considered in our report on the
regulation of medical implants in the EU and UK, which was published in
October last year. It was prompted partly by the scandal over PIP
breast implants and the less publicised but equally concerning problem
with metal-on-metal hip implants. In addition, the European Commission
has drafted proposals to revise the medical devices directive, and we
hope not just to influence but to assist the Government in developing a
strong negotiating position on that
directive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000611" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000611">Under
the directive, a medical device is used in health care for diagnosing,
preventing, monitoring or treating illness or disability. The
definition does not include medicines, which have their own regulatory
structure. Nevertheless, medical device regulations cover a wide range
of products, from pacemakers to spectacles. Devices are classified
according to the risk that they pose to patients. A device such as a
stethoscope or a dental filling is a class I or a class II, while
medical implants are always class IIb or class III. The classification
determines how much assessment is required.</hs_Para>

implants must be verified by a notified body before they can be placed
on the market. Notified bodies are overseen by a competent authority in
each member state. I use the word “competent” loosely,
because there are some questions about that. In the United Kingdom, the
competent authority is the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency, which oversees six notified bodies. They are private
organisations which assess high-risk devices and ensure that an implant
complies with the essential requirements specified by the
directives—the main one, of course, being the medical devices
directive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000613" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000613">When
an implant has been given the stamp of approval, the manufacturer
places the CE mark on the device, and is free to put it on the market
in all European countries 
<?notus-xml column=1033?>without further controls. I should emphasise that point, because it
shows how crucial it is to get the pre-market approval process right.
Once the implant has been approved by one notified body in one EU
country, it can go on the market anywhere in the EU. Manufacturers can
approach a notified body in any member state to get approval; what is
more, if a manufacturer has previously approached a regulator who has
said “That device is not up to scratch”, and then
approaches another and gets approval, the first part of the information
is, ridiculously, regarded as commercial in confidence. That must
clearly be
changed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000614" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000614">There
are more than 70 such notified bodies in Europe. I am pleased to say
that the Committee heard no evidence criticising those in the United
Kingdom, but we did hear concern expressed about the possibility that
those in other countries might not apply the same high standards. Such
differences are open to exploitation, as a manufacturer can choose to
approach a notified body that is more likely to provide approval, a
practice that is sometimes described as forum shopping. There is a real
lack of transparency, and we simply do not know how widespread the
problem
is.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000615" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000615">A
useful insight was provided on 24 October last year by <I>The Daily
Telegraph </I>and the <I>British Medical Journal</I>. Notified bodies
were approached to approve a metal-on-metal hip implant that was known
to be faulty. Shockingly, bodies in Slovakia and the Czech Republic
were prepared to approve it. Many Members will remember the names of
the authors of the article in <I>The Daily Telegraph</I>, because they
have previously been involved in stings affecting Members of
Parliament, but on this occasion they did an extraordinarily important
job. I have gone on record as giving credit to those journalists for
uncovering what I think was a trail of deception. I hope that, in his
negotiating stance, the Minister will ensure that we have a mechanism
that avoids that kind of risk in the future, and I intend shortly to
illustrate to him a way in which procurement can be developed to avoid
it.</hs_Para>

am pleased that the Commission has recognised the need to improve the
scrutiny of notified bodies. For example, it has been proposed that
manufacturers should be unable to apply to more than one notified body
at a time. Our report made a number of recommendations about notified
bodies, chiefly calling for a record of all approaches by manufacturers
and supporting the Commission’s proposals to use teams of
experts from member states to oversee the designation of notified
bodies.</hs_Para>

notified bodies also audit manufacturers, and that includes an
assessment of their facilities. In the PIP implants story, it was the
inspection of the manufacturer’s facility that led to the
discovery that an unapproved implant filler was being used. Although
the PIP scandal was a case of deliberate fraud, not of the failure of
the regulatory system, it demonstrated the importance of inspections
and audits. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:10:35"></hs_TimeCode>

key flaw in the current system is the overuse of equivalence data in
approving implants. We now come to the key difference between medicines
and medical devices. Every new human medicine has to go through
rigorous clinical trials to test for efficacy and safety, but 
<?notus-xml column=1034?>medical devices do not. The clinical data that the manufacturer must
provide can come from clinical investigations of that particular device
or from equivalence data, which are clinical data on another device
that is similar. That may sound reasonable, and in most cases it
probably is reasonable, but the problem is that even a small change to
the design or material of a device can radically change how it behaves
in the body. Also, if we keep approving devices on the basis of

doing so would not necessarily pick up the problems of wear and tear
that happen over a long period of time or take account of how patients

moving to the second half of the regulatory system, which is the

of clinical data. Very little information about a device is public.
Clinical data are generally not published, which makes clinical
decision-making and informing patients difficult. I think we would all
agree that patients have a right to know what is being put inside them
and the associated risks. The Commission proposed to make manufacturers
of high-risk devices publish summaries of safety and performance with
key pieces of clinical data. We did not think that went far enough and
called for all clinical data to be made available for both new implants
and those already on the market.

is an obvious way forward, and it is a way in which other countries
operate European procurement rules. Whoever sets out the procurement
process—in whichever trust or at whichever level in the
NHS—should simply make a requirement that anyone bidding for the
contract must provide the fullest and most transparent data about the
trials that have been conducted, the design of the product and the
regulatory processes it has gone through, including the ones where
there has been a failure. That is a perfectly reasonable regulatory

resulted from a system that had grown, as the use of implants had

Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency investigates
adverse incidents once they have been reported. Again, we called for
greater transparency by recommending that manufacturers publish the
results of post-market surveillance studies. We proposed that a system
such as the MHRA’s black triangle system, which flags up new
medicines approved on limited clinical data, should be adopted for
devices approved on equivalence alone. We found some evidence that
clinicians under-report adverse incidents, so we wanted the Government
to consider making reporting mandatory.</hs_Para>

withdrawn in Australia in 2009, but it took until 2010 for the problems

the Government told us that the Australian regulator did not

the MHRA first learned of safety concerns in April 2010. Although it is

That angle, although not central to the inquiry, is important for the
development of a registry. I gave an example of people being invited to
opt out of a registry before anything else is put to them. What needs
to be explained to them are the health benefits of working in a more
collegiate way and sharing data, and they should be encouraged both for
their personal health and for broader societal benefit to self-report.

debate but is not actually on the Order Paper: medical devices and
implants. I would like to make a few observations on what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:31:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) calls
post-market surveillance, which we agree needs to be improved. That is
obviously wholly desirable because it will eliminate problems, improve
patient security and so on. I would not disagree with a single word
voiced by him or his Committee. I agree that there should be more
transparency and more feedback from patients and clinicians so that
devices are safe and do exactly what they are supposed to do.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:34:29"></hs_TimeCode>, we can
improve regulatory vigilance. The MHRA has done a good job so far, but
it obviously could do better. There is clearly a role for increased
manufacturer responsibility. That is all very
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000644" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000644">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:34:29"></hs_TimeCode>
simple point I want to make about implants—I am not allowed to
talk about the huge sums of money we are voting through—is that
detecting failings is quite a complex matter. It is not as simple as it
was with the breast implants, which was a case of the wrong substance
being provided, which is fraud. I will illustrate my point with a
real-life example. I am familiar with a case in Nottingham involving a
number of unfortunate episodes that followed heart surgery in which a
particular type and brand of stent was used. A number of people were
called back for second operations because the stents leaked. I believe
that there were a number of deaths and some litigation. Initially it
was thought that the device was at fault, because it looked as though
the people who had the device experienced certain problems and
complications, and there had been other problems with it elsewhere. It
was subject to a court case and prolonged 
<?notus-xml column=1039?>investigation. Ultimately, the blame was attributed—this bears
out the point made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:33:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton)—to the surgical
procedure, rather than to the device

there is a particular problem when it comes to post-market
surveillance. Is it the equipment or how it is used that is
responsible, because the equipment is only as good as its user? That is
a particular issue in surgery, because surgeons up and down the land
are very particular about what bits of kit they use and what type of
equipment they work

Pugh:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and pay tribute
to his Committee for the work it has done. My simple point is that
post-market surveillance is complex, because devices need to be judged
alongside the patient experience and the clinician experience, and that
gets more complex and difficult if the market for a particular device
is relatively small. In the Nottingham case, the patients could not get
fully informed feedback because it was neither in the
manufacturer’s nor the surgeon’s interest to incriminate
themselves. There was the added problem, as there is often is, that the
manufacturer was in a different country from the user of the device.
That is partly why products that have been found over time to be faulty
in one country can still be used in another country because its
regulatory body has not picked up on the problem.</hs_Para>

Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller) and
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:35:40"></hs_TimeCode>for Southport
(John Pugh) on this subject, but I want to bring a couple of matters to
the House’s attention, including some that are of importance to
my

first point relates to recommendation 29 on transparency of evidence.
It is very important to have that recommendation in the report for the
sake of those who have had breast implants over the years. Some of my
constituents unfortunately found themselves on the wrong side of the
PIP scandal when the companies that had been involved in doing the
operations then went bankrupt or disappeared from the market. There
were also some cross-border issues in relation to the border between
Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Ladies who had put aside
substantial amounts of money for the operation, which in many cases
they probably could not afford, found themselves at the cold end, if I
may use that terminology, of what happened. I am very pleased to see in
the report the transparency that the Committee has sought to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:36:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Minister confirm for the record that all the proposals in the
recommendations will apply to Northern Ireland? I am ever mindful that
health is a devolved matter in Northern Ireland, and I want to make

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:39:23"></hs_TimeCode> am ever
mindful, too, that in many parts of the world people can buy almost any
items online—not implants or hip replacements, but almost every
drug for almost every condition, including cancer, heart conditions,
epilepsy and depression. There is always someone out there who will try
to take advantage of someone else’s unfortunate health

second point relates to help for small companies. Recommendation 12 is
very important, and I quote it for the

companies in all parts of the United Kingdom hold the key to the
employment opportunities that arise, as the Minister and, indeed, the
Prime Minister have said. That is certainly true in my constituency. T.
G. Eakin is a pharmaceutical business outside Comber that produces some
of the most excellent medical products, including a high-quality skin
protection product for use in stoma and wound care that it exports all
over the world and for which it has received numerous awards. The

underline the point that we should import such products only when it is
not possible to produce them ourselves. We must fight for the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. When we do import such
products, it should be highly regulated. Perhaps the Minister could
indicate how we can provide more opportunities for small businesses to
manufacture these types of products in the United Kingdom. T. G. Eakin
provides jobs for some 80 people in my constituency and is planning a
factory expansion that will produce about 20 more
jobs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:40:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000655" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000655">In
conclusion, there is a high level of expertise in some companies in the
United Kingdom. Recommendation 12 of the report plays up that point.
Perhaps the Minister could respond to that recommendation. There are
massive opportunities for the United Kingdom to do more in this area.
Why do we import when we can produce quality products at home and
produce jobs off the back of it? That is what we should do. We can lead
the world with our expertise not only in the manufacturing of products
such as those produced by T. G. Eakin, but in our universities.
Queen’s university Belfast and other universities across the
United Kingdom explore all the medical matters and ailments that affect
society. That provides opportunities. Recommendation 12 could perhaps
help us to make the most of those. I would like to know how we can do
that across the United Kingdom. If we can do more, let us do

health care regulatory systems, medical implants and devices hold a
unique status. The synthesis of new medicines and other pharmaceutical
products is done through highly precise chemical processes, whereas
implants are developed largely through an iterative engineering
process. As we can see from the Committee’s report, that
presents unique challenges. The bulk of the regulatory framework for
medical testing focuses on the side effects and efficacy of new drugs.
Although the emphasis is on medicines, there need to be mechanisms for
the effective regulation of safe medical implants, given the
fundamental differences between implants and
medicines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000659" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000659">As
the Committee’s report highlighted, there are weaknesses in the
current regulatory system. As Members have mentioned, those have been
highlighted by the recent PIP breast implant scandal and by faulty
metal-on-metal hip replacements. In looking at those high-profile
scandals, we must recognise the role of criminal activity, especially
in the PIP scandal. In that case, it quickly became apparent that the
company that manufactured the implants was engaged in a clear case of
fraud. There is no reasonable and workable system that could prevent
such cases. That fact is recognised by many in the industry and, I am
sure, by Members across the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000660" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000660">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:43:56"></hs_TimeCode>
the PIP scandal was caused by criminal activity, it presented the
opportunity for us to take a deep look at our regulatory framework and

perfect, as I am sure Members across the House will agree, and
improvements need to be made.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:44:14"></hs_TimeCode> case of the

is a fine balance to strike when debating the regulatory framework of
medical impacts because it is essential that all products are safe, and
that they bring only benefits to patients and are not harmful.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:44:32"></hs_TimeCode>It is also

election—ideal preparation, I must say. I raise the issue not to
bore the House with my personal interests but because figures released
this week by Diabetes UK show that the number of people in the UK who
have been diagnosed with diabetes has reached 3 million for the first
time. That is an increase of 132,000 over the last year and a further
850,000 people are now believed to suffer from undiagnosed type 2

year an estimated 24,000 people die from diabetes-related medical

cannot be stated enough that type 1 and type 2 diabetes are different
conditions and differ in many ways. Type 2 diabetes is often the result
of lifestyle circumstances or choices, but type 1 diabetes is a
genetic, sometimes hereditary auto-immune condition that is not related
to the lifestyle of an individual. The latest breakdown of figures that
I have comes from 2009. Research undertaken by the university of
Birmingham and the National Institute for Health Research showed that
at that time, 488,089 people in England and Wales had type 1 diabetes,
some 15,000 of whom were children and young people between nought and
24 years of age. In 2009-10, 27,200 hospital admissions and 96,651 bed
days were due to type 1 diabetes in England. To be blunt for a moment,
apart from concerning ourselves with the needs of the patient, that is

this week the US-based Diabetes Research Institute announced details of
its research into what it describes as a “quantum leap”
towards a biological cure for type 1 diabetes with the development of
its BioHub—a bioengineered “mini-organ” that
mimics the pancreas. It contains real insulin-producing cells that can
sense blood sugar and release the precise amount of insulin needed in
real time. In short, if successful, such a treatment could transform
the lives of 500,000 people in England and Wales, save the NHS a

report covers four main points, and I will take each one in turn.
First, I will discuss the system of pre-market approvals and the
difficulties surrounding them, before looking at transparency in the
regulatory system, post-market scrutiny of products and international
co-operation. Pre-market scrutiny of medical products is the minimum
prerequisite when it comes to health care products, whether medicines
or implants, but there are fundamental reasons why there is no
one-size-fits-all system for testing them.
With<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:48:33"></hs_TimeCode> medicines,
doses can be reduced and increased to test for side effects and
efficacy, but, as I am sure all Members will recognise, it is
impossible to change the dosage of a hip replacement. Furthermore, once
an implant has been placed, it is difficult to remove
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:48:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000667" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000667">Similar
issues present themselves with clinical trialling procedures. Medicines
pass through the body relatively quickly, meaning that medicinal trials
can be conducted 
<?notus-xml column=1043?>within a reasonable time frame. A hip implant is typically designed to
last over 10 years, and to obtain reliable clinical data that can
withstand proper scrutiny, trials on those implants would have to last
a number of years, which in many cases is simply not practical. A
system has therefore developed that uses different types of clinical
evidence to assess safety and efficacy. Where possible and practical,
clinical trials on products should take place, but for implants,
regulatory bodies will take what are known as equivalence data as the
basis for their decision making. That was mentioned by my hon. Friend
the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and is covered extensively in
the report. These are data obtained from similar products. As I have
said previously, products are developed in an iterative process and
these data can be from earlier iterations that may have been available
to patients for a number of
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000668" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000668">There
are a number of issues with this method. First, the <I>British Medical
Journal</I> has argued that, due to the progression of new products and
advances in this field, regulators may have difficulty assessing which
products, and therefore data, are equivalent. This difficulty is, to
some extent, surmounted by the differing regulatory requirements of
different classifications of medical devices. Most medical implants are

2b manufacturers are subject to annual detailed assessments of their

performing to a high standard. With class 3 products, notified

at the level of international co-operation when it comes to regulating

hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon). Most issues relating to the
regulation of medical devices are UK-wide, and the MHRA operates across

will set out briefly what is currently being done to improve the
regulatory system for medical devices. In October 2012, the Government
began negotiations with other EU member states to revise the regulatory
framework for medical devices, including implants. That will mean
completely overhauling the regulatory system that has been in place for
more than 20 years. The changes will take effect in 2017 at the
earliest. In the interim, member states and the Commission are
tightening up the most critical aspects of the current legislation. On
top of the legislative changes, member states are implementing a
voluntary programme of action that takes on board the lessons learned
from the PIP scandal, which was mentioned earlier.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:58:18"></hs_TimeCode>, we are
not merely relying on the EU. The UK is taking its own action,
including putting in place the recommendations of Earl Howe’s
report, which was published in May last year. In addition, Sir Bruce
Keogh’s review of the regulation of cosmetic interventions is
due to report later this
month<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:58:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000682" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000682">Let
me now turn to the issues raised in the Committee’s report.
First, I would like to talk about the requirements on clinical data for
medical devices. There are legitimate concerns about the quality of
manufacturers’ clinical evidence, as well as about how
rigorously notified bodies then evaluate the evidence they are
presented with. The Government’s response highlights how the
Commission’s proposal will address those concerns. In
particular, we consider that the requirement on notified bodies to have
in-house clinical expertise will be a big and important step forward
that will ensure that notified bodies really scrutinise and challenge
manufacturers on the quality of their clinical
evidence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000683" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000683">I
am pleased that the draft legislation requires manufacturers to comply
with clear rules on clinical evaluation. It is also much clearer on
when manufacturers can use clinical data from an equivalent device when
conducting their own investigation—one of the issues discussed
during this debate. None the less, by the end of the negotiations, we
should have legislation that goes even further to ensure that notified
bodies have access to high-quality clinical expertise. We do not have
any detailed proposals,
at<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:04:32"></hs_TimeCode> this stage,
but one idea is to establish an approved list of clinical experts that
notified bodies must consult when assessing clinical
evidence.</hs_Para>

addition, clinical data must be transparent, so that the procurement of
devices is based on solid evidence.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:00:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Ellesmere Port and Neston raised concerns about this point. Current
practice in the NHS 
<?notus-xml column=1046?>means that clinicians take into account several factors before using a
device, including the clinical evidence provided and the track record
of the manufacturer. In the light of issues identified with some brands
of metal-on-metal hips, the chief medical officer and the NHS medical
director wrote to all NHS trusts in England last March asking them to
ensure that there was sound clinical governance of procurement
decisions about joint implants—this is the important point I
want to make in response to what he said. I would expect these
principles for the procurement process to apply to all medical devices
used in the
NHS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:01:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000685" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000685">It
is worth highlighting how the UK is taking action, over and above the
requirements of EU legislation, to support the safe introduction of new
hip and knee implants into the market. Manufacturers, including Johnson
&amp; Johnson, Stryker and Biomet, have applied to participate in a
pilot scheme that will give surgeons earlier and more accurate data on
how well new hip and knee implants performed. This project involves
close co-operation with clinicians, the NHS and the UK’s
national joint registry. The MHRA is currently considering how this
pilot could add value to other categories of

return to a point made by the shadow Minister, we wholeheartedly agree
on the importance of transparency, which brings numerous benefits. I

notified bodies and public authorities. The proposed new European
regulations will increase transparency, giving the public, patients and
clinicians access, first, to clear information on the safety and
performance of devices; secondly, registration information on devices
and the companies that make, distribute and use them; and thirdly,
information on the electronic traceability system for
devices.</hs_Para>

for Ellesmere Port—I apologise for abbreviating his

different authorities across the EU, so this is 
<?notus-xml column=1047?>an important step. The UK is already pushing for improvements in
transparency in negotiations with other member states. For example, as
we highlighted in our response, we would like to see clinical data from
post-market surveillance published, so that the available information
on the safety and performance of devices always remains up to date. We
can do more as well. The Government’s public consultation on the
proposed regulation closed on 21 January. It provided us with a lot of
useful ideas, which we are currently considering in
detail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:05:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000691" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000691">Let
me turn to the issue of notified bodies and pre-market assessment.
Strengthening the quality of notified bodies is absolutely one of the
most important ways to improve the regulatory system. The Government
agree with the Committee’s recommendations in this area. We are
pleased that the Commission’s proposal goes a long way towards
addressing the current weaknesses in the system. Competent authorities
will review each other and share ideas on how to improve the way in
which they monitor notified bodies. The Commission can take action in
response to a member state’s concern about a particular notified
body. There is significantly more detail on the criteria that notified
bodies must fulfil, and teams of experts from different competent
authorities will audit notified bodies every three
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:06:10"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government agree with the Committee that a new layer of European

it is carried out.</hs_Para>

of all that, we cannot just sit back and wait for the revised
legislation to come into place—it is some way off yet. As I
outlined previously, we are acting before then to ensure that notified
bodies improve as soon as possible. Interim action is being taken
across Europe. It includes, first, joint audits of notified bodies on a
voluntary basis. The first of these took place in the UK in January and
many more are planned for 2013. Secondly, all member states are
auditing the quality of their notified bodies that assess high-risk
devices. Thirdly, rules on notified bodies and how they audit
manufacturers, including undertaking unannounced inspections, are being

potential we have in the UK for generating new business in this area
and the importance of giving businesses every opportunity to start up
and develop. We do not want to impose disproportionate costs on UK
businesses and put that potential growth at risk. Instead, recognising
the importance of the point made by the hon. Gentleman and the
Committee, we are considering what we can do at the EU level. For
example, notified bodies could require manufacturers to carry out
post-market studies for certain
devices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:09:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000697" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000697">Finally,
the Committee recommended that the Government consider making the
reporting of incidents by health care professionals mandatory.
Increasing reporting is clearly critical to ensuring that the regulator
has a full picture of emerging problems with devices. Mandatory
reporting is an option that the Government are continuing to consider,
although it cannot be the only solution. The MHRA is currently leading
work to improve reporting and has been working closely with the General
Medical Council and the medical royal colleges to consider how to
strengthen professional responsibilities in this
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:10:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030658000698" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030658000698">In

Lansley:</Member></B> The hon. Lady set out her reasons during business
questions on 7 February. I addressed her points then, but it may be
helpful for me to recap. Her first reason was that Members might
already have made arrangements in their constituencies for Friday
22 March. This is valid up to the point that Members are
just as likely to have made arrangements in their constituencies for
Wednesday 27 March—the date proposed in the Opposition
amendment. It is important to bear in mind that only those Members who
wished to speak on that day in the Budget debate would be affected.
Others might have commitments in their constituencies that they regard
as inescapable, but on three other days they would have the
opportunity, subject to catching the Speaker’s eye, to
contribute to that debate. It is not a case of “speak on that
Friday or lose the
opportunity”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030695000051">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:23:59"></hs_TimeCode>
is a choice here, but my preference—and, I believe, the
preference of Members—would be to sit on that Friday and not on
the subsequent Wednesday. While the calendar is always issued with the
proviso that it is subject to the progress of business, the Government
are conscious that having announced dates, Members and staff might have
made arrangements for the Easter recess, which it would now be
inconvenient, to say the least, to change. Indeed, as I have said, the
Friday would not involve the prospect of voting, and I can add that we
do not intend to arrange ministerial statements for that day. Those
with necessary constituency business will still be able to deal with
it, which might not be the case were the House to sit on
Wednesday.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030695000052">The
second reason given by the shadow Leader of the House was that if the

the Prime Minister of avoiding his duties in the House.
<I>[Interruption.] </I>I must tell the right hon. Member for Warley (Mr
Spellar) that his view is contradicted by the facts. The Prime Minister
has made more statements to the House per sitting day in the last
Session than his predecessor, spending more than 30 hours at the
Dispatch Box in so doing. He also gives evidence to the Liaison
Committee, and he takes all his responsibilities to the House very
seriously.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030695000053">I
think that my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr Hollobone)
should take a look at the 2013 calendar that I published. It shows six
occasions on which recesses have been proposed. There is the February
recess, which we have already had, and there are the Easter, Whitsun,
summer, conference and Christmas recesses. The plan was for the House
to rise on a Tuesday on two of those 
<?notus-xml column=1053?>occasions, on a Thursday on three of them and on a Friday on one of
them. No pattern is involved; it is simply a matter of trying to ensure
that each of the recesses has the right balance of time overall. A
simple examination of the parliamentary calendar will show that there
are no grounds for the supposition that we have avoided a Wednesday
sitting.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030695000054"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Hollobone" PimsId="4744" UID="13030695001352" xid="858" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0003.htm#13030695001352">Mr

good points, and this is not a black-and-white issue, although I must
add that I think that, when the rising of the House on a Tuesday can be
avoided, it should rise on a Wednesday or a Thursday. However, this is
not just about Prime Minister’s Question Time; it is also about
all the other business of the House. It is about all the Select
Committee meetings and all the sittings in Westminster Hall that take
place on Wednesdays. All that business is, in effect, lost when the

held to account, and that is to be expected, but they really ought to

mechanisms of accountability, the Government are achieving greater and
more meaningful scrutiny than has ever been achieved before. Let me
name just a few positive developments. There is more pre-legislative
scrutiny, there are many substantial debates via the Backbench Business
Committee, there is the work of Select Committees and their elected
Chairs that we discussed in the Chamber a couple of weeks ago, and
there is extra time for scrutiny during the Report stages of Bills.

therefore arranges for the House to rise on Tuesdays as often as he
thinks that he can get away with it. The hon. Member for Kettering (Mr

started attacking his own side.

sense of humour failure by a rattled Prime Minister who was
demonstrating to the House just how easily he seems to be able to
channel his inner Flashman. The memory of this omnishambles is
obviously still raw, Mr Speaker. According to samizdats emerging from
the 1922 Committee, the Chancellor has admitted to Tory Back Benchers
that last year’s Budget was a disaster. Why else would he have
been seen nodding vigorously as he was being exhorted, in language so

Spellar:</Member></B> It is hugely tempting to follow the hon.
Gentleman down that path, because it reveals a degree of
misunderstanding of how the Westminster parliamentary system works. If
the committee he mentions—this will be a long debate when we get
to that—is in control of the parliamentary timetable, it will
effectively become the Government, because it will control Parliament.
The committee might deal with a particular part of the parliamentary
timetable, just as the Backbench Business Committee does. However,
responsibility for the entire parliamentary timetable—and there
is nothing more intrinsic to the maintenance of government than
supply and this expression, “Through the
Budget”—is fundamentally the role of the Queen’s
Government, as determined on a daily basis by the maintenance of a
parliamentary
majority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:19:49"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:19:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

respects, but were this business of the house committee to be
established, it might well have on it a Government majority and be able
to determine non-legislative time, even if it could not determine
legislative time. Given that PMQs on Wednesday is non-legislative, I
would have thought that the committee would be able to determine that

immediate topic, tempting, interesting and attractive though it is to
discuss the broader issues of parliamentary sovereignty and procedure.
He is right that most of the 
<?notus-xml column=1070?>factors, including the date of the Budget, were well known when the
motion was laid. The number of days that we traditionally take for the
Budget debate was known, as too was the date of Easter. In fact, the
date of Easter could have been known several decades, if not centuries,
ago. The procedure for calculating Easter was decided at the Council of
Nicaea in 325. At that time, they could probably have calculated when
this Easter would

hope the Leader of the House will intervene—if we wish to fit in

debate. Why not have the Budget on a Tuesday and the debate on the
following days? That would work perfectly well, although I do
think—mention has been made of staff who work here, and so
on—that having recesses in the middle of the week rather than in
full blocks can affect many people, particularly those who are trying
to adjust to have holidays with family or, frankly, those without
children who are trying to avoid going on holiday at the same time as
those with family. Not much thought seems to have been given to how
these things are organised—or, indeed, to parliamentary

Tuesday, but it was changed to a Wednesday. That

when 
<?notus-xml column=1071?>the Budget was changed to Wednesday from Tuesday in the first place. Did
it have anything to do with Tony Blair changing Prime Minister’s

unravelling of his Chancellor’s Budget the day after he had
delivered it? Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman could help

Budgets were changed from Tuesday to Wednesday. It is some way back,
although I do not know whether it was anything to do with the bank rate
or whatever. It is an interesting subject; unfortunately, I did not
have time to research it. However, when Budgets were on a Wednesday,
with PMQs on Tuesdays and Thursdays, that would have enabled questions
to be asked of the Prime Minister. It would be perfectly
proper—I would have thought it would be extremely helpful for
the public debate—if the Budget was on a Tuesday and then the
Prime Minister answered on the Wednesday. However, that is slightly
separate; we would be able to fit in that time scale.

me turn to the question of Fridays. I am slightly surprised by the
Leader of the House’s comments—as though Friday and
Wednesday were comparable in terms of the constituency pattern. Members
of Parliament often establish a pattern with their local
organisations—schools, charities and businesses—that ties
in with having their advice bureaus on a Friday. Members will ensure
that they have a full programme during the day on a Friday and, often,
an advice bureau in the evening. It might be all right for Members who
only have to nip up the road to St Albans if Parliament sits until 2.30
pm, but for those who have to go further afield, getting back to
undertake their advice bureaus becomes a significant problem. I suspect
that most Members will have publicised when and where their advice
bureaus will be at least six months in advance; many will have done it
a year in advance. Indeed, they will have put up posters around their
constituencies to advertise them, because they had not anticipated that
the Friday under discussion would be a sitting day in the
Commons.</hs_Para>

the Leader of the House has said that Members can speak on other days,
but that is not how things work. Usually, under a very helpful Speaker,
there is a bit of flexibility with regard to Budget debates, but the
reality is that particular issues are debated on particular days.
Members therefore need to know when subjects in which they are
interested will be the prime focus of
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:30:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695000545" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0004.htm#13030695000545">The

Gentleman and other hon. Members to decide where they want to be on the
Friday under discussion. If he decides that it is more important for
him to turn up at the advice surgery that he has advertised six months
in advance, there is nothing to prevent him from doing so, even if the
proposed debate takes place. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman already
does that during the House’s sitting Fridays for private
Members’ Bills. He did not want to prevent the Opposition from
calling for a recall of Parliament when the riots were taking place,

Gentleman’s train of thought. He is right to say that debates on
private Members’ Bills occur on Fridays, but Members know about
them for a long time in advance. They can, therefore, set their
constituency calendar some distance ahead and say, with assurance,
“This is a non-sitting Friday, so there won’t be a Bill
that’s of interest to my constituents and I can make
arrangements.” That seems perfectly sensible. My point is that
all of those elements were known and we find it slightly strange that,
initially, the Leader of the House, at fairly short notice, tried to
spring this change on the Commons. Fortunately that was spotted, so we
are having a proper debate and exploring the
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695000548" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0004.htm#13030695000548">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:34:25"></hs_TimeCode>

If he looks at the motion, he will see that it is for the House to sit

amendment that seeks to amend the resolution, the point of which was to
establish the framework of recess dates, not to provide for which day,
including Fridays, the House would sit. It would always have been
necessary for us to come back to the question of a Friday sitting if

mentioned the fact that the Lords and the Commons often meet in
separate weeks. Many Members of Parliament are involved in groupings,
organisations and even some formal bodies that go across both Houses,
and it can be very difficult for people who organise events here, often
in connection with extremely worthy causes and important issues, who
are hoping to draw an audience of Members of both Houses. Similarly,
parliamentary delegations from other countries often come here and want
to meet up with fellow parliamentarians. The Inter-Parliamentary Union
and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, for example, are fully
integrated between the House of Lords and the House of Commons, and
peers and Members of the Commons are involved in them, but their events
become much more difficult for them to attend because of the
disconnection of the parliamentary timetable.</hs_Para>

those examples provide an indication that the Government felt that
running Parliament was easy. They did not understand the dynamic of the
Commons, in particular, and of Parliament in general. They did not
understand the rhythm of the place. The change to the timing of the
Queen’s Speech, for example, has had an impact. It has gradually
worked its way through, but there is still some disconnect
there.</hs_Para>

this respect. As my hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset

may I commend the Leader of the House on the Government’s

much closer to the date. I also want to pick up on the valid point made

Leader of the House has made a pretty good start to his tenure in his
current distinguished and important role. I was going to suggest he was
probably going to be the finest Cambridgeshire parliamentarian since
Cromwell. I am conscious that we have colleagues here from across the
water who will tempt me into debating Oliver Cromwell. Whatever his

House of Commons because the Leader of the House wishes to take away

private Members’ Bills, but at this afternoon’s Procedure
Committee sitting we had the Clerk Assistant, Mr David Natzler, as well

what happens to those private Members’ Bills. As I understand
it—you will correct me if my understanding is at all inaccurate,
Mr Speaker—without the Leader of the House’s consent,
those Bills cannot be placed on the Order Paper for the Friday. That
would look extraordinarily confusing to people outside Parliament; they
would see the Bills on the Friday but those Bills would not be able to
be taken. So will the Leader of the House guarantee the House today
that, as the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:59:12"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Kettering proposed, if, for whatever reason, Members on
either side finished early in the Budget debate on the Friday, the six
Bills we have at the moment—I suspect, depending on the Leader

placed on as orders so that they can be considered? That is an
important issue to clear up before we decide how to vote in this

key point is that the Government announced the Friday sitting dates as
long ago as last May. Some reference has been made to the fact that
this motion was tabled in December, but the sitting Fridays were set
out 10 months ago. At that point, the Leader of the House’s
predecessor did not say that this Friday would be coming up. A number
of colleagues will have made constituency plans and will have
engagements that it will be difficult for them to break. For those who
come from Belfast and elsewhere, travelling back to their
constituencies on a Friday afternoon can be quite challenging. Anyone
who has been to City airport or Heathrow knows how busy they can be.
The fact is that the House will be sitting until 2.30 pm, and if our
constituencies are outside the M25, it will become difficult to engage
at all with our constituents on that Friday.</hs_Para>

also disagree with the logic of the Leader of the House when he states
that the dates are published and cannot be changed. I am not yet aware
that the Government have announced the date for the Queen’s
Speech or for Prorogation. Someone who was not a parliamentarian or a
knowledgeable member of the public might think, looking at the
calendar, that once the House came back on 15 April it would sit right
through until the recess on 21 May. I am probably not giving anything
away if I say that we expect this Session to finish at the end of
April, and there will then be a recess. The logic that the Leader of
the House seems to have applied—that because dates have been
published, those dates are fixed—falls when it is subjected to
scrutiny.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_06_PT_1/113FA08CBA88472230D617DA3A7CE21BB16FC46B" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="6 March 2013">Wednesday

Opposition Benches were not entirely convinced that that would hold
water; of course, the autumn statement took place in December. I know,
Mr Speaker, that Buckinghamshire is a wonderful, delightful county and
that every day must feel like a summer’s day in Buckinghamshire,
but in Dunfermline and West Fife it is probably fair to say that 5
December certainly feels like we are into winter, rather than autumn.

the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) asks a valid question: is he

visited a food bank and spoke to some

the Prime Minister’s performance today I understand why the
Leader of the House is so admirably trying to defend the indefensible.
It is quite clear that, despite the soft drinks proffered last night,
my right hon. Friend the Leader of Her Majesty’s loyal
Opposition wiped the floor with the Prime Minister. For that reason, I
understand why the Leader of the House is reluctant for the Prime
Minister to man up and come to the Chamber to face up to his

hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Thomas Docherty). I do not
agree with all the comments he made, but the gist of his speech was
very good. I rise to support the amendment. Were I sitting on the
Opposition side of the House, I would support a similar amendment. Of
course, I supported 
<?notus-xml column=1083?>similar motions and amendments in the previous Parliament, as did my
friends on the Front Bench, but they seem to have changed their
position. It is also rather interesting that the shadow Ministers, when
they were in government, took exactly the opposite position to the one
they are taking today. It is the national union of Executives that we
have to deal with tonight. Parliament—the mother of
Parliaments—should decide the timetable, and it should do so
through a House business committee. If that were the case, we would not
have debates such as this
one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695000619" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0004.htm#13030695000619"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:13:28"></hs_TimeCode>I

Members have pointed out that business is listed as provisional, and of

the calendar. The only way there could be an extra sitting day is if
business has not been proceeded with. If business had not been
proceeded with, obviously the Budget could be on an earlier day. We
therefore have to assume that business has not proceeded as the Leader
of the House
wanted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695000620" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0004.htm#13030695000620"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:14:07"></hs_TimeCode>I

Gordon Brown</B> (Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath) (Lab):</Member> I am
grateful to you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on behalf of
the patient but hard-pressed and increasingly angry residents of
Dalgety Bay in Fife in my constituency. They are residents who
discovered 18 months ago that the houses that were built 50 years ago
were built near or above radiation-contaminated particles. They are
residents who in the last 18 months have suffered the fencing off of
their local beach. At the same time, their amenities have been cut,
with some now not able to be used. They are increasingly looking to the
Ministry of Defence and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency for
answers and, indeed, action. They wish for the radiation-contaminated
particles to be removed. They wish for a remedial action plan and
clean-up plan to be agreed for the Dalgety Bay beach area, and they
wish to be reassured not only about the amenity of their area, their
house price values and their ability to use the beach, but about the
safety and health of the people in the area.</hs_Para>

have asked for this debate specifically because of the advice given in
the last few weeks by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in
the Environment—COMARE—which has published a report on
Dalgety Bay. In its view, action to remedy and clean up the Dalgety Bay
beach area has to be taken as quickly as possible. Residents in Dalgety
Bay are increasingly angry because on other sites, particularly
Almondbank in Perth—the Minister will know about this and may be
able to comment on it in his response—action has been instructed
and taken and is now under way, while we still await any clean-up of
Dalgety Bay, any decision on how it will be funded and, indeed, any
decision on who is responsible for the

Brown:</Member></B> I will come to that. It is
incontestable—indeed, nobody disputes this fact—that
about 50 years ago, radiation-contaminated materials were dumped in the
Dalgety Bay area. Nobody disputes the fact, either, that in the past
few years, 3,400 particles of radiation-contaminated materials have
been collected in the Dalgety Bay area by scientists and others, who
have seen coastal erosion bring many of these materials to the surface.
Nobody disputes also the fact that the safety risks associated with
some of the finds are at a level that has made radiation experts
increasingly worried. Indeed, five finds were above 76 megabecquerels,
which, according to all radiation experts, constitutes a hazard that
has to be dealt
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:51:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695001218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0004.htm#13030695001218">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:51:25"></hs_TimeCode>
problem is that, even though we have all these finds and materials, the
action that we have expected to be taken on Dalgety Bay is still to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:51:18"></hs_TimeCode>. Does the
Minister agree that we need action and that the Ministry of Defence and
the Scottish Environment Protection Agency should now agree that the
previously identified 
<?notus-xml column=1091?>programme of work should proceed as quickly as possible? The medical
evidence says that action should be taken as quickly as possible, but
the process of dealing with this radiation contamination has slowed
down to the point where people are increasingly worried about whether
the agreed timetables will be
upheld<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:51:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695001219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0004.htm#13030695001219">As
I have said, the reason why I have called for this debate is the
medical evidence. If the Minister examines the medical evidence that
has been provided to him and the residents of Dalgety Bay, he will see
that the committee looked carefully at the health risks involved.
Fortunately for the people in Dalgety Bay, the committee discovered
that, although the radiation material was most likely to cause head or
brain cancer, there was no higher incidence of those conditions in
Dalgety Bay. It is also fortunate that, although rates of liver cancer
are higher in the area, it is not usually identified with these
radiated
materials<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:52:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695001220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0004.htm#13030695001220">The
committee said that there are three reasons why action should be taken
as quickly as possible, however, and recommended the quick
implementation of a remediation action plan. One reason was the long
life of the discovered materials, which means that they will have a
substantial life if nothing is done about them. Secondly, the committee
was worried about the dynamic process whereby, as a result of coastal
erosion, the materials were coming to the surface in Dalgety Bay and
posing a health hazard to the population. The third reason is the size
and scale of the materials. Not only have 3,400 materials been
discovered and examined, but such materials are coming to the surface
at a rate of about 1,000 a
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:53:27"></hs_TimeCode>. I suggest
to the Minister that he must now take seriously the size, dynamic
nature and long life of the
materials<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:53:45"></hs_TimeCode>
located in Dalgety

think that it was because of those things that the Ministry of Defence
agreed in February last year to what was called an investigatory plan.
The Defence Infrastructure Organisation agreed a timetable for action
to be taken in the Dalgety Bay area. There was to be a review of the
historical situation and of coastal processes. Then there was to be an
investigatory report on the physical elements that made up the problem
in the area. Then there was to be an assessment of that report, after
which there was to be a review of the risks entailed. Then there was to
be a set of options, which would be laid before us, on what needed to
be done to remove the contamination. Then it was foreseen that there
would be a plan that would deliver the area from the
contamination.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695001222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0004.htm#13030695001222"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:54:38"></hs_TimeCode>That
was set down clearly in a document that the Minister must have before
him this evening: the investigation plan of the Defence Infrastructure
Organisation. Unfortunately, that plan has not been observed. The
coastal processes report, which was promised in October, did not
arrive. By the time I called this debate, there was no indication that
it would arrive. I understand that it was sent to the Scottish
Environment Protection Agency on Sunday of this week, but it was five
months late, at a time when we are asking that action be taken
immediately because of the health risks in the area.</hs_Para>

on the investigatory report itself was to have been finished in
November; again there is work to be done by the Ministry of Defence,
but that report is not yet available, even though it was promised by
the end of January. The investigatory assessment has obviously not been
done, because the investigatory report has not 
<?notus-xml column=1092?>been completed. Many other promises have been made. We were told that
between February and May, we would have the study of the options and
the risk assessment work that had been done. We would then have the
summary of what needed to be done as a whole, and an agreement on that.
That timetable has now been completely disrupted by the failure to
produce the initial
reports.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695001224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0004.htm#13030695001224"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:55:55"></hs_TimeCode>I
have to say to the Minister that it is the Ministry of Defence that is
responsible for these delays. The coastal processes report is a
Ministry of Defence report that is going to be put to the Scottish
Environment Protection Agency. I see him looking at his civil servants.
They will confirm that that is the case. It was agreed that the
Ministry of Defence should do the investigatory report, not the
Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Again, that has not been
produced. It is now long delayed because of the Ministry of
Defence’s failure to complete its work. The investigatory
assessment was also to have been done by the Ministry of Defence and,
as I understand it, that has not been done either. Next Monday,
we<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:56:39"></hs_TimeCode> have a

Scottish Environment Protection Agency for a report and asked who was
responsible. The agency was very clear indeed about who was
responsible—the Ministry of Defence. The MOD chose not to accept
this advice and it has been looking for landowners, developers,
builders, residents and other participants in the area who might have
been responsible for its pollution, but there is absolutely no doubt
about it. It comes back not just to a legal responsibility, as I will
show later, but a moral responsibility for the MOD to accept that it
dumped the material in the first place, that the material is there
because it came from MOD aircraft and that the pollution is the direct
effect of having dumped it there. Refusing to accept responsibility is

me give a final reason why the Minister should stand before the House

Protection Agency to get a remediation action plan under way so that
work is completed by the end of the year. It is an irony that just at
the time that the Ministry of Defence is refusing to accept
responsibility for the contamination that exists in Dalgety Bay, a mile
away at Rosyth dockyard, the MOD launched a consultation exercise two
years ago and is examining whether the seven decommissioned submarines,
four of them Polaris submarines, should be cut up and stored in the
Rosyth area for years upon years. How is the MOD going to persuade the
residents of Rosyth a mile away from Dalgety Bay that it should be
entrusted with the safety and health of the local residents in
decommissioning, breaking up and then storing submarines in Rosyth,
when it cannot persuade the people of Dalgety Bay that the safety and
health needs of the residents there are being taken seriously and it
even refuses to admit its responsibility for the contamination while at

on investigations and is monitoring the work. I well know the speech he
is going to make, but the fact is that it has not produced the reports

congratulate the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:03:01"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown) on securing
a debate on Dalgety Bay once again. We last discussed the subject in
November 2011, and I visited the bay on 31 January last year. I walked
on the beach and met local residents in the sailing club and heard
about its problems. I also met Professor Curran, the chief executive of
the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:04:00"></hs_TimeCode> understand
furthermore that the right hon. Gentleman had a meeting with the
Secretary of State for an hour and more on this particular matter, so I
do not think it is fair to say, as he suggests it is, that my
Department has ignored the issues at Dalgety Bay, as we have not.
Neither, for that matter, have we ignored the concerns of the local
community and nor has the Ministry of Defence abdicated its
responsibilities or sought to delay a decision on who is the polluter.
I welcome the opportunity to explain how the MOD has actively been
supporting SEPA over the last year or
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030695001238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/debtext/130306-0004.htm#13030695001238">The
Department has actively supported SEPA in fulfilling its statutory duty
to inspect the area of concern. I am afraid that this is more than can
be said of other parties who have had an interest in either the former
Royal Naval Air Station Donibristle or indeed in the foreshore. That
includes the developers mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman, who have
some responsibilities in this regard. Similarly, we have not acted
inconsistently in our approach to sites that we formerly owned across
Scotland.</hs_Para>

right hon. Gentleman has said in a moment, but there is one thing that
I particularly dispute. I know that when he was Prime Minister, and
indeed when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, he was very profligate
with public money. He was very willing to spend it, and then to leave
us in the appalling financial condition in which we now find ourselves.
I must tell the right hon. Gentleman that we take a rather more
parsimonious and sensible view than I think he did when it comes to the

pursued that point, Mr. Speaker, but, as the hon. Gentleman knows, it

lead regulator in Scotland in relation to all matters pertaining to
radioactively contaminated land. Notwithstanding that, my Department

is worth repeating that, in the opinion of the Health Protection
Agency, the risk to beach users remains very low. The agency is on
record as stating that the risk of contracting a fatal cancer is less
that 1 in 100 million, which is significantly lower than the level that
the Health and Safety Executive considers to be the upper limit for an
acceptable level of annual risk for members of the public. Recent
investigations of the incidences of cancers in the Dalgety Bay area
appear to support the HPA’s assessment. I note the
recommendation of the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the
Environment—which was mentioned by the right hon.
Gentleman—that remediation should proceed, but this is a matter
for SEPA, and it needs to be reviewed in the context of the risk
posed.</hs_Para>

part of the monthly monitoring, contractors working for my Department
have recovered and removed radioactive items from the foreshore,
thereby ensuring that any potential risk is as low as reasonably
practicable. We adopted that precautionary approach because it was
consistent with the advice given by the Health Protection Agency, and
provided a suitable safeguard while SEPA undertook its inspection.
However, there appears to be a concerted effort in the media to
circumvent SEPA’s statutory inspection by raising anxieties
unnecessarily and calling for remediation. The press reporting of the
recent investigations of cancers in the area appears to be a
particularly egregious example. When I visited the area, the sailing
club informed me that it seemed likely that it would have to cancel a
regatta owing to heightened concern arising from media reports that did
not reflect the low level of risk, and that people were unlikely to
visit because they had read those reports.</hs_Para>

should bear it in mind that the royal naval air station at Donibristle
was closed in 1959, 54 years ago, when the right hon. Gentleman and I
were in short trousers and some Members of Parliament had not even been
born. The publicly available records show an organised and systematic
rundown of the various site activities, with a focus on the salvage and
sale of assets. As the right hon. Gentleman will know, the statutory
regime requires that, if land is deemed to be radioactively 
<?notus-xml column=1096?>contaminated, it is necessary to consider all the actions of later
parties which may have contributed to or caused contamination. The
subsequent redevelopment for housing as part of the Dalgety Bay new
town, together with the construction of what is now the boat park and
sailing club, would have involved significant demolition, site
clearance, infilling and land reconfiguration. This is supported by
contemporary photographs and plans. Indeed, a refuse tip appears at
what is now the headland in the 1964 Ordnance Survey plan, which was
approximately five years after the developer took over the land. It is
the areas of the headland and boat park where radium has been
identified, and that could go some way to explaining either the current
or historical occurrence of such material on the

“designation” of the land is appropriate. While I fully

given that items, often referred to as “particles”, with

Andrew Smith</B> (Oxford East) (Lab):</Member> It is good to serve
under your chairmanship, Mr Turner. I am pleased to have the chance to
discuss home care and home care workers, because it is an incredibly
and increasingly important area of service and policy touching nearly
every family in the land. As the number of elderly and frail people
increases, many of them with some degree of dementia, and as more
people stay in their own homes, it is vital that we as a Parliament and
the Government take action to ensure that standards of care are what
they should be and meet the needs of older people with the dignity and
quality of service that they have a right to expect, and that I am sure
we all want for ourselves when the time
comes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000007">I
appreciate that there are big funding questions. I certainly want
social care to be a priority for resources. Under the present austerity
regime, social services departments and care providers are struggling
to meet the pressures that we discussing. I also favour the full
implementation of the Dilnot proposals. However, it is my intention to
focus not on finance but on care and care workers and what we can do to
address the present shortcomings, which must be evident to Members from
all parties.</hs_Para>

it clear at the outset that we should praise the good job that so many
care workers and care providers do, often—I shall say more about
this—in difficult circumstances. However, there are far too many
shortcomings, as described in the recent Care Quality Commission report
and the Unison report “Time to care”. We need an
across-the-board drive to raise  the standards, training,
working conditions, terms of employment and professional standing of
this most vital group of workers. It is especially important because
they are on the front line. They are the first point of care and
contact for hundreds of thousands of elderly people and are responsible
for helping with their intimate personal needs and medication as well
as day-to-day
living.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000009">On
standards, the Care Quality Commission found a quarter of services to
be substandard. Both the Unison report and the survey last autumn by
the consumers association Which? found too many instances of rushed and
poor care, as well as evidence of good and excellent care. I have been
surveying constituents on the issue and have seen the same mixed
picture. One daughter in the Which?<I> </I>survey found her mother
having her face washed with a flannel with faeces on it and being
dressed in the previous day’s soiled clothes. Others spoke of
relatives going all day without food or drink, untrained staff using
lifting equipment, muddled medication and forgotten alarm pendants. It
is clear that standards must be raised to a consistent and higher
level.</hs_Para>

half-days’ irrelevant training was given. Then I was on my own.

Unison does, for standardised levels of training and detailed minimum
standards on employers to provide practical training to that level,
without  making the requirements excessively academic, so that
we do not exclude people who are good at caring but  bad at
passing exams. Requirements should include communication, though,
especially given the number of people whose first language is not
English working as carers. Someone in Oxford told me that her mother
was in a care home where just three out of 60 staff had English as
their first language.</hs_Para>

go wrong, it is vital that staff speak out, yet too often care workers
feel vulnerable and not in a position to do so. I note that last month,
the Secretary of State for Health said that he was “very
sympathetic” to extending to home care workers the duty to
whistleblow that the Government are thinking of applying to nurses. I
urge the Minister to do so.</hs_Para>

that inspection is extensive, robust and effective. It is all the more
so given the importance of care and the fact that it takes place in
people’s homes, away from immediate supervision. There are
concerns about that in Oxfordshire right now. Our local paper, the
<I>Oxford Mail</I>—I am sure you will remember it well, Mr
Turner, from your time in Oxford—has highlighted concerns raised
by our local patient voice and county councillors about the adequacy of
local CQC inspection arrangements. In November, there were just two
inspectors for Oxfordshire, and even now there are only five, who
between them are responsible for inspecting 447 health and social care
institutions and thousands of home  care
visits.</hs_Para>

all-party concern. Conservative councillor Jim Couchman, who chairs the

meeting the
CQC:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13030649000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000081">“We

Couchman has also told me since that apart from the enormity of the
task required of such a small staff, the most surprising fact was that
recruits did not need any experience or knowledge of the NHS, health
care or social services. The CQC seemed more concerned about whether
new staff had a background in regulation.</hs_Para>

concerned that when asked to talk to the <I>Oxford Mail, </I>the Care
Quality Commission declined. When such worries are being voiced, it is
all the more important for a body such as the CQC to come forward and
answer questions as a basic responsibility of public accountability, as
well as to take the chance to build public confidence rather than
undermining it, as the CQC ended up doing. Will the Minister look into
the position on care quality inspection in Oxfordshire? More generally,
will he ensure that the commission has sufficient inspectors across the
country with the right experience to do the
job?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000021">Feedback
from users and their families is another important yardstick by which
to lever up care standards. Our county council uses individual visits
and client satisfaction surveys to inform contract monitoring. However,
a wider public satisfaction rating is needed for the plethora of care
agencies. One of the paradoxes of modern life is that, if advice is
wanted on the standards of service providers such as restaurants,
hotels and garages, or of products such as cars and electrical goods,
there is no end of reviews out there to guide people, but for something
as important as helping someone to find a good care provider, there
seems to be nowhere to look for advice. In theory there is competition
for provision, but in reality all the customers are groping around in
the dark. That is a good reason not to emulate in mainstream NHS
provision the privatisation that has already happened in care
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000022">Underpinning
all that, action is desperately needed on the terms and conditions of
care workers. They are doing a demanding job, often on the lowest wages
and with minimal security. According to the Unison “Time to
care” survey, more than half of home care workers overall and
more than 80% in the private sector are not paid for travel time or
costs; it has been estimated that between 150,000 and 200,000 home care
workers are in effect paid less than the national minimum wage as a
result. To make matters worse, more than half of private sector home
care workers have a zero-hours contract with no guaranteed pay, and
more than half of all home care workers reported that in the past year
things have got worse for them on pay, working time and the duties
expected of
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000023"><Member ContinuationText="Lilian Greenwood" PimsId="5568" UID="13030649000091" xid="1117" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000091"><B>Lilian

collection of points that he has just made. I have had not only users
but care workers troubled by their ability to do their job come to see
me. In my experience, such workers are troubled by a combination of not
having enough time to look after the person they are caring for and no
adequate account being taken of travel time, which means that they are
in effect paid below the minimum wage to do a job that they cannot
carry out sufficiently and that often there is no continuity of care
from a particular individual for a vulnerable, normally elderly person.

no allowance for travel. After paying travel and other employment

that he would be better off back on jobseeker’s allowance, which
was where he went. I took up the case with social services and the then

Member for Oxford East (Mr Smith) not only on securing the debate but
on covering such fundamentally important ground on matters that clearly

<?notus-xml column=248?>need to be addressed. From the litany of issues that need to be dealt
with seriously by not only the two parties in government but all
parties, it is clear that if we were to construct the circumstances for
a catastrophe to happen on our watch, all the ingredients are being
prepared in the services being provided to people in their
homes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000036">The
right hon. Gentleman described many symptoms, and at present the health
system is under extreme pressure. The last Labour Government
established the £20 billion efficiency gain, now colloquially
known as the Nicholson challenge. All parties know that the pressure
for efficiency gain inevitably resulted in an attempt throughout the
system to push costs down to the least expensive care models, which
means out of hospital, into the home and care by the lowest paid
people. In addition, a whole heap of management babble obscures the way
in which the trend is being catapulted. The health system depends on a
group of workers in people’s private homes, but we should not
ignore the fact that many people work in similar conditions in
residential homes for people who cannot be catered for in their own
home. There is a parallel situation in nursing
homes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000037">With
pressure on the system, there will be increasing attempts to ensure
that patients are discharged from hospital much earlier than in the
past. Part of the management mantra is that the worst place for an
elderly person is an acute hospital and that unnecessary admissions
should be avoided. That is self-evidently unarguable, but is often
asserted. However, at the margin an assessment must be made before
making that decision. There is a feeling that older people are being
denied admission to hospital because of age discrimination in the
system, and that because they are older they should be kept at home
when, if they were 20, 30 or 40 years younger with the same condition,
they would be admitted to hospital. Many of us know that that pattern
exists.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000038">MPs
have many examples in their casework, and I am sure I am not unique in
this: inadequate care is provided in the home for older people who must
endure unacceptably poor standards of care and circumstances. The
response is often pontification from the political classes, but the
care workers are voiceless. Whenever the “Today”
programme runs a story about poor care, which it often does when a
shocking story of poor care is revealed or a report by the Care Quality
Commission is published, some of our own classes are wheeled on to
morning media slots and often denigrate the character of the people who
provide care, as though a failing in the carers caused the problem.
They say that we must address problems with carers’ characters
rather than the unfeasible circumstances in which so many of them must
operate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000039">I
intervened on the right hon. Member for Oxford East to ask how long it
takes him to get out of bed in the morning and to get ready to go out
of the door. All of us in the Chamber are able-bodied and do not need a
hoist to get out of bed or to use the toilet. We do not need to be
assisted in every way, and we are not on a cocktail of
medicines—perhaps some of us are. An hour is probably a
reasonable time for most able-bodied people, yet we often hear that
care workers must undertake those functions for other people in less
than half an hour. That is simply not feasible. People may say that
carers cut corners, take risks and do not complete the job, but they
are asked to undertake an impossible task.</hs_Para>

are on the minimum wage, and in areas such as mine
in west Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly the travel time between visits

address the issues that the right hon. Member for Oxford East has
properly listed. All the ingredients are there. As we go forward, the
pressure will continue. Bed reviews will be undertaken as the new
clinical commissioning groups swing into action in the next month. They
will look at how many community beds there are in their area, assess
whether they are affordable, and look for new ways of working and new
pathways. They will use the usual language to argue that there are
better ways of providing the care that is currently provided in
community hospitals, that local communities should not be obsessed with
bricks and mortar, that they can provide better care in the home, and
that people should relax and understand that the number of beds can be
reduced even when the population is ageing and the number of people
needing care is increasing. Reducing the number of beds will increase
the pressure on remaining beds. People will be discharged much earlier
to their homes with assurances that adequate care packages are in place
when we all know that those care packages are marginal and that the
people providing the care will be asked to undertake work that is often
unfeasible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000042">I
often resist calls for diminution in the number of community hospital
beds in my constituency, and I am sure that other hon. Members do the
same. We used to know the number of beds in our local hospitals, but
the service that used to be provided is becoming increasingly
invisible. The problem is that the service can then be cut, denuded and
reduced over time in ways that are very difficult for us all to
properly assess, because people will not able to see or understand how
it operates. Parts of the service will be shaved off in the same way
that local authorities have redefined access to support from moderate
to critical, and so on—as I know that many local authorities
have done.</hs_Para>

that we have some excellent agencies working in west Cornwall. Many of

George:</Member></B> Absolutely. Minimum standards and agreements
across agencies—or if the Government will not establish minimum
standards, baseline standards—would give people reassurance.
What we understand is happening, as part of achieving the efficiency
gain that 
<?notus-xml column=250?>all parties want, is that not only is there an attempt at constructing a
clinical and patient interest argument that patients are better off
being discharged to their home, which is better for them, because it is
where they want to be—the mantra that is often used; but there
is cost-shunting as well. Obviously, if a patient is in hospital, the
state is paying for them. There is an increasingly harsh attempt at
identifying what continuing care is and is not—in other words,
the state continues to pay for that patient in their home—but
what ultimately happens is that the sooner the hospitals can get
patients out to their home, it is the individual, if they have any
assets at all, who meets the bill.</hs_Para>

standards, in my view, we should be encouraging agencies that are
providing care to offer at least a living wage for
workers—£7.20 per hour and, I think, £8.30 in the
London area. Travel time between visits should be part of salaried
time. A mileage rate should be set and understood, and everyone should
share a mileage rate; in my area, the rate paid to travelling care
workers varies between 35p and 40p a mile. There should be a minimum
visit time of 45 minutes in very exceptional cases, and at
least an hour for most visits, especially if it involves at least two
of the following procedures for non-ambulant or semi-ambulant clients:
getting out of bed; dressing or undressing; toileting; feeding; washing
and mobility support.</hs_Para>

and effective arrival and departure reporting and recording system
should be introduced, because there is some dispute between agencies
and local authorities on that issue. Registration of care workers is
very important, and I hope there will be cross-party support for it.
The Select Committee on Health, of which I am a member, has been
pushing for it for some time. It would ensure that there is adequate
training, proper registration and recognition of the significant job
that home care workers do. With that kind of support, I believe that we
can give home care workers the proper status and support that they
richly
deserve.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_06_PT_1/AF52E2A694B037A5342208212D8492AF5687222A" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="6 March 2013">Wednesday

would argue, a bit of the economy that does not necessarily lend itself
well to markets. I hope that hon. Members will forgive me if I sound

these issues, and we have tried to bring together both those who work
in care and those who receive care so that we can see the problems from
either side of the coin. Those two aspects are 15-minute appointments
and zero-hours

on 15-minute appointments, it might have been mentioned that the recent
Unison report found that 46% of staff felt that they had to rush
visits—that is nearly half the workers going into the homes of
people who are very important and need help. The result is the feedback
that I receive that due care and attention cannot be given to people. I

me give an example from my own constituency. A care worker was in a
couple’s home to make some food for them, but said that they
were able to do that for only one member of the couple—the
husband or wife—because that was all that they had been
allocated time for. Most people expect to be able to sit down to a meal
with their partner. That is a basic thing that we all expect to be able
to do in our lives. Fifteen-minute appointments may or may not have
been the cause of the problem in that case, but if 15-minute
appointments mean that the normal standards that we would all expect to
be upheld have to be disregarded, that is not a system that will work

next person, which will cause stress, or, frankly, rushing around doing
things that they know they will not be paid for, which will cause them
stress. At the same time, they are trying to make that individual feel
better about what has happened. What skills and talents does someone

we treat others in society is ever more important. When we are asking
people to do a list of tasks—no more and no less—rather

a bit of work but do not need it to be regular—students or
others—zero-hours contracts may not be such a problem. However,
I think we all recognise in this Chamber the
problems with that flexibility and insecurity in a world in which
people are trying to provide routine, predictability and attention to
detail for some quite vulnerable people. I think we would all question
the appropriateness of zero-hours
contracts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000064">There
are two problems with zero-hours contracts that we need to consider.
The first is inconsistent care. My constituents tell me that they would
like to know who the person is who will be turning up and they would
like visits to be predictable and regular, not least because of respect
and dignity issues, such as knowing the little details. Often, people
who need care face communication barriers. Understanding in detail how
a person communicates is extremely important, so consistency of care
could not be more important. How do zero-hours contracts support
consistency of
care?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000065">The
second issue is stress. Insecurity at work causes stress, and in a
world in which we are asking people, as I mentioned in my example, to
turn up and help vulnerable people, we need them to feel confident and
secure and to have enough skills to be able to tackle whatever problems
are there. Recent research has shown the impact of stress and
insecurity for those working in care on the manner of treatment
received by the people for whom they are caring. That is an important
message to us all as politicians. What responsibility can we
take  for creating more security at work for those who care for
vulnerable
people?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000066">Comments
have already been made about the pay levels in the sector. They are
clearly low. Low pay plus zero-hours contracts mean that we will have
people of relatively low skill. I mean “low skill” in the
technical sense; I would argue that people who work in care are
extremely skilled and extremely able practically, given what they have
to deal with. However, investment in skills will clearly not happen
where there is low pay and an insecure labour
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000067">Having
described the problem, I will conclude by describing what I believe
might be part of the solution. First, working in home care needs to be
seen as an aspirational job. There is no reason why someone should not
work in care and aspire to management, to moving up in their career. We
need to find pathways through the career chain so that we can make this
a genuinely aspirational job. A significant number of our young people
are out of work. We need to demonstrate to them that home care work is
valued in society and that if they pursue such a career, they will be
invested in and respected as members of our society. We need to make
that absolutely
clear.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000068">I

this. I hope that the Minister will respond positively and explain what
we can do to bring some change to the

matter to the House

to medical innovation, people have a longer life expectancy now than
they had in the past. As a result, people are trying to live at home
just a wee bit longer before they go into a residential or nursing
home. A great many people now retire to my constituency of Strangford,
because it has the seaside and is also a lovely place to be, and we are
very pleased that they are coming to live in our area. However, they
are people of a certain generation, and the expectation of people in
Northern Ireland is the same as that of people in the rest of the
United Kingdom—that they will live that wee bit longer. I
believe the Government have been encouraging families to help at home
before turning to residential nursing
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000071">There
must be robust regulation of care workers to ensure safety and value
for money. In the news, we often hear horror stories of someone taking
advantage of the elderly or vulnerable. Hearing such stories concerns
and annoys me, but it is not the case in the vast majority of
circumstances. There should be regulated training and assessment as
well as funding and help, to ensure that we get things right, which is
the gist of the debate
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000072">In
the past I have spoken about the difficulties that welfare reform will
bring for carers. I shall use the example of my brother, who had a
motorbike accident approximately eight and a half years ago that left
him with some brain injuries. My parents are well into their
80s—81 and 83, mum and dad—and their ability to cope with
my brother and his particular circumstances lessens as every year
passes, because the nature of life is that the older we get, the less
physically able we are. We are very pleased and blessed to have my
brother able to speak and converse with us; the difference is that our
Keith will never be able to work again or, as he would love to, ride a
motorbike again—that will never happen. He is able to keep his
independence due to the carers who come to see him, and they are
tremendous. There is perhaps not as much funding as there should be in
the NHS for carers; Keith is reliant on his disability living allowance
to pay for the help he needs. If that were to change, he would have to
be placed in a facility with full-time carers, which would adversely
affect his mental health and cost the Government a lot more to provide.
That is my honest-to-goodness, personal opinion in the case of someone
close to
me.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000073">Such
situations are replicated across my constituency and in constituencies
across the UK; there are many cases. It is essential that home care
continues. If people cannot afford to pay for reputable carers, it is
more likely that they will look for carers who are less expensive and
perhaps less qualified. That is why the Government must regulate more
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000074">I
make a plea for Crossroads Caring for Carers Northern Ireland, which
primarily provides domiciliary respite care. It has offered that
service for carers in Northern Ireland since 1984, and provides in
excess of 200,000 hours of respite care to more than 1,200 families per
year. It does tremendous work, as do many others. 
<?notus-xml column=255?>The service is unique, because it is aimed specifically at the carer.
Crossroads is committed to providing a quality, flexible home-care
service; its care attendants enable the carer to have a break, by
carrying out whatever tasks the carer would normally do. Carers can
take a break from caring, in the knowledge that those they care for are
receiving quality care from Crossroads. In other words, every bit of
quality care will be provided by Crossroads. A break from caring is
invaluable in reducing the psychological and emotional stress that many
carers face. Crossroads domiciliary respite care helps carers to
continue to provide the support they give to a sick, disabled or
elderly
person.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000075">The
care provision is tailored to each caring situation; everyone is unique
and the service adjusts to the unique circumstances. Individual care
plans are agreed between Crossroads, the carer and the person with care
needs. People decide for themselves what help and support they need,
and Crossroads responds. Care attendants help with a range of personal
care tasks, ranging from bathing and personal hygiene to complex care
needs. Through their families, I regularly meet many constituents who
have complex care needs. Crossroads adopts a flexible support approach,
with care attendants helping with almost any task that is part of
everyday
living.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000076">Funding
for Crossroads is under stress, as I said, so less and less help can be
given. That brings us to the thrust of the debate: people are left in
situations where they must look to cheaper alternatives, which are not
always better. It bears repeating that the Government must address care
in the home needs. Too many people are living in dirty homes and not
being fed enough. There is only so much that families can do. Although
we are trying to save money, care in the community cannot bear the
brunt of what the changes will bring. Crossroads Caring has lost the
bulk of its funding due to cuts. That will mean more elderly people
living in unfit conditions because too much is required of their
carers. With respect, the Government do not seem to understand that if
they put a little into respite help for carers now, it will mean that
carers can continue to care rather than giving up and putting their
loved ones into state-sponsored homes, which are more expensive and
where issues with carers are more apparent. Saving a penny now will
soon mean spending thousands later. I hope when the Minister responds,
he will give some indication of the Government’s
strategy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000077">Those
advertising care at the moment can do so while providing little
training or checks on their staff, as hon. Members have indicated, and
that must end. There must be regulation, qualifications and a set
standard to which all carers and service providers adhere. When the
Government set that in place, we will hear fewer horror stories and
more feel-good stories, of which there are thousands and thousands.
They are not the stories that make the press; they are about the many
carers who go above and beyond their calling to provide
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000078">As
an elected representative—as an MP and a former Assembly Member
and councillor—I know of the good work that carers do. They come
to me regularly, in their own time, to seek help for those for whom
they care. I am always impressed by the fact that carers spend
additional time on those for whom they care—above and beyond
what is expected. We hear the negative 
<?notus-xml column=256?>stories, but the good ones always make us feel much better about the
good work that carers do in our
constituencies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030649000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030649000079">I
am sure that, like me, colleagues feel there must be proper training
and monitoring and that it must be put in place in a timely fashion. As
each day passes, more people are being cared for at home. We have a
duty to ensure first, the regulation of all carers; secondly, the
safety of those being cared for; and, thirdly, and most important,
peace of mind for the family of the person who needs care. I

I read the “Time to Care” report, I had an enormous
feeling of déjà vu. Before becoming a Member of
Parliament, I worked for Unison as a full-time officer. Back in the
1990s, one of my first jobs as a young officer was supporting the
Derbyshire county council home helps joint consultative committee.
“Home helps” was the name given to home care workers in
Derbyshire, of whom there were thousands. The  joint
consultative committee used to bring together representatives of home
care workers from across the county with senior management of social
services, including the director of social services, who so understood
the important role of home care that he was always prepared to attend
meetings to listen to the views of home care representatives. It was an
opportunity for them to raise their concerns and the issues that their
members faced.</hs_Para>

a period of huge change for such workers. The role of home helps was
changing immensely: they moved from providing a service that was
basically helping older people with cleaning, shopping, meals and even,
back then, laying fires, to providing much more intimate personal care
and dealing with people with increasingly complex needs. It was also a
period of budget cuts, which accounts for the feeling of
déjà vu. There was pressure to change services, to make
them efficient, obviously, but also to open them to the private
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000004">I
vividly remember Derbyshire home helps raising concerns about a
proposed move to a time-recording system. When they arrived at a
service user’s house, the first thing they had to do was
telephone to tell social services where they were, so that there was
much more detailed information on the amount of time they spent with
each service user. A concern they raised at the time was that doing so
would change their focus, so that rather than their prime focus being
on the needs of the service user, their top priority when they arrived
was to record their time so that social services could properly cost
the
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000005">I

of the most important issues is about older people. I imagine that many
hon. Members have this experience when they are out canvassing in their
communities: they knock on the door of an older person, and perhaps the
Member is the only person they have spoken to that day. Their priority
is to talk to someone who is willing to listen. That was well

is vital that, like the director of social services in Derbyshire back
in the 1990s, we listen to the voice of home care workers, because they
meet service users every day. Most of them are incredibly committed to
providing a good-quality service and ensuring that people receive the
support that they need. It is also vital that we do not simply listen
to them, but act. Will the Minister meet home care workers and their
representatives to discuss the findings of Unison’s “Time
to Care” and the CQC report? Will he set out today how he
intends to respond to the findings of those
reports?</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_06_PT_1/7D3ABC67C67154AC639959E12870650F681D858F" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="6 March 2013">Wednesday

congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford East (Mr Smith)
on securing today’s debate. Home care workers often work in
isolated environments, and the people who receive care are isolated.
Too often, they do not have a voice, and one of our jobs as Members of
Parliament is to provide a voice for the voiceless. My right hon.
Friend has helped us to do that
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000022">The
issue is extremely important. More than 800,000 people provide home
care in the UK. Some 80% of them are women, and their median age is
about 40. They provide vital, intimate and personal services to more
than 1 million of the most vulnerable people in society. If any other
policy area had that scale of figures, this debate would be
on the Floor of the House, with 
<?notus-xml column=259?>many other hon. Members present. It is good to have hon. Members here in
this debate, but the issue that requires addressing is a huge
one.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030650000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000023">The help that
home care workers provide is crucial for older and disabled people,
because it helps them do what they want, which is to stay living
independently in their own homes. It is crucial for families, who often
have to go out to work and cannot provide support and care for their
elderly relatives. Also, they might not live nearby, as I know well
myself. Home care help is crucial also for the public finances and
taxpayers, because if we can keep more people living healthily and
independently at home and not going into hospital, taxpayers will
receive better value for money.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030650000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000024">Like other
hon. Members who have spoken today, I have been concerned about the
issue for a long time. Last May, I held a domiciliary care summit in
Parliament with the United Kingdom Homecare Association, with 50
providers coming along. I have work-shadowed home care workers in my
constituency, including Amanda White. Going out on an early-morning
shift with her was an eye-opening experience. I also speak to many
older and disabled people and care workers in my constituency and
across the country. Many of the points that I have heard have been
repeated by right hon. and hon. Members today.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030650000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000025">There are
many examples of excellent, decent and respectful care. The home care
workers to whom I have spoken, including Amanda, love their job. They
feel that they are doing something important for vulnerable people,
helping them to live the kinds of lives that they want. However, the
overwhelming picture is of a vicious downward spiral, with
ever-increasing demand and ever-decreasing budgets, poorly paid,
motivated and trained staff, and poor-quality care. Just to summarise,
I will go through five issues that many hon. Members have raised
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000026">The
first issue is low pay. Many people do not get even the minimum wage at
the end of the week, because they are not paid travel times.
Unison’s survey, “Time to care”, which hon.
Members have mentioned, found that half of those who responded said
that they did not get paid travel time, rising to more than 80% in the
private sector. King’s college London has found that between
150,000 and 220,000 people working in the social care sector get paid
less than the minimum wage. I will ask the Minister some questions
about that towards the
end.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000027">The
second issue concerns shorter and shorter visits for people with higher
and higher levels of need. It is important to remember that as budgets
are squeezed, councils raise their eligibility criteria, so people who
need care and support at home have greater needs but get shorter and
shorter visits. According to the UK Homecare Association, three
quarters of visits are for 30 minutes or less, and one in 10 visits are
for only 15 minutes. As several hon. Members have said, that
is completely inadequate to get someone up, washed, dressed and fed,
particularly if they have dementia. Anyone who knows someone or has a
family member with dementia will know that they often struggle in the
morning, which is a really disorientating
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000028"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jim Shannon" PimsId="650" UID="13030650000078" xid="1218" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000078">Jim
Shannon:</Member></B> One thing that carers provide to those on whom
they call is a wee bit of a chat in the morning—someone to speak
to—because many people have no 
<?notus-xml column=260?>one at all to speak to. When they come in, they light the fire and do
all the things that the hon. Lady has mentioned, but communication
between carers and those they visit is important. Does she think that
that should be given more
time?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000029"><B><Member ContinuationText="Liz Kendall" PimsId="5669" UID="13030650000079" xid="1114" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000079">Liz
Kendall:</Member></B> Care and communication is vital for people with
all sorts of frailties and conditions, but particularly for those with
dementia, as carers try to keep their memories and brains going. Those
people often feel lost in a fog, and having some kind of contact is
vital to keeping them going, so it is
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000030">We
have heard about the problems of call cramming, with carers being
rushed, getting late to one client and leaving early for the next.
Older people are worried when they are left waiting on their own, and
staff are frustrated that they have to rush in and
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000031">The
third issue that has been raised is zero-hours contracts. As hon.
Members have said, such contracts are very bad for workers, because
they find it difficult to budget and plan their lives. Zero-hours
contracts make it hard to attract people to the sector. They are also
terrible for the users—older and disabled people who do not get
continuity of care. I cannot imagine someone coming round to get me out
of my bed and take me to the shower. I would be naked and they would be
washing me, but I would not know who they were, because they would
often be different people each time. We would not put up with that for
ourselves, and we should not expect it for older people
either.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000032">The
fourth issue is the lack of training, which is a real problem in
dementia care. It is only since having known people with dementia that
I have fully understood why they are seen to get aggressive: they do
not, but they are frustrated because they cannot remember things.
Carers need detailed training for
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000033">The
fifth issue is the vicious downward spiral or vicious circle that leads
to poor care for users of services and real problems for staff. The
last UK Homecare Association report states that vacancy rates are at
21%, so we are simply repeating the
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000034">In
my remaining time, I want to make three comments about why that is all
happening and what we need to do. Clearly, demand has increased in
recent years. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral South
(Alison McGovern) said, when local councils’ budgets are being
cut by a third, when adult social care is 40% of their budget on
average and their biggest discretionary spend, and when the money that
the Government say they have transferred from the NHS has not been
ring-fenced, it is inevitable that care budgets are being cut. Figures
from the Department for Communities and Local Government—the
Government’s own figures—show that more than £1.3
billion has been cut from older people’s social care budgets
since the coalition came to
power.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000035">There
are a few deeper things going on. First, the caring profession is
mostly delivered by women and is low-skilled. Such professions have
always been neglected in the past, so that is a concern. Secondly, the
problem is invisible: it concerns isolated staff and isolated, frail
older people who do not have a voice. In talking about the care crisis,
I always tell people that I have received five letters about the care
crisis in my constituency and 99 about saving forests. I am passionate
about forests, 
<?notus-xml column=261?>but getting only five letters on the care crisis shows that this is an
issue of isolation and we should stand up about
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000036"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andrew George" PimsId="3404" UID="13030650000080" xid="222" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000080">Andrew
George:</Member></B> Like the hon. Lady, I have shadowed care workers
in my constituency. One point that often comes across is that when I
ask those who pontificate from on high—criticising poor care
standards and implying that it relates to the character of the people
providing the service—whether they would be prepared to do this
job, no one wants to do it, even at twice the
salary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000037"><B><Member ContinuationText="Liz Kendall" PimsId="5669" UID="13030650000081" xid="1114" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000081">Liz
Kendall:</Member></B> I completely agree. That is why Unison’s
report, “Time to Care”, which has given people a voice,
is
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000038">The
third fundamental issue is that our NHS and care system have not kept
pace with changing demographics—people living longer—and
changing needs and expectations. Families cannot always cope with
caring for elderly relatives, and older people want to stay in their
homes for longer. In the past, it was not the business of the NHS and
social care to think about the home; its business was always about
sending people to
institutions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000039">What
should be done? I want to raise four matters with the Minister. First,
I know that the Low Pay Commission has looked at the minimum wage. Will
he confirm, however, that as my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford
East said, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs has ruled that it
is not legal to pay for travel time? If that is the case, what is being
done about that? What action has been taken? In any other area, there
would be legal action to enforce the minimum wage, so what is being
done?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000040">Secondly,
I know that the Minister wants a shift to commissioning for outcomes,
rather than by the minute. That is the Government’s policy, but
how will he make that work in action? What are his levers over local
councils? Thirdly, it is time to have a national strategy for improving
training for home care workers. What are the Government’s
plans?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000041">Finally,
although the announcement on the Dilnot cap is a step forward, Dilnot
has always said, as the Minister will know, that proper funding is
needed in the current system, which this Government have not produced.
I know that he will be in intense conversations with the Treasury over
the future budget. If, following the Budget, the Government decide to
pull over more money from the NHS to social care, will he ring-fence
that money this
time?</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_06_PT_1/B2C582E3F2BACE412143D31B2166D89EBE0CE385" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="6 March 2013">Wednesday

totally agree with the shadow Minister that the health and care system
has not kept pace with the demands and challenges of an ageing society,
and that we need a fundamental re-engineering of how we deliver care. I
have a passionate belief in the need to shift towards an integrated
care model, in which we shape services around the needs of the
individual, rather than those of the institution, which is a shift that
must
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000045">Before
I go into details, let me say that I applaud Unison for having
undertaken the report that several hon. Members have mentioned. When
its staff wrote to me about the report, I asked officials to meet them,
and they will meet soon. I, too, asked to meet them, and I will discuss
their concerns with them next month. I recently met some care workers,
with another hon. Member, to hear directly from them, and I want to
experience myself what goes on—often behind closed
doors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000046">The
right hon. Member for Oxford East mentioned whistleblowers, and I have
a lot of sympathy with the points he made. Last January, the Government
extended the Government-funded whistleblowing helpline to the whole of
the care sector, so that any care worker can find out how to pursue
their concerns. Of course, as employees, care workers have employment
law protection, and we should encourage them all to use their
rights.</hs_Para>

Government want to do all we can to ensure that standards of care
remain as high as possible, and indeed improve. That is the challenge
we all face. People who receive home care and their families should be
able to expect the highest quality of care every time. I am aware of
the many examples of poor care. The right hon. Gentleman and other hon.
Members drew our attention to some pretty shocking case studies and to
the fact that someone can have up to 13 different care workers over a
relatively short space of time. As the hon. Member for Leicester West
said, it is completely unacceptable that a person has to receive quite
intimate care from someone whom they have never met before. Moreover,
the idea of a zero-hours contract is, in most circumstances, completely
incompatible with a model of high quality care, in which the individual
really gets to know their care worker.</hs_Para>

report “Not just a number” highlighted some serious
concerns, which we must take action to address. The responsibility for
bringing about improvement rests with all the key players, including
the providers, the councils and the regulator. The Government too must
take their share of the responsibility here. The trick is to erase the
bad, keep the good and improve services across the
board.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030650000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030650000049">The
care and support White Paper sets out our intentions to improve the
standard of social care. We will do that primarily by investing in
people—by focusing attention on the staff who provide care in
the first place. I want to join the right hon. Gentleman and other hon.
Members in paying tribute to care workers, the vast majority of whom do
really excellent work, often in difficult circumstances. They work
under real pressures because of the way in which care is commissioned
over 
<?notus-xml column=263?>very short spaces of time. We are seeing a race to the bottom, and we
must move away from that. It puts care workers under impossible
pressure and it does not provide good quality care.</hs_Para>

matter I feel strongly about, and to which I referred in my response to
the Winterbourne View scandal, is that there must be much more
effective corporate accountability. Some companies are making very good
money out of home care, so accountability must go with that profit
making. It is unacceptable that home care providers sometimes allow
negligent care to take place under their watch, and they must be held
to account for it. Poor care, private or public, should be condemned
wherever it exists. We must not have the idea that poor care exists
only in the private sector. It was intolerable that hundreds of people
died in Mid-Staffordshire hospital, an NHS hospital, as a result of

Brechfa West wind farm are based on ETSU-R-97, the same methodology
used for the existing Alltwalis turbines. As the Minister should be
aware, the 10 turbines at Alltwalis already make the maximum noise
permitted under ETSU-R-97. The 28 proposed turbines at Brechfa West
would inevitably add to the existing noise, thereby breaching noise

assessing the noise coming from wind turbines. As I have pointed out in

consistently ETSU-R-97 is applied but whether it is effective in
protecting people who live near turbines. The Minister should ask my

the Brechfa application and other infrastructure projects classified as
nationally significant—in the case of onshore wind farms, those

determined. One of the key planks of the Planning Act 2008 process for
such projects is the role of the Planning Inspectorate. Until its
report and recommendation are submitted to the Secretary of State, the
inspectorate leads on various aspects of the process. It is, therefore,
the inspectorate that engages in discussions with applicants before an
application for development consent is submitted; it is the
inspectorate that considers whether an application should be accepted
for examination; and it is the inspectorate that will conduct the
examination of that application. As part of the examination, the
inspectorate’s examining authority—either an individual
or a panel of three of five members that is hearing the
case—visits the sites of proposed developments. That is as it
should be. The inspectorate’s officers have the expertise to
assess the issues on the ground and weigh up the benefits, or
otherwise, of the proposed development package. It is not

submission of the Planning Inspectorate’s report and
recommendation. I am sure we all agree that it is in nobody’s
interest for such decisions to be spun out, leaving local communities
and businesses hanging, waiting for Government decisions. If that
timetable cannot be met, the responsible Minister must make a statement

Barker:</Member></B> I understand why the hon. Gentleman raises the
question of grid connection for the Brechfa project. Although I cannot
go into detail and comment on the specifics of that case, for obvious
reasons, it might be worth outlining the process that is set out in the
overarching national policy statement for energy, which is known as
EN-1, for considering grid connection issues. EN-1 sets out that,
wherever possible, applications for new generating stations and related
infrastructure should be contained in a single application to the
Planning Inspectorate or in separate applications submitted in tandem
that have been prepared in an integrated
way.</hs_Para>

Barker:</Member></B> I hear my hon. Friend’s point, and clearly
it would be best for the applications to be made in tandem. However,
that is not always possible, and it 
<?notus-xml column=274?>may not always be the most practicable way of dealing with such issues.
In some cases, therefore, applicants may decide to submit an
application that seeks consent for one element but contains some
information on the second strand of the project, including an
assessment of impacts. Where that is the case, the decision maker will
need to be satisfied that there are no obvious reasons why the
necessary approvals for the other element—the grid
infrastructure—are likely to be refused.</hs_Para>

to touch on the other big issue that was raised, namely the devolution
of consenting powers for energy infrastructure to Welsh Ministers. I
understand that that raises a degree of emotion. The Government support
the principle that decisions for particular matters should be taken at
the most appropriate level, and as locally as possible, wherever that
is feasible. For nationally significant energy infrastructure projects
in England and Wales, as defined in the Planning Act, we consider that
the right decision maker is the Secretary of State for Energy and
Climate Change. For offshore renewable energy projects of up to and
including 100 MW, that responsibility is vested in the Marine
Management Organisation, under the relevant provisions in the Marine
and Coastal Access Act 2009. We believe that the present arrangements
for decision making are fit for purpose in that they minimise delays
and unpredictability and ensure investor confidence in the
decision-making process.</hs_Para>

infrastructure planning regimes are different in England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland for historical reasons, and they reflect
each nation’s devolution settlement. The Planning Act and the
Localism Act 2011, which broadly cover England and Wales,
introduced the current major infrastructure planning regime. Those
changes were devolution-neutral and did not make any significant
changes to the division of responsibility between the local and
national consenting authorities. The Government are clear that any
requests for further devolution of powers in this area to Welsh
Ministers  or the Welsh Assembly should be considered in
the  light of any recommendations made by the Silk commission,
which is currently reviewing the powers of the  National
Assembly for Wales and is due to publish its recommendations in spring

Hayes McKenzie, which carried out a research project. Its report was
published in June 2011, and it found that although ETSU-R-97 guidance
remained fit for purpose, good practice guidance was needed to confirm,
and where necessary clarify, how it is being implemented in practice.
We are producing new guidance, which will be published in the first
half of 2013. We are updating the guidance, but we believe that it is
fit for purpose. I am afraid I cannot go into more detail, but I will

chose to call a debate on retail for two purposes. From a parochial
point of view, retail is a significant employer in Watford and a
significant contributor to the economy. Also, the press that retail
receives nationally, with glamorous Sky reporters standing in front of
shops such as Blockbuster and HMV that are shutting down, gives a false
impression of the sector’s overall prosperity and contribution
to the
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000066">Members
of Parliament and the public at large should realise that retail is a
big sector of the economy, and contributes in excess of 5% of GDP.
Although the Government are trying to encourage growth in the
manufacturing sector, the retail sector contributes more added value to
the
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000067">Retail
is able to offer increasingly sophisticated employment. The old
impression that people work in shops because they cannot do anything
else is no longer relevant. Retail jobs are highly trained, and there
are many apprentices. Many people, including me, started their business
career in the retail sector. Following my law degree, I was a graduate
trainee at John Lewis, which gave me ideas for developing my life both
in business and more generally. It all went well until I became
interested in
politics.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000068">Retail
contributes employment and taxation not only through pay-as-you-earn
and corporation tax but through business rates. The sector is a big
contributor to urban regeneration. People do not think of retail as a
factor in urban regeneration, but they only have to look at places such
as Westfield on the Olympic site. When I went to work in
Watford’s Harlequin centre, which is now known as Intu, in 1980,
it was the poorest part of town, notwithstanding the efforts of John
Lewis and other old retailers that had been there for 50 years, 100
years or more. The Harlequin centre was certainly not the sort of place
people would want to go unless they had to go
shopping.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000069"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Lee Scott" PimsId="4843" UID="13030679000375" xid="855" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000375"><B>Mr

Harrington:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a good point, and I would
expect nothing less. Independents are very much part of the story, and
they are necessary, but large companies developing real estate and
operating shops create massive employment, massive taxation and a
massive contribution to urban regeneration, although that takes nothing
from the validity of my hon. Friend’s
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000071">Things
have changed. Everyone knows that in the past, apart from the high
street, most towns had parades of shops. The developers of the masses
of residential 
<?notus-xml column=276?>areas across London and the home counties from the time trains opened up
those places would, for every few hundred houses, build a parade of
shops that included a fruiterer, a greengrocer, a fishmonger, a general
grocer and so on. Various things in the cycle, certainly in my
lifetime, have kept those parades
going.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000072">I
remember when the supermarkets started to take hold and some of those
shops became empty and were replaced by banks, which were opening
chains of local branches. It is hard to imagine now, but there was a
big fight for which bank could get there first. Then there were estate
agents. Again, if there was a spare unit, people would open an estate
agency. There always seemed to be something, but that is not the case
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000073">With

of the changes is that massive supermarkets are also becoming dominant

Harrington:</Member></B> Yes, I have reflected on that fundamental
point. Many hon. Members want to contribute, so I cannot address all
aspects of retail. Suffice it to say that although in the past shops
appeared, on the surface, to give people much greater choice, if we add
the internet and other channels, people have great choice now. I do not
completely agree with the hon. Gentleman, but his point is
valid.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000077">Many
people of my father’s generation came out of the Army with a
small amount of money and could never dream of opening a big factory or
going into a big form of business, but they were able to use their
money to open a market stall, as my father did in Yorkshire.
Unfortunately, the Marks and Spencer dream of going from a penny bazaar
to a major multinational did not happen in my family, but we ended up
with two market stalls. My father’s business doubled in size
over 30 years from one market stall to
two.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000078">The
serious point is that in those days the barriers to entry were low and
could be met by people with small savings and an idea. For almost any
item of clothing, household goods, luggage or anything that people
could think of, there was a place for a niche shop. It is easy to say,
“All that has changed. It is now in the hands of Tesco and the
other big companies.” I do not quite buy that, although, yes, in
the start-up system it is generally true that not many people, for a
number of reasons, are opening shops; they are not saying, “I
want to sell shoes, so I am going to take a store in Watford high
street.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000079">Even
if someone is acceptable as a tenant, they probably cannot afford to
pay the rent or the rates. Compared with my father’s generation,
there probably is not the same demand for the high street, but that
does not include internet start-ups. There are many such examples in my
constituency, including the sister of 
<?notus-xml column=277?>Jenny Reed, who works in my office. Hayley Reed had no business
experience, but she set up a shop in her spare room. If I might
ruthlessly plug the shop, it is called ProperPresent.com, and is
similar to what previous generations would have created in bricks and
mortar. The retail sector, albeit differently, still allows for
start-ups and for choices that fit people’s modern
lifestyle.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000080"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Robin Walker" PimsId="5656" UID="13030679000379" xid="1178" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000379"><B>Mr

and opportunities for retail. Does he agree, therefore, that it is
important that the Government take a long, hard look at the changes
taking place in the sector and the policies that we need to implement
to maximise employment opportunities? Does he welcome the recent

Harrington:</Member></B> I more than welcome the inquiry. It shows that
retailing is being treated seriously as an industry in its own right,
rather than as just a mechanical part of the distribution chain. It
contributes as much as manufacturing and other sectors. I warmly
endorse what my hon. Friend says.</hs_Para>

answer to the question of choice in retail is whether the public are
given a better service today. I argue that they certainly are. When I
worked at Trewins, which was John Lewis in 1980, we shut on Saturday at
lunch time, on Sunday and on Monday. Now the equivalent—the Intu
shopping centre, formerly known as the Harlequin, in Watford—is,
for better or for worse, open every day. People have the choice to shop
all the hours they want. Similarly, from the small independent point of
view, although I agree that the butcher, the baker and the candlestick
maker are not there, the internet gives the public a huge amount of
choice and very good service. Although the developments in the retail
trade are muted in people’s minds by the shops, chains and
household names that have closed down, the public are given a much
better
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000083">We
need only look at the effect on the economy. Again, to be parochial,
the main shopping centre in Watford replaced a sprawling mix of
businesses, including the smallest abattoir left in England, an old
Sainsbury’s branch and lots of different warehouses. For the
past 20 years, the main shopping centre has had 147 stores,
but the important thing is that it directly employs more than 4,000
people, plus the distribution chain and all the businesses in it. The
shopping centre contributes about £14.5 million in business
rates, which is a tremendous amount. It has about 750,000 square feet
of infrastructure, and has upgraded that whole part of town.</hs_Para>

saying that there have not been consequences. It would be wrong of me
to say that things are all one-way and all about prosperity; I am aware
of the effect that shopping centres have on other things, but they are
economic powerhouses in their own right. By any standards, the shopping
centre is a big business, employs a lot of people and contributes a lot
to the economy.</hs_Para>

nationally, companies such as Westfield have come from abroad to invest
significant amounts of money in what it sounds trendier to call
“urban regeneration” than “retail”. The
east end, White City and other places throughout the country are major,
long-term investment projects. Westfield has invested about £3.5
billion since it came to the UK in 2000, and created 25,000 jobs. If it
were another kind of business and that sort of growth were announced
over 10 years, there would be headlines all over the place.</hs_Para>

accept that retail is not the total answer to our economic problems, we
must accept what it does for employment, infrastructure and areas where
the rest of the private sector and the public sector have failed
completely. It is a significant and serious business, and its problems

has been raised, but does he agree that apprenticeships are another of
retail’s valuable contributions? Sectors such as retail and
catering offer important apprenticeships. They certainly do in Erewash.
I recently visited Anderson’s on the High street, an independent
coffee shop and caterers offering apprenticeships. Next week is

Harrington:</Member></B> I very much endorse what my hon. Friend says.
As I said, it is easy to think of retail as “Open All
Hours” with Ronnie Barker or Young Mr Grace appearing
and saying “You’ve all done very well”, but shops
invest a lot of money in training staff, and they know that a lot of
their capital assets lie in the skills of those staff. Retail used to
be minimum-wage drudge work, but it is fair to say, despite my lack of
success in the John Lewis hierarchy, that now the management teams in
some retail firms are comparable with almost anything else in this
country, and the work starts from apprenticeship level. I totally
agree.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000089">However,
there are some industry issues that we need to consider, and I will
speak of them as I perceive them; I am not in any way a spokesperson
for the industry, but I have tried to observe it and take all things
into consideration. Business rates are a significant issue. In many
cases, they are a more important overhead than rent. I believe that the
industry contributes just short of £24 billion a year in
business rates. That is a direct contribution to the local and national
economy, and it is a serious amount.</hs_Para>

rates are linked to the retail prices index means that average shop
rates have more or less doubled in the past 20 years. As most other
valuations in the Government system these days are being linked to the
consumer prices index rather than the RPI, that seems a little unfair.
The industry’s greatest disappointment, which seems to have
merit, is that there was talk of a fundamental revaluation that would
remove many of 
<?notus-xml column=279?>the anomalies in the system, but it has now been postponed. It seems to
me that there is a legitimate argument that in the interim, until the
system is properly reviewed, rises should be limited by linking rates
to CPI instead of RPI.</hs_Para>

Harrington:</Member></B> I do not think that point is
relevant in this particular case. As far as retailing is concerned, a
payday loan company, provided that it is legal and proper in all that
it carries out—I accept that there is a different
issue—employs people in much the same way as a shop with the
same number of staff. That is not to take away from the hon.
Lady’s point, but from a retail perspective, it is important to
realise that like traditional retailers, all those companies employ a
lot of people and in that respect contribute a lot to the local
economy, which is the subject of the debate.</hs_Para>

important issue to which the Government must turn their thoughts. The
planning side of things is also important. The national planning
framework, which I thought was absolutely excellent, gives a lot of
emphasis to town centres and their development, but there seems to be
no compliance mechanism. It must be remembered that more than 80% of
planning applications for retail currently being considered are for out
of town rather than in town centres. Given that it is generally agreed
that the regeneration of town centres is a good thing, it would be good
to have some form of compliance for ensuring that local authorities
emphasise it.</hs_Para>

accept that because there are now fewer functions for retail premises,
local parades do not have the “get out of jail free” card
that they used to have when new industries and uses would by and large
appear. However one looks at high street retailing, there is less
demand because of the internet, which has also brought many benefits.
The Government’s current policies on relaxing planning rules to
allow some units to return to residential use are a good thing and an
acceptance of reality. Although one would hope that it was not the case
and that some units could be live/work—for residential use at
the same time as retail—the fact is that there are a lot of
places where, if there is a convenience store, it is very good. I
commend the convenience store sector for how it has adapted,
notwithstanding the point made by the hon. Member for Chesterfield

hypermarkets to convenience stores, doing their best to dominate the
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000095">There
is still a strong and good independent sector in this country, and long
may it continue, but that sector will not fill up all the parades of
shops and tertiary units, which were built with very good reason. In

Members, their great-grandparents—the husband would be at work
and the wife would walk to the shops every day with the baby in the
pram and the shopping

transport and people certainly did not have a car. Most of us accept
that has changed, and that planning laws have to change in respect of
empty properties; we need both private and social accommodation and
some of it could come from surplus retail
space.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000096"><Member ContinuationText="Paul Uppal" PimsId="5654" UID="13030679000385" xid="1165" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000385"><B>Paul
Uppal</B> (Wolverhampton South West) (Con):</Member> I declare an
interest. Like my hon. Friend, I worked in the sector for about 20
years, either as a landlord or a tenant, and I echo his sentiments. The
vital issue with retail space, in particular in city centres, is
utilising the upper parts: residential conversion is crucial. For far
too long, we have been obsessed with the ground-floor unit, almost
dismissing the upper part. In continental Europe or other areas, people
utilise the upstairs, which provides an alternative
use.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000097"><B><Member ContinuationText="Richard Harrington" PimsId="5577" UID="13030679000386" xid="1155" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000386">Richard

finish with two suggestions that might be unpopular with the large
commercial sector, the shopping centre providers and commercial
landlords. I mentioned many good points about companies such as
Westfield and the strong regeneration sector; retail happens to be
their product, but they are really redeveloping important parts of our
landscape. However, it is almost impossible for independent retailers
to get into such units. I am not talking about community efforts, an
area for a market with local craftsmen and that type of thing; I am
talking about people who are running proper businesses, be they
start-ups or just one unit. They cannot get into the shopping centres
because of the commercial value of a rent paid by an individual
operator to the shareholders, many of which, ultimately, are the
pension funds that look after all our pensions; those capital values
are very much dependent on having big names in the units. As part of
planning, the Government should look at the possibility of allocating
to independent retailers a small number of units paying market rent; I
am not arguing for any form of subsidy, except the sort that people get
to move in, such as fitting out or a rent holiday. A number of shops
should be allocated to companies with only one or two stores. That is
the only way. It could be part of a general planning permission. I am
not specifying half the units, or a quarter, but somehow it has to be
realised in the retail sector that small companies and start-ups with
capital—properly capitalised, I am not talking about ones that
cannot compete from a capital point of view—should be allowed
into those main retail
centres.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000099">My
second suggestion will probably make me extremely unpopular, in
particular with my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton South West
(Paul Uppal). Although the Government cannot do much about the role of
small commercial landlords, those landlords are absolutely deluded
about their ability to get the rents they ask. Their mentality is to
ask for yesterday’s rent; because a shop was rented out 10 years
ago at £40,000, they will keep it empty for three, four or five
years under the delusion that they will get the same rent, and
notwithstanding the fact that they are paying empty property rates,
which I point out to the Minister it is right for them to be doing. If
the vast array of small commercial landlords are listening to the
debate or reading <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow, which I accept is completely

<?notus-xml column=281?>unlikely, I have a suggestion that might help, although it is not the
panacea for everything. As MPs, local councillors and people involved
in the community, we could persuade small operators to come into some
of those empty shops, but landlords asking for a rent that they once
got 10 years ago makes it almost
impossible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000100">In
summary, retail should be recognised as a modern, vibrant sector,
something that this country is good at and which contributes a lot to
our national economy. It has to be accepted by Government that retail

important source of jobs for people seeking non-standard hours, such as
pensioners or those combining work with study, child care or caring
responsibilities. Retail is a diverse sector, ranging from market
traders to high street giants, or from self-employed start-ups to
global companies; they are the face of our high streets. Those high
streets, however, are changing, not least because of the impact of the

reflection of what may be happening in a particular town, because high
streets are going through transition and many councils are looking to

principle of the Portas pilots was understanding that high streets are
not simply collections of shops but public spaces where people can
socialise, eat out, access other services and enjoy leisure, arts and

commitment they need from staff. In future, because of changes in how
people shop, customers will want more service from staff in the

From market stalls to superstores, whether a trolley-shop in a
supermarket or using the latest technology to buy online, the nature of
shopping is changing. People no longer want just a shopping experience,

retail, independent and specialist shops, special markets and cultural
events. The challenge is to create a high street that is attractive to
21st-century mobile phone shoppers and also meets the social needs of
the community. Combining retail with a place to meet has always been
the challenge of the high street through changing times, but I am

Marcus Jones</B> (Nuneaton) (Con):</Member> Thank you, Sir Alan, for
calling me to speak in this extremely important and pertinent debate. I
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Watford (Richard Harrington)
on securing it. It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for
Stockport (Ann Coffey), who has immense knowledge of the subject, and
has made a good pitch for what she thinks should be the future of our
town
centres.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000119">There
is no doubt that our retail sector is undergoing a fundamental and
lasting structural change, and that the full force of the internet is
being felt. In the past few months, HMV, Jessops and Blockbuster, to
name a few companies that once had a successful business model, have
succumbed quickly as their business model, overtaken by the pace of
change in technology, has become obsolete. Traditional retailing is
being eroded and is likely to give way to
e-retailing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000120">Destination
retailing is joining e-retailing as the focus for many of our multiple
chains. It is said in retail that the customer is king, and it is
impossible to stem the tide of what is happening. I am chairman of the
all-party town centres group, and I think it is important to manage
that fundamental change in our town centres and high streets. That is
what I want to speak about today. We must look carefully in many areas
at how we manage the change because many things need to be done. I want
to focus on three
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000121">The
first issue is business taxation. Rents are falling in many small and
medium town centres, but business rates, which are one of the greatest
costs for retail businesses, are not following that pattern. I
understand why the Government may not want a business rate revaluation
at the moment, but the Minister and my right hon. and hon. Friends in
the Treasury should consider freezing business rates in the forthcoming
Budget, to give a fighting chance to small businesses in our town
centres that might not benefit from small business rate
relief.</hs_Para>

Perkins:</Member></B> I commend the hon. Gentleman for his comments
about business rates. There is no question but that the issue is
significant. He seems to be calling for the Government to forgo
expected income to invest in the future, which is the Labour
party’s economic strategy, so is the hon. Gentleman coming on
board?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000123"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Marcus Jones" PimsId="5603" UID="13030679000392" xid="1112" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000392">Mr
Jones:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. If my
right hon. Friend the Chancellor sought to freeze business rates, I
would expect him to do so in a way that balances the books. It is
certainly not the Conservative-led Government’s policy to do
things that impact further on the deficit. The hon. Gentleman and the
Labour party are advocating an increase in the deficit instead of
reducing it as the Government are
doing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000124"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Robin Walker" PimsId="5656" UID="13030679000393" xid="1178" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0001.htm#13030679000393">Mr
Robin Walker:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is making an excellent point.
Before he moves on from business rates, does he agree that we inherited
with the terrible deficit from the last Government a huge backlog of
appeals against business rate decisions in the Valuation Office Agency?
That continues to be a problem. Will he join me in urging the Treasury
to do everything it can to clear that backlog, and to recognise that
that shows that there is a real issue with the valuation and
revaluation process?</hs_Para>

Jones:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that comment. I would
certainly join him in calling for that. Many businesses in my
constituency have contacted me on that very point.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030679000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000126">Let me move
quickly on, because other Members want to speak. The second issue that
is vital to managing the transition in our town centres is car parking
and particularly short-stay car parking charges. Car parking charges
are a tax on our town centres; they very much detract from them and
lead people to look for alternative shopping destinations. There are a
number of things we could do about that. First, the Government could
work more with local authorities and even incentivise them to reduce
car parking charges. Secondly, I would like them, perhaps through the
Department for Communities and Local Government or town teams, to work
with local businesses, local authorities and private car parking firms
to see how we can develop systems to incentivise shoppers. For example,
we could, in partnership with retailers, put in place systems that took
a certain amount off the customer’s car parking charge for every
purchase they made. Utilising such a system could help some of our
small and medium-sized town centres.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030679000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000127">The third
issue is regulation. I would like the Minister to advocate to every
Department the idea that any unnecessary regulation that has an impact
on our town centres and high streets should be completely resisted. A
classic example is the proposed EU harmonisation of permitted vitamin
and mineral levels in food supplements. My right hon. Friend the Health
Secretary is alive to this issue, and he is trying to resist the
EU’s directive, which could impact on our town centres and high
streets. The industry thinks that 4,000 jobs could be lost if the
directive is implemented, and many of them would be in small health
food shops and in health food chains across the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000128">To
sum up, we cannot ignore structural change, and the Government are
hard-pressed in terms of what they can do, but they can make a
difference in the three areas I have identified. There are ways in
which they can help to manage structural change, and I look forward to
hearing what the Minister has to tell us about how the Government can
help at this difficult time for our
retailers.</hs_Para>

Barwell</B> (Croydon Central) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Sir Alan. I join hon. Members in
congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Watford (Richard
Harrington) on securing the debate. I want to focus on high street
retail. I beg Members’ forgiveness because I want to be fairly
parochial and to talk about the challenges and opportunities facing my
home town.</hs_Para>

to be one of the top 10 retail centres in the country, but it has been
in relative decline for 20 to 30 years. It might help colleagues if I
examine the things that led to that decline. The first is the
mismanagement of parking policy. I do not wish to make a particularly
strong party political point, but the previous Labour-controlled
council sold the multi-storey car parks to NCP. I am not arguing about
whether there is a problem with their being in private ownership, but
the council took no control over subsequent parking prices. Prices have
gone through the roof, so many people no longer come to Croydon to
shop.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=286?><hs_Para UID="13030679000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000131">In
the 1980s, the previous Conservative Government 
made a mistake on out-of-town planning policy.
In Croydon, there have been major developments along the
Purley Way, which drew people away from the town centre.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030679000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000132">There are
also issues about how the council has managed the public space in our
town centre over a number of years. We have two covered shopping
centres, and the main pedestrianised road—North End—goes
between them. There are issues about people feeling safe when they come
into the centre. There are issues about aggressive charity collections.
The area is meant to be pedestrianised, but there is fairly regular
vehicle access so that things can be delivered to shops. There are lots
of people playing music, but that is poorly controlled, not well
structured or organised. There are therefore issues about the quality
of the public realm. There is also the general problem Croydon faces
with its overall reputation and brand.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030679000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000133">However,
Croydon has just had the most incredible news. Westfield and
Hammerson—two of the top retail developers in the
country—have formed a joint venture, with a plan to invest
£1 billion in our town over the next three years. That is game
changing for my home town; it is the best news we have had in my adult
life. The aim is to make Croydon one of five retail destinations in
London. We have the west end, Westfield London to the west, Westfield
Stratford to the east and Brent Cross to the north, and Croydon will
become the destination for south London. That will, I hope, bring some
of the big brands, such as John Lewis and Apple, which we are missing
at the moment. That is the key to then having the independent shops
that everybody wants. Those independents will exist only if we get
sufficient footfall to support them, and that comes from the big
brands.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030679000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000134">The scheme
will create thousands of jobs. One thing I hope the council will do as
part of the planning permission is try to ensure that as many
construction and subsequent retail jobs as possible go to local people.
I hope that Westfield and Hammerson take control of parking provision
so that we can have sensible parking prices. I am a great believer in
public transport, and I want improved public transport access so that
those who can come by public transport do. However, the reality is that
when some people go shopping—particularly if they buy a
lot—they want to take their car. If our parking policy penalises
them for doing that, we will be shooting ourselves in the
foot.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030679000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000135">I also want
to make a point about mixed use. The development scheme is not just a
retail transformation; it will provide hundreds of new homes and
leisure opportunities. We want Croydon’s major town centre to be
an active destination not just during shopping hours but pretty much
around the
clock.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000136">The
scheme will not just be good on its own terms, but catalyse other
development around the town centre. A number of schemes have been
consented, but they are not being developed, because of the current
economic climate. The new scheme will clearly bring them closer to
fruition.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030679000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000137">The scheme
will be an important first step in transforming Croydon’s
reputation, along with the Mayor’s policing plan, which will
address the long-term under-resourcing of policing in Croydon, giving
us 117 extra officers by 2015. There is also the money the Government
and  the Mayor generously gave us in response to the riots,
which will be used to transform the public realm in the town centre.
That really is great news.</hs_Para>

that others want to speak, and I do not want to talk for
too long about my own parochial concerns, so I will
mention just three other things. First, I would like the Minister to
pass on to his colleagues the idea that, if we are to realise the full
potential of the extra jobs that are created, we will require some
transport infrastructure improvements. We need to ensure that we have
better connectivity between Croydon town centre and the motorway
network through the A23. We also need to improve capacity on the trams
at East Croydon station. The Mayor will have to foot the bill for a
significant chunk of that, and so will the developers as part of the
planning process. We may well want to talk to the Chancellor about the
jobs that could be created with a relatively small additional
investment.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030679000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000139">I also want
to talk about the Portas pilots. The centre of
Croydon is too big for the Portas pilots, but we
have one connected with our historic market in Surrey
street. One real issue is how we connect the new retail
destination with that market so that it reinvigorates that
great destination.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030679000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000140">Let me
emphasise that the residents of Croydon want this
scheme to be an urban regeneration scheme, not a
box full of all the big brand names that is plonked down on them. They
want a scheme that better connects our town centre and that
ensures that Surrey street and London road, in the constituency of the
hon. Member for Croydon North (Steve Reed), which took such a hammering
in the riots, benefit from being adjacent to the area that is
redeveloped. They want much better connectivity with our key gateways
at East Croydon and West Croydon.</hs_Para>

I want to plug the idea of business improvement districts. We had a
vote in Croydon a few years ago. There was strong support from all the
major business rate payers for paying a bit more in business rates, as
long as they had control over how the money was spent. They have
invested in additional policing, improved cleaning and some really
great events, which have drawn people back into the town
centre.</hs_Para>

constituents are passionate about their home town. They have
been put off going there by its image, concerns about safety and
parking prices that are too high. On the horizon, we now have a
potentially transformative scheme, and I wanted to put on record my
strong support for it. There are some real lessons to be learned from
what has happened to Croydon and what will be done to put that right,
and those lessons are relevant to many other town centres around the
country.</hs_Para>

an interest. My first job, when I was at school, was at the local
greengrocer’s. I can make a fantastic stack of oranges and
apples if given the opportunity, but time is probably too pressing. I
also spent many years as a senior executive for major
retailers—Safeway and Asda. While I was at Asda I was fortunate
enough to move the business on, in its involvement with financial
services, and to run its e-commerce and home shopping
business.</hs_Para>

incredible to see the degree of trust that people put into big retail
brands, which was such that when the tsunami struck in December 2004
our website was almost crashed by the number of people who wanted to
come to the retailer to work out how to respond to the challenge on the
other side of the world. The retailers need to support that trust
fully, and each needs to build a relationship with its customers. To do
that, retailers must be better at adapting and more flexible in how
they tackle the challenges and conditions around them. Let us not
forget that Tesco started as a market stall, and is now taking on great
media companies and trying to deliver movies and a cinema experience
for people  in their front room, at a click of a button, on
their  smart TV.</hs_Para>

must be more responsible and more responsive to conditions in the
marketplace. That means that they must embrace all the channels that
are available to them. Too many have been too focused on bricks and
mortar and have not thought about the opportunity that comes through
the click of a mouse or, perhaps more importantly, about the
integration of channels and how to appeal to changing customer needs
across those channels. For example, the British Museum has a small
physical retail presence, but a multi-million pound website with appeal
across the world. In Macclesfield there is a fantastic business called
musicMagpie, which some hon. Members will be familiar with. It engages
not only in e-commerce, but in re-commerce. It recycles DVDs, CDs and
computer games, selling them on through multiple channels including the
high street. That recycling fits the need for greater sustainability

hon. Members have highlighted the need for more flexible use of
physical space by traditional retailers. That means that planning
authorities need to think more creatively. A space that has had a
certain use in the past need not in the future be linked to retail, but
could be linked to residential or other uses, as my near neighbour the
hon. Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey) said. That process—making
the use of space more flexible—is vital, and it is something for
landlords, not just councils and planning authorities, to engage in.
Too often their expectations are far too high, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Watford said.</hs_Para>

try to get rates lowered, but it is also vital for retailers to think
more effectively about how they engage the community. We were not able
to become a Portas pilot—we wish Stockport well—but
despite that we moved on to work out what else we could do. We created
a forum called “Make it Macclesfield”, which is the
town’s new brand identity, and there is a town team. We have
brought life back to the historic Barnaby festival, celebrating the
fact that we used to be the world’s leading producer of finished
silk. Each month there is the Treacle market, which brings more people
to 
<?notus-xml column=289?>the marketplace on a Sunday afternoon than we normally see on a Saturday
morning. Winterfest and other events and community
programmes bring countless more people in. We have created a plan for
the whole town: we must consider the whole town, and not just retail.
There is a plan for the silk quarter, to celebrate our silk heritage,
for the heritage quarter, to celebrate our independent retailers, and
for the marketplace, to bring everything together and enable the town
to thrive and flourish flexibly.</hs_Para>

sector, as we have heard, is a vital component of the UK economy. At
present, the sector faces challenges, which it is important for us to
address. I shall concentrate my remarks on the high street, which some
pundits have written off, but which I passionately believe still has an
important role, not just as an engine of economic growth but as a focus
for communities and leisure activities. I shall comment particularly on
business rates and the unfair burden that retailers must carry, paying
28% of all business rates despite accounting for only 5% of the
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000154">Lowestoft,
in my constituency, is a Portas pilot town. The town team is putting in
place a range of initiatives to create the sense of place that we need
to get back to. They include mentoring small businesses, the
introduction of town rangers, the hosting of musical and cultural
events and the creation of a voucher discount scheme for those who shop
in the town centre. Such initiatives provide high streets and towns
with an opportunity, but it is important for traders and retailers to
be able to compete on a level playing field with out-of-town stores and
internet operators. Sadly, at present, the business rates burden means
that they cannot do that. In the past two years business rates have
increased in line with the retail prices index, by 4.6% and 5.6%. The
increase in 2012 meant that retailers had to find a further
£350 million in taxes when trading conditions were
particularly challenging. At a time of falling disposable income and
low levels of bank lending to small businesses, business rates are
unsustainable.</hs_Para>

Government to consider various measures, and I will be interested in
the comments of my right hon. Friend the Minister. First, the
Government should review the mechanism for increasing business rates
annually. Instead of making increases in line with RPI based on a
particular month, in which there may be a spike in inflation, they
should use an annual average consumer prices index rate, subject to a
2% cap, in line with the Government’s inflation
target.</hs_Para>

Government have decided, as we know, to defer the revaluation that was
due in April, with the new list that was due to come into operation in
2015. I 
<?notus-xml column=290?>question the merit of keeping a rating list based on rental values from
April 2008, when the property market was at an artificially
unsustainable level. The Government have said that the reason for the
delay is that the result of a revaluation would be more losers than
winners, and that the centre of London would benefit to the tune of
£440 million, which might not be palatable to the rest of the
country. However, the evidence that I have seen shows that retailers in
many provincial towns will be penalised by the delaying of the review.
I urge the Government to introduce measures to reduce that
burden.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000157">My
third point is that there is a need to address the inherent unfairness
of the current system, which favours out of town development at the
expense of town centre shops. Out of town car parks are not subject to
business rates, as long as they are free for customers’ use. As
those locations compete with the town centre, where shoppers must
invariably pay for their parking, the financial incentives are
effectively the wrong way round. Consideration should be given to
raising business rates on out-of-town developments and investing the
money in town centre regeneration
schemes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000158">Fourthly,
the Localism Act 2011 introduced welcome new powers for local
authorities to provide discretionary rate relief, which can be used to
incentivise new investment in the high street and in shopping parades.
However, to ensure widespread take-up of the relief, more funding is
needed for councils to deliver it. It is important that the Government
develop a mechanism for local authorities to fund discretionary rate
relief through those new powers.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030679000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000159">Finally, I
urge the Government to conduct a full review of the means by which
business rates are set. The rise of the internet means that retailers
who trade from high street and mall shops are unfairly penalised when
competing against rivals that sell exclusively online. Let me provide
the example of a book retailer. A national bookshop company may have a
chain of shops for which it is paying rents in excess of £100 to
£150 per square foot, on which its rates are based. In contrast,
their internet competitor will have one—albeit very
large—warehouse in the middle of the country, where the rent may
be to the order of £4 to £5 per square foot. It is
important that business taxation properly reflects the underlying
profitability of a business.</hs_Para>

the Treasury—whatever parties may be in power—rather
likes business rates. They are easy to collect, difficult to avoid and
highly productive, generating 5% of the UK’s tax bill. However,
I submit that the system is no longer fit for purpose. If we carry on
as we are, the future of British retailers is at best uncertain, and I
urge the Minister and the Government to carry out a full
root-and-branch
reform.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_06_PT_1/696B437F35DAD17C56CA5B73AF2A605265BF1FA3" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="6 March 2013">Wednesday

arriving in the House, I spent 15 years as a Conservative party agent
but before that, I spent 15 years in the retail trade. I
worked, as it happens, for a small, family-run business that is still
trading—successfully trading, I would add—so it is
important to note that 
<?notus-xml column=291?>small, independent, family businesses can survive the onslaught of the
big multiples. The retailer that I worked for was in the electrical
retail trade, so it could say, in relation to Comet, for example, that
it has seen off its competitor.</hs_Para>

to dwell too much on statistics, but in preparing for the debate, I
came across research by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Local Data
Company, indicating that retailers with more than six stores are
closing shops at a rate of 28 a day, and that there are 35,500 empty
shop units in the UK—a national vacancy rate of just over 14%.
Clearly, the financial situation is not favourable at the moment and
retailers are finding it exceptionally difficult. The Government have
done a great deal over the past couple of years on changing planning
procedures. In that respect, they have helped by making change of use
easier, and I am sure that some provisions in the Growth and
Infrastructure Bill will also be beneficial.</hs_Para>

high street does not only require planning laws and deregulation. As
has been mentioned by previous speakers—in particular my hon.
Friend the Member for Waveney (Peter Aldous)—we must have a
level playing field for high streets, out-of-town stores and online
retailers, if the high street is to survive in anything like its
current state. I would be reluctant to add additional burdens to
existing businesses. I would rather look at reducing them, but we must
look at evening up the difficulties. Business rates, as has been
mentioned, are a particular burden on small shops. We have to
acknowledge that, and I sincerely hope that the Government are looking
at possible changes to taxation, business rates, and so on, which will
level the playing field.</hs_Para>

constituency, there are three major towns. Barton-upon-Humber, which is
a relatively small market town, has a very good retail mix, with
thriving local shops that seem to be able to co-exist with the local
Tesco. In Immingham, they are desperate for Tesco to arrive, because
that will switch the engine on for local regeneration schemes. Planning
permission has been given, and that highlights the fact that
out-of-town stores or incoming supermarkets can regenerate existing
towns. Immingham is particularly unfortunate in that it has a very
run-down shopping centre, and people are desperate for the arrival of
the supermarket. In Cleethorpes, St Peter’s avenue and Sea View
street are littered, as it were, with independent retailers. People can
get everything from a cup of coffee and a sandwich to furniture,
jewellery, and so on, and there are all the usual stores that used to
make up every high street, such as the butcher, the baker and the
fishmonger. There are models across the country of thriving high
streets where, occasionally, some of the larger chains are mixed
in.</hs_Para>

pilots have been mentioned, and although I welcome the aims and
objectives of the Portas review, I have reservations about some
proposals. Obviously, I welcome the fact that the Government have taken
on board the celebrity status of Mary Portas and used her to promote
schemes that will help to regenerate high streets. Going back to the
time when I was a Conservative party agent, our office was in Market
Rasen on the high street, which is now a Portas pilot, but the fact
that that office has closed and become a tattoo parlour may not help
the Mary Portas scheme.</hs_Para>

proposals are a little too simplistic. As  a local councillor
in north-east Lincolnshire, I was a member of the town team, which was
mainly concerned with the Grimsby town centre, which serves
Cleethorpes, Immingham and Grimsby, and we worked tremendously hard. We
had a local businessman who had a lot of energy and enthusiasm, but we
must recognise that the local council is a key element of any
successful high street. It deals with traffic regulations, parking
pricing regimes, and so on. North East Lincolnshire council, when I was
the portfolio holder, had an income of £1.25 million
from its parking charges. We cannot cast that out of the
council’s budget and assume that it will provide the same
services. Last week my hon. Friend the Minister was in Scunthorpe,
which is part of North Lincolnshire council and has a very successful
parking scheme that benefits local shopkeepers. It can be done, but I
urge Members not to think that it is as easy as can
be.</hs_Para>

does not help high-street retailers, because it results in
redundancies, and it does not even always result in the same levels of
corporation or income tax being paid, as we have seen with some
high-profile online retailers. In the modern world, however, we have to
realise that online shopping is here to stay, because people will not
want to give up the luxury of shopping from their armchairs. It is
important that we look at the pros and cons of the move online,
including the fact that Britain is at the forefront of e-retailing and
provides unique opportunities for kitchen-table entrepreneurs. There is

I am talking about opportunities to see and touch things and to try on

be done, he will have huge support on both sides of the 
<?notus-xml column=294?>House. He also reflected on the potential for Government to incentivise
councils, which we all know are incredibly hard-pressed at the moment,
to reduce the level of parking costs. We all recognise that parking is
a barrier in town centres. Again, it sounded slightly like a spending
commitment, but perhaps it was not. If something could be done in that
respect, that would be very
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000182">The

are all conscious of the pressure on the retail sector at this time. We
have seen some very high-profile failures on the high street in the

will not continue to

consider how the power of Government can be used to support small

reduction in business support that is out there, anything that we can
do to support small businesses to harness that power would be
tremendously important. With that principle in mind, my hon. Friend the
Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna) has launched Small Business Saturday,
copying an idea that is already successful in America. Many Labour
local authorities are involved, and I hope that local authorities of
all political persuasions will sign up to have a Small Business
Saturday identified every year on which local authorities and the local
small business sector can work together to encourage people to shop
locally. Local authorities are coming up with very innovative ideas to
promote their local small

Chesterfield, where I am the Member of Parliament, we have a tremendous
retail offer. We have a huge market. We have a market festival, which
has brought a lot of publicity. It supports not only our retail offer,
but 
<?notus-xml column=295?>our tourism offer. However, an issue that we have had in Chesterfield
and that I touched on earlier is the massive emergence of the big
supermarkets and particularly Tesco in the convenience store sector. We
already have a huge Tesco Extra store. We have a Tesco petrol station
and convenience store on Newbold road. We have a supermarket in the
town centre. We have a Tesco that has moved into the former Angel pub
on Derby road. There is a Tesco moving into the White Horse at Old
Whittington, and there are now plans for a Tesco at the site of the
Crispin Inn on Ashgate road. That will be six in one town. People in
Chesterfield have been calling it Tesco Town and are very concerned
that the offer available is far too
limited.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000190">I
recently met with Tesco. When I asked whether it felt that six stores
was going to be enough, I was told, “No, not nearly. We think
there’s going to be loads more growth in Chesterfield and we see
a lot more opportunities right across the country for many more of
these Tesco stores in the convenience
sector.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000191">I
am not anti-Tesco, but I do think that something radical is happening
that has the power to change dramatically our communities and the
diversity of food on offer. I do not think that we have really stopped
to think about whether we want that to happen. It is important that we
have a debate about what we want the convenience sector to look like.
Are we happy for all food shopping to be in the hands of three or four
major retailers, or do we want to say something about that? Are there
things that we can do through the planning system to ensure that local
authorities have the opportunity to say, “No, this is not what
we want in our area”? This is not just about Tesco.
Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Asda are also moving into the
convenience store sector. Those stores provide very good value and are
popular among consumers, and we do not want to stop people having the
right to shop where they want, but it is a debate that we need to have
and an area that we need to think
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000192">This
debate is incredibly important. The Portas review was a tremendously
useful piece of work. What Mary Portas identified in her work was that
planning and regulation, if they are done correctly, can boost and
support the diversity of the retail offer, rather than necessarily
always being a barrier. We need to get the right balance between
planning controls that give local authorities and communities the
opportunity to say what they want, and giving businesses the freedom to
operate in the way they want. There is a fine balance. It is not always
true that less regulation is good and more regulation is bad, but good
regulation is important and ill-thought-out regulation is problematic.
I congratulate the hon. Member for Watford on securing the debate and I
congratulate everyone who has spoken on contributing so well to it. I
look forward to hearing the Minister’s
contribution.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_06_PT_1/033A72339404D6B803C69CEB53350F415F48B8D3" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="6 March 2013">Wednesday

my hon. Friend the Member for Watford (Richard Harrington) on securing
the debate. He almost apologised for being parochial, but there is
nothing parochial about the retail sector. It is our largest private
sector employer, employing one in nine of the workforce. It is a
£300 billion industry and the end point of many supply chains.
As we have heard, retail plays a vital role in the national economy,
local economies and communities, and the Government fully recognise
that.</hs_Para>

healthy future for the heart of Watford. I hope the senior management
at John Lewis fully appreciate that their loss is
Watford’s, and indeed Westminster’s, gain. I know how
important retail is to his constituency. Watford was one of 100 towns
sharing the £10 million high street innovation fund, which is

that are under

we have heard, retail is a diverse sector in the size and structure of
businesses, what retailers sell and to whom, and where and how
retailers operate. From micro-businesses to international players and
from high-end luxury to providing for our daily needs, it is a lively,
competitive and innovative industry. There are some outstanding success
stories of competitive retailers operating here and in international
markets. Conversely, many smaller retailers are battling to
survive—we have all seen the
reports.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000197">A
high street or town centre needs a thriving and diverse retail sector,
and retail needs thriving town centres, but as we have heard today, the
town centre is no longer just about shopping—it is about eating
and drinking, entertainment, services and culture. Successful towns
know that and nurture it. Because retail is so important, it was chosen
as one of the first sectors to be the subject of a growth review and
was the first theme chosen for the red tape challenge. The initiatives
identified several barriers to retail performance and growth, which we
are addressing. We are delivering measures to support retail, including
doubling small business rate relief for three and a half years to help
small shops and making it easier for small firms to claim. More than
500,000 businesses in England are expected to benefit, with about
300,000 paying no rates at all.</hs_Para>

focusing retail development in town centres through the “town
centre first” planning policy; changing planning rules to allow
councils to provide more parking spaces in town centres; and issuing
guidance encouraging councils to set competitive parking charges. We
are also working with the retail sector to develop the retail strategy,
published last September, which focuses on what we can do at national,
local and European level while avoiding market distortions. That
includes reducing the burdens of regulatory compliance through better
inspection and performance and helping to understand and analyse town
centre
performance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000199">As
we have heard today, we cannot discuss retail without talking about
help for high streets and town centres, especially where there are
empty shops. Many hon. Members have spoken about empty shops in their
high streets and town centres and will know the impact that closures
have had on retail employees and their families. To alleviate some of
the problems that causes, new planning measures introduced in January
will ensure that empty shops and offices can be swiftly converted 
<?notus-xml column=297?>into much-needed housing. That will help town centres by increasing
footfall and providing badly needed homes for local
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000200">The
Government have always recognised that high streets are important for
communities and growth, which is why we commissioned Mary Portas to
carry out her review of the high street. We published our response to
the review last year, accepting nearly all the recommendations, and we
are going further with the Portas-plus package, designed to revive
ailing high streets. We have doubled the number of Portas
pilots—there are now 27—and announced a £10
million high street innovation fund, which is benefiting Watford. We
received 55 nominations for the £1 million future high street
X-fund, which will make awards to locations delivering the most
creative and effective schemes for revitalising their high streets.
Winners will be announced in March.</hs_Para>

we announced support for over 300 towns that had come forward to be
town team partners. They are receiving funding, plus a package of
support through the Association of Town and City Management. We will

recommendations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000202">The
debate is not about high street versus out of town or the internet. A
feature of today’s debate has been that every speaker has
accepted that high streets must change and evolve to compete, and in
some cases to survive. The Government are committed to supporting high
streets, but we cannot dictate what should and should not be done; the
vision and innovation has to come from places and communities, with the
public and private sectors playing their
part.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000203">I
turn briefly to two particular questions that my hon. Friend asked
about business rates. The estimate from the valuation office was that
the revaluation would have increased bills for about 800,000 properties
and decreased them for only about 300,000. We would have seen
significant tax increases for food, retail and convenience stores. We
think it better to give businesses more certainty, which is why we
postponed the revaluation. He also asked why we could not index the
annual rise to the 
<?notus-xml column=298?>consumer prices index rather than the retail prices index. He will know
that RPI is much lower for the year beginning in April than it was for
the year beginning the previous April, but we are continuing to review
the situation.</hs_Para>

main feature of the debate: the future of retail. Analysts at Verdict
research have predicted that UK retail will grow by about £4.9
billion in 2013—the highest increase since 2008. Online sales
are increasingly important. They accounted for 5% of all retail sales
back in 2008 and more than 9% in 2012. Verdict predicts that they will
account for 12% of all retail spending this year and 17% of all
non-food spending.</hs_Para>

do not really tell us what is happening and why. What are the drivers
of change? UK retail faces challenging trading conditions, but it is
simultaneously having to adapt to massive structural challenges driven
by changes in consumer lifestyles and preferences, the impact of new
and emerging technologies and the constant evolution of how technology
is used. Technology is driving change. Tablets and smartphones are
making it easier for consumers to buy online in any location, and new
delivery options such as click and collect are reducing the problems
customers face with home
deliveries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000206">I
shall conclude, because I want to allow my hon. Friend a few minutes to
sum up at the end. Retail is an important barometer of our economic and
cultural well-being. It is going through a period of rapid change, but
Britain has the companies, the brands and the entrepreneurial spirit to
ensure that we will always have successful retailers. It is part of the
Government’s job to ensure that we have the right environment
for them to thrive, prosper locally and compete globally. There are no
easy answers or quick fixes for either the retail sector or the high
street. We all have to play our part—central and local
government, businesses, communities and local partnerships—in
helping the adaptation of the future of retail and helping to shape
that future.</hs_Para>

is hard not to feel a sense of hopelessness when standing at a memorial
such as the one at Thiepval—those grand Indo-Saracenic arches.
All the schoolchildren were running around and making noise. Then the
rain started to fall and they all scattered to the shelter of the
visitors centre. I was left in the silence of a Somme
morning—misty and cloudy—and I had a real sense of the
tragedy of the loss of 20,000 people in one day. It is hard to imagine
just how many people that is, but that is what occurred. At a time when
we are once again debating what should be in our history curriculum,
1 July 1916 rarely seems to feature as a focal point for our
national story, yet I believe it should be at the heart of what we
think about when we study history.</hs_Para>

fascinated and inspired by Thiepval, but I also visited some of the
Canadian sites at Beaumont-Hamel and Vimy ridge, to which I referred
earlier. The reason why I secured today’s debate is to promote a
Canadian idea that we could learn from. Visitors to those two Canadian
sites are greeted by a young Canadian student, who is there for four
months, and explains what is available to people of all ages, what they
could do on their visit, why the location is there and what it means to
Canadians.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000218">There
is an interesting contrast with Thiepval. We have put great effort into
an excellent visitors centre there, which I cannot praise highly
enough, but on arrival, people are not greeted by a young person or
someone who can explain to them why the place matters. For visiting
schoolchildren, being welcomed by someone of their own age group would
connect them more to what they are about to see; it is not just a theme
park, but something that someone of their own age thinks is
sufficiently important that they are spending a long time there
welcoming
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000219">The
scheme might also benefit more elderly visitors, who often visit
battlefield sites. Perhaps it is unfair to cite reported speech, but we
often hear criticisms such as, “Oh, the children run around.
They don’t show respect. They don’t understand what they
are coming to see.” I do not think that that is true, but such a
scheme would encourage older generations to think that what they had
done in world war two and indeed in world war one was not in vain,
because younger generations were still explaining it to their children
and their children’s children.</hs_Para>

War Graves Commission is also a key programme partner, and provides a
range of impressive educational resources to support the learning of
young people. There is also the Heritage Lottery Fund’s
£6 million grants programme, which will encourage
young people to learn more about their local first world war heritage.
That goes to one of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for

people even younger than that served, including Jack

<?notus-xml column=305?>actions at Jutland at the tender age of 16 and a half years were
recognised with a posthumous Victoria Cross. Again, it is important to

secured today’s debate on the managed motorway scheme

Agency’s proposals recommend the implementation of variable
mandatory speed limits between junctions 32 to 35a, which is a section
of motorway around the city of Sheffield. The section carries around

times.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000264" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000264">The
consultation document recommends that variable speed limits should be
set in response to traffic conditions, automatically calculated from
sensors buried in the road. Speed limits would be displayed on the
motorway indicator signs above lanes, mounted on existing overhead
gantries, and on additional verge-mounted signs. Where no speed limit
is displayed, the national speed limit would be in force. However, the
proposals, unlike other managed motorway schemes, include the use of
the hard shoulder 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Emergency refuge
areas would be created at intervals of a maximum of 2,500 metres, and
would include emergency telephones. All other telephones would be
removed from the hard shoulder, as it would in effect become a
permanent fourth lane.</hs_Para>

the Highways Agency is suggesting that this proposal is the best
solution to add capacity to the existing strategic road network. It
claims that these benefits can only be achieved by the use of variable
mandatory speed limits and the use of the hard shoulder as an
additional lane 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I do not agree with
all the recommendations, and I 
<?notus-xml column=308?>challenge some of the argumentation set out in the proposals.

motorway schemes have been introduced elsewhere, notably on the M6 and

proposals for the section of the M1 that I am discussing. Other schemes
have only been introduced at peak flow times—weekday morning and
evening rush hours—and with the overhead gantries spaced at 500
metres. The hard shoulder then reverts to just that—a hard
shoulder—when congestion is not an issue. Evidence suggests that
the introduction of a managed motorway scheme on those motorways has
indeed led to a reduction in congestion and an improvement in traffic
flows, resulting in fewer accidents and more reliable journey
times.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000270" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000270">In

broke down where a refuge could not be reached, its occupants would
have to exit the vehicle in a live lane, which would be an increased
risk to them—as the chief constable said, an increased risk of
“200%”—as well as endangering other drivers, who
might hit the stationary vehicle. Information provided to the South
Yorkshire Safer Roads Partnership indicates that, while the Highways
Agency predicts an overall decrease in 
<?notus-xml column=309?>risk, certain risks will increase significantly, as my hon. Friend has
outlined, including the risk of a collision with a vehicle that has
stopped in a running lane outside of peak periods. That risk would be
further increased by the volume of lorries, which are often driven by
foreign drivers, that use this stretch of the M1 particularly at night,
when the traffic is fast-moving and the lighting is turned off, as it
now will
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000277" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000277">The
proposals make much of verge-mounted speed enforcement equipment and
traditional enforcement by the police to ensure that speed limits are
not being exceeded. However, the roadside speed enforcement equipment
that has been cited has not been approved by the Home Office. Also the
traditional enforcement action by police of pulling over drivers on to
the hard shoulder when they are in contravention of the law will be
taken away, because there will not be any hard shoulder. This is
already reflected in the enforcement strategy within the existing
schemes in the west midlands, where different and more challenging
methods of policing have had to be adopted, but only at peak times; at
other times, which of course is the majority of the day and night, the
police can revert to traditional enforcement
methods.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000278" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000278">Let
me give the Minister some examples. The police chase a 16-year-old in a
stolen car late at night. They manage that situation by forcing the car
on to the hard shoulder. That will not be an option for them if these
proposals are adopted. Similarly, in the case of an accident leaving
debris on the road, the police use the hard shoulder to drive ahead and
create a sterile area to protect other road users. That will not be an
option for them if these proposals are adopted. Also, police chase
suspects at high speed and the cars enter the motorway system. The
police use the hard shoulder to intercept and contain the perpetrators,
and to minimise danger to other road users. Once again, that will not

major incident in south Yorkshire would require a response by fire and
rescue services from all bordering areas. Emergency services use the
hard shoulder to speed up response times. Again, that will not be an
option for them if these proposals are adopted. Even normal operations
to reinforce good driving would no longer be an option. I recently
spent time with police officers who were specifically looking at the
behaviour of lorry drivers, which included identifying one who was
watching a DVD. With no hard shoulders, such routine operations could
no longer take place and drivers’ bad habits would not be
identified and prosecuted. Such operations have been normal practice,
in order to improve driving on this

Yorkshire Safer Roads Partnership is a multi-agency partnership
consisting of representatives of the south Yorkshire local authorities
and the accident and emergency services, and it is chaired by the South
Yorkshire police chief inspector responsible for roads policing. The
partnership has welcomed the proposal to introduce hard shoulder
running in peak flow time—the morning and evening rush hours.
However, like me, the partnership is opposed to the suggestion of hard
shoulder running 24 hours, seven days a week. This opposition is based
primarily on safety grounds. The partnership contends that variable
messaging for speed management purposes should use signs on the well
understood and widely established gantry system, rather than using
verge-mounted signs. Verge-mounted signs are not as visible; they are
often obscured by high-sided vehicles in the slower lanes; and drivers
have to take their eyes off the road ahead to view them. Gantries that
are properly spaced are visible by drivers when they are looking
straight ahead; therefore, they are easier to see at a glance, and
importantly a glance ahead where any traffic or debris would still be
visible. It agrees that the reinstatement of the hard shoulder outside
peak flow times would also ensure that emergency services could use the
motorway system more effectively to attend major incidents, and that
safety would not be compromised by having no hard shoulder when traffic
is light and fast moving, and when visibility is
poor.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000288">The
proposals suggest that, where danger exists, red X signs
would flash and a lane divert signal would be shown over a lane, but
accidents can only be avoided if sufficient gantries are provided.
Safety cannot be enhanced by the use of roadside signs, which are not
as clearly, safely or instantly visible. Therefore the proposals will
not be as effective or safe as having the hard shoulder available
outside rush hours and using overhead gantries for messages.</hs_Para>

I quoted the chief constable’s letter, which indicates that he
is concerned that the Highways Agency’s proposals are
constrained by budgetary matters. It would be a matter of concern if
the safety of people on the M1 around Sheffield was put at risk because
of budgetary constraints. We are looking for absolute assurances from
the Minister that the scheme will not go ahead until the chief
constable in particular and the South 
<?notus-xml column=312?>Yorkshire Safer Roads Partnership in general are satisfied that there is
no risk of a reduction in safety under the

I think that the Minister is aware that I wrote to him about noise
levels on the M1 in this area, particularly near Tinsley junior school,
where on a hot summer’s day the windows cannot be opened because
the noise from the motorway means that teachers cannot be heard by
their pupils. That is unacceptable. The Minister said that he does not
expect hard shoulder running to increase this problem. All I would say
to him is that the problem is there anyway. I am looking for assurances
that noise on the motorway, right next to Tinsley junior school, will
be dealt with by the Government, irrespective of the hard shoulder
running and particularly if the proposals go
ahead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000299" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000299">Thirdly,
and finally, the Minister is probably aware of a report by the Highways
Agency and Sheffield city council about pollution levels around the M1
in the Tinsley area. Surveys of nitrogen dioxide levels, arrived at as
a result of EU directives and translated appropriately into UK law,
which were carried out in that area showed that in virtually every
instance levels were 25% to 50% higher than the maximum allowed in
2010. Anything that worsens those levels should not happen. I say again
to the Minister that we are looking not merely for assurances that the
scheme he is proposing will not worsen those levels, but for assurances
that action will be taken to deal with the unacceptable pollution that
already exists in this
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000300" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000300"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sir Alan Meale (in the Chair)" InTheChair="True" PimsId="1859" UID="13030679000440" xid="422" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000440">Sir

this afternoon, following all the publicity, I was contacted by
someone—not one of my constituents—who was hit by a lorry

the M42 pilot scheme was designed, the target was to ensure that there
was no worsening of safety as a result of implementing the active
traffic management pilot. There was a three-year safety report and
trial on the M42, although I accept that the hon. Lady will want to
point out that there are differences. The pilot showed considerable
improvement in safety—accidents involving personal injury were
reduced by some 55%—and that was with hard shoulder running.
Overall, there was a reduction in the severity of accidents, with no
fatalities and fewer serious injuries, so to suggest that a move to

are two ways of answering it. There can never be total safety. As to
whether or not we describe refuge areas as being as safe as possible,
let us not play with semantics. Surely the hon. Gentleman is not
suggesting that anywhere on a working motorway is totally safe; even
motorway service areas can never be totally safe. I am not sure that it
would be right for the agency to say, “This is a totally safe
area.” We can play around with that. If the hon. Gentleman does
not like the words, we can look at the description, but if I were to
suggest that the proposed refuge areas are totally safe, I am sure he
would attack me because I cannot possibly give that guarantee. I
understand his point, but I hope he agrees that it is sensible to
indicate that even in the refuge areas there is an element of
risk.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030679000318" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000318"><B><Member ContinuationText="Paul Blomfield" PimsId="5587" UID="13030679000448" xid="1145" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/halltext/130306h0002.htm#13030679000448">Paul

the M1 as a national and inter-urban transport artery. The estimated
cost of works for the scheme is some £150 million. The scheme
requires no additional land and is built entirely within the
highway’s existing boundary. As a result, the scheme can be
built more quickly than would be the case with conventional motorway

shift more to charges which fall outside the cap and to optional fees
which are generally less transparent to consumers. However, the
Government recognise that a cap might be appropriate at some point in

Britain 2.4 million people aged 16 to 64 are currently ILO unemployed
and a further 8.7 million are economically inactive. Administrative
statistics show around 5.1 million people are claiming an out-of-work
benefit, although this will include a small number of people in
part-time work who retain some eligibility for benefit. There are a
round 4 million people who claim either jobseeker's allowance (JSA) or

decrease in the number of businesses served with civil penalties can be
explained by employers' increased awareness of the regime together with
improved guidance on the UK Border Agency website; and by the providing

Agency's work in summer 2012 under Operation Mayapple targeted

We support this through an annual Transport Grant, totalling

experience open to all 16 and 17-year-olds across England. In 2011 and
2012, providers were allowed to charge variable fees, depending on the
young person's ability to pay. The evaluation from these pilots
demonstrated that charging a nominal fee encourages a young person's
commitment to the programme. Therefore, in 2013 all providers are
encouraged to charge a fee of up to £50 to encourage young
people to complete the programme. Full bursaries are also available for
young people who cannot afford the
fee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030699000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/text/130306w0002.htm#13030699000258">The

Hancock</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 1 March 2013]:</I> Vocational
education is an incredibly important part of our country's education
provision. Standards required of students pursuing vocational education
must not be any lower, or less challenging than for those pursuing
academic courses. Over the past two years, the Government has
implemented Professor Wolfs review of vocational education in full. In
particular, the restriction of Key Stage 4 performance tables to
include only high-value vocational qualifications will ensure parity of
esteem between academic and vocational study. The Department for
Education will shortly consult on proposals to extend these reforms to
cover 16-19 vocational qualifications. Last November I also announced
the Government's intention to introduce a Technical Baccalaureate
Standard that recognised the highest level of achievement in technical
education.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030699000326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/text/130306w0002.htm#13030699000326">From

Government wants people from all walks of life to come forward to

not favour same-sex marriage from becoming foster carers or adopters. A
person's views would only have a bearing if it seemed likely that these

impacts vary with energy consumption, and the Government is mindful of
the impact that this has on household energy costs, particularly for
low-income and fuel poor households. Policies such as the Warm Home
Discount (WHD) and part of the energy company obligation (ECO) take
special account of low income and vulnerable households, offering bill
relief and support for some heating and energy efficiency measures.
This will enable more of the most vulnerable to heat their homes more
affordably and to a more adequate level. As a result, energy bills for
the poorest 30% of households are expected to be, on average, lower as
a result of policies in 2020 compared to in the absence of
policies.</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13030699004888" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/text/130306w0003.htm#13030699004888"><Sup>1</Sup>

Vaizey:</Member></B> Ofcom is responsible for regulating access to BT's
network, including the network of ducts and poles, which includes
determining whether the price charged for access is fair and
proportionate. Ofcom incorporated an indoor coverage obligation in one
of the 800 MHz lots of spectrum that were recently auctioned. The
winner of this lot is Telefonica UK Ltd. This operator is obliged to
provide 4G mobile services for indoor coverage to at least 98% of the
UK population and at least 95% of the population of each of the UK
nations, England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, by the end of
2017. With it being easier to provide coverage outdoors, this
obligation should result in more than 99% outdoor coverage for the UK
population. Towards the end of 2013, Ofcom will be publishing details
of the areas and broadband speeds that each operator is providing on
their 4G
networks.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="130306101000004" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/text/130306w0005.htm#130306101000004">Defamation</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="130306101000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/text/130306w0005.htm#130306101000086"><B><Member PimsId="5470" UID="130306101000103" xid="936" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130306/text/130306w0005.htm#130306101000103">Mr
