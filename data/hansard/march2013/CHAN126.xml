Eustice:</Member></B> I am grateful for that answer. In the
Committee’s recent inquiry, we received evidence that a
contributory factor in respect of the problem of status dogs is the
number of backstreet puppy breeders, because dogs are more likely to
become aggressive and unmanageable if they are not socialised and cared
for properly in the first few months. The law currently allows people
to breed up to five puppy litters a year without licensing, but we
recommended that the figure should be reduced to two. Will the Minister
look carefully at that

Heath:</Member></B> I have every sympathy with the reasoning behind the
hon. Gentleman’s proposal, and I certainly deplore the
irresponsible breeding of dogs. I can assure him that it is already the
case that if a local authority considers that someone is in the
business of breeding and selling dogs but they have produced fewer than
five litters in a year, a licence would still be needed, and any
dog-breeding establishment that produces five or more litters in a
12-month period will also need a licence regardless of whether it is
considered to be in the business of breeding and selling dogs. Guidance
on that was given to local authorities back in 1999, explaining

“Obtaining flood insurance in high risk areas”. We are
also assisting people in flood-risk measures they take for their

that the mismatch between the registration of

can be seen in a number of ways such as the appointment of new staff at
Lambeth, the first ever woman chaplain to an Archbishop of Canterbury

be cautious about wanting to go back to the position prior to 1919,
when matters of doctrine and worship of the Church of England were
settled by Parliament. In 1919, Parliament decided that those were
matters for the Church Assembly—now the General Synod—and

propose to remove the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s
general equality duty from the statute book, having already slashed 70%

on 8 March—a non-sitting Friday. Therefore, may I thank you, Mr
Speaker, for granting my request that this U-turn be brought forward to
a sitting day by agreeing to Labour’s urgent question on the NHS
competition regulations, which the Government withdrew ignominiously on
Tuesday? It may have arrived like clockwork, but that U-turn took a
quarter of a million names on a petition, thousands of doctors
protesting and outrage across the House before the Government saw sense

Lords Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee reported that the
regulations are defective for precisely that reason. Will he now
concede that he was wrong? Will he tell me when we can expect to see a
new version of the regulations, and can we have them published in draft
first, to avoid even more chaos? I am setting my clock for the next 29
days, but I make a plea to the Government: if I can predict their
U-turns, then surely so can they. Could they, perhaps, just think
through their policies a bit more before they announce them?</hs_Para>

am glad to see that our downgraded Chancellor has got his priorities
right: he spent the week in Europe defending bankers’ bonuses.
He gathered his allies around him ready for the fight and ended up in a
minority of one. No one seems to respect the Chancellor anymore.
Yesterday, the Business Secretary made a pre-emptive strike on the
Prime Minister’s big economy speech by agreeing with the
Opposition that we need a plan B, and 
<?notus-xml column=1125?>the Governor of the Bank of England has accused the Chancellor of
holding back the economy by not splitting up RBS. Most damningly,
however, he has lost the respect of the British public, who see him

do not believe that the competition regulations as originally presented
to this House were in any sense in conflict with the commitments given
by Ministers. What is clear, however, is that those regulations are
capable of being misunderstood and misrepresented—particularly
the latter by the Opposition. In that respect, it is simpler and better
to illustrate clearly two simple facts in the regulations. First,
clinical commissioning groups have a duty, which overrides all other
considerations<B>,</B> to secure the needs of their patients and the
quality of services to their patients and to make choice available to
them. Secondly, contrary to the situation under the last Government, in
their “Principles and rules for co-operation and
competition”, procurement should be conducted with a view to
securing integrated services for patients. To that extent, what we are
doing is based on the principles set out in early 2010 under the last
Government,  
<?notus-xml column=1126?>but we are enabling patients to be more confident that they will get
integrated services responding to their needs with clinical leadership.
That seems absolutely fine to me.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady asked about bankers’ bonuses and all that. We have to
be clear about this. The Opposition might not think it is important
now, but in the past the Labour Government used to rely almost entirely
on the proceeds of financial services in the City to fund all their
expenditure. Now the Opposition seem to have ignored the fact that,
notwithstanding that, we need a competitive financial services industry
in this country. Labour seems to have ignored the fact that it did
nothing about bankers’ bonuses, which were four times as great
under the last Government than they are under this Government. The
Opposition seem to have ignored the fact that what the European
Parliament is proposing could have perverse results, leading to higher
salaries rather than bonuses, adding to companies’ fixed costs
and reducing both their capacity to claw back bonuses if there is poor
performance and the flexibility that brings. This is not a debate in
principle about whether bankers should have bonuses or about the
level—we are dealing with that. The issue is whether they are
structured in a way that allows poor performance to be penalised
without adding to the problems of the industry’s competitiveness
in Europe.</hs_Para>

lost control and ended up with a net migration figure of 250,000 a
year. The coalition Government set themselves the task of bringing that
net number down from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands, and
the figures published last week demonstrate that net migration has
fallen by a third in the past two and a half years. That shows that, in

intention to step up the UK Government’s support for girls and
women in the world’s poorest countries. We have already helped
to make great strides globally. Since 2011, our country has supported
more than 2.5 million girls to go to primary school and a quarter of a
million to make the transition to secondary school. We have helped
nearly three quarters of a million women to access financial services,
helped to secure property and land rights for nearly a quarter of a
million women, and supported 1 million additional women to use modern
methods of family
planning.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000360" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0002.htm#13030784000360">It
is also appropriate this week to underline how urgent and great is the
need for further sustained action. Around the world, one in three girls
and women will be beaten or raped in their lifetime. Fewer than 20% of
girls in sub-Saharan Africa have the chance to go to secondary school.
A third of girls in the developing world marry before the age of 18,
some as young as seven. Despite performing two thirds of the
world’s work, women earn only 10% of the income and own only 1%
of the property. Women represent only 20% of the world’s
political leaders. I do not believe that there can be sustained
development when only half a country’s population is
involved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000361" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0002.htm#13030784000361">The
evidence shows that when the potential of girls and women is unleashed,
there are incredible returns for girls and women themselves, and for
whole societies and economies. Investing in girls and women is the
smart thing to do. An extra year of primary schooling for girls
increases their wages by up to 20% and the return is even higher for
secondary school. Such education means that women marry later and have
fewer children, and that there are better health outcomes for the
children they do have.</hs_Para>

unmet challenge of our time. The challenge is about three things to my
mind: choice, so that girls and women can choose when they have
children and how many; control, so that women and girls are free from
violence and can take control of their working lives and incomes; and
voice, so that girls and women can be heard and are able to speak out

women control over their economic lives. On participation, research
clearly demonstrates that women’s political participation

is an indisputable fact that there is a direct correlation between

investment matters, which is why I want to begin by asking the

Last Friday, a Tory Back Bencher once again blocked the progress of the

the eve of international women’s day, it is right
that we think about how UK aid can be focused to address the scourge of
violence against women and girls. On my most recent visit to eastern
Democratic Republic of the Congo with World Vision, I saw for myself
the terrible impact that sexual violence has on the lives of women,
their families and their communities. One woman told me how three
soldiers from a militia group had gang-raped her and left her for dead.
In the same attack her husband and three children were taken away and
she never saw them again. Every day, that woman and many

physical scars that may lessen over time but will never heal. It is
essential that we tackle the culture of impunity, as well as the
underlying causes of violence against women. More needs to be done to
help women whose lives are blighted by violence and conflict.

providing financial and humanitarian assistance to help alleviate the
suffering of the 1 million refugees and, in addition, the many
displaced people within Syria, but in beating the drum for other
countries to step up to the plate. The Kuwait conference I attended a

significant funding. The hon. Gentleman asks what more we can do. I am
prepared to do more. Unfortunately, if we continue to see refugees
streaming across the Syrian border into neighbouring countries, it is
likely that we will need to do more. As I said in my statement, I
raised formally at the UN the issue of how we deal with women and
girls. That needs to be carefully thought through and never missed in
our humanitarian work. From looking at similar situations, such as in
Haiti, we know that it is easy for the plight of women and girls to be
missed. They are never more vulnerable than in such situations. The

areas in which we carry out our work, and women’s economic
empowerment in the region is incredibly important. In countries such as
Kenya, women have access to only 1% of land titles, and without

and I had the very same discussions that my hon. Friend mentions.
Interestingly, much of the work we do for girls in Pakistan is focused
on education. We have a huge programme, focused particularly on states
such as Punjab, that provides young girls with the chance to go to
primary school and then on to secondary school for the very first time.
We know statistically that when girls spend more time in school, they
are less likely to start a family quite so early. Alongside direct
family planning and access to safe family planning, that is one of the
best ways of tackling these issues in the long

strengthening justice systems is also important alongside that, as is
ensuring that the right laws are in place at the legislative level, so
that women and girls have recourse at the national level. Those are the
other building blocks that we should try to ensure are in place. Part
of what DFID does is to work with institutions to strengthen them so
that they are better able to deal with these issues—from a
top-down basis, as well as from a grass-roots programme bottom-up
basis. My hon. Friend mentioned the particular area of Kashmir, which
is representative of the fact that in many of the places where DFID
does its work, the circumstances are incredibly challenging—so
much so in some cases that it is quite hard for our staff practically
to get out and deliver the job and the programmes. Yet that is what
they do, and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to

It does not seek that individual members of the Committee should be
elected; that is a compromise that those who introduced it have agreed
to. There is agreement that Committee members should be nominated by
the Prime Minister and approved by the House, as the Government have
proposed. The crucial distinction is that the Chairman, who is the key
figure of the Committee, should be elected by secret ballot of the
whole House and that that Chairman should have been previously agreed

That would become a public matter and the Prime Minister
would either have to refuse to give his reasons or, if he did give his
reasons, those might be very damaging to the reputation of the

prevention and investigation measures, which have been dealt with on
other occasions. In that context, it is vital that the
House, the wider public and non-governmental organisations are

The way that the hon. Gentleman portrayed what we did grossly

Gentleman acknowledges, the ISC is a different kind of Committee. The
people concerned are handling different information—information
that they cannot share—and there are occasions when there is an
ongoing operation, things are moving at a fast pace, it is impossible
to convene a meeting of the full Committee, and the Prime Minister, the
heads of agencies and the Foreign Secretary—whoever is
relevant—have to be able to talk 
<?notus-xml column=1167?>to somebody. On some occasions the Chair has been
the person they speak with, which is entirely appropriate, but in order
for them to be able to do so the Chair must have the confidence of
senior Ministers and the heads of the agencies. I think that is an
important principle. Otherwise, they will feel inhibited about sharing
vital information, which often has to be provided at very short notice,
with the Chair at

be predicated on the view that the Committee is entirely unaccountable,
but that is not the case. We produce an annual report and other reports
during the course of the year, and they are debated in both
this House and the other place, along with other matters we
have dealt with over the year. Therefore, to that extent
there is accountability. In that sense the way the Committee
operates is already similar to the way Select Committees operate, and
it will become more so as a result of the

that an appropriate veto over an individual’s promotion to it

reason to believe that the current Prime Minister, who is not a member
of my party, would not perform that role properly. I also believe that
no Prime Minister would promote the candidacy of someone they did not
think would have the confidence of the whole House, not just that of
the Committee. In that context, I think that the accountability is
already there. It might be a little bit opaque in some respects, and in

second that the Committee’s significance depends on the Chair.
The Chair is an important member of the Committee—the first
among equals. During the two years I chaired the Committee, including
the period when we considered extraordinary rendition, there was
certainly unanimity among the members, as

years ago, the Committee started on a journey. Before the law was

before the inauguration of the Committee, the very existence of MI6 was
denied publicly by the Government. In those 20 years there has been a
dramatic shift in how the intelligence services have been made more
accountable. The latest of those shifts is proposed in this Bill, which
is a very good Bill in that regard. The accountability and transparency
that it requires—there is obviously a limit to how much

Minister could have a say in who the members are, but ultimately the
House of Commons makes that decision. Those members will know among
themselves who they feel to be the best person for the job. We have to
bear it in mind that this is not a Select Committee. If it were, it
could be argued that its Chair should be elected in the same way as for
a Select Committee, but it is not—it is a Joint Committee of
both Houses of Parliament. The Chair of the Committee, who is usually,
and should be, a Member of this House, reports to the House annually,
and a debate is also held in the other place. Having the members

can never be the same as a Select Committee, because if it were, it

matter covered in this group of amendments is the way in which the ISC

Committee is sui generis; there is nothing else like it. To seek to
bring it within a certain structure runs the risk of ignoring the fact
that it has particular characteristics. The Chair of the Committee has
particular characteristics, too, because by convention the Committee
does not talk to the press. When any request is made for information
from the print or electronic media, the proper course of action, which,
if I may say so, I have studiously followed since my election, is to
refer the matter to the Chair of the Committee. The Chair then finds
himself in a very difficult and sensitive position regarding the extent
to which he is able to respond to possibly legitimate inquiries about
the work of the Committee, in so far as that is consistent with the
fact that he, like all of us, signs the Official Secrets Act. No member
of any other Select Committee in the House of Commons does that.
Particular skills are therefore essential for the chairmanship of this
Committee that are not necessarily required in the chairmanship of
other Committees. I respectfully suggest that those who are best able
to assess those skills are the members of the Committee themselves. Of

a different type of Committee that is not entirely analogous to Select

House would behave in a partisan way in choosing Select Committee

an argument about the House of Commons and whether we have the
self-confidence to believe that we should be taken seriously as a
Parliament and a representative Chamber and whether we are prepared to
take on this enormous responsibility. Just as the election of Select
Committee Chairmen and members has enhanced the House, I believe that
eventually this next step will also enhance it. It will prove us
capable of making that responsible judgment and ensuring

our debates in the other place and here in Committee, there were
extensive exchanges between the Government and the Opposition about how
to strengthen the role of the ISC. Since inception, the ISC has been
composed of Members of Parliament, yet because of its unique nature, it
has often been portrayed more like a component of the Executive, not
least because its secretariat is provided by the Cabinet Office. The
Government have now finally decided, however, formally to constitute
the ISC as a Committee of Parliament. Changing its name to the
“Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament”
emphasises not only that the ISC is composed of parliamentarians, but
that they are doing the work of Parliament while serving on the
ISC.</hs_Para>

the sensitive and secret information it routinely dealt with made its
constitution worthy of separate and special consideration. Many
parliamentarians are calling for reform to be hastened. I would like to
set out the Opposition’s view. My right hon. Friend the shadow
Home Secretary has called for the ISC to become a Select Committee. We
recognise that, were that to happen and because of the special nature
of its work, we would have to consider the most appropriate way of
appointing a
Chair.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000579" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0002.htm#13030784000579">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:39:40"></hs_TimeCode>

the status of the Committee.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:36:59"></hs_TimeCode>The Bill
provides for a Committee of Parliament, with the rules for its
operation and procedure laid down in statute. Hon. Members will know
that Select Committees are not created by statute, but formed by a
resolution of the House and governed through Standing Orders. I
recently reread the chapter in the book by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:37:23"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Chichester (Mr Tyrie) about the ISC and what reforms were needed.

just like other Select

problem is, however, that in the Bill the Government are establishing
the ISC as a Committee of Parliament, not a Select Committee. We are,
then, in a very different place from the established Select Committee
structures. I note the comments of the hon. Member for Wycombe (Steve
Baker), but amendment 8 would give the ISC the partial look of a Select
Committee, when it actually is not a Select Committee. I also note that
setting out in a Bill how the Commons should elect a Chair is
problematical, because the House is governed by Standing Orders. Will
the Minister say whether it is in order to put in a Bill a mechanism
for how the House should operate?</hs_Para>

second problem with the amendment, which has been touched on by right

give written consent to any Member wishing to stand as Chair. As has
been recognised, that does not happen with any other candidate for a
Select Committee position, although it goes some way to recognising the
special nature of the Committee. It would present lots of problems,
however, as it would mean that the Prime Minister could decide not to
endorse a candidate—an elected MP—as not suitable for a

without Portfolio (Mr Kenneth Clarke):</Member></B> Before dealing with
Government amendment 58, which provides the Government with the
necessary powers to make a financial contribution to the Committee, I
will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:48:53"></hs_TimeCode> add a few
words to the interesting and lively debate that we have had on the
election of the Chair. I will not repeat every argument.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:48:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Wycombe (Steve Baker) put the case robustly and had some
pretty strong support. However, every member of the ISC who is here has
responded and he has had to take on some of the more formidable Members
on both sides of the House. He is also facing the opposition of all
three of the major
parties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000606" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0002.htm#13030784000606">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:49:21"></hs_TimeCode>
assure him that this is not an establishment stitch-up—quite the
reverse. Perhaps the best way of illustrating that is by putting
everything in the context of what we are trying to do in this part of
the Bill. We are making a remarkable advance in strengthening the
powers of this Committee to hold our security and intelligence services
to account. For 20 years the Committee has steadily contributed on that
front, and we are marching forward considerably in the Bill. This part
of it is just as important as the part we debated on Monday, as we are
stepping towards making our security services more accountable to
Parliament. We are enabling judges, in exceptional cases, to take all
the evidence into account and make an adjudication when allegations are
made by individuals; and we are committing to holding judicial
inquiries when worrying circumstances occur—subject, of course,
to those inquiries being able to get under way once police
investigations have been properly completed.</hs_Para>

amendments are important, and they are being proposed in the context of
a situation where all parties agree that they want this Committee to be
a parliamentary Committee and no longer a creature of the Government.
We therefore wish to give it more resources and the structure that
enables it to do an even better job. The only thing that distinguishes
the Committee from a Joint Committee or Select Committee of this House
is this problem of the extremely sensitive nature of some of the
information that it sees. Only where it is unavoidable are we departing
from the normal process of allowing the House of Commons to have a
powerful Committee of its own choosing and to exhort it to do its job

Friends at the Treasury are receiving a very large number of these bids

tell the House that it is not wise to engage in negotiations across the
Floor of the House—it is certainly not wise for a non-Treasury
Minister to do so. For this purpose, in this debate, given those
present, I think we can agree that it is the Government’s
intention that this Committee should be properly resourced to do its
job, which is why we are taking a power to supplement
Parliament’s financing of the Committee. Obviously, the

Clarke:</Member></B> I can say only that I, like my right hon. and hon.
Friends, am fully aware of the Committee’s views on the amount
of funding that it will require. Yet again, I take note of my hon.
Friend’s points on the matter, but I repeat that there is not
much point in my standing here carrying out a negotiation with him or
any other member of the Committee about the figure we arrive at. As
someone who has been at the Treasury, I think that the Government must
combine providing the right resources, which are undoubtedly going to
be more than the Committee has had in the past, with doing a bit of
negotiating about what is the necessary cost. Report stage is not the
place to resolve the final figure.</hs_Para>

the status and nature of the Committee will not be resolved finally by
statute or by debate on the Floor of the House. A long discussion has
been going on to make sure that the Committee has the right status and
structure to do its job effectively, and I think we are very near to
reaching a successful agreement between the Government, the Opposition,
the House authorities in both Houses of Parliament and the current
members of the Intelligence and Security Committee on what its status
should be. I am told that we still have to have further discussions
with the House of Commons Commission and the House Committee in the
House of Lords, but I think everybody is becoming satisfied that we are
resolving that matter. We are also resolving the question of the
accommodation, which probably will have to be on the
Government’s estate rather than the 
<?notus-xml column=1181?>parliamentary estate, for security reasons. I will go into more details
if hon. Members wish, but I realise that we still have quite a lot of
the Bill to deal with. Unless hon. Members are particularly interested
in knowing the precise current status of these discussions, I hope I
may take it that the House is reasonably satisfied that all parties are
going to reach a satisfactory conclusion. I assure the House that the
Government have been anxious throughout to make this Committee
powerful, properly resourced and as much of a parliamentary
body—a body that is accountable and resembles the Select
Committees of the House in every way possible—as it can be. I
think that soon this will all be resolved.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson), although she anticipated
my reply. Government amendment 58 is required in order to give us the
necessary authority to make the financial contributions that we are
going to be arguing about. Amendment (a) seeks to oblige the
Government—or at least expressly to empower them—to make
an additional amount available for the payment of Committee members.
That is not necessary, nor, in my opinion and that of the Government,
is it wise to start putting the matter of the payment of
members of Select Committees or parliamentary Committees into statute,
or implicating the Government directly in that. The payment of members
of this Committee, the Chairman of this Committee and members of Select
Committees is a matter for the House of Commons, the House of Lords and
the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority—from every
point of view, it is best left there. Where the Government have to
initiate all this, it is a feature of all Governments, of all political
complexions, that they can get very politically embarrassed on
questions about the remuneration of any Member of either House. So a
process that leaves the matter with IPSA and the House of Commons is
preferable to the hon. Lady’s amendment.</hs_Para>

I shall touch on the spirit of political debate we have had on the

say that the Wright Committee produced a splendid report.

the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie) first proposed this, but he is not

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:58:49"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for North West Hampshire (Sir George Young), who is
now the Government Chief Whip, on a thing called the democracy
taskforce, advocating the election of Chairman of Select Committees and
producing proposals that were remarkably close to those of the Wright
Committee. I certainly start on the same basis as my colleagues who
have been drawn to this part of the debate, but we have heard all the
arguments why, in this particular case, the proposal does not work. We
are already making the whole thing approved by Parliament. No longer
will the Prime Minister appoint the Chairman; the Chairman will be
elected by those who know—or will know—him best: members
of the ISC.</hs_Para>

realise that something about the candidate has caused the agencies
successfully to blackball him or her. We cannot agree to that. Some of
the Members I am talking about have served in government and would have
been perfectly suitable to be Chair of the Health or Education

made more powerful. Alongside that reform, we are making the
Intelligence and Security Committee far more parliamentary and
powerful. The fact that there is a comparatively detailed difference in
the way that Parliament votes for the Committee members and how the
Chair is elected does not undermine the policy and the Bill.</hs_Para>

Brokenshire:</Member></B> After that interesting debate about the basis
for the important reforms that are taking place to strengthen the
scrutiny, and perhaps some of the principles behind measures in the
Bill relating to the parliamentary ISC, we will now consider a number
of amendments that touch on procedural matters relating to the
functions and operation of the ISC. I apologise to the House in advance
that I will touch on a range of different points. I know that a number
of other amendments have been grouped for this debate, so I will touch
briefly on those and then reflect on points made in the debate. If time
allows, I hope to respond to any further points that may
arise.</hs_Para>

56 and 57 were originally tabled on Report in the other place and Lord
Taylor highlighted that one possible consequence of the change in the
Bill to refer to the Intelligence and Security Committee “of
Parliament” could be that the ISC would have the power to take
evidence on oath. However, further analysis concluded that the
consequence of changing the ISC to a statutory Committee of Parliament
would be that the ISC may, in future, take evidence on oath. Our view
was that, when taken together, the Parliamentary Witnesses Oaths Act
1871, which concerns the power of Committees of the House of Commons to
administer oaths, and its Lords equivalent, the Parliamentary Witnesses
Act 1858, would give the ISC the authority to administer
oaths<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:08:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000640" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784000640">However,
the House services raised a concern with the Government about that
provision and disagreed with our analysis that the change to “of
Parliament” would give the ISC the authority to take evidence on
oath. They believe that the Bill should contain an express power for
the ISC to take such evidence. Following 
<?notus-xml column=1185?>further discussions in response to that point, and with the intent of
putting this issue beyond doubt, we have decided to address the concern
of the parliamentary authorities by tabling amendment 57, which puts
the ISC’s power to take evidence on oath beyond
doubt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:08:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000641" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784000641">The
amendment makes it unnecessary to specify in the Bill who has the power
to administer oaths on behalf of the ISC, as there is no longer any
need to displace the provision in the relevant statutory authorities.
Amendment 56 makes procedure in relation to the ISC hearing evidence on
oath a matter for the ISC to determine, pursuant to paragraph 2(1) of
schedule
1.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000642" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784000642">An
amendment was agreed in Committee that places restrictions on the
ISC’s ability to publish material that it receives in connection
with the exercise of its functions, other than through its reports. We
had a useful debate in Committee, which highlighted some of the issues
and challenges and recognised the need for safeguards to ensure that
sensitive material was not inadvertently disclosed, as well as the need
for the ISC to be able to fulfil its
duties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000643" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784000643">The
amendment addresses a consequence of the ISC being a statutory
Committee of Parliament. In that context, the ISC will have a general
power to publish information, which will sit alongside its express
power to publish reports to Parliament. Absent the restriction, which
is now contained in paragraph 5 of schedule 1 to the Bill, under that
general power the ISC would have been able to publish evidence it has
received other than through its reports to Parliament. Following
concerns raised by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest East (Dr
Lewis), I was able to provide assurance that it was not the
Government’s intention that the amendment would inhibit or limit
some of the existing practices of the ISC, and made a commitment to
look at the language to see whether there was any way of giving further
assurance. I have considered that matter and, as a consequence, we have
tabled amendment
60.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000644" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784000644">Amendment
60 would provide a further gateway allowing publication or disclosure
where the Prime Minister and the ISC agree that this would not cause
prejudice to the functions of the agencies or other Government security
and intelligence bodies. This is the same criterion that is used in
clause 3(4) of the Bill which allows the Prime Minister, after
consultation with the ISC, to require that the ISC must exclude a
matter from any report to Parliament.</hs_Para>

consequence of amendment 60 therefore would be that the ISC would be
able to publish informally—for example, in an open
letter—any information which, ultimately, it would be permitted
to include in its reports to Parliament. As I have said, the criteria
are exactly the same. I recognise the concern to ensure that the
existing arrangements for the ISC and the steps that it takes are
maintained, and that is in part reflected in amendment 73,
tabled by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington
(Sir Malcolm Rifkind) with the support—I believe—of the
existing members of the ISC. While I am sympathetic to the
intentions, and have had several discussions with my right
hon. and learned Friend to work out some suitable language to address
the issues, our view of amendment 73 is that it
would  
<?notus-xml column=1186?>have some unintended consequences. In its current form, the amendment
would widen the net in a way that I suspect the ISC had not
anticipated.</hs_Para>

I appreciate the intention behind the amendment, that phrase suggests
that the prohibition should apply to any person inside or outside
Government who had ever known, or been in a position to know, any
classified information. Unfortunately, the effect of the amendment
would be slightly different. The Official Secrets Act 1989
contains prohibitions of general application, most notably in section
5, and it extends to the whole UK. It even apparently covers some acts
done outside the UK by British citizens or Crown servants. It would
therefore cover information beyond the purview and structure
anticipated. It would cover all information supplied by a person who
has, at any time, been in a position to have access to classified
information. Information supplied to the ISC by such a person will be
covered by the prohibition whether or not it is in fact classified
information, and whether or not it even came to that person in
connection with the role in which they had or could have had access to
classified

my hon. Friend says, but the problem is that in that formulation the
ISC was trying to do away with a similar problem with the
Government’s wording, which suggests that all information that
the ISC receives in private is subject to these restrictions. The whole
point of what we are trying to say is that it should only apply to
classified or sensitive information that we receive in private. Other
information that we receive in private, such as from victims of the 7/7
bombing, should not be restricted in that way. Even though my hon.

the same point still applies to the Government’s
wording.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000649" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784000649"><B><Member ContinuationText="James Brokenshire" PimsId="4751" UID="13030784002092" xid="851" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784002092">James
Brokenshire:</Member></B> My hon. Friend, in his customary way, has
highlighted the genuine challenges that both the Government and ISC
members have had in seeking to frame legislation, which can be a
challenging mechanism within which to express matters effectively. He
rightly points out the evidence given by the families of the victims of
7/7 and those who were sadly caught up in that terrible event. There
have also been discussions of the evidence taken from communication
service providers during the ISC’s recent inquiry into
communications data, including whether the information provided was
sensitive. It is a challenge at times to analyse evidence from third
parties to decide whether evidence is sensitive and thus not suitable
for disclosure. Sometimes that is clear, but sometimes it is
not.</hs_Para>

closely, and I acknowledge that it is difficult to get the right
legislative framework for this area. I wish to reinforce the point made
by the hon. Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis) that part of the
change we are seeking to achieve is to make the Committee more
independent. The consequence of the provision that all 
<?notus-xml column=1187?>information in private will be covered means that
the decisions can be made by the Government rather than the Committee.
We must have a clear delineation of information that belongs to the
Committee, which can then decide what to do with that information. No
matter how hard this is, I hope that the Minister will be creative and
ingenious enough to provide clarity. Such information is not the
Government’s information: it is for the Committee to
decide.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000651" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784000651"><B><Member ContinuationText="James Brokenshire" PimsId="4751" UID="13030784002094" xid="851" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784002094">James
Brokenshire:</Member></B> I hear the point that the right hon. Lady
makes. The intent of the changes in the Bill is to underline the
greater scrutiny and the import of the ISC as a Committee of Parliament
in fulfilling its work, and therefore ensuring that it has an
appropriate mechanism for the publication of information relating to
its deliberations. As we have already discussed, sometimes there are
challenges on evidence given, perhaps in private, and we had some
useful debates in Committee on public hearings. We hope that we will be
able to work with the newly formed ISC to have public evidence hearings
for some evidence that has previously always been held in private. I
acknowledge that most evidence would probably still continue to be

proceedings. As a result, the existing prohibition on the use of
evidence against the witness needs only to deal with use of evidence
in criminal proceedings, since the wider protection given by
the provision introduced by Government amendment 61 will cover use of

the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North will wish to speak to
that. All I will say at this stage—obviously, I will listen to
what the hon. Lady says in her speech—is that we believe there
is a significant issue of compatibility with the European convention on
human rights. For example, it is possible that criminal proceedings
against an individual could hinge on the testimony of a particular
witness who has given inconsistent evidence to the ISC about broadly
the same matters. If approved, this protection in the proposed
amendment would prevent the inconsistent evidence given before the ISC
from being used by the defence in the criminal proceedings to discredit
the
witness.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_07_PT_1/8D74CB28A67B4E276C13004D829102B863BF0CBD" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="7 March 2013">Thursday

notion of a fair trial. By providing the accused with protection
against improper compulsion

amendment would even cover the reports that the ISC lays before
Parliament, which will of course be public documents in any event. That

We have given careful consideration, at length, to the statutory
protections afforded to the ISC through this Bill. He will remember the
debates we had in Committee about issues under the Data Protection Act
and the Freedom of Information Act, along with a number of other
statutory provisions, which we believed needed to be addressed to
afford the ISC a number of additional protections. Although I very much
hear what he says, the Government believe that we have taken this as
far as we can through our amendments—and within the remit of
article 6 of the ECHR, for example—to afford those protections
and frame the provisions. I note the concern he has raised; all I would
say is that the Government have taken some additional steps—on
things that the existing Committee does not currently have—in
how the Bill is framed to move the Committee as close as we can, within
the framework of law, to provide the relevant protections.</hs_Para>

members of the ISC who are here today will recognise, consideration was
given to how one might approach the issue of parliamentary privilege.
Indeed, there was a lengthy debate in the other place on that issue.
There is a broad recognition that trying to define parliamentary
privilege in statute would open a whole new array of issues. Indeed, I
do not think this House would welcome an attempt to frame the
privileges that reside in this place by way of an Act of Parliament,
which might be subject to further litigation and challenge, which not
only might have an effect simply on the ISC but could have a limiting
effect on parliamentary privilege for broader issues in this House.
When considering this issue, everyone involved in the examination of
the Bill thought that that would be a very unfortunate step to take.

by framing matters within existing legislative

me turn briefly to amendment 55, which concerns the ISC’s
ability to oversee operational matters. With the amendments, the Bill
now provides for three routes by which the ISC may consider particular
operational matters. The first is where the Prime Minister and the ISC
are agreed that the matter is of significant national interest and not
part of any ongoing intelligence and security operations. The second
route is where the Government request the ISC to consider a matter
notwithstanding the fact that those criteria are not met. The third is
where the ISC’s consideration of an operational matter is
limited to considering information provided to it voluntarily by the
agencies or another Department.</hs_Para>

additional route was provided to meet a further concern of the
ISC—that the requirement that both the ISC and the Prime
Minister should be satisfied that the criteria for oversight of
operational matters had been met risked slowing the provision of
information to the ISC on routine operational matters. Obviously
that already happens now; the concern was that not framing
the third limb might hinder it. We therefore made an amendment in
Committee to address that third point. The key issue is that, as has
been highlighted, for the first two categories there is the ability to
require further information to be given, whereas for the third
limb—because, in essence, information is provided
without being compelled—those further requirements
did not operate. That is why the structure has been framed in this
way.</hs_Para>

the reason for a further amendment to try to clarify rights of

Blears:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
explicit recognition of the fact that the Committee has had access to
operational information for some considerable time, despite the fact
that no such provision is in the current legislation. The Committee
remains concerned about the use of the word
“voluntarily”, and I had hoped that the Government would
withdraw it from the Bill. It goes against the whole spirit of the
direction in which we are moving, from the right to request information
to the right to require it. That is a small change on the face of it,
but it is actually a big, transformational step. I do not think that
the word “voluntarily” is necessary in the Bill; it is
superfluous and its retention goes against the direction of travel, in
that the agencies will voluntarily be able to decide whether to provide
information. That is not the relationship that we currently have with
the agencies, let alone the one that we want for the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:39:22"></hs_TimeCode>. I ask
the Minister to think again. Why does he want the word
“voluntarily” in there when we acknowledge that for the
issues in question, this is a matter of requesting information just as
we do now?</hs_Para>

already receives information on ongoing operational matters, and that
would fall short of the requirements in the first two limbs that I have
described. She will have seen the Government’s amendment that
seeks to reflect the existing work that takes place and the information
that is provided. As always with legislation, this is a question of the
wording and the way in which matters are interpreted by lawyers, as
well as by Members of Parliament. The provision is in no way intended
to cut across the Committee’s existing work or the existing flow
of information when a request for further clarification has been made.
It is intended to provide a distinction between the first two limbs,
which will contain an element of further requirement, and the third
limb, in which information will be provided because it has been
requested rather than required, and in which further investigations
will be limited to using the information that has been so

this issue—certainly from members of the Committee. The use of
the word “voluntarily” creates entirely the wrong

ISC has sometimes received

do not think that sub judice information should be excluded from the
ISC’s hearings, because that might may prevent it from seeing
particularly important information. As significant procedures exist to
ensure that information will be protected, we should not worry about
the ISC seeing the information if it would assist it. We also feel that
the ISC should have access to information held by previous
Administrations, for two main reasons. First, the matters that the ISC
investigates are rarely politically sensitive, although they will be
sensitive in other ways. Secondly, the ISC will often be able to
investigate an issue only after a change of Administration. Its role is

I go into the details of the difference between amendment 76 and the

important. 
<?notus-xml column=1196?>They are important because we want witnesses to be able to give full and
frank evidence to the Committee, and we want the Committee to be able
to receive evidence in confidence. It may be helpful to compare the
provisions governing the ISC to the provisions governing Select
Committees. Evidence given to Select Committees, whether written or
oral, is subject to parliamentary privilege, which means that the
evidence cannot be used in any court proceedings against the witness or
anyone else.</hs_Para>

Witnesses giving evidence to the ISC are likely to be particularly

covered by the Official Secrets Act and, technically, an offence would
be committed every time a witness exceeded the explicit permission they
had been given, which could be frequent.</hs_Para>

may not be the only restriction on a witness’s ability to give

witness’s employment contract and the civil service code. Such
restrictions have the potential to pose two problems to the ISC. First,
they could slow down or prohibit witnesses where there is no genuine
need for them not to be able to divulge evidence but it is not clear
they have the legal authority. Secondly, they could prevent the
Committee from taking evidence from whistleblowers. In recognition of
these difficulties, in Committee the Government tabled amendments
introducing statutory protection for witnesses, exempting evidence they
provided to the Committee from civil, disciplinary or criminal
proceedings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:55:26"></hs_TimeCode>.

I want to ask the Minister about the status of the hypothetical
document to which I referred. Evidence accepted by a Select Committee
is not admissible in a court of law, but what about evidence given to
the ISC? The Government’s amendment protects witnesses, but in
the case to which I was referring the witness would not be identifiable
as the information would be given anonymously. That is often the case
with whistleblowers: they are protected in the Select Committee system
because their evidence is privileged, but under the Bill as drafted
they would appear to be protected only if they had been recognised by
the ISC as a witness. If they were not identified as the witness who
provided the evidence, the evidence given to the ISC could be used
against them in proceedings.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:00:58"></hs_TimeCode> is why the
Opposition have tabled

74 is about pre-appointment hearings for agency heads. The
previous Labour Government introduced pre-appointment hearings for a

to agency heads. Select Committees now hold pre-appointment hearings
for a range of positions, and in keeping with our desire to make the

give it that
role.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000718" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784000718">Long<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:00:37"></hs_TimeCode>

positive consequence of introducing pre-appointment hearings is that it
will encourage senior members of the agencies to foster strong
relationships with the Committee in preparation for their possible
future hearings. Such hearings were suggested in the other place and we
discussed them in Committee, too. I believe the responses from the
Minister in the other place and in Committee were rather weak. The
Governments argued that such hearings were not necessary because agency
heads were essentially civil servants and subject to the normal civil
service recruitment rules.</hs_Para>

that argument might be technically correct, it fails to realise the two
special characteristics of agency heads. First, they have far more
autonomy than most civil servants not only in how they structure their
organisation but in operational matters. The decisions they make are of
a different order of magnitude from those made by normal civil
servants. They make decisions that can be a matter of life or death,
either for their staff or for people in the UK.</hs_Para>

there is a more confusing line of accountability. If the permanent
secretary of the Home Office makes a decision or a mistake, the Home
Secretary will be required to answer for it. She appears
before Parliament on a regular basis and the decisions made by her
Department are in the public eye. There is no such clear line of
accountability for agency heads. As the noble Lord Henley explained in
the other place, the Prime Minister has overall responsibility within
government for intelligence and security matters and for the agencies.
Day-to-day ministerial responsibility for the Security Service lies
with the Home Secretary and that for the Secret Intelligence Service
and GCHQ lies with the Foreign Secretary. The Home Secretary is
accountable to Parliament, and therefore to the public, for the work of
the Security Service; similarly, the Foreign Secretary has his
accountability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:04:05"></hs_TimeCode>.
Only rarely are any such figures called on to account for the work of
the agencies, however, so we must put greater emphasis and
scrutiny on the person doing the implementation behind the scenes. I
shall therefore want to test the opinion of the House on
amendment 74.</hs_Para>

of staff of either agency. Nevertheless, I understand that an
individual, who may or may not be a member of an intelligence agency,
can volunteer to appear before the ISC and the Prime Minister or agency
head would require an injunction to prevent them from appearing,

that sufficient measures have not been taken to empower the Committee

situation in which some of our proceedings that involve statements
—not from witnesses, but from Committee members—that in
the ordinary course of events might be regarded as defamatory may
result in court proceedings being taken against members in a way that
would not be possible with members of a Select Committee in analogous
circumstances? If we could end up in such a situation, the Government
need to consider that problem very seriously indeed and do something

the question of pre-appointment hearings, I do not believe that the
Committee has taken a corporate view as such, but one point
must be made, and made strongly: this would add to the work load of the
Committee’s staff. The Committee, as has been made
crystal clear today, is already grotesquely understaffed by comparison
with comparable committees and organisations in this country and in
Europe. Therefore, were we to take on that further burden,
we would definitely need better proposals for resourcing it than those
that are currently

Opposition are quite right to resist amendment 71, because
individual complaints against the agencies, such as that involving
Binyam Mohamed, are not the responsibility of the ISC; they fall within

on the question of the Osmotherly rules, I am glad that the matter will
be dealt with one way or another. We would prefer it to be set out in
the Bill, but otherwise in the memorandum of understanding, because the
ISC frequently needs access to the papers of a previous
Administration, for example, or has to deal with matters that are sub
judice, and we cannot row backwards from that situation. Subject to
those comments, we are very pleased with the progress the Bill has made

Lucas:</Member></B> Amendment 71 seeks to provide some form of recourse
for people who have been defamed by the UK security services and to
ensure that part of the Intelligence and Security Committee’s
remit is to investigate such claims and, where necessary, ensure that
they are corrected. I listened with interest to what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:12:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for New Forest East (Dr Lewis) said about this not necessarily being
the right forum. I am happy to be advised on that, but right now it
feels that there is no 
<?notus-xml column=1201?>appropriate forum. The situation of Shaker Aamer, for example, which I
will set out in more detail shortly, demonstrates that. If the hon.
Gentleman can enlighten me on how we can make existing forums work more
effectively, for example in this case, I would be very interested to
hear <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:12:45"></hs_TimeCode>what he has

ability of the security services effectively to say what they like
about anyone, often resulting in serious consequences for the
individual concerned, is at present largely unchecked. As John Cooper
QC said in a legal opinion on precisely that issue, the security
services are “presently allowed to literally say what they will
to achieve their own ends, whether or not those ends are legal,
democratic or in accordance with the rule of law. In addition to this,
those who indulge in these activities are completely unaccountable to
the citizen, to the Government, and even to a quasi-regulator or body
charged with their oversight, such as the ISC. What is more, the
victims of such defamation are likely to be the most vulnerable
individuals, most likely detained under the most restrictive of
circumstances. In essence, they are prisoners defamed by their
controllers and captors. That is neither right, nor
acceptable.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000739" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784000739">I
want to give a real-life example to help illustrate why I believe that
this is so important. British resident Shaker Aamer, whose wife and
children are British citizens and live in south London, has been held
in Guantanamo for more than 11 years, despite having been cleared for
release by both the Bush and Obama Administrations. The Foreign
Secretary has raised the case with the US on several occasions, and the

the US has cleared him for release, a complicated process including
multiple federal agencies, and the UK Government have made it clear
that they want him to come home, one cannot help asking why Mr Aamer
remains detained in Guantanamo, never having been charged or tried for
any crimes. The conclusion that his US lawyer has reached is that
Britain’s intelligence agencies have been defaming Mr Aamer to
the US, passing on false information and accusing him of
extremism, and that is what is holding up his
release.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784000741" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784000741">Mr
Aamer is being deprived of his liberty on the basis of lies
being told about him that he is unable to challenge. He has therefore
begun defamation action against the security services—action
that could be pushed into a secret court under part 2 of the Bill,
leaving him once again unable to confront his accusers or to challenge
the evidence used by the Government against him.

would argue that, at the very least, it is important that a duty be
placed on the Intelligence and Security Committee fully to investigate
such claims. That would not be a solution in itself, but it could
provide some small measure of recourse for those such as Mr Aamer who
find themselves in the gravest of positions as a result of information
passed behind their back.</hs_Para>

served on the Intelligence and Security Committee for about 11 years
from its very beginning. It was a slow and painful task to get the
first generation of heads of agencies and civil servants from
Departments to understand the Committee’s need for a deep
understanding of the relevant matters in order for us to do our job
effectively. Subsequent generations of heads of agencies were ready to
involve the Committee more closely and to bring up operational matters,
whatever the statute said. It did not take me long to realise that it
was not possible for members of the Committee to do their job properly
unless they understood how various kinds of operations were conducted
and the constraints and problems faced by the agencies. In particular,
it was not possible to discharge an important responsibility without an

of the purposes of the ISC, where Members of both Houses of Parliament
look closely at the work of agencies, is to give people on the

observing the agencies sufficiently closely to give confidence that
their work is within the framework not only of the law, but of the
ethics and principles by which we try to run our country. The
background is that agencies were often accused of doing precisely the
opposite in years gone by. Unless we can give people that confidence
and say, “Yes, I have looked very closely at this matter and I
do not think you need to be concerned about it,” the Committee
will not be discharging properly one of its most important
roles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:22:05"></hs_TimeCode>. We found

fully understand how the Government have arrived at the word
“voluntarily”. It would have been absurd if the wording

something is going wrong when it needs to do so, or that it can be

then, words are being put on paper and when that happens, as we have
discovered, simple, practical and sensible ways of doing things may

becomes easier for the head of an agency or, at least as

shall respond first to
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:25:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) and her amendment 71. As others
have said, the essentially judicial function she seeks does not sit
well within the ISC, which is intended to be a Committee of Parliament.
It is not for the ISC to consider, much less determine, individual
complaints about the intelligence services, especially given that there
is already a body that can consider these matters and which we believe
is well equipped to do so. Right hon. and hon. Members have highlighted
the work of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which is the appropriate
route through which complaints should be made.</hs_Para>

case remains a high priority for the UK Government and we continue to

consider the implications for Mr Aamer’s case of the
2013 National Defence Authorisation Act. Discussions continue with
senior officials within the US Administration. The Foreign Secretary
raised Mr Aamer’s case numerous times with former Secretary of
State Clinton and will continue to do so with Secretary of State Kerry.

amendment 74 and pre-appointment hearings, I do not wish to go back
over the lengthy debate we had in Committee on this issue. I can only
restate several points I made then: pre-appointment hearings are a
relatively new phenomenon in the UK; the Cabinet Office has published
guidance on the process to be followed for such hearings; and at the
moment the list of posts subject to those hearings relates to public
bodies, such as the chair of Ofcom or the Social Security Advisory
Committee. The pre-appointment process has never been used for the
appointment of civil servants. The heads of the intelligence and
security agencies are permanent secretary-level civil servants, so the
recruitment process is expected to follow the process for the
appointment of civil servants of such seniority. We judge that this
continues to be the appropriate
mechanism.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:29:41"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

Osmotherly rules, I made the point in Committee that the powers to
withhold information from the ISC have been used sparingly and that we
expect them to continue to be used only in exceptional circumstances.
The Osmotherly rules set out categories of information, including
information on officials’ personal views, as distinct from the
views of Ministers, on policy options; information that could be
supplied only after carrying out substantial research or at excessive
cost; information about matters that are sub judice; and the papers of
a previous Administration. The provisions in the Bill are necessary to
safeguard the long-standing conventions that are reflected in the
Osmotherly rules. We judge that the provisions, although they have been
used only sparingly, remain

whether it can compel witnesses to attend. At the moment, it cannot

to the Committee. That is a powerful provision and an important step.
In practice, the ISC, the agencies and others discuss and agree on who
is the appropriate person to appear and give evidence on a particular
point. The current practice is for the ISC to have regular oral
evidence sessions with Ministers, agency heads and other senior

first point to reflect on, in considering the Bill in its entirety, is
the debt we owe to our security and intelligence services.
Unfortunately, we face unprecedented threats at different times from
various enemies, both at home and abroad. It is extremely important
that we have highly efficient intelligence and security services to
protect the lives of our citizens and the normal civilised business of
the country. We have to support the intelligence services on which we
rely so heavily.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030784001216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001216"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:52:21"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly,
this country upholds the highest standards of human rights in this area
of its activities, as in other areas. We all expect those who work in
our intelligence and security services to have the same regard to the
values that we are defending as everyone else does—that we do
have regard to the rule of law. The British Government are, and, as far
I am aware, always have been, firmly against the use of torture, firmly
against unlawful and extraordinary rendition, and firmly against
practices on which some of our allies take a more relaxed 
<?notus-xml column=1211?>view. I would like to think that the British intelligence and security
services are not only among the best in the world, but uphold much
higher standards in the way they conduct themselves than is true of the
vast majority of the nation states of the world.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030784001217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001217"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:53:21"></hs_TimeCode>The
vast majority of Members agree that we are grateful to the security
services, and that it is important that they are held as accountable as
everyone else. We follow another principle that the Government, as far
as possible, hold dear, which is that of transparency: avoiding
unnecessary secrecy wherever possible, and being as open in our
dealings with the public in every aspect of our public life. Plainly,
that has to be modified to a certain extent to protect the absolutely
essential secrecy that our security services need, and which the people
who co-operate with them, the agents who help us and the various people
we have to rely on throughout the world, need.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030784001218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001218"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:54:30"></hs_TimeCode>I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:54:12"></hs_TimeCode>
believe that the part of the Bill that we will look back on with
greatest pleasure is the considerable steps we are taking to give extra
powers to the Intelligence and Security Committee. In ensuring that the
security services are held accountable, accountability to Parliament is
extremely important. I will not rehearse all the arguments, which have
taken most of today, but the Committee is now to be truly a Committee
of Parliament. The House of Commons will be able to elect the
membership—on the nomination of the Prime Minister, but members
will be appointed by parliamentary vote. The Prime Minister’s
nomination is a necessary precaution in case some unknown feature of a
Member of Parliament’s background might make him or her a less
suitable member of the Committee than would otherwise be the
case.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030784001219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001219">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:55:56"></hs_TimeCode>
we have seen over the years, the Intelligence and Security Committee is
one of the most important Committees of the House. Its membership, not
surprisingly, tends to comprise heavyweight individuals from all parts
of the House of Commons, with a membership that is highly respected in
all parts of the House for the work it tries to do. However, I will not
repeat what my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:55:31"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department set
out in the debate. We have examined in detail the various processes
that we now have in hand to enable the Committee to require evidence to
be given to it and to hold the security services thoroughly to account,
in all the sensible circumstances that can be managed, while at the
same time ensuring that no risk is posed to national safety and
national security.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030784001220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001220"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:55:57"></hs_TimeCode>The
most controversial part of the Bill is the one we debated on Monday, in
which we seek to make the security and intelligence services more
accountable to the judiciary and courts of this country, particularly
as in the last few years a growing number of people have alleged before
our courts malpractice against the security services and sought
substantial damages for events in which they say our security services
were complicit. Things are plainly unsatisfactory as they stand, and we
have all quoted many distinguished members of the judiciary to
illustrate that. Opponents persuade themselves that they are so against
the principle of closed proceedings of any kind that they wish to keep
the present law, which they regard as satisfactory.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030784001221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001221">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:55:00"></hs_TimeCode>
am afraid I am still at the stage where I do not see how on earth we
can say that the present law is satisfactory. People bring claims and
are prepared to give evidence, as they are perfectly entitled to, in
support of them. 
<?notus-xml column=1212?>The nature of the evidence that the security and intelligence
services and the Government would wish to produce to defend some of
those claims is of the kind that cannot possibly be given in open
court. The courts have made it clear that sometimes there is indeed
scope for closed proceedings, but that they cannot be held through an
ordinary civil action unless Parliament has decided the circumstances
in which these should be allowed.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030784001222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001222"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:57:36"></hs_TimeCode>We
already have closed proceedings in this country in several
areas—there are about 14 instances of different jurisdictions
where we have closed proceedings, largely in the immigration field. It
is of course less than perfect justice, because the only possible
challenge to the evidence is from special advocates who have been
security cleared, and they are not as free as they would be in an open
court case to take full instructions from their clients. Everybody
knows that, but in fact they have more weight as advocates than most
people appreciate. Given the circumstances, most judges are prepared to
listen to challenges, realising that they have to bear in mind that
they need to be particularly scrupulous, because there are limitations
in how far the evidence is being tested before them.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030784001223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001223">The
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:58:25"></hs_TimeCode>best test is
that special advocates win in closed sessions—I have been fond
of citing one or two instances as these proceedings have gone along.
The last case that the Government lost—that of Abu Qatada, which
caused a tremendous public controversy and still is—was lost
before a judge, Mr Justice Mitting, who does not have the reputation of
being a melting-heart liberal. Abu Qatada won in closed proceedings in
a British court, defeating my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and
the Government in our attempts to remove him for a trial in Jordan.
Obviously the judge was not satisfied that torture would not play a
part in the proceedings if Abu Qatada was sent there. The idea that
Ministers have the ability to present things to a judge in
circumstances where the closed advocates have no hope is mistaken. What
we will get is a judgment, whereas what we get at the moment is
silence.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030784001224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001224"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:59:27"></hs_TimeCode>In
the main, we have been attacked by people who say how much they deplore
secrecy and silence, yet the effect of being granted a public interest
immunity certificate, which is the only course open to Ministers
wishing to withhold evidence that could damage national security, is
total silence. The evidence cannot be used by the claimants, cannot be
taken into account by the judge and is not available to the defence. As
we all know, cases are being brought with increasing regularity in
which the Government have no alternative but to offer no defence,
because no evidence can be called, and then to start negotiating the
amount money to be paid in
compensation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:03:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784001225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001225">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:00:26"></hs_TimeCode>
have never given exact figures for the compensation
involved—although some have appeared following interviews with
me—because the claimants usually want to enter into
confidentiality agreements on the settlement. However, there is no harm
in telling the House that millions of pounds are being paid out to
claimants whose cases have never been tested or challenged. I make no
apology for repeating my suspicion—one that is held by most
objective people—that there is a serious risk that some of the
money is finding its way to very undesirable quarters, and probably to
terrorist groups
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:00:52"></hs_TimeCode>in the case of
certain plaintiffs. I am not talking about all of them, and I will not
say which of them this applies 
<?notus-xml column=1213?>to—that was never decided by the courts—but some of those
people will have links to organisations that will have some of that
money on them.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:01:03"></hs_TimeCode> I
do not think that the public understand why the Government
cannot defend themselves. That gives rise to genuine
disquiet among perfectly intelligent liberal members of the general
public.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030784001226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001226">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:01:24"></hs_TimeCode>
have had a long, satisfactory debate, during which the Bill has been
transformed in both Houses. We are still not in total agreement on the
wording, but we agree on the principles. The judge will have the widest
possible discretion to decide that he is going to hear evidence in
closed proceedings only when it is relevant and has to be heard to
decide the case, and when it would damage national security if it were
given to the wider world. Furthermore, the just and effective
administration of justice will have to be served by hearing it in
private. I will not repeat all the arguments that were put
on Monday.</hs_Para>

overall effect of the Bill will be to improve the reassurance that we
can give to the public and to the world that we uphold the highest
standards in this country, and that we seek to maintain them by holding
accountable those who work on our behalf. I believe that the outcome is
not only legally sound but an eminently sensible common-sense solution
to the obvious practical problems that arise when we wish to combine
the rule of law with the protection of national safety and security. I
commend the Bill to the House.</hs_Para>

to me earlier. He has again made the assertion that the
Government are being forced to settle cases, but his assertion would
have more appeal if they did not regularly settle cases before
exhausting all their options and before applying for a strike-out. I do
not think that his admonitions about people seeking confidentiality
agreements to hide the amount of compensation that they were getting
could apply to Mr Belhaj, for example. The Minister is to some extent
peddling damaged goods again, and that is regrettable as he is one of
the last defenders of human rights in his party. I thought he might
have had a little more to say about article 6 and the common law right

is substantial agreement on two parts of Bill. Part 1 improves the
scrutiny of our intelligence services—something that has come a
long way since they first emerged from the shadows in 1994. A point
well made by ISC members on the Public Bill Committee was that there is
a developing relationship between Parliament and the security services,
which tries to balance the need for scrutiny with the effectiveness of
the vital job those agencies do. The Bill takes that a step forward in
enhancing accountability: it is too little and too slow for some, but
it is moving in the right
direction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784001234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001234">The
clauses reforming the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction seek to re-assert
the control principle and to protect the security interests of allied
countries—not only in their interest but ours, since the success
of our security services relies on close working relationships with
their equivalents overseas. Thus far we agree, but how can that explain
the definition of sensitive information in clause 15 as information
relating to “an intelligence service” rather than to
“a foreign intelligence service” as our amendment
proposed? It looks like another attempt gratuitously to extend the
protection given to secret information for reasons other than those
given. It is a pity we did not have time to debate that matter
further—perhaps even now, the Government will, of their own
volition, look at that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:06:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784001235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001235">That
brings me to the contentious part of the Bill—that relating to
closed material procedures—which regrettably leaves this House
in a far worse condition than it was when it arrived. Not only have the
key safeguards added to the Bill by the other place on the advice of
the JCHR been removed, but new and alarming departures from the normal
standards of civil justice have been put on the face of the Bill. This
has been done as late and as obliquely as the Government could get away
with. I hope their lordships will when the Bill returns to them later
this month reimpose their necessary amendments and fillet the unwelcome
additions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784001236" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001236">There

secret courts that the Government have rejected, but in brief we have
had 18 months of feigned 
<?notus-xml column=1215?>U-turns, compromises and Pauline conversions from the Minister without
Portfolio. In the end, they amounted to two important but not
fundamental ameliorations. The door was opened to judicial discretion
by accepting the Lords amendment on “may” instead of
“must” at the entry to clause 6. Citizens will, after a
series of wobbles and changes of heart, now have the same status as the
Secretary of State to apply to enter a CMP. The two core changes sought
by the Opposition in support of the other place have been firmly
rejected: judicial balancing between the interests of national security
and fair and open justice at the gateway to the CMP; and requiring the
court to look at other more open, more tested and more equal ways of
proceeding to trial before invoking the CMP—the so-called last
resort.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784001237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0003.htm#13030784001237">Perhaps
unsurprisingly, the Government were also unwilling to concede
considering public interest immunity as a first option, judicial
balancing of evidence once the CMP process was under way or to support
a sensible renewal clause designed to give parliamentary scrutiny to
this botched-together part of the Bill. These are all matters to which
their lordships, including some of the finest legal brains in the
country, will wish to address their minds. I hope and trust they will
renew their attempt to make this part of the Bill work in the interests
both of national security and open and equal justice. I hope—I
am sure—they will not be deceived by the Government’s
flimsy attempts to make purported concessions on these

Committee, purports to challenge the CMP process continually and

right about that, there are other ramifications. The gisting
requirements—which, as the special advocates have pointed out in

the court to consider, not to require, a gist, and thus allow a case to
be decided entirely on the basis of evidence that one party has had no
right to challenge. In addition, a gist need only be made of material
that is disclosable. That presents the possibility of a CMP being
granted on the basis of non-disclosable material, and the court not
even being asked to consider whether it is necessary to gist that
material to the open lawyer or client.</hs_Para>

I do not like part 2 of the Bill. Quite often we have to pass
legislation that we do not like, however, because in our judgment it is
necessary to do so, as the balance favours having the legislation. That
is the principle on which I base my conclusion in this case, for which
I will not be the darling of the Liberal Democrat conference in

consequences of the Government’s decision to close the Royal Air
Force base there, which has been a source of great pride and has made
an enormous contribution to the life of the community. What I will say
and do is contrary to the expressed—and potential—views

of most thoughtful people on this side of the argument about closed
material proceedings, the consideration is not that there is an ideal
answer, or even a satisfactory answer, but that all we can do is choose
the least worst answer. To make that least worst answer to the problem
more palatable, the strengthening of the ISC was added to the
Bill.</hs_Para>

strengthened and increased role. For those who did not hear me say it
earlier, I remind the House that the ISC has only eight members of

unfavourably with the staff support for other Committees and inquiries,
such as the 14 staff members for the detainee inquiry, which had only

ISC is currently funded to the tune of £750,000 a year. In the
impact assessment published with the Bill, the Government cited a
revised figure of £1.3 million that reflected their estimation
of what the ISC would need to carry out the extra duties that are being
placed on it in order to reassure the public that proper scrutiny is
being carried out. The figure that is actually being offered is
£850,000—an increase of just over one seventh on the
existing budget. This would continue to leave the ISC worse off than
all its international counterparts and worse off than the bodies that I
listed. This is our last opportunity publicly to press the Government
to commit to a substantive increase in resources. I hope that the

assessment will not be discarded when it is convenient to do so once

that sort of expertise would be available to people on either side of
the argument if we had undermined, restructured and, in effect,
destroyed the upper House in the way that was so irresponsibly

Much of the tone and rhetoric of the debate on the Floor of the House

had been discussing criminal proceedings, but we are talking about
civil proceedings. The problem that we have to come to terms with is
that, because the Government are unable to defend themselves in civil

while others may be of doubtful character—they end up spending

moving in the right direction, but there is further to go. I have

hon. Friend the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis). We all know that
the Bill is about civil cases and not criminal cases, but as he well
knows, because he has been a litigant, civil cases are very important
and can affect a person’s whole life. They should therefore be
treated with great
seriousness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784001313" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0004.htm#13030784001313">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:54:01"></hs_TimeCode>
should not approach debates where human rights are involved by saying
that the litigants belong to a class of people whom we find
reprehensible. It may be that 
<?notus-xml column=1227?>they are reprehensible, but that argument is often used about
minorities. It is used at the moment about Islamists and it would have
been used about the IRA in the 20th century, the civilian
German nationals who were interned in 1940, the Fenians in the 19th
century, the French earlier than that, the Jesuits in the 17th century,
the Chartists and John
Wilkes.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:54:59"></hs_TimeCode> So let

should sometimes imagine how we would feel if we were the litigant. Let
us suppose that we felt that something terrible had happened and our
rights had been infringed in some way. How would we like a procedure
whereby we went to court and halfway through the defence suddenly said,
“This is all very secret and we cannot share it with you”
and the judge said, “Okay, I’ll adjourn that and listen
to the evidence on your behalf Member for New Forest East. You can
trust me. I am appointed by the state. Or perhaps we can get some
barrister appointed by the state and he can hear it”?</hs_Para>

us then suppose that a few hours or days later the judge says,
“You haven’t heard this evidence against you, but I think
your case doesn’t stand up.” What happens when he sums up
at the end of the case, as of course in public he cannot adduce all
this secret evidence? How would hon. Members feel if they were the
litigant? Would they feel that they had received justice? What does it
say for our worldwide reputation if serious allegations about torture
and so on are made and a large part of the case—and the reason
why the litigant did not win his case—is determined on the basis
of secret evidence?</hs_Para>

what evidence to submit to defend themselves. Is it really beyond the
wit of man to defend these cases satisfactorily, for the most part? A
question of the identity of agents may arise, but nobody is suggesting
that the agent has to be brought before the court of law, or to have
himself or his practices identified. Surely there are ways in which the

Nash</B> (Airdrie and Shotts) (Lab):</Member> I am very pleased to
secure the debate, and to have the opportunity to exchange views with
the Minister on the problems still being faced by parents assessed by
the Child Support Agency under the 1993 scheme. I will concentrate on
how this has severely affected one of my constituents, about whose case
I have already been in correspondence with the Minister and the
Department. It may seem odd to request a debate at the moment, when the
Government have recently launched the most recent incarnation of the
Child Support Agency. However, I would like to stress from the outset
that I do not believe my constituent’s experience is an isolated
one, and wish to take this chance to explore what might be a larger,
underlying
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T17:12:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

mood of cross-party co-operation that I wish to conduct the debate, as
it would not be fair or helpful to blame any one party or Government
for the numerous IT policy failings that have occurred in the
administration of the Child Support Agency, from its inception to the
present day, under different Governments. The contentious issue of
ensuring that parents support their children after the breakdown of a
relationship has undergone repeated, technical and bureaucratic
tinkering by successive Governments.</hs_Para>

established in 1993, the CSA was originally designed simply to collect
and enforce the child maintenance payments of non-resident parents on a
formulaic basis. Government intervention was necessary following a long
line of failures by the courts to establish a fair and consistent
process of addressing the situation. However, the system created out of
the Child Support Act 1991 was a product of the previous recession. As
a result, it has been widely accused of being driven with the aim of
saving the Government money, rather than collecting it for the children
to whom it was owed. I remember only too well CSA letters dropping
through my own letterbox as a child, and I can tell the Minister that
the content of those letters pleased neither my mum nor my dad. Despite
repeated attempts to fix the problems of the CSA, I find it
unacceptable that there are still people being assessed under the same
system that could not help my own family more than 20 years
ago.</hs_Para>

constituent, Gordon Russell, was first assessed by the CSA in April
2002, and he has paid what the CSA assessed he was due to pay up until
very recently. Because of the date of his original assessment, his
payments were assessed under the 1993 scheme. This week the 2003 scheme
is 10 years old, and yet Mr Russell has never been allowed
to change over to it. He and I have calculated that, had he been
reassessed under the 2003 scheme when he expected to be in 2004, he
would have paid more than £23,000 less in child maintenance than
he has paid as a result of being assessed under the 1993
scheme.</hs_Para>

many others.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T17:14:27"></hs_TimeCode> It
is the Government’s responsibility to ensure that policies are,
and are seen to be, equitable—that is, that two 
<?notus-xml column=1232?>people in almost identical situations should never find themselves in
very different financial positions solely as a result of Government
policy. However, by running the 1993 scheme concurrently with the 2003
scheme, that is precisely what has happened to Mr Russell, who is
expected to pay almost double the amount paid by others in exactly the
same financial and personal situation who were assessed post-March
2003.</hs_Para>

Russell contacted my office early in my parliamentary career. He is a
non-resident parent of two children. Initially, following his
separation from his wife in 2000, they agreed a sum for maintenance
between themselves. They arrived at it after he contacted the Child
Support Agency for advice on how to proceed. He says he was told that
the system was very complex and was about to be amended. With that in
mind, Mr Russell and his ex-wife used the 1993 scheme as a calculator,
but at that point the CSA was not directly involved in the assessment
or the administration of the payments. In 2002, for various reasons,
that voluntary agreement broke down and the CSA was contacted by Mr
Russell’s ex-wife. At that point a new CSA case was opened and
an assessment made under the 1993 scheme of the time. The resulting
calculation was a monthly payment by Mr Russell of just under
£585. Again, the CSA was not involved in the administration of
the payments, which I understand Mr Russell made on a
voluntary basis to his ex-wife.</hs_Para>

spring 2003, Mr Russell received a letter from Doug Smith, the chief
executive of the Child Support Agency, informing him of the new
assessment scheme—I expect it was sent to many people in his
position. The letter

introduction of the new scheme will be a complex task, which must be
planned and handled very carefully. When the Government is sure
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T17:19:30"></hs_TimeCode> the changes
are working well for new applications, I will write to you again. I

you.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13030784001576" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0004.htm#13030784001576">It
is clear that Mr Russell and the others who received these letters were
continually reassured by the CSA that their cases would eventually be
transferred to the new scheme, but that never transpired. The reasons
given for the failure of the administration of the 1993 scheme centred
on an over-complicated calculations process, an inadequate enforcement
procedure and multiple IT failures. The 2003 scheme was sadly also
plagued by IT problems. I understand that one issue for the new system
was that cases from the old scheme could not be transferred to the new
scheme’s simpler assessment process. That resulted in the CSA
being left to administer two different systems concurrently, in a
twin-track process. When Doug Smith departed the CSA, not long after he
wrote that letter, he

eight years Mr Russell paid the amount agreed with the CSA under the
1993 scheme. His expectation that he would be transferred to the new
scheme was never met. In 2012, Mr Russell’s daughter
celebrated her 19th birthday, which under the CSA’s
rules meant that 
<?notus-xml column=1233?>his maintenance payment for his children needed to be recalculated. He
was told at that point that his monthly payment would be £511
for only one child. He challenged that figure, as it was only
£74 less than he was paying for two children. As a result, a new
assessment was made, still under the 1993 scheme, which concluded that
he was in fact due to pay £618 a month—more than he was
previously paying for both children. At that point Mr
Russell decided he had to take a stand on this inequity, as he
felt—indeed, he has been advised—that he should be on the
2003 scheme, under which he would be paying almost half that amount. In
fact, he could no longer afford to pay that much money and felt that he
should not have to. At that point he took the decision to pay the sum
of £350 a month, which was what he calculated he would be paying
if he had been assessed under the 2003 scheme. As a result, Mr Russell
started to accrue arrears, and only two weeks ago, his wages were
arrested.</hs_Para>

do not see how the Minister or anyone else can argue that that is a
fair system. It is unfair to the non-resident parent who pays double
the amount, and it is unfair to the children and parents who receive
less under the same scheme. I would appreciate hearing from the
Minister how many non-resident parents are still paying maintenance
calculated under the 1993 scheme, and how many of those parents are
paying more than they would be paying if they had been assessed under

post-2003 system as planned. Instead, all cases would eventually move
over to the new system, once it was up and running. That sounds fair,
but unfortunately there appears to be a nine-year gap between when the
decision was first taken under the previous Government and its being
implemented by this Government, and 2017 is the date when all cases are
planned to have been moved over. That means that cases such as that of

bizarre—namely, that for every loser as a result of the
two-track approach to CSA there is a corresponding winner—as if
someone gaining from an unfair system somehow compensates those who

people never been switched over to the 2003 scheme? What are the
Government going to do to stop this situation continuing and to
compensate those who have suffered as a result? How long will it be

hon. Lady raised an important point about the fact that there are still
261,000 cases of people being assessed under the 1993 rules. Perfectly
reasonably, she said that she did not want to approach the debate in a
partisan manner, and neither do I. I will simply observe,
chronologically as it were, that the 2003 system came in. I shall say
more about the reasons for that, but it was not because the 1993 system
was felt to be fundamentally unfair or that the figures the system
produced were somehow wrong. Rather, it was about the massive
bureaucracy and complexity of assessing anybody, which meant vast
amounts of time were required and vast amounts of evidence had to be
gathered. That is why the decision was taken by the previous
Government to streamline all that—not because the answers of
the 1993 system were inherently wrong or worse than under
the 2003 system, but because of the awful amount of time and effort
involved. It was fundamentally a streamlining process.</hs_Para>

original intention was, as the hon. Lady said, to migrate people
across, and for several years the previous Government sought to do that
in good faith. That is 
<?notus-xml column=1236?>why letters of the sort she mentioned from Doug Smith were sent. Those
letters were subject to the caveat that when the Government were
convinced things were in order, those people would be moved
across—but they never were. In fact, it was the independent
Henshaw report that finally put the nail in coffin of this idea back in
2006. So well into the period of the last Government, it was decided
that it was simply not feasible to bulk transfer people across. As the
hon. Lady will have gathered—now there are more than a quarter
of a million of cases; back then, there were far
more—the IT issues, the compatibility of the data and the whole
difficulty involved in moving things across meant that bulk transfer
and bulk case closure were simply not an
option.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784001594" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0004.htm#13030784001594">The
hon. Lady asked why, if a single constituent had calculated that he
would pay less under the 2003 system, we could not just transfer that
one person. Within the total of 261,000, there will be an awful lot of
people who are potentially in that position. I do not know how many
precisely, because we have not made 261,000 calculations; if we had, we
could probably transfer all the people concerned. However, it is clear
that there will be a proportion of people of whom that is true, and a
proportion of whom the opposite is
true.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030784001595" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/debtext/130307-0004.htm#13030784001595">I
was pleased when the hon. Lady rightly said that what matters is the
well-being of the children. A unilateral case-by-case closure is
currently against the law, but if we changed the law to enable all the
people who did not fancy their ’93 assessment because they
thought it was bigger than the 2003 assessment simply to transfer to
the latter, tens of thousands of children—perhaps hundreds of
thousands—would receive less child maintenance.</hs_Para>

would be asymmetrical, because parents with care who calculated that
they were receiving more under the old system would presumably not have
a right of veto. All the non-resident parents who were paying more
under the old system than they would under the new one would be
transferred, although there would be a massive take-up problem: people
would be asking us to do calculations and all the rest of it. If people
opted to be transferred in tens of thousands of cases, tens of
thousands of children would receive less money and no one would receive
more, because no one would move in the other direction.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady recognises that that would create a different kind of
unfairness. How is it fair for someone who would pay less under the new
system to be able to move to that system, while someone else—a
mother, for example—who would receive a larger amount under the
new system because the maintenance would be higher, as it will be in
some cases, cannot do the same? That person will then persuade her
Member of Parliament to hold an Adjournment debate and say,
“It’s not fair. My ex-husband could transfer because he
wanted to pay less, and I should like to be in the system in which I

There are different answers to different questions. If those doing the
calculations take the view that all the complexities of people’s
circumstances should be taken into account, they will come up with one
number; if they take the view that what is wanted is a rough and ready,

pay.” These are legal liabilities, so the amounts are owed; it
is not a matter of choice, I am afraid. I appreciate the point that
some people, on both sides in many cases, will feel the sum is unfair.

contact people six months ahead of the point at which their case would
be due to be closed. We will encourage them to reach a family-based

One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T17:38:56"></hs_TimeCode> problem with
cases on the ’93 system is that they are often stuck in the
system untouched, so the maintenance assessments get very out of date,
and they can be based on very old income data. I do not know whether
that is the case with her constituent, but if someone asks for a
reassessment and finds that their liability has gone up, that is often
because the previous assessment was based on very old wage
data.</hs_Para>

beauty of the new system is that it will use most recent tax return
data from HMRC. Rather than our having to go to a non-resident parent,
ask for wage slips, wait for them to come back, process them and so on
without reassessing the assessment, those data will feed through
automatically to us. Once a year on the anniversary we will revisit the
assessment and update it with the latest income information so people
will not have the rude shock of a sudden hike or drop in their
liability, which will be based on the latest income
information.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady is absolutely right that there is a set of issues for the
people on the ’93 system who are paying more than those on the
’03 system. Equally, a set of parents with care would love to be
on the ’03 system but are stuck on the ’93 system. It is
important to realise that and perhaps we have not communicated it in
correspondence as clearly as we might. We are not saying that because
the computers cannot do it there is no issue of fairness, but there are
multiple issues of fairness.</hs_Para>

we mean by “for every one, there is another” is that for
every parent with care who would receive more under the new system,
there is a non-resident parent who would pay less under it.
Simply allowing case-by-case migration, quite aside from being
unlawful, would create a different set of injustices. That is my
conclusion: we want to get as quickly as we can to a new streamlined
system that is fair to all and in which we do not have either of the
legacy systems while learning the lessons from the past. As the hon.

fair, many are naval jobs in uniform. Presumably many of those people
would be relocated elsewhere, and therefore would not be directly made
redundant, but the other jobs would obviously be lost if Faslane and
Coulport were closed, as would all the support jobs  in the
community. It has been estimated that up to 11,000 jobs could be lost.
The information that I have seen makes that figure higher; it suggests
a multiplier of roughly 2.5 plus the additional jobs, or potentially
about 19,000 jobs lost in the Faslane and Coulport area, which will
clearly have a horrendous impact. It has not been made obvious what
would replace those jobs or what alternative naval facilities would be
provided there.</hs_Para>

Davidson:</Member></B> The key word is “realistically”.
We have not had any estimates from the Scottish Government that we
regard as solid; we have had to search around. On the point about the
number of jobs directly involved with Trident, the UK Government have
made it absolutely clear that, on the solid trade union principle of
“one out, all out”, if the Trident missile-firing
submarines were removed from Faslane, everything else would
go—the Trafalgar submarines, the Astute submarines and the
headquarters. Within the United Kingdom, the intention is not only for
50 years of secure employment, but for Faslane and Coulport to become a
centre of excellence for submarines for the entire United Kingdom. The
new Trafalgar boats would therefore be moved there as and when, as well
as the training facilities currently scattered throughout a number of
locations in the United Kingdom, so that everything connected with
submarines would be on the west coast of Scotland. That is why the
number of jobs involved would go up from the current 6,700 to 8,200
over a period. It is security and growth with the United Kingdom and
the great unknown with
separation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:42:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000029">To
return to the question of removing the nuclear deterrent from Scotland,
the statements made so far have the merit of clarity: the SNP wants to

that does not include a ban on nuclear weapons visiting Scottish
territory. The SNP might well intend Scotland to be similar to Norway
and Denmark, which have a “don’t ask, don’t
tell” policy and therefore allow nuclear weapons in their waters
and on their soil while pretending that they are not. No doubt we will
get clarification on that in due

key issue for us is, what are the parameters? Our role as a Committee
is to provide information and evidence to the people of Scotland to
inform their decisions. If the nuclear weapons are to be removed, we
wished to establish the parameters within which that could be done. At
one end of the range, according to the CND, it could be done quickly;
at the other end, it would require 20 to 25 years to build alternative
facilities. Somewhere within there, in the event of a separation
decision, will come the solution. People in Scotland, in particular
those employed at Faslane and Coulport, deserve to be told now which of
those alternatives is favoured by the SNP; it is then the
responsibility of the UK Government to respond with their reaction. The
Committee does not accept that it is reasonable for the UK Government
not to say anything in such circumstances, but we understand that the

CND, from its evidence, clearly believes that the missiles can be
disabled within days. Apparently, there is a fuse thing that can be
pulled out, which effectively disables the missiles and means that they
will not work any more. Those to whom I cannot refer will no doubt tell
me that it is much more complicated than that, but that is the gist.
There seemed to be general agreement that those fuses I pulled out
could be put in the boot of my car—for the interest of the
population, a Vauxhall Vectra, which is not a particularly specialist
vehicle—and driven down to England, therefore being removed from
Scotland. In such circumstances, the missiles would not work so, within
eight days, the missiles could be disarmed, 
<?notus-xml column=321?>defused, defanged or whatever simile is wished. It would then take eight
weeks for the warheads to be removed from the
submarines—basically, a big hand comes down, grabs them up and
puts them down. Again, the process is a bit more complicated, but that
is the gist. Believe it or not, that takes people eight weeks. It is
then anticipated that the removal of the nuclear weapons from Scotland
would take two years—a figure based on the existing timetable
for the replacement of the missiles, because they regularly get lifted
out of the submarines in Coulport, with the warheads taken off to be
polished or whatever, to be recycled and come back
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000033">The
weapons, therefore, could realistically be removed from Scotland within
two years. The subsequent disarming and so on would be a longer

will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:47:37"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Scottish Government could not do that on their own, however, and they
would require technical assistance from the Royal Navy and the Atomic
Weapons Establishment in Aldermaston and elsewhere, but if there was
co-operation, that could be achieved. That is one parameter: the
weapons could be removed within that time

other parameter, if the United Kingdom wishes to retain a nuclear,
at-sea deterrent, relates to the need to construct alternative
facilities elsewhere in the United Kingdom or to base the missiles
abroad in some way. Some who came to see us suggested that the
missiles, warheads or boats could be based in France or the United
States. The responses we have had, however, indicate that that is not
as realistic as was once anticipated, so we are setting that option
aside. We therefore want to focus on the other parameter, which is the
replacement of
Faslane.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000035">N<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:49:37"></hs_TimeCode>uclear
weapons require three functions: support facilities, docking, including
loading, and maintenance. A number of alternative locations have been
looked at: Devonport, Barrow, Milford Haven and a number of others.
Opinion varies about the amount of work necessary for a relocation. One
argument is that the facilities could be split. At the moment, Faslane
and Coulport are clearly separately facilities, but they are obviously
proximate. The question is whether to have a 20-mile gap and so on, or
more. It has been generally accepted that that could be done, but
planning requirements are much more stringent now and our evidence
indicated that 20 to 25 years is the most realistic estimate of how
long it would take the United Kingdom to build replacement facilities,
and there is an issue of whether it would want to do that. The
political and economic costs of relocating Trident would be huge, and
some of the arguments suggest that part of those costs would be borne
by a separate Scottish Government. The entire cost of relocation would
be imposed on the United Kingdom by a separate Scottish Government, and
the United Kingdom’s view is that it would be reasonable for the
Scottish Government to pay at least part, if not all, of those
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000036">I

possibility of relocation elsewhere in the United Kingdom, not just in
England. Locations in Wales were also mentioned. Francis Tusa, editor

which unloads nuclear weapons and so on, is a floating dock. By
definition, it floats so it could presumably be moved, and the facility
would not require complete rebuilding in the way that those of us who
had not realised that a floating dock floated had assumed. The matter
might not be as difficult as it appears, but we are not experts, and it

Davidson:</Member></B> We visited the storage facility, which is indeed
built into the side of a hill but, with respect, it is not the only
hill in the United Kingdom. There are hills and mountains in quite a
lot of locations in the United Kingdom. The search for hills is not the
main constraint, and several locations were
identified.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000041">The
matter can be split into different parts. One is the submarines, and we
believe that their maintenance could probably be done in places such as
Devonport, where there are enough bays and so on. The warhead element
is slightly more complex and there are two issues. One is loading and a
floating dock; the other is storage. There is storage at Coulport, but
I understand—we were not told much—that weapons are not
held there for an enormously long time. They are polished and whatever
at Aldermaston, then moved to the hill, which is rather Hobbit-like,
and then loaded on to submarines. They are not kept there for an
enormously long time. It would be possible to store them at Aldermaston
or elsewhere, although the journey would be longer and less convenient
in many ways and perhaps less safe, but that would be for the Ministry
of Defence and the UK Government at the time to
determine.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000042">Our
view was that that could be done. It would take a long time and it
would be expensive. Professor Walker of St Andrews university helpfully
said, “Don’t ask me to put a figure on it. I have no idea
at all, but certainly it 
<?notus-xml column=323?>would be billions of pounds.” Francis Tusa thought it would be
much less and said, “I have seen reports that it would cost
£50 million. No, it wouldn’t. It would cost much
less.” The then Minister for the Armed Forces, the hon. Member
for North Devon (Sir Nick
Harvey)<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:55:38"></hs_TimeCode>, pointed
out that a recent upgrade of the facilities at Faslane had cost
£3.5 billion. That was just for an upgrade, so presumably the
cost of replacing it would be much higher. We then come back to the
extent to which that forms a major part of the dialogue between the
Scottish and UK Governments after a separation
decision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000043">I
have touched on France and the United States. The other alternative we
looked at was maintaining a United Kingdom base in a separate Scotland,
similar to the Holy Loch base that the United States had, and the
United Kingdom’s sovereign territory in Cyprus. That would have
to be negotiated in the spirit of the Edinburgh agreement, which would
require best endeavours on both
sides.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000044">The
matter is not as straightforward as it seems because obviously not just
the base would have to be secure. Access and so on would have to be
secure, and a substantial amount of water would have to be UK sovereign
territory, at least during the period when submarines were leaving.
There could be an interesting situation if the Scottish Government
instructed Strathclyde police to beat back protestors from outside a
UK-owned and maintained Faslane base. The situation could be quite
complicated, and not one that the Scottish Government would
want.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000045">If
a Scottish Government wanted to join NATO, they would have to be part
of a nuclear alliance. The compromises that that might involve have not
been fully explored. The United Kingdom and Scottish Governments must
be much clearer about such matters, particularly the relationship with
NATO. The Scottish Government have indicated that they are enthusiastic
about the concept of joint air bases with the RAF and the Scottish air
force sharing facilities. The Ministry of Defence and others have said
that there is an issue of control, and if the UK Government wanted to
bomb somewhere that the Scottish Government did not want them to bomb,
would they have a sovereign right to do so, or would the Scottish

and shared bases are complicated, and even more so if there were any

runners. We will wait to hear from the Ministry of Defence and the

In the resolution that was passed at the SNP conference recently, there
was the proposal—indeed, the commitment—that the SNP in a
Scottish Government would seek to have submarines. However, the SNP has
also said that it would not wish to have any nuclear submarines, so the
question comes up of what sort of submarines it would have. Ireland,
New Zealand and Iceland all have no submarines. Denmark has just
decided to decommission its submarines. The Norwegians have six
diesel-electric submarines. If the Scottish navy are to have
diesel-electric submarines, two main issues come up: first, where will
they be built, and secondly, within what time scale?</hs_Para>

of us went along to see the BAE Systems shipyard staff and management,
and when we suggested to them that they could turn their hand to
building submarines, they laughed, because they thought that the idea
was so ludicrous. Other experts said to us that any submarines built in
the Clyde yards would be the most expensive submarines in the world,
ever, on the basis that they were a one-off—whether there are
four or six. They said that the yards were not equipped to build
submarines, and it would require starting completely from scratch. The
style of building submarines is, apparently, from the inside out, and
for ships, it is the from the outside in. The technologies are
different. Of course, it could be done—with the appropriate
amount of money and political will, Hall’s of Broxburn could
build submarines—but that is not to say that it would be
financially or economically viable. Anything could be done with enough
will, commitment or finance.</hs_Para>

have to assume that the diesel-electric submarines would be bought from
the main supplier, which is Germany. Therefore, we would have the
Scottish navy being equipped with U-boats at a cost that is
undetermined and to a timetable that is equally unclear. We have no
idea when U-boats from Germany would be able to arrive in Scotland to
provide jobs in maintenance at Faslane or Coulport. Of course, we would
then have circumstances in which there was a huge gap between the
departure of the submarines from the Royal Navy and the arrival of the
submarines from Germany, unless the SNP completely abandons its
commitment to remove the submarines from the Clyde as speedily as
possible. It is possible to see a compromise being reached, which would
require the SNP to undertake a U-turn on its commitment to remove the
submarines as quickly as possible. That is the only way in which we

vessels are, therefore, in entirely the wrong position, with the
longest possible sailing time to get to the areas where they would be
required. All the military experts to whom we have spoken indicated
that it would make sense to have the vessels on the east
coast—in Rosyth, or perhaps up near Aberdeen, particularly if
like the Norwegian navy, there will be 70 vessels. To be fair, some of
those vessels in the Norwegian navy are very small, but it would make
sense to have them close to areas that have, say, the oil rigs and so
on. However, that cannot be done if the main driver of a policy is the
need to guarantee as many jobs as possible in Faslane.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:06:29"></hs_TimeCode> is not
militarily rational to say that the entire Scottish navy, such as it

loss of any jobs concerned with naval matters in Rosyth, which is much

it does not make sense to have all of the headquarters staff based far
away from the seat of Government. We assume, in a separate Scotland,
that Helensburgh would not be the seat of Government. It would be
Edinburgh, and in those circumstances, it would be appropriate to have

Davidson:</Member></B> We have not yet got to the detail of that. It is
another issue that we have to explore. Our understanding is that the
policy of the SNP is to resurrect all the Scottish regiments. We are
not entirely clear as yet how far back that goes. The Argyll and
Sutherland Highlanders is, I think, presently destined to become a
platoon for Japanese tourists at Edinburgh castle, because it will
solely be a display regiment. It is unclear whether the Argyll and
Sutherland Highlanders will be resurrected as a regiment—as well
as all the separate regiments going back, presumably, to the date of
their foundation—as is whether the plans apply only to 1945
onwards, or any other date chosen at random.</hs_Para>

understanding is that no one who wishes to serve with the Scottish
armed forces will be refused—that is the policy of the Scottish
Government as we understand it; if that is wrong, I wait to hear my SNP
colleagues correct me—and that would of course include large
numbers of Fijians, who have provided the Royal Scots with one of the
best seven-a-side rugby teams in the country. I have watched them on a
number of occasions. Fijians play a valuable part in the Scottish
regiments. Presumably, as members of Scottish regiments, they will be
entitled to remain part of the Scottish armed forces. Scots in the Navy
could be scattered all around the world. The position will be similar
for Scots in the Air Force. As I understand it, they will be entitled
to join the Scottish armed forces. Then there is the question of
matching up needs and so on, which will be an intricate exercise.
Again, I presume that will be settled in the spirit of co-operation

what we must have spelt out by the Scottish Government as early as
possible is a statement of their intentions—their negotiating
position. I, for one, agree with the shop stewards who met us this
morning—I cannot mention their present location. They indicated
that they regard it as unacceptable that they have to wait potentially
until November to be told what their future is. That is simply not
acceptable. Even if there are 6,700 jobs being created on the
Clyde—I very much doubt that; all the figures that we have had
suggest that the figure will be much less than that—the job of
an infantryman who has been relocated from the Scots Guards to Faslane
is not the same job as is held at the moment by a fully trained
engineer working on nuclear submarines. One job might balance the other
in simply numerical terms, but they are not necessarily the same
people, unless the intention is to conscript the engineering work force
into the Scots Guards, in which case they would match up. The Scottish

nuclear-powered or that carry nuclear missiles. I believe them. I think
that that is something in which they are sincere, and that we have to
take it as a starting point that Trident will be going in days rather
than
decades<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:14:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000067">However,
as the Chairman of the Select Committee outlined, there are great
practical difficulties. What will the United Kingdom do when faced with
an eviction notice from an independent Scottish Government? The
Committee, in our evidence-gathering sessions, took evidence from a
wide variety of experts about whether it was possible to relocate
Trident and the submarines elsewhere in England or Wales, and that just
does not seem to be within the realms of practical possibility. My hon.
Friend the Member for North Devon (Sir Nick Harvey), when he was the
Minister for the Armed Forces, gave evidence to the Committee and
described the cost as “gargantuan”. Other experts gave
very large numbers. Therefore, there would be a cost
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:15:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000068">The
other problem would be location. Whereas it may be possible to
replicate the facilities at Faslane elsewhere, replicating the
facilities at Coulport elsewhere would be extremely difficult. The hill
is a very large one. There are many such hills in Argyll, but finding
such a large hill in the rest of the United Kingdom that was next to
the sea and relatively close to where there was an industrial work
force would be very difficult. I believe that only one place has been
mentioned. The Welsh Government at one point put forward Milford Haven
as an alternative, but I think that that met with objections from other
people in Wales and I certainly have not heard that idea being floated
recently. There would also be the problem of what to do with the
petrochemical complex

conclusion, I think, is clear. I simply do not believe that if the
Scottish Government won the referendum and evicted the Royal Navy from
Faslane, the United Kingdom Government would relocate elsewhere,
because 
<?notus-xml column=328?>as well as the problems of location and the political problems, there
would be the problem of cost. “Gargantuan” was how my
hon. Friend the Member for North Devon described it, and the United

therefore think that the only choice open to the United Kingdom
Government would be decommissioning. I think that the decommissioning
would probably start fairly quickly after the referendum if the SNP won
it. The timetable that the SNP has laid out is as follows. There are 18
months of negotiations, followed by Scotland becoming a separate state
on 1 April 2016. During that time, of course, the present devolved
Government at Holyrood would have been given a mandate by the
referendum to commence negotiations. As I said, I believe that they are
sincere in their opposition to nuclear weapons and that there would be
no point in the United Kingdom Government hanging about; I think that
the decommissioning would probably start straight away.

us take one of the countries in what used to be termed by the SNP the
arc of prosperity—Ireland. The Irish navy consists of eight
patrol boats. However, eight patrol boats are not going to keep
anything like the current Faslane work force in a job. It is also
extremely unlikely that those eight patrol boats would all be based at
Faslane, because
what<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:20:28"></hs_TimeCode> assets
would an independent Scottish navy seek to defend? The key assets would
clearly be the oil rigs and fishing grounds in the North sea, but as

opposite side of the country to
Faslane.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000075">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:21:46"></hs_TimeCode>
can imagine an incident on an oil rig, for which a patrol boat based at
Faslane would have to sail down the Clyde, round the Mull of Kintyre,
up the west coast of Scotland, through the Minch, round Cape Wrath,
through the Pentland firth and eventually arrive at the incident.
Clearly an independent Scotland would base at least half of its patrol
boats at an east coast port—Rosyth, Aberdeen or Lerwick, for
example. Even if Scotland’s navy were slightly bigger than
Ireland’s and we had 10 or 15 patrol boats, probably only about
six of them would be based at Faslane. That would keep only a handful
of people in jobs.</hs_Para>

paying 10p or 15p more in the pound in taxes in an independent

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:28:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing) asked whether NATO would let Scotland in
if we wanted rid of nuclear weapons; I remind her that Canada, a member
of NATO, got rid of its nuclear weapons in 1984 and Greece, another
member of NATO, got rid of them in 2001. It is not unprecedented.
Norway does not have nuclear weapons, for example.</hs_Para>

of the rest of the report goes into detail about the options open to
the UK Government in finding an alternative to Faslane. Frankly, that
does not appear to me to be the concern of the Scottish people or
Government. It is a matter for the UK Government, should they wish to
continue with the possession of nuclear weapons. Scottish independence
gives the remainder of the UK the perfect opportunity to accept that it
can no longer justify the possession of such weapons and to decide that
it will no longer have them, but that is a decision for it to make. It
is worth noting that even some military figures have begun to question
the wisdom of retaining Trident in the UK, given the huge cuts to

as the report suggests, there seem to be alternatives. Francis Tusa of

have been exaggerated. It appears that the UK Government do not want to

missiles would be too near centres of population, but it does not seem
to worry them that Faslane is close to the main centres of the
population of Scotland.</hs_Para>

seems curious that there is objection to the use of Kings bay in
Georgia, because it might give the impression that Trident is not a
totally independent system. I think most people think that already.
Given that the report says that a stockpile of weapons is stored there

Clark:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. The Scottish
National party often forgets that not only will England, Wales and
Northern Ireland have views on this issue, but many other European
countries will be interested in the internal implications for
themselves. For example, Spain may not want to create the precedent of
allowing one part of a current member country of the European Union an
easy process for continuing to be a member of the EU, given that it has
to deal with situations such as the one in
Catalonia<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:44:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

general point is that we cannot presume that negotiations would be easy
on all matters if Scotland voted for independence.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:45:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Angus (Mr Weir), who spoke on behalf of the Scottish National
party, therefore needs to think about his comment that it would be
laughable for an independent Scotland to have to take at least a share
of the costs of relocating Trident. Whatever the Scottish National
party’s views about what is a reasonable negotiating position,
it should be aware that it might have to negotiate with people with
very different
views<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:45:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000142">That
is one reason why there has been a great deal of speculation in
Scotland about whether the Scottish National party would honour its
position of not having nuclear weapons in Scotland if we became
independent. I very much hope that it would: we should not have nuclear
weapons in any part of the United Kingdom. I would therefore be
sympathetic to much of what the hon. Gentleman said about the
implication for jobs, if we were talking only about Trident. Of course,
a whole range of work has been done on which part of those employed at
Faslane and Coulport is related strictly to Trident and its
replacement, and which part is related  to other military
activities that currently take place in Scotland but may not continue
to do

am grateful to have had the opportunity to speak in this debate. It is
an important debate for Scotland, because the reality is that the
Scottish National party’s policy on Trident has been successful
for it over many years. In Scotland, there is a very different
tradition on such issues than there is in other parts of the United
Kingdom. In opinion polls, the replacement of Trident has consistently
been unpopular. Indeed, over many decades, many people in Scotland have
opposed nuclear weapons. Whether we go back to the 1950s and 1960s,
with the demonstrations against Polaris, or the 1980s, with those
against both Cruise and of course Trident, which was brought in
afterwards, the anti-nuclear movement has been very strong in
Scotland.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000146">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:49:08"></hs_TimeCode>
the purposes of this debate, whether people are for or against nuclear
weapons should not be a reason for taking one side or the other in the
independence debate. If Scotland decides to become independent, we will
still be grappling with the same issues and having  to deal
with other parts of this country. I therefore say to the Scottish
National party that as much honesty and information as possible in this
debate would be in 
<?notus-xml column=337?>everybody’s interest and would ensure that the people of Scotland
can make an educated choice when the time
comes.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_07_PT_1/20CBCB5BF7A5BC6FF8D3D99A2EB10BD0CD685E1F" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="7 March 2013">Thursday

was a miniscule organisation in Scotland at the time, because it was
focused, as always, on breaking up the United Kingdom and separating
Scotland from the UK. It was never part of the movement that was
clearly committed to organising against the bomb. I went on the marches

international motions and structures we sign up to that enable us to

dump the people”—that was always the statement made at
demonstrations outside the gates of Faslane and Coulport. It was never
about getting rid of the people who were inside doing the job that the
nation had asked them to do, using the skills that they had been
trained in and were proud to serve their country with. Unfortunately,
that is the unanswered question, which was asked by the Chair of the
Scottish Affairs Committee.</hs_Para>

we are to have such a monumental change in the structure of the defence

becoming some wee country that would not be a significant player in the
world—we must think about how we can deal with that. That is the
problem for the SNP Government, who, by the way, as I keep having to
repeat, were elected by 24% of the people of Scotland.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:53:12"></hs_TimeCode> structure of
the electoral system set up by those under Donald Dewar, who thought
that by helping their Liberal comrades they would enable Labour to form
an alliance with the Liberals in Scotland, actually advantaged the
Scottish National party and gave it a majority. The Labour party,
because it had done such an abysmal job in 
<?notus-xml column=338?>Scotland and lost the faith of the Scottish people, got about half the
SNP’s percentage at the election. None the less, a party cannot
have a landslide victory when only 24% of the people vote for it. It is
a fix that happens because of electoral arithmetic, and it has nothing
to do with popular support. If there were some sea change among the
people in Scotland, we would have to consider what to do with the
bomb.</hs_Para>

all dead. The fuses deteriorate and do not necessarily react 30

for Nuclear Disarmament show that there is nowhere for the weapons to
be relocated. There was nowhere all those years ago that was thought to
be isolated and secure enough to install the nuclear weapons. Now,
given the population changes in the conurbations around those areas, it
is unlikely that anywhere would allow those weapons to be installed.
The question of relocating them, therefore, cannot be resolved unless
there was some sort of dictatorship of Government on the people in the

we even be thinking about moving the weapons somewhere else? It is a

bomb the establishments based in my constituency in Grangemouth, where
the North sea oil and gas comes in, just because we put the weapons
somewhere else? What are we going to do? Are we going to paint CND
signs on the tops of all the buildings in Scotland? Let me own up to
something. When I was leader of a council, we actually did put CND
signs on our vans. Somebody pointed out that we should have 
<?notus-xml column=339?>put them on the roof because they could not be seen on the side of the
vans, but we were young and foolish then. I have learned now that it is
a nonsense to say that we are not part of the UK because we do not have
the bomb any more and that if there were a conflagration we would be

late. Having campaigned with the Labour movement over many years, my
understanding is that more than 70% of the people of Scotland are
already against these weapons. Therefore, changing the mood of the
people in Scotland by removing the weapons is not the point. I want to
see the mood changed throughout the United Kingdom so that we can
persuade a Government in the future—a Labour Government, I
hope—that we should be moving in the direction of taking the
weapons out of the whole land mass of the UK; that is my aim. If my SNP
colleagues, who support the idea of ridding the world of these nuclear
weapons, want to go off and hide in a corner then they can do so, but
they should not pretend that it is sensible Government policy. I am

before they are quickly made redundant because £2.5 billion of

centre produced a report on Trident in 2008, “Trident: What is
it For?”, which argues and shows that Trident is not for
anything in the modern world, quite frankly; Trident is a nonsense. The
centre talks sensibly, as the SNP should be doing to challenge the
assertions that are made and the questions that are asked by the
Scottish Affairs Committee. The centre produced another report in 2009,
“Stepping down the Nuclear Ladder: Options for Trident on a Path
to Zero”, which worked out how we can go—step by
step—away from these weapons and what we can do with them. In
2010, the centre produced the report, “Continuity/Change:
Rethinking Options for Trident Replacement”. These reports are
fundamental sources of information about how we can move away from a
world, and a UK, that has nuclear weapons in its armoury, and use the
money for something much more useful.</hs_Para>

been doing if they really meant to remove Trident and if they are not

kind of work that should have been done, but I see none of that work
being done by the SNP. That review argued very strongly 
<?notus-xml column=341?>that if we want to have a situation where Barrow, which builds these

will tell you an interesting fact, Mr Rosindell, as you have taken the
Chair. When I looked into my wife’s ancestors, I discovered that
her third great-grandfather was the ferry manager from Ardentinny to
Faslane. In his day, there was an agricultural community on both sides
of the water, and that route became a route for people to go down into
the central belt of Scotland; sadly, that emptied out most of that
area. The idea that we could not have people living there with high
skills, in a very attractive area, who could work in the conurbations
of Scotland and commute, or in fact who could create whole new
industries in that area, is a nonsense.</hs_Para>

us consider a parallel.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:04:47"></hs_TimeCode>When I first
came into the House, I went down to visit Baglan bay. Baglan bay was a
BP refinery and chemical site, because we thought that the oil would
come from the other side of the world and to the west coast of the
nation. BP realised that would not make sense, because of North sea
oil, so it shut down Baglan bay, slowly but surely. However, there are
more jobs in Baglan bay today than there were when BP had its refinery
and when there was a chemical industry there, because the Wales Office,
which was then responsible, planned for the change, trained people for
it and put the infrastructure in for it.

I have just given the example of the work that has been done on Barrow.
People who are looking at the future of the UK without nuclear weapons
are looking at what it takes. It is not a matter of location; it is a
matter of industrial, manufacturing and education policy. Whether or
not we had stopped making gas lanterns in Faslane and we were going to
make some new things for the nation, we have to plan and train, put
people in the skill set, and give them the infrastructure. Whether
something is made redundant by technology or by the movement of
history, such as the movement of agricultural workers to the
conurbations, it is a cycle. A nation must plan ahead for the people
and for its needs in the future.</hs_Para>

Rosindell, for saying that, after all this time that I have been
campaigning, I am not allowed much more than 18 minutes. If anything I
have said is redundant, I strike it from the record, but what I would
say is that the questions asked in the context of the Scottish Affairs
Committee remain unanswered. The questions that I asked, which are
slightly different from those of the Scottish Affairs Committee, remain
unanswered in most of the context of the UK, but we have some
indication that the nuclear industry commission, which has Lord Browne
of Ladyton and others on it, is beginning to look very seriously at
that issue. The point that the commission makes, and I make, is whether
or not we have a scenario with a final conclusion, which might come
from independence or the removal of Trident because of some other
reason, we must plan, argue and invest for the future. None of that is
in the SNP documents that I have found; in fact, the question of
weapons diversification is not on the agenda at all. It is all about
government by suggestion.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:10:05"></hs_TimeCode> that context,
I have to conclude that if the argument is that we would feel morally
better if we got rid of Trident, we should do so on a UK basis. None of
the arguments I have heard show that the SNP has any idea what it would
do if it had independence and was facing the removal of Trident from
Faslane and Scotland.</hs_Para>

plays an essential and pivotal role in the defence of the United
Kingdom, and I welcome the opportunity to speak on one of the most
important impacts of the referendum debate: the future of the Trident
nuclear deterrent in a separate Scotland. It is no secret that I am an
advocate of the decommissioning of all nuclear weapons, lock, stock and
barrel, regardless of where they are sited—in Scotland, the UK
or anywhere else. Indeed, I believe that nuclear disarmament should not
just stop at Carlisle and Berwick-upon-Tweed, as the Scottish
nationalists would have it. However, the removal of Trident from the
Clyde, if that is the proposition, needs to be considered extremely
carefully, with a full examination of all the implications and
exploration of the alternatives. I therefore welcome the report as a
significant contribution to that debate. Rather than putting up
barriers and creating false divisions, as the nationalists constantly
do, we all need to work together and play an active and constructive
role in an international effort to achieve a world free from nuclear
weapons<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000220">The
UK is a proud and prominent signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty. Its three pillars must continue to be the prism for our nuclear
policy: non-proliferation, disarmament and the facilitation of the
peaceful use of nuclear technology. I also believe that the formal
response from the Scottish Government is not a meaningful contribution
to the debate, and that many people throughout Scotland and the rest of
the UK do not welcome it. If the SNP were to insist on the removal of
Trident from Scottish territory by the “speediest safest
transition”, as it says, any armed submarine on patrol would be
recalled and, in effect, the UK would at that point no longer be able
to maintain its nuclear defence capacity. The continuous at-sea
deterrent would stop and it is not clear how quickly the UK could
restore it, if that was the choice.</hs_Para>

SNP has claimed that the panacea for the vacuum that would be created
through the removal of Trident from Faslane and Coulport would be the
basing of conventional naval forces there. However, moving nuclear
weapons from the Clyde after Scottish separation would be an enormous
exercise costing billions of pounds and thousands of jobs. The Faslane
site currently employs 6,700 military and civilian workers, with that
figure due to rise to 8,200 by 2022. Of course, there is also a
multiplier effect, across the west of Scotland and beyond. It is
therefore for the Scottish Government to explain how the quality and
quantity of such jobs would be 
<?notus-xml column=348?>matched if Trident were relocated. I do not think that the speeches of
the hon. Members for Angus (Mr Weir) and for Perth and North Perthshire

a newly separate Scotland insists on the removal of Trident from
Faslane and the UK is forced into developing a new base at great
expense, one would assume that the associated costs would be included
in the separation negotiations. In that event, one would imagine the
difficulty, both practically and politically, for a UK government
trying to establish facilities suitable for storing nuclear weapons and
home-porting the Trident fleet in England or
Wales.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000223">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:30:09"></hs_TimeCode>

has been mentioned that in a sitting of the Select Committee on
Scottish Affairs this morning, we took evidence from the unions
representing the work force on the Clyde. From their responses to our

and Coulport in the event of a yes vote in the pending referendum.
Despite what was said earlier by members of the Scottish National
party, it was reported to us today that November will be the earliest
opportunity for the work force to get some answers, perhaps, to their
legitimate questions and concerns. The work force and, indeed, the
people of Scotland must be able to make the best possible informed
choice and be fully aware of the implications of that choice, so the
SNP cannot continue to duck this
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000225">Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:31:53"></hs_TimeCode>
the Minister can confirm what discussions the devolved Administration
in Scotland have had with the UK Government and the Ministry of Defence
on the implications and additional costs of a separate Scottish state
removing Trident and establishing a new naval base, post separation. In
particular, I should like a response about whether he accepts the view
that Trident warheads could be deactivated in a matter of days and that
the nuclear warheads, missiles and submarines could be removed from
Scotland within 24 months, and whether this timetable would constitute
the “speediest safe transition” of nuclear weapons from
Scotland.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000226">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:32:40"></hs_TimeCode>

that Faslane is ideally suited to its purpose. Back in the 1950s,
alternative sites were investigated, including Falmouth, which has one
of the largest harbours in the world, and Milford Haven, but we cannot
turn back the clock and consider how Falmouth and Milford Haven were 50
years ago. The fact is that a great deal of development has happened in
both since, and some of it is completely incompatible with a nuclear

deterrent for a further generation, it would be one of the biggest
items—if not the single biggest—on the table in the
negotiation that would have to take place between London and Edinburgh
in the aftermath of a referendum vote for independence. The Scottish
Government would likely take the view, “This will all have to be
paid for by the United Kingdom Government”; I would not expect
them to write cheques for it. However, if the residual UK Government
found themselves facing a massive bill of many billions of pounds for
relocating the nuclear deterrent, they would have that many billions
fewer in their back pocket for discussing the rest of the things on the
table.</hs_Para>

brings us to the critical point that we have not heard from the
proposers of Scottish independence what the defence policy of an
independent Scotland would be. The United Kingdom, even denuded of 8.5%
of its population and taxpayers, would continue to have global
interests, which its armed forces are there to defend. It would
continue to have a broad spectrum of capability with which to defend
it, and it would continue to have the critical mass necessary to
sustain a variety of equipment fleets, but the defence force of an
independent Scotland would have neither those global interests nor that
global reach.</hs_Para>

critically, Scotland would not have the sheer mass with which it could
possibly hope to sustain fleets of warships or fighter jets. We have

carriers and warships. If Scotland is not going to have any of those

truth of the matter is that an independent Scotland would need defence
forces. It would be about homeland security. If Scotland was
forward-leaning in its global interests, it would perhaps be willing,

our report had made it clear that it would be possible to remove

stated that removing them was possible, but that it would be at the

separate Scotland. Their only priority seems to be to win a referendum
in 2014. That is why they ditched a long-held opposition to NATO. The
SNP held a view for 60 years, but dropped it at one meeting in a
desperate attempt to fool public opinion, which has consistently shown
popular support for Scotland’s membership of

organisation was born at the end of the second world war and the start
of the cold war, and many countries around the world are still queuing

we are proud of being part of NATO, and membership is not only a hoop
to be jumped through. NATO membership has allowed us, as a small
country, to contribute to preventing the slaughter of Muslims in Kosovo
and Bosnia, to protecting women and children in Afghanistan from the
Taliban and to securing our safety in the UK. NATO has played a vital
role in humanitarian relief, helping after the Pakistan earthquake and
Hurricane Katrina.</hs_Para>

SNP has been arguing the point. It wants to join the club but it has
been arguing against the rules before even being granted membership.
The SNP likes to have a grand, international, catch-all comparison in
its desperate attempts to justify its assertions. None of us has yet
forgotten the arc of prosperity, which has already been mentioned
today. The SNP has quoted Norway as a country with an anti-nuclear
stance that is still a member of NATO, but forgets that the country was
a founding member of NATO. It also chooses to ignore the fact that
Norway has mandatory military service. Denmark, too, is often quoted,
but again the SNP ignores its historical relationship with NATO as a
founding member and the fact that the country supports the holding of
nuclear weapons through membership. I have not yet heard exactly how
the SNP has come to the position of wanting the protection of nuclear
weapons but not being willing to have them in its own
backyard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:04:54"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is no precedent for a country that has kicked out a nuclear deterrent
to join NATO. Canada and Greece were mentioned, but they were opposed
to US weapons on their soil, and the two positions are simply not
comparable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000252" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000252">An
SNP alternative for a separate Scotland might be to follow Belarus and
Kazakhstan into the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, which
includes countries that formerly had nuclear weapons on their soil.
Frankly, a separate Scotland is more likely to be granted membership of
the CSTO than of NATO. NATO would not let in a country that has removed
nuclear weapons quickly, causing not only Scotland but the entire UK
not to have a nuclear deterrent and reducing the nuclear deterrent
capability of NATO as a whole. No countries in NATO have got rid of
their nuclear
weapons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:05:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030782000253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/halltext/130307h0001.htm#13030782000253">More
importantly, on joining NATO a separate Scotland might be obliged to
sign up to everything that NATO requires of its members, including
allowing nuclear weapons in their waters, and article 5, which states
that an attack on one member of the alliance is an attack on all
members and will be acted on, and not only with UN sanctions as the SNP
put forward in its defence document. It is not possible only to pursue
a pick-and-mix approach, as the SNP regularly asserts. Regardless of
that, I have seen no evidence that the SNP has discussed the options
with NATO. Has the Minister had any discussions with NATO about the
possibilities of a separate Scotland joining? What effect on Scotland
and the UK’s membership would there be if an SNP Government in a
separate Scotland disarmed the UK of its nuclear
capability?

countries should be pulling together to face the new challenges of a
fast-changing world, the SNP logic is to break up Britain and to gamble
with Scotland and the UK’s security and their membership of
NATO. We need the SNP to be open and honest about the defence of
Scotland if it breaks away from the rest of the UK. The SNP needs to
acknowledge the facts and choose evidence over ideology, as the
Scottish people have the right to make an informed decision in 2014.
They need to know that, while other countries are queuing up to join
NATO, the only mainstream party in the UK that wants to risk losing
membership of the alliance is the SNP. That would not be in the

in providing a temporary base. One option would be to work with the USA
at its submarine base in Georgia, but, as the Committee noted,
questions would probably arise about the perceived independence of the
capability. For most people, 
<?notus-xml column=355?>independence is a key desire behind having a nuclear deterrent, and the
same argument might be applied to the Committee’s consideration
of stationing the deterrent in France. Although it is closer and the
geography would make things easier, there might be problem with finding
sufficient space to house it.</hs_Para>

do so in the foreseeable future. For that reason, I reiterate that we

wording. She subsequently got a row from her colleagues and then
produced a press statement, which led to her being rebuked for
misbehaviour by the other members of the Committee, but she did
actually agree that wording. It was alleged that we were too
hard in rebuking her. Let me make it clear that there were 14 witnesses

prepared to argue on the issues, because I think that the discussions
that we have had today have moved the debate forward quite
considerably. I think that there is recognition on all sides that the
parameters that we have spelt out in our report are universally
accepted—that that is the area that the debate will focus on in
terms of timing. We have had a clear indication from the SNP about its
position in relation to those. It has not been absolutely explicit, but

seems to me that we are now in a position in which, having established,
as a result of this report and subsequent discussions, what the
alternatives are on timing, we are also pretty clear on where one of
the parameters is in terms of jobs. The shop stewards told us earlier
today about the 50 years of job security with the United Kingdom. There
are 6,700 jobs, rising to 8,200 jobs, with the UK. But with separation,
the position is unknown. In those circumstances, we as a Committee will
be, on both this occasion and others, drawing attention to what appears
to be a complete vacuum of policy from the SNP on the question of
defence. That cannot

the next day. If they wish to leave their present employment, as a

placing orders for the Type 26 between now and the referendum. If they
cannot be clear, or if they wish to say that no orders will be placed
before the referendum, they need to indicate what will be done to
ensure that yards remain open between now and then. The yards engaged

from construction is within a range between 0.29 and 2.12 MtCO2e

based on the carbon intensity of materials and the wide range reflects
the uncertainty about factors such as construction methods at an early

jobseekers find work so we expect that the majority of claimants who
are genuinely looking for work will want to willingly use the service
themselves. Where this is not the case and where appropriate we may
require some jobseeker's allowance (JSA) claimants to create a profile
and public CV in Universal Jobmatch. In addition to this, JSA claimants
must do all that can be reasonably expected of them to find work and
must apply for any jobs that an adviser deems suitable. Universal
Jobmatch will provide access to a wide range of vacancies, so using the
service will be an important part of actively seeking
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130307104000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/text/130307w0001.htm#130307104000219">If
after the Jobcentre Plus adviser has explained the benefits of the
service to them and they still refuse to use Universal Jobmatch, the
adviser may then consider whether it is reasonable to issue a
Jobseeker's Direction to mandate them to register on Universal
Jobmatch. Before issuing a Jobseeker's Direction the adviser will take
into account their circumstances, including whether they
have access to the internet. Jobseeker's Directions require jobseeker's
allowance (JSA) claimants to take specific actions which will help them
to find work, and failure to do so without good reason may result in a
benefit sanction being applied.</hs_Para>

benefit week that follows the date a person reaches state pension age.
State pension is paid in full weeks and this means that for most people
there will be a gap between their birthday (when they reach pension
age) and the day they receive their first payment of pension. The gap
could be anything between one and six days, depending on the person's
birthday and their benefit
payday.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130307104000257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/text/130307w0001.htm#130307104000257">If
a person's birthday happens to fall on the same day of the week as the
first day of their benefit week, there is no gap between that birthday
and the first day for which payment is due. For most other people,
there will be. However, because we make pension payments in complete
weeks, there are no part-week payments at the end of a claim either,
when a full week's benefit is also paid and thus the system balances
itself
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130307104000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/text/130307w0001.htm#130307104000258">There
are administrative costs associated with making part-week payments and
it is important that we continue to deliver the Department's service as
cost effectively as possible. If we made part-week payments at the
commencement of a claim then logically we should seek to recover any
days' overpayment at the end and this would be at a cost to the
Department, as well as causing distress to families.</hs_Para>

2017 at the earliest. Only individuals who reach their state pension
age after implementation will be eligible for a single-tier pension.
Therefore, all men and women who reach state pension age before the
implementation of single tier, including women born between 6 April
1952 and 5 July 1953, will receive a state pension in line with
existing rules. The Government will publish an analysis of the state

Robathan:</Member></B> The Ministry of Defence is still in the process
of determining what pieces of equipment and materiel should be
repatriated from Afghanistan and by what means. We are therefore
currently unable to give an accurate estimate for the cost of
withdrawal from Afghanistan. Equipment will only be repatriated where
to do so represents the best value way to meet an enduring military
requirement. We will seek the most cost-effective solution to
repatriating both military personnel and equipment, whilst balancing
this alongside logistical and military considerations on the
ground.</hs_Para>

valuable service, working with their handlers, to search for items and
substances such as, arms, ammunition, drugs and explosives and can also
be trained to track or detect human scent. Detection dogs have played a
significant role in counter-improvised explosive device work during
Operations Herrick and Telic, reducing human injuries and
fatalities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130307104000320" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/text/130307w0001.htm#130307104000320">Information

Ministry of Defence gathers data on sexual orientation on a voluntary

(RTS). It is our intention to extend monitoring in the future using the
Joint Personnel Administration system to enable armed forces personnel
to record their sexual orientation, should they wish to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130307104000326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/text/130307w0001.htm#130307104000326">The
following tables provide a record of the data collected at all phase 1
and 2 training establishments over the last 12 months for Royal Navy
ratings, soldiers, and airmen using the RTS. Personnel completing the
confidential survey are, of course, entirely free to classify
themselves as they wish, and those describing themselves as gay will be
open, or not, with their sexuality to varying degrees. Data are
collected in a similar way for officers using the Officer Cadet Survey;
however, sample size for this cohort is low and not yet sufficiently
mature to be considered statistically robust.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=1131?>vulnerable veterans and it was considered important to offer this
additional support to those most likely to need it. VIS letters were
despatched via e-mail or post to almost 16,000 veterans who had left
service between September 2010 and November 2011. Responses were
encouraging, with an 8% increase in Big White Wall activity and 591
visits to the VIS area of the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency
(SPVA) website. Also, around 60 recipients of the VIS letter made
contact to ask for help. SPVA were able to offer help and advice to all
who made contact.</hs_Para>

resulted individually as local councils issue multiple cases that are
heard at a single hearing. HMCTS cannot, therefore, tell how many
people they relate to, or how many liability orders were granted. The
only way we may be able to obtain this data would be to ask each
area/court to manually count and check the numbers which would be
possible only at disproportionate costs. Upon the granting of a
liability order the local council takes responsibility for the
production of those orders.</hs_Para>

freezes the proportion of glass which can be sent to non-remelt

packaging recovery note (PRN) system, established by the Producer
Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 (as
amended), will enable the remelt target for 2013 to be met. It provides
a mechanism by which additional funding is generated to support the
collection and recycling of packaging waste materials. Following the
introduction of the remelt target, more PRN revenue will be directed to
glass remelt facilities which they are expected to invest in increasing
capacity for the collection, sorting and reprocessing of glass for
remelt. This could take the form of increased support for waste
collectors, including local authorities, to collect more glass in a
manner which facilitates remelt.</hs_Para>

British Equestrian Trade Association's National Equestrian Survey 2011
to be just below 1 million. DEFRA has made no estimate of the number at
risk of being abandoned or fly-grazed, but evidence from the animal
welfare charities and the British Horse Society suggest that the risk
is on the increase. Their recent report "Left on the Verge" estimates
that some 6,000 horses are at risk of abandonment and fly grazing.
Ministers have discussed the report with the welfare organisations
concerned and with the All Party 
<?notus-xml column=1149?>Parliamentary Group for the Horse. Steps can be taken by landowners and
others to tackle the issue and controls are in place to help them do so
including using the anti social behaviour legislation. Largely the
problem is one of tackling irresponsible owners and breeders. We are
discussing with the Home office what further measures could be
considered.</hs_Para>

Department, and its arm's length bodies, is constantly developing new
measures and indicators of the quality of health care provision and
making as much information as possible available publicly. From
1 April 2013, we will hold the NHS Commissioning Board to
account for meeting the objectives set out in the mandate using the NHS
Outcomes Framework. The framework was derived from Lord Darzi's
three-part definition of quality and includes outcomes that relate to
the effectiveness of care, the quality of the patient experience and
patient safety. The framework is refreshed every year,
refining existing indicators and developing new indicators.. We will
also implement the Friends and Family Test nationally for
all acute in-patient and Accident and Emergency services to encourage
services to be responsive to patient needs and experiences.
The test is unique in that it provides frequent, fast feedback, which
is comparable from both patients' and national health service staff
perspectives. Although there is currently no aggregate
‘rating’ to summarise the performance of organisations
providing health and care services, the Secretary of State for Health,
my right hon. Friend the Member for South West Surrey (Mr Hunt), has
commissioned a review by 
<?notus-xml column=1165?>the Nuffield Trust to consider whether an aggregate rating should be
used and if so, how best this should be
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130307104001828" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/text/130307w0003.htm#130307104001828">We
have also consolidated work initiated under the previous Government.
All providers of NHS services are required to publish annual Quality
Accounts alongside their financial accounts. The Department publishes a
range of data on performance measures, including waiting times and the
incidence of health care associated infections. The National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence has been commissioned to produce a
library of 150 to 180 quality standards to define what high quality
care looks like for particular pathway of care or groups of patients.
The national clinical audit programme is being expanded and outcome
data for every consultant practising in 10 surgical specialties will be
made publicly available. A library of assured indicators for quality
measurement (Indicators for Quality Improvement) is available on the
website of the Health and Social Care Information Centre.</hs_Para>

weekly/monthly/quarterly basis and this can also explain marked
differences between months. Registration data is received in batches

Willetts:</Member></B> There is a substantial demand for engineers who
contribute widely to the UK economy. Our recent work on engineering
skills has found a complex picture in terms of both supply and demand.
The Institute of Engineering and Technology found in their Skills and
Demand in Industry survey 2012 that 29% of employers did not expect to
be able to recruit the qualified engineers, IT staff and technicians
they require. Further, the National Employer Skills Survey 2011 shows
establishments in engineering sectors are more likely to report skill
shortage vacancies with between 5% and 8% reporting skill shortage
vacancies depending on sector. This compares to 3% of all
establishments reporting skill shortage
vacancies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303081000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/text/130307w0003.htm#1303081000165">Regarding
the supply of professional engineers, the UK produces around 22,000
graduate engineers per year. Significant supply also comes from those
with non-engineering qualifications, for example from maths and science
graduates, and the UK produces around 89,000 science, technology,
engineering and mathematics graduates annually. Finally inward
migration of engineers to the UK also contributes to the available
skills pool. These factors mean forecasts of supply are built on a
number of
assumptions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303081000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/text/130307w0003.htm#1303081000166">The
Government has listened to industry and recognises the chronic supply
issues they have reported. The most significant issue being the
difficulty in recruiting staff with specific types of engineering
skills, for example there is great demand in the aerospace sector for
staff with experience in composite materials reflecting as this is
relatively new type of skill. By continuing to work closely with
industry and the engineering institutions we aim to encourage more
young people to consider 
<?notus-xml column=1183?>careers in engineering and transform the outdated and negative image of
careers in engineering. We are also working to address specific
engineering skills shortages, for example 500 new Aeronautics MSc
places are to be jointly funded by Government and industry to the tune
of £6 million. Our commitment to nurturing the right engineering
skills in the UK was demonstrated at the Manufacturing Summit on 28
February 2013. The Government is also allocating up to £135
million over the current spending review period to improve science and
mathematics education in schools and recognises the importance of
engineering in higher education where it is given the status of a
strategically important subject and funded
accordingly.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="1303081000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/text/130307w0003.htm#1303081000167"><B><Member PimsId="4768" UID="1303081000511" xid="802" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130307/text/130307w0003.htm#1303081000511">Nadine

Government recognises the need to increase the supply of engineers

increase the uptake of maths and science qualifications in schools, the
essential first step to produce more engineers. Working with industry
we have been able to significantly increase the numbers of engineering
apprenticeship starts (up 21% in the last year to 59,480), which should
provide many of the skilled technicians the economy requires. Investing
in engineering provision in higher and further education will provide
the infrastructure to build the skills of our engineering work force,
(for, example in the autumn statement an extra £270 million was
announce to be spent on laboratories, classrooms and other facilities
in our further education colleges). We also recognise engineering as a
strategically important subject in higher education and fund
engineering courses accordingly.</hs_Para>

export licences to Israel at the present time. The UK maintains a
rigorous and transparent arms export control system, whereby all
applications are assessed on a case by case basis, against the
Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. This
includes assessing the risk of exports being used for internal
repression, to provoke or prolong armed conflicts, or aggravate
existing tensions or conflict in the country of final destination. We
apply these criteria rigorously, including with respect to Israel. We
refuse licences for any arms exports to Israel which we assess would be
inconsistent with the criteria.</hs_Para>

if Israel wished to build the barrier, it should have been built on the
1967 border and where it is constructed on the Palestinian side of that
border, it is illegal under international law. The International Court
of Justice's ruling, which is an advisory opinion and therefore is not
legally binding, concluded that the construction of the Separation
Barrier along its chosen route, and its associated regime, and the
settlement breach Israel's obligations under international law. We
agree with this conclusion and make our position on the Separation
