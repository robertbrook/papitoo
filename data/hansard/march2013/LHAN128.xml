We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T14:37:08"></hs_TimeCode> welcome the
committee’s report on the ageing population that was published
last week. We will consider its recommendations carefully and respond
in due course. Effective reform of public services is critical if we
are to meet the needs of an ageing population and ensure long-term
sustainability. We have put in place an ambitious programme of reform
across a wide range of government policy areas, including pensions,
health, social care, housing and

Filkin:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his reply. As the House
may know, the committee found that our society and Government were
woefully underprepared for this major social change. To focus the
supplementary question on health, out of courtesy to my colleague, the
report found a massive increase in demand and cost driven by the
increase in long-term conditions. In the committee’s view, this
posed perhaps the biggest challenge the NHS has ever had to face. Will
the Secretary of State set out his assessment of these challenges and
what he proposes to do about
them?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13031964001239" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964001239">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, we know that to adapt and respond to
future need, the health and care system needs to change. The
conclusions of the noble Lord’s report correlated in many ways
with our own analysis in this respect. The challenges that the report
sets out create an opportunity for the NHS and local authorities to
innovate and explore new ways of working together to meet the needs of
their local populations better and to optimise the use of resources,
which is of course critical. We think the NHS and local authorities are
best placed to understand the opportunities that exist in their areas,
and we are committed to supporting them in that

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I very much agree with the noble Baroness.
It is our ambition that people should receive high-quality, integrated,
person-centred services that deliver the best outcomes to the service
user. Making the service as a whole more efficient is the other benefit
of integrating service. There is no single definitive model of
integration. Some localities are further advanced than others in
thinking about new ways of delivering it. We are developing the concept
of pioneers to support the rapid dissemination and uptake of lessons
learnt across the country, but we want to encourage local
experimentation as much as we can to allow local areas to
provide integrated care at scale and
pace<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T14:42:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Jolly" PimsId="5895" UID="13031964001244" xid="2109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964001244">Baroness
Jolly:</Member></B> My Lords, there are several common themes between
the report from the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, and his group, and that of
the scrutiny committee of the draft Care and Support Bill, which was
published today. One of those themes is the funding of personal care,
which has to be shared between the individual and the state. As
recommended by the Dilnot commission, will the Government invest in an
awareness campaign to inform people of this situation and the
importance of planning
ahead<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T14:43:04"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13031964001245" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964001245">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> I am sure my noble friend is right that there is a
job of work to do to inform people about the new arrangements that we
are bringing in to implement the Dilnot recommendations. My right
honourable friend the Chancellor’s announcement at the weekend
confirms that we will introduce a cap on care costs and extend the
means test upper capital threshold at the earlier date than previously
announced, namely on April 2016. The reason for the change in date is
to bring it into line with changes to single-tier pensions. We will
need to disseminate this information sooner than we would otherwise

Bakewell:</Member></B> My Lords, when I was appointed the voice of
older people in 2009, these issues were already well appreciated. It is
now 2013. This is an excellent report from the House committee, which
everyone recognises, but I am afraid that it joins many

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, change is an increasing imperative, at
least in my judgment, at local level. I talk not only to professionals
in the health service but to local authorities, which will very soon be
charged with looking in the round at the needs of patients and service
users in their area. They know that with the financial constraints that
are upon us, services need to change in order to remain sustainable and
affordable. That will be a very strong driver to ensure that some of
these very good recommendations are driven forward at

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, the Opposition warmly
welcome the report. I am sure that it will be influential in the way we
develop policies in the future. I was interested in the noble
Earl’s response when he talked about public sector reform. Does
he agree that the overwhelming message of the report is the need for a
fully integrated health and social care system? Is he not as worried as
I am that the changes in the NHS that he is introducing on 1 April will
in fact lead to a disintegrated system in which, instead of
co-operation and integration, competition will become the name of the

Howe:</Member></B> No, I do not agree with that. We have always said
that competition is but one tool in the armoury of commissioners. It is
not a panacea by any means. As for disaggregation, I see the opposite
at local level. Health and social care, public health and patient
organisations are getting together for the first time to break down
silo barriers and the traditional divisions that have

matter raised by my noble friend. The change in the way the information
was presented on NHS Choices was as a result of a formal review, which
happens automatically to all NHS Choices pages every 24 months. The
page on homeopathy reached the formal 24-month review point in January
2011. The policy of NHS Choices is to provide objective and trustworthy

Walton of Detchant:</Member></B> My Lords, more than 10
years ago I chaired an inquiry conducted by your Lordships’
Select Committee on Science and Technology into the field of
complementary and alternative medicine. We examined the evidence in
favour of homeopathy, accepting that certain well qualified doctors
believed in its use. However, at the time we did not discover any
convincing research evidence to suggest that it was better than
placebos. Over the centuries, many medicines have been used that have
been shown to be no better than placebos. Therefore, has the time not
come when it is appropriate for the Government to recognise that, in
the light of recent research, there is no evidence whatever to support
the continued use of homeopathy in the
NHS?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000020"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13031964001255" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964001255">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, we have been consistently clear that no
treatments should be arbitrarily rationed on cost grounds. The NHS
constitution sets out that patients have a right to expect local
decisions on the funding of drugs and treatments to be made rationally
following a proper consideration of the evidence. More importantly in
this context, it is the responsibility of the NHS to make decisions
about commissioning and funding of healthcare treatments and not for
Ministers to second-guess that
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000021"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Winston" PimsId="4649" UID="13031964001256" xid="1499" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964001256">Lord
Winston:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may be permitted to help the
Minister. Many years ago, there was a very interesting study in Wales
of a placebo-controlled trial that showed that, whatever was given, the
best chance of a treatment working, placebo or not, was whether the
doctor who was giving the medicine actually believed in it. Does the
same apply for homeopathy and the Secretary of
State?</hs_para>

is to refer him to the page on NHS Choices that explicitly refers to
the placebo effect. As he will know, the 2010 House of Commons Science
and Technology Committee report on homeopathy said that homeopathic
remedies perform no better than placebos. It is important to emphasise
that message. On the other hand, many people have found benefit from
homeopathic medicines and, in a way, that is their privilege and
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000023"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Gardner of Parkes" PimsId="3383" UID="13031964001258" xid="1170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964001258">Baroness
Gardner of Parkes:</Member></B> My Lords, is the Minister aware that
homeopathy started at a time when the one treatment they gave people
was to bleed them? It was effective because they did not bleed them and
allowed them to recover normally; I was on the board of the Royal
London Homeopathic Hospital for a good many years, where I learnt that.
Does the Minister not think that, faced with a situation where
antibiotics have been used too casually, it is time to look at what we
should not be taking? Does he think it important that patients should
have the right to whatever treatment they choose provided that
homeopathy does not allow them to escape proper diagnosis for cancer or
some other tragic condition, which could be overlooked if it is not
combined with ordinary medicine?</hs_para>

clear in recommending that patients should talk to their GPs before
stopping any treatment that has been prescribed by a doctor in favour
of homeopathy and before they start taking homeopathic remedies. It is

homeopathic remedies, will the Minister ensure that the views of people

Again, we have consistently said, in this and in other areas, that
clinical responsibility for an individual’s health condition
rests with their GP, who must therefore be able to justify clinically
any treatment to which he or she refers someone. As she said, there are
GPs who have a speciality in homeopathy. We recommend that a patient
who is interested in homeopathic treatment should go to such a
GP.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_19_PT_1/E766B09112583A9D8C8B181D4B2A3FC7FED714A8" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 19 March 2013">Tuesday,

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the Bank of England Act 1998
already gives powers of operational responsibility for monetary policy
to the independent Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England.
The Act requires the Treasury to specify the objectives of the MPC at
least once every 12 months. The Chancellor set the remit for the MPC at
Budget 2012 to target inflation of 2%, as measured by the 12-month
increase in the consumer prices

the Chancellor was looking at that remit with the possibility of
changing it. I appreciate that it may have been only a Lib Dem
Budget leak but is it true and, if so, what does he propose to do about

looser monetary policy, and has he told the new Bank governor that that

target would be met in the medium term and that, because the principal
reasons for inflation did not include excessive domestic demand and are
therefore less capable of being moderated by increases in our own
interest rates, it was wiser to “see through” the
temporary increase in inflation above 2% but to work, as the

such sums and amounts under the annual uprating of benefits and tax
credits. As we explained in Committee, we fully intend these amendments

these grounds alone, the Bill is completely unnecessary. If the

of necessity have the highest marginal consumption rates, it is
damaging demand. It ignores the IMF warning that the fiscal stabilisers

correction for the fact that benefits have been uprated at a faster

at percentages rather than cash amounts is misleading. One per cent of

housing benefit: the very support that enables individuals to sustain

that the Government are committed to eradicating child poverty, and of
course we would accept that child poverty is not only about income
levels, but improving income and relative income is an essential
component of tackling poverty, and matters are being made worse by this

I can add to the comprehensive account given by the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie. The only point I would stress was made by somebody on
television last night—that we now live in an environment where
inflation is considerably higher than we were used to in the first
decade of this century. We understand that the new Governor of the Bank
of England advocates that the inflation target should be allowed to
float free. We are in an environment where inflation is set to hover
around 3.5% or higher with no prospect of it reducing. In these
circumstances, to cap the increase in benefits at 1% is simply
unjustifiable. I support the amendment moved so comprehensively by the

Forsyth of Drumlean:</Member></B> My Lords, there is no one in this
Chamber who would not like to see support for those on low incomes and
families to be increased. What was striking when the noble Lord
proposed this amendment was that, apart from a vague suggestion that it
might be possible to find the money by pursuing tax evaders, there was
no indication of where the £3 billion needed to
provide uprating in line with inflation—assuming the
Government’s forecasts are correct—could be found. That
is deeply irresponsible and it is particularly irresponsible of an
Opposition who will not say what they would do in government. In other
words, while it is not their responsibility, their line is “You
should spend the money”, but when it might be their
responsibility, they are not prepared to say what they would do. That
is completely dishonest
politics.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000075">We
have a dangerous position in our country, partly caused by the present
Government constantly harping on about how they have reduced the
deficit by a quarter. According to a poll carried out by ITN
and  
<?notus-xml column=498?>a separate poll by the Centre for Policy Studies, which may not be quite
so objective, when asked the question, “Do you think by the end
of this Parliament the national debt will have gone up by £600
billion, be just the same, or will have gone down by £600
billion?” only 6% got the answer correct: that it will have gone
up by £600 billion. So here we are, living in a country where we
have to make difficult decisions—this Bill is an example of
having to make difficult decisions—and where the vast majority
of people believe that the Government are cutting debt, when in fact
all the Government are doing is reducing the amount by which the debt
is increasing. I will wager that when we have a debate at the end of
this Parliament and come the next election, the Opposition will pursue
the same kind of irresponsible tactics which we see in this amendment.
They will say, “The Government were elected to reduce the debt,
but the debt has gone up by 50%. If we had been in government, it would
have been different”. That is the politics of it.</hs_para>

further is that the energy and fuel costs that the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, spoke of will go up. So how does it help people who are
struggling to say “Your benefits will go up by inflation”

The warning is on the packet. There has been a certain amount of calm

steadily forward into calm waters, and as though the eurozone was
secure. The financial markets, with the euro increasing in value, may
have had that illusion. However, it has all been blown away. I have not
heard any recent news; I do not know whether there has been a decision
yet about 
<?notus-xml column=501?>what Cyprus will do. We should remember that, at the moment, there is a
very real risk. Clearly, people have been caught in Cyprus. If
Portugal, Spain and Italy decide that this will be the European
practice, people there may find that their savings and funds in their
banks are not as secure as they had been assured they were. After all,
everyone thought that there was a clear undertaking that below a

agree with my noble friend Lord Forsyth. All of us in this House would
like to say, “Let’s increase benefits. Let’s deal
with all the hard cases and see how we can give people more
money”. Look at the situation in Ireland, where benefits have
been cut by, I think, 10%. There has been talk of cuts today but in
fact we are taking about how big an increase the Government should
impose, not an absolute cut in the amount. Other countries in Europe
are cutting by 6%, 10% or 12% the actual amount that people are
getting—what hardship that must represent.</hs_para>

speech to make. It is much more popular to say, “Let’s
have some more benefit”. I say this against a background of a
new situation that has suddenly come upon us: if this House—the
unelected House of Lords—decides today to cut right through one
of the decisions made as part of the prudent financial planning to find
our way out of the problems that we are in, and if that triggers a loss
of credibility in our national approach and the Government’s
approach to tackling those serious problems, it will really be a
problem for people on benefits if there is a run and we then find that
the low interest rates that the Government have enjoyed for their
substantial borrowing no longer apply.</hs_para>

our debt. We are not; we are reducing the rate at which the debt is
increasing. One of the blessings that we have had is that at least we

credibility. If the House of Lords today kicks away one of the planks
that help 
<?notus-xml column=502?>to shore up the credibility of a Government who have a plan to try to
deal with our problems, and if those international interest rates are
then demanded of the Government and the country when we try to borrow
money, the problems that we will incur for all our people could be
vastly greater. Look at the tragedies that exist now, such as the

worked for years, trying to deal with those problems and being
concerned about the poor. We have found, though, that you have to be
honest. The reason we have to cut in this way—not cut, but cut

German:</Member></B> My Lords, in his speech moving the amendment, the
noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, made it perfectly clear that it would break
the Government’s policy proposal. There was no indication given
of how much the benefit bill should rise, though the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, indicated his preference. However, that is not what is in
front of the House. If the amendment were to be passed there would be
no proposal as to how much it should rise: 0.5%, 1.5%, 2%, 3% or
whatever. Neither does the amendment offer any solutions: it does not
offer any ameliorations, it does not seek any exemptions. However, Her
Majesty’s Opposition say no to a 1% cap on working-age benefits,
yet support a 1% cap on public sector workers’ pay. It is quite
strange. I sometimes wonder whether we are living in a parallel
universe where the economy is healthy, where there have not been any
fundamental economic shocks and where Cypriots can get all their money

that and the Bill is not set in the sort of financial vacuum that some
Members seem to think it is. I accept that borrowing is higher than it
ought to be, though I wish it were less. I know that we have had to
borrow in order to maintain the essence of our welfare state and I
agree that growth is critical. However, in these tough times the
Government have to take difficult decisions. These decisions are, no
doubt, uncomfortable but it could have been worse. As I said at Second
Reading, there were lots of things on the table for discussion which
could have made this a much tougher prospect for us. As it stands, this
is our biggest budget—the budget where we spend £1 in
every £4 of government money—and, despite all previous
efforts, it is still growing as a proportion of total government spend.
Therefore, no matter what we may think, this budget has to make its
contribution to helping to put our finances back on a sound

debate in the Moses Room in which the Government proposed a
£2.545 billion reduction in the overall welfare spend for
2013-14. Her Majesty’s Opposition rejected this as
“vicious” and “contemptible”. Today, we
have before us in this Bill a budget proposal of £3.7 billion
for the two years following, and that is also rejected by Her
Majesty’s Opposition. Therefore, £6.245 billion of
savings have been rejected in two days. Yesterday—I have not
heard it yet today—I heard a vague assertion about tax
avoidance, but it is my understanding that this Government are spending
far more on tax avoidance than the previous Government did and putting
far more effort into it. When she replies, perhaps the Minister can
tell us how much success the Government have had compared with the
previous Government.</hs_para>

still £6 billion to find, just to round up the figures.

do not think that my noble friends on the Front Bench have made life
easy for themselves by making this a stand-alone Bill. It certainly
should not be viewed that way. It needs to be viewed in the context of
the introduction of universal credit, which will bring about benefits
of £168 a month to 3 million families. That, because of the wage
incentives and the attractiveness of work, will lead to an estimated
300,000 more people finding their way into employment. We need to be

it has started to fall and has been coming down quite steadily for a

me name just a few of those measures. We are expanding early-years
education to ensure that children have access to early education and to
support parents in work. We are attaching additional funding to
disadvantaged pupils through the pupil premium, which will rise to
£2.5 billion a year by 2014-15. We have protected the schools
and NHS budgets to ensure that these vital services continue to support
families. More than £1 billion of investment will go into
schools. We are introducing universal credit—a new, radically
simpler benefit payment designed to ensure that work pays.</hs_para>

my noble friend Lord Bates already has acknowledged, this last change
is about transforming our welfare system. It will significantly
increase the incentive that people have to work. Indeed, we estimate
that it will lead to up to 300,000 more people moving into work. It is
important that we focus on that point for a moment. As my noble friends
have already indicated in their speeches, we must not look at the
changes that we are discussing today in isolation; we must see them in
the wider context of the changes that the Government are making. They
reflect the fact that this Government’s focus is on how to help
people off benefits and into work.</hs_para>

the level of support that people can receive while they are on
out-of-work benefits. For many, this is supposed to be a temporary
state—an interruption between periods of work. By making the
system simpler, by reducing the risks from people moving into work and
by making work pay, we can reinforce that temporary nature and ensure
that more and more people are moving into work. That is what we are
seeking to achieve through universal credit and, as I have said, I ask
noble Lords to bear these wider changes in mind when considering this
Bill and all the amendments that we will debate
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000125" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000125">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:02:21"></hs_TimeCode>
Bill is a short-term change, made at a desperately difficult time, as
we seek to rebalance the public finances. However, in our other reforms
we have made a huge commitment to the long term, a commitment to
changing lives through helping people back to work. Although we still
have challenges in the labour market, the fact is that more
people are moving into work already. Unemployment is falling. Private
sector employment is up by more than 1 million since the election and
the number of people employed is at its highest level ever.</hs_para>

are continuing to provide for a 1% increase in these benefit rates. As
my noble friends have said, this will mean that the value falls in real
terms, which is not a decision that we take lightly, but it is an
increase and we must compare this, as some of my noble friends already
have, with what is happening elsewhere. Ireland has cut unemployment
benefit by 4% a year for two years 
<?notus-xml column=508?>since 2010. Portugal has cut unemployment
benefit by 6%. Spain has cut payments to people who are
unemployed for more than six months by 10%. Let me remind noble Lords
that the UK’s deficit in 2010 was larger—I repeat,
larger—than the latter two countries. I am not saying that that
justifies the measures we are discussing today; they are justified by
the need to rebalance the public finances. However, it is, I hope, a
reminder that these are very difficult times. The actions this
Government have taken and continue to take to reduce the deficit are
helping to secure economic recovery, but there are still tough
decisions to make.</hs_para>

amendments seeks in simple terms to remove the 1% figure from the Bill,
as many of my noble friends have already pointed out, it does not
suggest an alternative. It should be noted that if the amendments
before us were to pass, they would make it possible for the Government
to increase benefits by any amount that they wanted in the years in
question, without reference to prices or any specified factors,
including uprating by less than 1%. Let us assume that the intention
would be to upgrade in line with CPI. That would mean that the
£3 billion in savings from the Bill would not be delivered. I
appreciate that the decisions we have made in the Bill are not easy. We
never claimed that they were. However, they are absolutely necessary.

amendments are not consequential one on another. If Amendment 1 is

Lord Bishop of Ripon and Leeds:</Member></B> My Lords, I will also
speak to the other amendments in this group. Amendments 2 and 8 are
paving amendments for a new clause to protect child benefits and child
tax credits from the effects of this Bill. The substantive amendment to
which they refer is Amendment 11. This follows extensive discussion in
Committee, and is designed to halt the disproportionately negative
effects of the Bill on children and their welfare.
Amendments 13, 14 and 15 are consequential, and no doubt
the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, will speak to her
Amendment 14A.</hs_para>

all households. Of those with dependent children, it affects 87%. Of
lone-parent households, it affects 95%. Conspicuously, 11.5 million
children suffer as a result of this Bill. This is in addition to the
effects that our austerity measures have already had on children. In
2012, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that there would
indeed be a reduction of 0.9% in real-terms income for all households
from 2010 to 2016. For a couple with two children, that fall will
already, without this Bill, be 4.2%: equivalent to a fall of
£215 per year for a couple without children, or £1,250
for a couple with two children. This Bill adds to that discrepancy, and
it is that which cannot be
fair.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000149" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000149">It is
true that we need particular concern for those in or on the verge of
poverty. This Bill fails that test, too. For the poorest 20% of
households, the IFS estimates to which I have referred suggest that the
reduction in income is 7% from 2010 to 2016. In addition, 60% of the
Bill’s savings come from those in the poorest third of our
population, and 3% from those in the richest third. This will mean
that, on the Government’s estimates, 200,000 more children will
be in poverty, half of them in working families.</hs_para>

make us pause to see what other ways there are to make the £0.9
billion savings which the child-related parts of this Bill are designed
to produce in 2015-16. It is not for us today to declare what those
alternatives should be. However, they do exist. Whether through
reducing tax reliefs on pension contributions for the wealthy, or
through introducing national insurance contributions on employer
pension contributions, there are a number of different ways in 
<?notus-xml column=515?>which we could explore raising this money, which
would not affect children in the ways in which this Bill does. We need
to find a way for the burden of our fiscal challenges, so well
described in the previous debate, to fall on those who, like me and
many Members of this House, can afford to meet it, rather on than those
who cannot. <hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>The

these amendments is to defend the nine out of 10 children in this
country who are affected by the Bill. This effect is cumulative; it
comes on top of the reductions already made. It has been argued that
since many people are currently seeing wage increases of only 1%,
benefits should also rise by only 1%. However, this Bill is an
additional blow for those with children whose wages have increased by
only 1%. Not only are their wages declining but, by this Bill,
provision for their children will decline,
too<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. These
benefits affect those in work just as much as those who are not in
work. None of the benefits referred to in these amendments is out an
out of work benefit. This is a transfer of the burden from all of us to
those with children, and that increased burden on children cannot be
right<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000152" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000152">I
continue to be particularly concerned at the continued gradual erosion
of child benefit. The 1% cap comes after three years of the freezing of
child benefit, so it is a cap on a figure that has already been
reduced. From 2011 to 2015, the increase in child benefit will be 2%,
rather than the estimated 16% of CPI over that period. Therefore, a
couple with three children with one earner, such as a corporal in the
Army, will lose £552 a year by 2015. A couple—one a
childminder, let us say, earning £240 a week and the other a
postal worker on £395 a week—with two children will lose
£351 a week by
2015<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

been a crucial part of the support for families in our culture. That is
particularly so for those on low wages. For very many families, child
benefit is explicitly set aside to provide for children. Parents will
struggle by making savings on their own lifestyle, sometimes even by
going without meals themselves, but they will ensure that the child
benefit that they receive is spent on their children. We owe it to the
next generation to ensure that this element of our society, our
children, is not disadvantaged, and certainly not disadvantaged by so
much more than households without
children<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000154" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000154">In
addition, child benefit plays a particular role in support of those in
work because it acts as an earnings disregard in the calculation of
housing and council tax benefits. Any reduction in child benefit is
therefore a disincentive to returning to work. For a two-child
family in work, on a low income and living in rented accommodation, the
cut between 2010 and 2015 is not only the £4.80 a week in child
benefit but an extra £4.10 in lost benefits. This working family
on a low income therefore loses almost £9 a
week<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000155" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000155">I
need to refer briefly to the third element in this package, that of the
lower disability addition of universal credit. That is already being
reduced from its current £57 a week to £28 a week under
universal credit. Now it will be reduced further by this Bill. It seems
extraordinary 
<?notus-xml column=516?>to reduce a benefit before it has even come into
effect, especially when it provides for the needs of disabled children
and their extra financial demands. These children need our support so
they can live full and creative lives, and therefore benefit not just
themselves but all of us. Children already contribute more than their
fair share to our austerity burden. This Bill adds to their burden. I
hope that we shall at least remove this extra pressure on them by
accepting this amendment. I beg to

in this area after failing to receive any comfort at earlier stages of
the Bill. I congratulate the Lords spiritual in general for being
willing to stand up for what they believe, despite the inevitable
volley of artillery that came their way the moment they dared to raise
their heads above the cathedral parapet. It may be that we have them to

remove a number of children’s benefits and credits from the
scope of the Bill. Since we on these Benches wish to remove all
benefits and tax credits from the scope of the Bill, we are pleased to
support it. We have heard at different points in the passage of this
Bill that it has a disproportionate impact on families and
children. The Government’s impact assessment shows that
two-thirds of households affected are families with
children. We also know that the Bill will have a
direct effect on child poverty in Britain. Ministers have previously
announced—as the right reverend Prelate noted—that this
Bill alone will put a further 200,000 children into relative
poverty.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031967000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031967000003">In Committee, I asked
the Minister to tell the Committee what the impact would be on the
three other poverty measures in the Child Poverty Act. I got
nothing back at all. Now the Child Poverty
Action Group has dragged some information from the
Government by means of the Freedom of Information Act—although
it should not have had to use a FOI request to get
it. I would have hoped the Minister could have told us the information
when I asked for it in Committee. The Government have not yet offered a
narrative assessment even of measures, for example, of material
deprivation. However, they were forced to admit what would happen to
the number of children in absolute poverty. In response to that FOI
request, the DWP admitted for the first time that it estimates that
around 200,000 more children in Britain will be pushed into
absolute poverty by this uprating
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031967000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031967000004">This is a shocking
figure, which reveals the depth of what is wrong with this policy. It
also removes the Government’s defence that the problem is with
the relative poverty measure, rather than with the impact on children
themselves. On the back of those figures, some new analysis for the
Child Poverty Action Group by Landman Economics found that an
increase of 600,000 children in absolute poverty
is likely between 2010 and 2015, and that is net of any
improvements as a result of universal credit.</hs_para>

Bill, too many parents go without to ensure that they can heat their
homes and feed and clothe their children. As the costs of food and
energy have soared, more parents spend more of their money on these
basic costs. Yet vital support that they depend upon is being cut in
real terms in order to hand a tax cut to the very richest. It is not
only the Church of England that has come out against these
priorities; Archbishop Peter Smith, vice-president of the Catholic
Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales
stated:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13031967000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031967000030">“It is

archbishop noted something that many of us know: that like many other
charities across the country, Catholic agencies supporting parents find

so many of those families have no alternative way of reducing that
problem. Most victims of this Bill are working families. The parents
are already doing the right thing; they are out working. One of the
real disappointments about the debates we have had is the failure to
acknowledge that, far from this being something that penalises only
people who are not working, it is in fact the very same people who have
had below-inflation or no pay increases and who have struggled
repeatedly to get out, get work and get hours, who are hit by these
cuts to tax and benefit support.</hs_para>

completely inappropriate way to address the uprating of essential state
support for families. We already have perfectly good mechanisms to
uprate annually in the light of inflation and prevailing economic
conditions. These are poor choices for the Government to be making. The
families who will be hit are not responsible for the failure of the
Government to get the economy growing again. They are just doing their
best to manage in difficult times, but the Government are planning to
cut the value of the help that they get from the state to fund a tax
cut for people earning £1 million a year. We should not

previous debate, we went through the arguments for why it is
economically impossible to sustain inflation-related increases. I do
not propose to repeat the arguments, but this amendment would result in
exactly the same position, given that the exceptions proposed by the
right reverend Prelate constitute a large part of the Bill. It is just
a way of saying that, if one was going to make the same savings, one
would have to make bigger reductions in the increases for everyone
else, or else one would have to find the money. Once again, the right

The noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, argues that somehow it is possible
to find money which we have not got and that she is proud to support
the amendment because of the reduction in the top rate of tax paid by
those who she describes as millionaires. I remind her that those people
are paying 5% more in tax than they did under her Government. I also

to increase revenue and therefore to make it possible to do more in

be available for others, but that is not a practical proposition for

borrowing far more than we planned to meet our commitments and to be

respond to the debate, I would be grateful if he would comment on the
following point. He made great play, and I do not underestimate this,
of the effect and impact of limiting the uprating of child benefit and
child benefits generally to 1%. According to Appendix 3 of the helpful
Library note on the Bill, regarding the child tax credit element, in
2011-12 the child element of child tax credit increased by 11.1%, a
significant sum. That followed significant increases of 13% in 2008-09
and 12.5% in 2004-05. If one is to argue that limiting that increase
now to 1% would have a significant effect, if you take it as a
snapshot, that may be the case, but if one looks over time, one has to
factor in those significantly higher-than-inflation increases that have
occurred in the child tax credit element in the

with trading figures with regard to child poverty is that you get some
curious results. One of the most notable is that in 2010 there were
300,000 fewer people in poverty because the recession had caused the

been pulled out of poverty not because anything had changed in their

turn again to a theme in the debate on the previous amendment: one
cannot just take this in isolation. One needs to look at what the Prime
Minister has announced today on childcare, for example, which will make
a significant difference to people by enabling them to move into
employment. One needs to look at the pupil premium or the raising of
tax thresholds, which means that someone on the minimum wage has seen
their tax bill halved under this Government. One has to look at these
things in the round. Unlike the Opposition, we have ring-fenced the
budget for the National Health Service, on which people significantly
depend. Again, in the round, we need to get this absolutely

charge that somehow there is an easy pot at the other end of the income
scale to be tapped into. As a result of this Government’s
actions, the richest pay more tax on capital gains, more stamp duty on
their homes and more tax on their pensions and are less able to evade
tax than was the case before. These factors need to be borne in mind in
the broad reach of these changes that I know when taken in cold,
clinical isolation, one year at a time, without reference to trends
over time, may allow one to draw one conclusion but should be placed in
the proper context. I seem to recall from my youth the good theological
concept of placing individual verses in context in order to understand
their meaning, and one might think it was a good idea to place this one
measure in the broader context in order to understand what the

welcome the measures that we are seeking to take to reduce indebtedness

responsible. A child may live in poor housing or in a troubled area,
have an unstable family environment or attend a failing school. His
parents may not have the skills to get out and get the job that they
need, or they may be in poor health. These are a broad range of issues
that ought to be reflected in our debates about child poverty. In that

We all want to support families with children and ensure that children
in this country have the opportunity to fulfil their potential. We have

will spare noble Lords my speaking notes on the economic context, as we
have already had a full debate on that. The only point I make in
passing, in respect of the Opposition’s policies on deficit
reduction, is that they passed legislation saying that by the
forthcoming financial year it would be illegal not to have
halved the deficit. It is therefore particularly surprising
that they seem to have had no plan at the time to do it and
have given no indication since of how they might have done

I must remind noble Lords again of the baseline from which these
savings are being made. Tax credit expenditure increased by 340% under
the previous Government compared to the benefits they replaced.
Eligibility for tax credits was extended to nine out of 10 families

will give noble Lords one other piece of context. The latest OECD
figures show that of all the developed countries the UK, along with
Ireland, spends the highest proportion of its national income on family
benefits. We are not a country that takes these things lightly or a
country that has not given very high priority to supporting
families<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:02:55"></hs_TimeCode>. We
believe that that is 
<?notus-xml column=522?>absolutely a right priority and we support families
with children as much as we can in the circumstances. Child benefit and
tax credits exist to do that. However, as we have said, we have to
focus resources where they are needed

number of noble Lords, including the right reverend Prelate the Bishop
of Leicester and the noble Lord, Lord Bates, have mentioned that this
Bill is only one of a large number of measures that the Government are
taking which affect families with children, in particular poor families

premium, which will cost the Government £2.5 billion by next
year. This will be worth £900 per disadvantaged child—and
that is £900 in hard times. We are extending flexible support
for early education. Since 2010, all three and four year-olds have been
entitled to 15 hours of free childcare and we are extending this to
260,000 disadvantaged two year-olds from this year. This is immensely
important to these families and it will be worth around £2,900 a
year for the poorest families who benefit—£2,900 extra
per family. We have found these hugely significant sums of money by
making reductions elsewhere, because we place such a large priority on
the poorest

children and grandchildren with a lack of deficit or a deficit that

further point on universal credit, although it has not been the subject
of much debate in this group of amendments. I am sure we will be
dealing with this important issue in more detail when we debate
Amendment 3, to which my noble friend Lady Stowell will respond.

inflation—to more than cover, in the first few years, the
reduction in child benefit. Taking child benefit and child tax credit
together, we have tilted the expenditure away from affluent families

number of noble Lords have talked about the impact of the Bill on child
poverty. As has been pointed out, the Bill is forecast to increase the

to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, my noble friend

<?notus-xml column=523?>wrote to the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, copied to

absolute poverty so, far from seeking to avoid mentioning it, we chose
to circulate it. I am not saying that absolute poverty is not something
we should be extremely concerned about but the term does not mean what
most people think of as absolute poverty. The definition of absolute
poverty is 60% of the median income in 2010-11 uprated to take account
of inflation. The 200,000 children mentioned in respect of absolute
poverty are very largely the same as the 200,000 who are mentioned in

previous stages of the Bill, we have discussed the definition
of child poverty and the importance of tackling child poverty.
We know that if we focus on the relative income line we get
some very odd results. We have pointed out previously that in 2010
300,000 fewer children were said to have moved out of poverty, not
because anything changed in their lives but because the rest of society
got poorer. The estimate on the impact of this Bill does not take
account of policies which would cause child poverty figures to move in
the other direction, such as universal credit which is expected to lift
up to 250,000 children out of poverty, depending on the effect of the
minimum income floor. We take the issues of cash and poverty, as
currently defined, very seriously, but we also think that we need a
broader definition of child poverty. That is why the Government are
currently consulting on a wider
definition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:10:02"></hs_TimeCode>. As I
set out two weeks ago, and repeat today, this Government remain
committed to eradicating child poverty. We believe that income will

focusing our resources on benefits alone is not enough. We have to take

existing schemes offered by fewer than 5% of employers. Families on tax

number of suggestions—not just from me but from a collection of
other people—as to how this money could be raised. At an earlier
stage in our discussions on the Bill, I made suggestions and the noble
Lord, Lord Newby, responded that they were indeed possibilities but not
ones that fitted in with the Government’s current priorities.
That is a perfectly fair response but it is not fair to say that taxing
the winter fuel allowance or dealing differently with things such as
free television licences, tax relief on pension contributions, national
insurance contributions or employer pension costs and so on are not
possible. They are possibilities. I was not quite sure

Forsyth of Drumlean:</Member></B> I am most grateful to the right
reverend Prelate. My criticism was that he did not say which of these
he wanted to do. If the church’s position is that it wants to
tax winter fuel benefits, please say so and say that the money from
that could be used for this purpose. As for increasing taxes on pension
contributions, he may not have noticed but the Government have already
done

It really is not my

church’s view on exactly how the money should be raised. It
is a task to say that there are alternatives and,
indeed, to make suggestions as to how the money might be
raised. There is no policy on exactly how it should be and I do not
think that it would be for me to try to produce the solution to what we

Lord Bishop of Ripon and Leeds:</Member></B> My Lords, I have made a
number of specific suggestions as to ways in which this money could be
provided from elsewhere. My basic point continues to be that it should
not be raised by putting the pressure on children and their families. I
am grateful to the Government—and to the noble Lord, Lord Bates,
for raising the matter—for the child tax credit increase of
£180 in 2011. It has to be said that that was, at the time, only
the first of two announced upratings. The second, of £110, never
happened because of the economic state in which we find ourselves. That
above-inflation increase in child tax credit did something to
ameliorate the pressure put on those in most difficulty, particularly
children, by various other provisions made over the past few
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:18:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000203" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000203">I
am grateful, too, for the announcements that the Minister has made this
afternoon. However, one could say that if 20% of childcare is to be
covered, that still means that those receiving that childcare need to
find the other 80% in order to get the 20%. I absolutely agree with the
Minister when he speaks of the need to tackle root causes and to make
sure that more people are in work. I commend any efforts of any
Government which lead in that
direction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:18:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000204" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000204">However,
these amendments are about children and we have moved much more widely
in our discussion of them. I am still stuck with the statistic that the
decrease in income for a couple without children will be 0.9% over the
five years, but for a couple with two children it will be 4.2%. It is
the differential between those two figures that we need to tackle. I
recognise that attempts have been made to tackle them but they have
been stubbornly unsuccessful so far. In view of the various things that
the Government do for children—I certainly accept that they have
a concern for children—I am sorry that they cannot accept the
amendment. In the light of that, I beg to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13031964000259" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000259">5.20

Low of Dalston:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 3 would remove from
the 1% uprating cap all aspects of the employment and support
allowance, including the personal allowance component, the support
group component for those in the support group and the work-related
activity group component for those placed in the work-related activity
group, which I may shorten to the WRAG as “the work-related
activity group” is a bit of a mouthful and I do not wish to take
up too much of your Lordships’ time—no more time, at any
rate, than I need to. Paragraph (b) of the amendment would also remove
the child disability addition under universal credit from the
cap.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000207" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000207">The
Government have given the impression that disabled people are protected
from the restriction of benefit increases to 1%, but this is not the
case. Some disability benefits are protected—notably disability
living allowance—but that does not mean that disabled people are
protected from the restrictions introduced by the Bill as a whole. The
only disabled people who are protected are those who receive no
benefits other than the disability living allowance. The impact
assessment makes clear that households where someone describes
themselves as disabled are more likely to be affected than those where
there is not a person who describes themselves as disabled: 34% of
households as against
27%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000208" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000208">Even some
benefits specifically targeted at disabled people are not protected.
This applies particularly to employment and support allowance. ESA is
paid at two different levels according to whether claimants are placed
in the support group, meaning that their impairment or condition is
such that they are not expected to look for work, or the WRAG. Both
groups receive a personal allowance of £71 a week but those in
the support group receive a support group component which is paid at a
higher rate than the comparable component paid to those in the
WRAG.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=530?><hs_para UID="13031964000209" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000209">The Government have
given the impression that those in the support group are protected from
the 1% uprating cap but, in truth, only their support group component
of £34 a week is protected: rather less than one-third of their
benefit. This means overall that disabled people in the support group
will see their ESA payments rise by only 1.4% rather than by inflation,
not a lot better than if increases in the whole of their benefit were
capped at 1%. As a result, a disabled person in the support group will
be £62.76 a year worse off. Capping increases in their benefit
at 1% will mean that households receiving ESA in the work-related
activity group will be £87.65 a year worse
off.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031964000210" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000210">However,
it is worse than this. Although some disability benefits and some
disability elements and components may be protected, disabled people
may lose out overall because of the complex interaction of different
benefits and components. Disabled people do not only receive disability
benefits; they have children and rent houses, and so they are not
immune from restrictions in the uprating of children’s benefits,
housing benefit and so on.</hs_para>

support group does not have any other income, they are also likely to
be entitled to housing benefit and council tax benefit. If they have
children, they will also be entitled to child benefit and child tax
credit. It can be seen that protecting the support group component
protects only a small proportion of their overall benefit. For example,
a lone parent who is in the support group and has two children will
have lost £18 a week or almost £1,000 per year by 2015
compared with their position in 2011, simply due to uprating
changes.</hs_para>

disabled people in the UK were found to be living in poverty before the
global economic crisis. Disabled people routinely experience higher
living costs associated with their disability, on things such as
equipment, personal assistance and special diets, for example. In
Committee, the Minister said that ESA for those in the WRAG group is
intended to be a short-term
benefit:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13031964000241" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0001.htm#13031964000241">“Those

People’s impairments often make it very difficult for them to

discriminatory attitudes in the workplace can present insurmountable
barriers. In the current state of the economy, there just are not the

as we know, the work programme, by which the Government set such store,
is just not working. In Committee, the Minister questioned the
rationale for including the personal allowance in the amendment and for
not subjecting it to the 1% cap. She said that treating the personal
allowance differently from that in other parts of the benefit system
would add an element of complexity and undermine the coherence of the
system as a whole. That strikes me as a comparatively technical
objection. If that is her principal concern, I ask her to look at the
position again with 
<?notus-xml column=531?>me before Third Reading and see if we cannot find a way of achieving the

second limb of the amendment would remove the 1% uprating cap from the
lower child disability addition under universal credit. The right
reverend Prelate also spoke about that. This part of the amendment is
particularly necessary given that rates of support for children
in this group are already intended to be halved under universal credit.
At present, families with a disabled child for whom they are in
receipt of some level of disability living allowance may be
entitled to receive support through the disability element of child tax
credit, currently worth £57 a week. Under universal credit, that
support is to be provided through disability additions within
household benefit entitlements. But it is proposed to cut this support
in half to just £28 a week. This change will affect all families
with a disabled child unless the child is receiving the high-rate care

disabled people and their families. I will not repeat the detail now

Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates a growth in the number of
children living in poverty of 400,000 between 2011 and 2015 and 800,000
by 2020. The Minister said in Committee that we cannot set too much
store by such predictions because we do not know what direction
government policy will take. But government policy seems to follow only
a one-way direction of travel in this regard. We do know that the
Government intend to take a further £10 billion out of welfare.
The upshot of that can be only one thing: more child poverty. This
measure can only serve to increase that; indeed, the Government have
acknowledged that it will add 200,000 to the numbers of children in

two years of the previous Government. They were held in the Moses Room;

asked why the Government, in their explanation of the text of the

that I was not to worry my head about these things. There was no
acceptance that the economic ice was beginning to thin and,

he had therefore had the opportunity to use the weekend to explore in
his diary what the publishers thought he needed to know in the coming
year, which they had not supplied in the previous one. It transpired
that the answer was the thickness of

we have argued on previous amendments, it is the vulnerable who are
most affected by the Bill. This is particularly so for those on ESA for
two specific reasons. They are much less able to increase their income
through work and their living costs are generally higher. This is
particularly so for those in the support group, who are furthest from
the labour market, but also for those in the WRAG.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:51:44"></hs_TimeCode> is worth
remembering that there is a rigorous testing process for people who are
unable to work due to ill health or disability. We know that the

successful appeal.</hs_para>

conditionality or otherwise, the route to paid work is not easy, as the
noble Lord, Lord Low, said. We know that the Work Programme has not
covered itself in glory in this regard. As things currently stand,
individuals in the WRAG will lose something like £191 a year by
2015 as a result of this Bill. Those in the support group will fare

from 50% to 45% would be a source of revenue. The Government say that

explain, however, why we have included the personal allowance and the
work-related activity component of ESA in the Bill. The ESA personal
allowance, which is subject to the 1% cap, is there to provide
temporary basic support for everyday needs. It does not reflect
disability or the additional costs of disability: hence it is set at
the same rate as the personal allowance for the other working-age
benefits such as jobseeker’s allowance, income support and
housing benefit. The work-related activity group component—the
additional component on top of the personal
allowance—which is also subject to the 1% cap, is paid to those
who are able to take steps to prepare for a return to work. As such,
they will be referred for appropriate support, training and provision
to ensure that they get the help that they need. It is the support
group component that is paid in recognition of the fact that more
severely ill and disabled people are less likely to be able to increase
their income by moving into work and may have additional needs. That is
why it is paid at a higher rate than the WRAG component, as the noble
Lord, Lord Low, referred to it, and why it has been excluded from the

will give noble Lords some comparison. The WRAG component goes on top
of the personal allowance, which for a single person at the moment is
£71 per week. For those who are considered perhaps to be ready,
with some support, to be able to start thinking about moving back into
work, that is £28.15 a week at today’s rate, while the
support component is currently £34.05 a week. The noble Lord,
Lord Low, questioned whether we were right to describe the work-related
activity component of ESA as a temporary benefit. He may find it
helpful if I remind him and other noble Lords that when the last

has been made to universal credit and to the component of it that is
paid to parents of disabled children. In universal credit, a similar
distinction is drawn between people who are in what we are currently
calling the WRAG group and those who are in the support group: hence,
the disabled child additions and their adult equivalents in universal
credit are to be paid at a lower and a higher rate. The lower rate of
the disabled child addition reflects that the parents are more able,
with the right support, to move towards work. That is why it is part of
this Bill. It is a payment that is made to the parents of children.
However, the higher rate of the disabled child addition
reflects the fact that parents of a severely disabled child who
are entitled to the higher rate may not be able to increase their
incomes through work. That is why it is not part of the Bill. That
distinction is mirrored across into universal

stress again that the personal allowance—the payments for which
increases will be capped at 1%—are not those that are paid to
cover the additional costs associated with a person’s
disability. There are fundamental distinctions here between additional
cost disability benefits, such as DLA, which we have protected, and
employment and support allowance; between the ESA support group
component, which we have protected, and the WRAG and the personal
allowance; and, finally, between parents providing care to a child
receiving the higher rate of the universal credit disabled child
addition, which we have protected, and the lower rate that is paid to
parents who, with some support, could return to

all of us are concerned to see disabled people receive the support they
need, it might be helpful for me to outline for noble Lords some of the
wider support that the Government provide for disabled people. The
Government are spending nearly £50 billion a year supporting
disabled people. One of the ways in which we are doing this is by
investing £320 million on disability employment programmes. I
hear the comments that were made by the noble Lords, Lord Low and Lord
McKenzie, about the Work Programme, but I disagree with them. I would
also say that we have a scheme for disabled people called Access to
Work, which in 2011-12 supported over 30,000 people at an average cost
of over £3,200. We have invested more, another £15
million, in this area for this spending review. We have another
programme called Work Choice, which provides tailored support to help
disabled people facing the most complex barriers to employment find and
stay in work. It is voluntary, and payable regardless of any benefits

different benefits that apply to disabled people and have been involved

is worth me making the wider point that the latest OECD figures show
that the Government spend a 
<?notus-xml column=537?>higher proportion of GDP on disabled people’s
benefits and services compared with the rest of the EU. Of
34 countries, only Norway and Iceland spend more. We take

Low of Dalston:</Member></B> I am grateful to all those who have spoken
and to the Minister for her full reply. A fair amount of the discussion
has been taken up with where we are going to get the money. It is
certainly not my job to answer for the Opposition as to where they
would get the money from, but I would say here that without wanting to
open up a general discussion again on the management of the economy,
especially at this stage of the debate, I do take the view that you can
borrow your way out of a recession. This is a paradox, of course, and
it is not clear how it is the case at first blush. However, running a
national economy, where one person’s expenditure cut is a cut in
someone else’s income, is different from running a domestic
economy.</hs_para>

is a clear difference of view here with those on the Benches to my
left. I am not an economist but I would ask people to accept that there
is a very respectable and quite populous strand of opinion that
supports the proposition that I have just enunciated. It is not so
self-evidently barmy, as was suggested earlier in the debate, to say
that the Government would be able to meet the cost of these amendments
by borrowing more. There is respectable opinion to support that. To
those who say that the Government are already more in debt and
borrowing more than they would like to be, I simply say that there is
no reason why they should not borrow a bit more. If the amount of extra
borrowing that they are engaging in is still not achieving lift-off for
the economy, they just have to borrow a bit more until they do. I know
that that will not commend itself to this side of the House, but it is
a respectable point of view and it is the position that I
take.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031982000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031982000031">We have
been asked about the cost of the amendment. As the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, has said quite clearly, that obviously depends on a range of
factors. One of those factors is certainly the rate of inflation.
Therefore, it cannot be precisely quantified. In any case, the question
about what we would do to get the extra money is answered by what I
have already said in response to the Minister. A more pertinent
question 
<?notus-xml column=538?>than how one would find the money is when one would find the money. The
answer of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie—a year at a
time—is perfectly reasonable. Labour is prepared to say that it
would uprate at the rate of inflation in the first year that we are
talking
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031982000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031982000032">The
only other thing I want to say in response to the Minister is that the
Government have essentially been peddling a myth when they say that
they are protecting disabled people in this Welfare Benefits Up-rating
Bill. They are only partially doing so. The Government ought to be
straight with the British people. I repeat: they are only partially
protecting disabled people. It is because I believe that the Government
should deliver on their pledge to fully protect disabled people with
this benefits uprating measure that I have brought this amendment to
the House. It is also why I ask the House to support it, and why I
would like to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13031982000116" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031982000116">6.12

Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</Member></B> My Lords, my
Amendments 4 and 9 in this group take us
into much lighter territory. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth
of Drumlean, will understand and relax, because the purpose of the
amendments is not to attack the savings which it is the
principal purpose of the Bill to achieve but only to protect the
position of benefit recipients should the Office for Budget
Responsibility’s estimates for inflation be exceeded by 3%,
which is the figure that I have chosen for the purposes of the
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031982000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031982000035">The
amendments are different from those which have gone before because,
apart from anything else, they are much less susceptible to attack on
grounds of financial privilege. A problem that I had with some of the
earlier amendments, and I share some of the analysis, was
that they were prone to attack on those grounds. I think that those of
us who participated in consideration during the passage of the Welfare
Reform Act last 
<?notus-xml column=542?>year felt that financial privilege was being used rather rashly in the
other place, but the purpose of this House is to persuade the House of
Commons perhaps to think again about some of the legislation that comes
to
us<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031982000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031982000036">Amendment
4 would simply disapply the 1% limit on benefit uprating in the event
of inflation reaching 3%. I would be interested in the view on this of
the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, because he knows a lot more about it than
do. Judging where inflation will come out in September 2013 and
September 2014 is an inexact science. We will learn tomorrow what the
Office for Budget Responsibility and the Chancellor think about the
situation, but the two years covered in the Bill, September 2013-14 and
September 2014-15, are considered to be facing inflation increases of
2.6% and 2.2% respectively. The purpose of the amendment is to ask what
happens if those estimates are wrong. They are forecasts; they are not
scientifically worked through. We have therefore to ask ourselves what
we do as a legislature if inflation reaches
3<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031982000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031982000037">Change
in the real-terms value of benefits is very sensitive to inflationary
increases. I have said that the Office for Budget
Responsibility’s baseline is 2.6% for September 2013 and 2.2%
for September 2014. That reduces the real value of benefits by 4% and
produces a saving of £3 billion; that is already agreed and
is in the Bill. However, checking Library figures, I am advised
that if inflation exceeds Office for Budget Responsibility estimates by
1% in the two years covered by the Bill, it will reduce the real value
of benefits in the hands of claimants by 6% and result in a windfall
saving to the Treasury not of £3 billion, which is what the
deficit reduction programme is looking for, but of £5.1 billion.
You can multiply the figures. If the OBR baseline is exceeded by 2%,
that reduces the real value of benefits by 8% and produces a windfall
saving for the Treasury of £7.2 billion. I have no way of
knowing whether any of that will happen. All I seek with this amendment
is to ask what the Government will do if it does.</hs_para>

is slightly worrying and has been getting worse since the coalition
Government promulgated this policy some months ago. We will learn more
about this in the Budget tomorrow. The Budget may well be—and
some of us will argue that it should be—looking to promote
growth and loosen some of the constraints on inflation that the Bank of
England’s Monetary Policy Committee is required to oversee.
However, we have a Bank Governor-designate in Mr Mark Carney, who comes
with a reputation of being prepared to live with higher levels of
inflation. If that happens, then the 3% figure in the amendment may
well be breached sooner rather than later. In some of the earlier
debates the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, rightly adverted to the fact
that the markets are already pricing in higher inflation in the short
term over the two years that the Bill
covers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031982000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031982000039">As a
legislature, we now face an increasing risk of inflation for these two
financial years; I put it no higher than that. We very much need to
take that into account. The CPI calculation of inflation is a national
figure, worked out with average figures on a statistical basis, but
someone said to me the other day that 
<?notus-xml column=543?>childcare costs have gone up 6%, as anybody who has studied the
incidence of rising costs on low-income families will know. That is a
long way in excess of the general CPI rates that we face, as with food
prices, rents and energy prices, particularly for the low-income
families that I am concerned about.</hs_para>

noble friend for the considerable discussion that we had about this. He
was generous in considering what I said, but it would be helpful if the
House knew what the Government would do if the 3% inflation figure was
breached. I am reasonably content that there are overriding powers in
the Social Security Acts, but I do not think there are in the Tax
Credits Acts; I might be wrong about that. What happens if something
untoward happens to inflation and we end up in the 2014 and 2015 fiscal
years with something unexpected suddenly coming over the horizon?
Surely some of these reductions in the value of benefits that I
have alluded to would be quite unconscionable as a windfall
increase to the Treasury’s coffers in a way that is not
intended, as I understand it, but may well happen by
mistake<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:34:30"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031982000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031982000041"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" PimsId="3285" UID="13031982000983" xid="1225" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031982000983">Lord
Forsyth of Drumlean:</Member></B> I have looked carefully at my noble
friend’s amendment and listened to his speech with care, but he
does not provide the remedy in the amendment. It simply says that the
uprating limited to 1% is cancelled if inflation reaches 3%. Would he
indicate why he chose 3% and what the remedy would be? If he specifies
a remedy, then we are back into the argument about
cost<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:35:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</Member></B> The remedy would simply be that if
3% was breached, then the clauses in the Bill fall and there would be
the default position of an annual uprating process. It would be
at the Secretary of State’s discretion with the usual provisions
of Section 150 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. It would
be taken year by year and would say that inflation was forging ahead in
an unforeseen way. For myself, I would listen to an argument that said
that we should stick to 1% on costs shown in those circumstances, but
if 3% was breached we would go back to the status quo. That does not
have a cost at all.</hs_para>

Forsyth, and I have been doing government uprating statements for 30
years together and I have never known a Government not get an uprating
statement that they wanted if they had a majority. That is what I think
would happen in these circumstances. However, the Secretary of State
would be obliged to come back and say to both Houses that the
circumstances were not what he had anticipated or what the Office of
Budget Responsibility had calculated and that therefore there would be
a chance for reconsideration. That is all I ask.</hs_para>

and Clause 2(4) of the Bill give the Treasury power to protect itself
from the downside. These clauses say that if inflation falls below 1%
it will not admit the full 1% uprating and will reserve the right to
adjust it. Yet there is no limit to which the Treasury will allow
inflation to increase before it comes back and argues its case in
Parliament one way or  
<?notus-xml column=544?>the other. There is a 50:50 chance of this
happening. I believe in my heart of hearts that the
Government would respond to that. I do not believe it would be at all
conscionable to leave 3.5% or 4% inflation with these 1% caps for the
two years in this Bill.</hs_para>

We need some inflation-proofing and protection for recipients of
benefits in the two years covered by the Bill if inflation races ahead.
That is the burden of the argument. It is no more and no less than
that. I do not think that it would be attacked on the grounds of
financial privilege. It has no direct effect, as I see it, on deficit
reduction. I am content that the Government get £3 billion
in savings, but not content that they get £5 billion
or £7 billion, because that is not what the Bill is designed to

2015, in excess of 40,000 cancer patients will be claiming ESA. It is
the main benefit claimed by cancer patients, as we have already heard.

cancer patients in the support group will see their ESA payments rise

been expected with the CPI level as was in September 2012. I
cite the £138 figure, but I am conscious that we do not yet know
the true effect of the Bill. That figure shows how far ESA will fall
behind inflation if the consumer prices index were to remain at the
September 2012 level of 2.2%. However, it has now risen to 2.7%. If, as

and foremost are two things. The first is the control of inflation and
the second is the creation of employment. They will help the
poor more than anything else. If we fail to tackle the debt, the cost
of borrowing will rise, as my noble friend Lord Forsyth has said. If
the cost of borrowing rises, inflation will rise on the back of it.
Therefore it follows that tackling the deficit is the best thing that
can be done to help the poor. In table 2 on page 6 of its
forecast, the OBR estimates that inflation will be: 2.6% in 2013-14;
2.2% in 2014-15; 2% in 2015-16; and 2% in 2016-17 and thereafter. It is
clearly assessing that the culmination of the effect of these and other
measures being taken is to move us towards a situation in which
inflation is on a steadily downward course. That is the OBR’s
assessment, which was used as the basis of the 2012 Autumn Budget
Statement. As noble Lords have said, we will find out tomorrow where we

provides a report that influences the minimum wage. The report was

it, too, provides a lock. Despite in previous incarnations being
against the minimum wage, the Government have said that they support
the minimum wage and have always accepted the recommendations of the
Low Pay Commission to increase income as a result. Taking that together
with the changes to universal credit that are deemed to be providing
additional benefits to people estimated at £168 a month for 3
million families and the likely increase in tax thresholds and their
impact on the salaries and incomes of the poorest in our society, it

would not apply and there has to be an annual assessment, as happens at
the moment. That assessment might lead to a 1% uprating, or to some
other form of uprating, but there would not be the automatic

has worked quite hard to differentiate himself from the noble Lord,
Lord Kirkwood, and his amendments. The suggestion that somehow having
this provision in the Bill will fuel wage inflation across the land,
fuel expectations up and down the country and bring the economy to a
halt is, frankly, frivolous and a nonsense. The noble Lord knows that
full well. He is an experienced parliamentarian and an able debater,

that if that is the Opposition’s view, is it also their view in
respect of public sector pay? If inflation turned out to be

entirely unobjectionable and I cannot see

they have to say what level of inflation, what level of real decrease
in people’s circumstances, they would find acceptable, because
that would be the consequence of rejecting the amendment. This is a
very modest proposition. I really am surprised at the trouble that the
Government are having with accepting it. I would hope at least that the

towards the target in the medium term. In the final year of the Bill,
the current forecasts show that inflation for the purposes of uprating

Statement. The OBR produces independent and authoritative forecasts for
the economy and public finances and we take decisions based on

it now. It is relevant to the point that was made by my noble friend
Lord Forsyth. The purpose of the Bill, as we have debated about 20
times since Second Reading, is to give some certainty to the
Government’s fiscal plans. The reason we are doing that is that
a number of international bodies and rating agencies have said that
this has a specific and significant impact on the way that they view
the UK’s prospects. Entrenching something in a Bill has the
effect of giving a degree of certainty, which is immensely useful with
regard to the markets.</hs_para>

Forsyth has said, there seems to be a sense that the markets think that
we in the UK are in a very good position and that a little tweak here

the markets feel that something is going wrong. Once that feeling takes

servants have seen their pay frozen and then increased by 1%. When
inflation rose to 5.2% in 
<?notus-xml column=552?>September 2011, many public servants were in the
middle of a pay freeze. The Opposition supported that policy and there
was no inflation guarantee within it. This includes, for example, many
hard-pressed personal advisers in jobcentres who are on modest incomes
and are having to see restraint in their pay in these very tough times.
That is the right policy. However, the consequences have been that many
out-of-work benefit recipients have seen higher cash—yes,

Young of Hornsey:</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to open this
second debate on ethics and sustainability in fashion, especially as
there is a full-page account of a round-table discussion on the subject
in today’s <I>Guardian</I>. I am particularly grateful to
colleagues on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Ethics and
Sustainability in Fashion for their hard work and to the Centre for
Sustainable Fashion for providing a secretariat alongside MADE-BY.
Special thanks go to Dilys Williams, the head of the CSF, for bringing
me up to date on key
developments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000002">Fashion
is about so much more than the clothes we wear. It may be an expression
of our professional and personal identities, an expression of where and
how we see ourselves in relation to our peer group, our cultures, our
families and communities, and an expression of our creativity and our
sense of fun. However consciously or otherwise we do it, as we dress,
so we make a statement, even if the statement is, “I
don’t care or think about what I wear”.</hs_para>

However, better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T19:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>
than most, the Minister will be aware of the size of the UK fashion
industry and of its contribution to the economy. The estimated amount
spent on clothing in the UK in 2011 was £43.9 billion. Despite
the high level of garment manufacture carried out overseas, the
estimated value of UK-manufactured clothing and textiles in the UK was
£8.1 billion in 2011, and the overall estimated export value of
UK clothing and textiles was £7.3
billion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000004">If we
take the volume of clothing sales and look at the global nature of the
supply chain, and then start to unpack what that means in terms of the
relationship between the environment and consumption, a worrying
picture emerges. The Waste and Resources Action Programme, known as
WRAP, reported in <I>Valuing Our Clothes</I> that we have stashed away
in our wardrobes some £30 billion-worth of clothes, unused for

<?notus-xml column=558?>a year. About a third of the clothing we no longer
need ends up in landfill—that is, around 350,000 tonnes or an
estimated £140 million-worth of used clothes. On average, the
global water footprint of a UK household’s clothing exceeds
200,000 litres a year—enough to fill more than 1,000 bathtubs to

have to work much harder and be more creative and inventive about how
we tackle these problems. Not enough of us make connections between

Defra were presented with the Global Leadership Award in Sustainable
Apparel by the Swedish Sustainable Fashion Academy in Stockholm last

dyes are a case in point. For a start, fabrics are dipped or washed in
dyes that are made using copious amounts of precious water. In spite of
regulations intended to ensure that the excess, dye-laden water is
treated before being disposed of, it is cheaper to dump the dye
effluent than to clean and reuse it. The <I>Wall Street
Journal</I>’s report on an instance of severe pollution in China
where a river literally ran red makes chilling reading. Of course, by
not treating water, costs are kept low, as demanded by large retailers
wanting to sell cheap clothes to their customers in the USA and
Europe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000009">Consumers
need to make the links between their desire for cheap clothing and the
loss of livelihoods through depleted, polluted fishing stocks and ever
diminishing food and water resources. Add to that the fact that more
than 400 people have died in fires in Bangladesh and Pakistan in the
past six months, with at least one of the factories involved producing
garments for a British retailer, and we have to acknowledge that our

our high-profile “heritage” British brands, such as
Burberry, Aquascutum and Crombie, is often all or
mostly made outside the

imperative that we work with colleagues internationally to secure more
effective international standards on, for example, sophisticated
factory inspection measures, labelling countries of origin and
instituting traceability mechanisms and so on. Thanks to the horsemeat

equivalent to the horsemeat issue, if I may put it that way, in

International, which has worked ceaselessly to try to persuade
Governments and the EU to work harder to stop this practice—but

that education and awareness-raising have a crucial role to play.

platforms for initiatives, supporting change-makers and investigating
the risks of not thinking through the consequences for environmental
sustainability. This leadership role should also be concerned with

BIS agenda because of the manufacturing element and also because of the

Patten:</Member></B> My Lords, the more alert of your Lordships may
notice that I seem to be the only member of the Tory party Back-Bench
fashionista tendency rising this evening. I do that for a number of
reasons. One is that I admire what the British fashion industry
produces. The noble Baroness referred to that in her introductory
speech, and I will not repeat it. I also admire very much the
creativity of the British fashion industry. About a month ago, I was
very glad to be at my first ever London Fashion Week show, the Matthew
Williamson show. I sat in rapt attention on the edge of the seat:
indeed, the seats seem to have been designed to ensure that you sat in
rapt attention during the whole show watching the models sashay past.
It is no wonder to me that the British fashion industry is growing and
is contributing so much. Certainly, it is one of the top 20 productive
sectors in this country, which has to be a very good thing.
The imagination of the British fashion industry is also good. We can
see a Matthew Williamson or a Stella McCartney dress being
paired with something from Primark or Topshop. That has gone all over
the globe, which is much to the credit of those involved.</hs_para>

the ethical issues must be addressed, and I have four points that I
wish to make. My first point is the only one which I believe is unique
to the fashion industry; namely, that the fashion industry has done a
bit, but not enough, to discourage the image of the thin, verging on
anorexic, and therefore ill, model in its shows and photographs and the
casting agencies which cast these models. Occasionally, there is a bit
of breast-beating about it, but I do not think that there is a
continuing programme to discourage 13 and 14 year-old girls and
boys who want to be models one day. Its message should be to eat
responsibly, just as the drink industry should tell people to drink
responsibly. I urge the noble Baroness, with her influence in the
fashion industry, to press this
hard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000035">My
second point is that I do not think there is anything peculiar or
unique to the fashion industry in the need to manage the supply chain
properly and responsibly. It is not just in fashion that we see these
problems; it is in the use of children in other parts of the world in
manufacturing carpets and toys, as well as in the use of young people
who are not very well paid in putting chips into hand-held telephones.
A responsible corporation monitors the supply chain and makes sure that
it treats those who work in it properly. Much more needs to be done by
good corporations in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000036">Thirdly,
a very good tool is to hand in the condign punishments available under
the UK’s Bribery Act and bribery legislation. UK companies which
permit their supply chains to bribe and act in a corrupt way are those
which do not treat their workforces very well. We should ensure that
the Bribery Act provisions

Young of Hornsey, for securing this debate. As has been mentioned, the
all-party group has a very wide agenda. Included under the heading of

materials, in particular, cotton. One of the most disturbing and
difficult examples is that of cotton picking in Uzbekistan, which has
already been flagged up by the noble Baroness, Lady Young. Uzbek cotton
accounts for 10% of the world’s harvest, ranking third in the
world. It is, of course, a very important product for the country,
making up 20% of its GDP and approximately 40% of its hard currency
export earnings. The legacy of Uzbek’s history with the old
USSR, with its continued command economy, does not provide a happy
situation either for the farmers or the cotton pickers.</hs_para>

system is forced upon farmers and that, together with the
government-set price, means that farmers cannot cover their expenses.
Lack of profit leaves no money for investment in machinery, which leads
to a continuing heavy reliance on cheap labour. Incidences of minimal
payment or no pay at all means that many adults go elsewhere to find
work, often to neighbouring countries. The Uzbek Government then step
in with a system of forced labour, mostly, but not entirely, made up of
children. Some schools in the cotton-growing areas are forced to close
between September and November for the picking season so that children,
some as young as 10 years old, can be sent to the fields to pick cotton
for seven days a week. Children in rural areas are required to carry
out weeding of the cotton fields during May and June. The children who
pick the cotton have a quota to reach which varies, depending on the
local circumstances, between 60 pounds and 110 pounds of raw
cotton per
day.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000041">This is
by any other name slave labour and it is not confined to children. The
Government of Uzbekistan also forcibly mobilise teachers, public
servants and employees of private businesses to harvest the annual crop
manually. Failure to comply can mean the loss of employment and/or
pension rights. The Cotton Campaign has a list of demands for
Governments and companies, and, of course, cotton traders, calling on
them to use 
<?notus-xml column=565?>due diligence in their supply chains, to demand
respect for human rights and to require Uzbekistan to abide by the
employment conventions of the ILO, to which it is a signatory. In 2008,
the country ratified the ILO convention on the minimum working age and
the ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of Child
Labour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000042">I hope

It has joined forces with Asia Floor Wage in calling for a living wage

Stone of Blackheath:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps because of our
society’s destructive obsession with speed and short-termism,
fashion is often neither ethical nor sustainable. In many fields we
fail to consider the long-term effects of what we do: in politics, it
is the next term’s votes; in the media, it is weekly ratings; in
business, it is tomorrow’s share prices; and in fashion,
consumers want today’s new look. At Marks &amp; Spencer, I was
taught by the late Lord Seiff about good human relations in industry.
We were not only concerned with the long-term satisfaction of our
customers and of our shareholders who were often with us for life, we
were also frugal with our use of resources. We used minimal packaging;
we did not have fancy window displays; we used low-energy lighting; and
even our relationship with our suppliers was that of a long-term
partnership. We mainly bought our goods in the UK, but even when we
moved some production abroad, we ensured that there was fair pay and
good conditions in the factories that made our clothing. Home
production is an issue to which I will
return.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000044">The
consumer, too, has a role in this. How does he or she decide what to
buy? A brilliant mind in this field, as was mentioned, is the designer,
artist and academic, Professor Helen Storey at the Centre for
Sustainable Fashion at the London College of Fashion. She is involved
in a project that seeks to explore and understand more deeply the
relationship between us and our desire to acquire. At the heart of the
question posed by this debate lies our understanding of human actions
in relation to material consumption habits. Here in the western world
we are consuming and wasting at a rate that threatens our own health
and that of the planet. The fashion industry exemplifies the complexity
and extreme nature of human society’s obsessive cycle of
creation and destruction, but it is also a great place to find
solutions. Fashion sits at a point that crosses economics, aesthetics,
psychology, creativity and our individual notions of who we are. This
research will produce some really interesting results.</hs_para>

exposed to this understanding. Many companies in the retail industry
tick the boxes in terms of ethical and sustainable initiatives but do
not have them high on their agenda because their one-year operating
plans are dominated by recession survival and the complexities of
multichannel retailing. As we found this week with controlling the

importance of fashion design in this country. From Stella McCartney to
Vivienne Westwood, we are clearly world market leaders. It is also
important that we should highlight the importance of ethical fashion,
which was brilliantly highlighted in this House by the noble Baroness,
Lady Young of Hornsey, and outside it by Livia Firth, who is better
known in this field than her famous actor husband.</hs_para>

horrors of Primark, which were referred to earlier. It was accused of
exploiting third-world employees to produce dresses that it was cheaper
to wear once, throw away and replace with another than to dry clean.
However, the big companies have begun to catch on. I commend to the
noble Lord, Lord Young, and others—I do not know why I picked on
him—the Gucci ecologically 100% traceable bag. It is not black
but a burgundy brownish red because this is the best vegetable-sourced
colour. The leather is sourced from cows reared without causing
deforestation and the handle is made from bamboo that grows like a
weed. Gucci may sell furs, but this bag is a

not only major companies that have caught on. The United Kingdom has
Brora, which sources ethically produced fibre from the Mongolian goat

started in 2001 and is recognised as a pioneer in fair trade and
environmentally sustainable fashion. It both provides desirable fashion
and works to improve the lives and environment of workers and farmers
in developing countries. UK manufacturers do not just provide jobs.

can the Government do? That is the Question put by the noble Baroness.
I am not a great believer in government intervention, but if we accept
that demand for high-end value manufactured goods made here rather than
in China is good for the United Kingdom, the Government could, first,
encourage universities to concentrate courses on manufacture rather
than just design; secondly, following the reference to Vince Cable,
contemplate the creation of manufacturing hubs, or
“catapults” to use the jargon, to encourage
manufacturing; and, thirdly, in their export drives, promote
manufacturers and suppliers of ethically produced clothing that is made

other noble Lords said, with a large carbon footprint. It has left
behind it a trail of eco-destruction. Now, fortunately, efforts are
being made to counter the existing structures of the industry. As usual
it is the Scandinavians and not us who are in the lead, as they always
are on environmental issues. I commend to noble Lords the work of the
Nordic Fashion Association, which was briefly touched on in other
speeches. It has a very wide range of projects and amazing coverage in
the Scandinavian press. One of the main emphases of the NFA is
eco-design: integrating sustainability into garments at the design
stage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000055">Among
high-profile figures in the UK, I commend in particular Vivienne
Westwood for her work on climate change. A couple of years ago I went
to speak at a literary festival in Hanover. I gave my speech on climate
change. It was followed by the Handel opera “Semele”,
performed in the same long, elegant gallery 
<?notus-xml column=568?>where Handel first presented it. This was “Semele” with a
difference. It was called “The Semele Walk” and featured
models parading in Vivienne Westwood costumes. All the singers in the
opera were also dressed in Vivienne Westwood clothing. It was a
brilliant adaptation. She chose “Semele” because it is
about the battles of the gods, and climate change is about our battles
with the immense forces that we have
created.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000056">Sustainability
is becoming important in the fashion industry around the world. There
are many initiatives in North America. The annual Eco Fashion Week
debate has been going for six years and attracts 2,000 people from the
industry. Even more important is China, where the picture is very
mixed. In some respects this echoes what my noble friend said about
another part of the world close by. The turnover of the garment
industry in China is about $60 billion a year. Most of the money is
earned from exports, mainly to the West. There are massive
contradictions here. On the one hand, children work all hours to
produce cheap garments for the western market. The film “China
Blue” is a very good exposition of this. On the other hand,
sustainable fashion is now talked of as widely in Hong Kong and
Shanghai as it is in London. I admire the designs of Ma Ke, who makes

are two questions that I would like to ask the Minister arising from
this. First, all this is worthwhile but it seems to be nibbling at the
edges of the global garment trade and it could degenerate into eco-chic
concentrated at the high end of the industry. Is it possible to
generalise it to the industry as a whole? Secondly, how do we get the
big corporations more involved? As far as I can see, there are many
corporations involved, but mainly their corporate responsibility
department, which is usually a minor part of the business. We surely
need companies to be much more integrated in the whole design process
to transform it, and I would welcome the Minister’s comments
on
that.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_19_PT_1/49D6D9FC58F750E8CD577A2C0BA4739CF32772EC" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 19 March 2013">Tuesday,

overview of the issues. I am glad that the debate is to be answered by

not intended to speak—I should be singing—but I wanted to
make a couple of short points. However, they have all been made by
other speakers and so I will quickly pick up on a couple of matters
that other people have spoken to and expand them a little. My noble
friend Lord Stone spoke about buying less and wearing it more. That is
absolutely at the heart of how we change human behaviour in this area.
It will be difficult because in the developed world we have become
addicted to over-consumption, and fashion is no exception. I am a
complete serial offender in this respect. I have that wardrobe full of
misguided purchases, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Young, referred,
which were 
<?notus-xml column=569?>bought in haste and without due consideration. I am very ashamed of it,
but unfortunately that does not stop me doing
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000060">We buy too
much of everything because we can and because the market is geared
towards high volume and low costs, as we have heard from many other

profligate.</hs_para>

issue for Governments of all complexions because the prevailing
economic orthodoxy says that consumption equals growth, and growth is
the only game in town. I can see that we have got problems but we
should surely be wondering whether that model is itself sustainable. I
rather doubt that it
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000062">Fashion,
of course, is very much about novelty and therefore inevitably about
consumption. However, at its best it is also about beauty, craft, skill
and durability, and it is often about small businesses doing one thing
really well. Does the Minister agree that one of things the Government
can do is to put as much support as they can behind small businesses in
fashion, as well as trying to persuade the large businesses to change
their practices, which I do not deny is extremely
important?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000063">We
must not forget that sustainable fashion is, of course, about
sustainability, but it is mainly about fashion. If we do not get the
fashion part right—that is, if the fashion that comes as
sustainable is not as good as, if not better than, other fashion
choices we could make—then it will never get off the ground.
That is why we need small businesses that have creativity built into
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000064">My final
point goes to the heart of how we can keep those small businesses
coming: our education system. The system that we have at present, as we
have already heard, has allowed some very talented people to come
through and has allowed the fashion industry in this country to be
world beating in many respects. If we do not keep the education system
balanced so that the creative education necessary to allow those
talents to emerge is properly sustained and valued, we shall find in a
few years’ time that we are not the world beaters that we once
were. I would extend that into the higher education sector where, as I
should probably have said at the start, I have a personal interest in
the excellent work of the Centre for Sustainable Fashion, which has
been mentioned many times today, because my son works for it. What he
has learnt through being part of that team has engaged my interest and

it remains surprising that the Government pay so little attention to
the fashion sector, as it is a major player in our economy. As the
recent WRAP report, <I>Valuing our clothes</I>, identifies, clothing
accounts for around 5% of the UK’s annual retail expenditure,
with consumers spending £44 billion a year on buying clothes, or
around £1,700 per
household.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000068">Many
UK clothing producers, particularly small businesses, as my noble
friend Lady McIntosh identified, are putting ethical and sustainable
fashion at the heart of their business models. They are making a point
of celebrating quality manufacturing, greater longevity, respected
craft skills and locally sourced materials. However, to expand further
they need greater investment in production skills, improved training
and a higher status, which would encourage the next generation to
believe that the sector has a future. Will the Minister update the
House on the steps being taken by BIS and other departments to build up
our UK textile capacity and attract the brightest and best young people
into UK sustainable textile production and design for the

a wholesale shift towards sustainable and ethical fashion means that
all the major production and retail businesses in the sector have to
commit to change. I am very proud of the work being done by WRAP in the
Sustainable Clothing Action Plan to sign up a list of companies
prepared to work towards ambitious targets on sustainability by 2020.
Already, major retailers such as John Lewis, Primark and Marks &amp;
Spencer are involved. Together they are addressing a range of
environmental challenges such as the overuse of scarce water in
production, the fact that a third of discarded clothing goes straight
to landfill and the short lifespan of most clothing with resulting

wardrobe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000070">The
Sustainable Clothing Action Plan is providing businesses with practical
tools to deliver change, such as how to accurately measure the
environmental footprint of the clothes they produce, how to design
clothes with a longer active life, how to give consumers consistent
information so that they can see the benefit of changing their
behaviour and how sustainable business models can bring financial
benefits as well. For example, it has worked out the financial
advantages of retailers providing repair services for their own
garments, extending clothing hire services, offering a buy-back and

several noble Lords have said,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T20:20:39"></hs_TimeCode>fashion is a
vital part not only of our national but of the global economy. In 2009,
the United Kingdom fashion industry was estimated to contribute more
than £20 billion to our economy and to support more than 800,000
jobs, so this is indeed an industry worth talking about.
About<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T20:21:11"></hs_TimeCode> 90% of the
clothing consumed in the UK is imported. Our consumption has positive
economic effects in developing countries, but there are also a wide
range of environmental and ethical implications to take into account.
We need to consider the water, fertiliser and pesticides used when
fibres are grown and the emissions generated when synthetic fibres are
made. There are issues associated with access to markets and trade
terms for producer farmers. There are concerns about labour conditions
in clothing factories, sweatshop conditions and child
labour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T20:21:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000075">As
the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, said, there are
significant water as well as greenhouse gas impacts associated with
washing and drying clothes and waste at end of life. As the noble Lord,
Lord Young, said, we landfill around a third of a million tonnes of
clothing every year. There are complex global supply chains. Although
the issues are different, the recent and ongoing horsemeat saga has
shown that we need to be able to trust all our supply chains,

textile manufacturing showcase. This was part of the
Government’s Make it in Great Britain initiative, designed to
dispel the myth that the UK does not make anything any more. UK Trade

abroad and encouraging foreign investment in the UK through its GREAT

Ethical and sustainable fashion is a complicated topic, and there are

aspects, and DfID on poverty reduction aspects. We work together to
ensure that appropriate links are made without duplicating or
generating unnecessary bureaucracy. There are cross linkages between
the initiatives. For example, Fairtrade, the ethical trading
initiative, and DfID are all members of the sustainable clothing action

the percentage of childcare help and much more. Since then, the
Children’s Society has analysed in detail the impact of those
changes. The results are shocking. They have calculated that a working
couple about to have a second child in 2015 could find themselves over
£7,000 worse off than they would have been over the following
two years, simply as a result of changes since 2010. That is the
context for this amendment and, indeed, for this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000094">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T20:43:25"></hs_TimeCode>
second concern is that the Minister failed entirely in Committee to
address the question that I raised as to the rationale for including
SMP in this Bill. Noble Lords may recall that the Prime
Minister’s official spokesperson responded to critics by telling
the <I>Telegraph</I> that it was a “personal choice” for
parents to decide whether to return to work or to stay at home after
having a child. Of course it is, just like deciding where to go on
holiday, where to shop, or where to buy your children’s clothes
is a personal choice—if you have enough money, that is. If not,
then it is George at Asda for you, rather than Giorgio Armani Junior.
Money is what makes people have choices, not simply the fact of having
a
baby.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000095" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000095">However,
that was not the reason that the Chancellor gave when he announced this
Bill back in the autumn. He claimed that the legislation was necessary
to ensure that the welfare state was fair to working people, and not to
those who lie in bed with their blinds down when their neighbours go to
work. In Committee, I asked the Minister to explain how SMP fits with
his argument. Let us recall that SMP is a contributory benefit, paid
only to women who have given up work to give birth or to care for a new
baby, after having been in continuous employment for the requisite
period and earning enough to require their employers to pay national
insurance contributions on their behalf. However, answer came there
none. I therefore ask the Minister one last time: how does including
SMP in this Bill fit with the Chancellor’s narrative, and why
should pregnant 
<?notus-xml column=576?>women and new mothers pay the price for a tax cut
for millionaires? I look forward to the answer. I beg to

Bach:</Member></B> My Lords, I very much support what my noble friend
has said in moving the amendment. The House seems very quiet this
evening, following the shenanigans of this afternoon when it looked
very much to some of us as thought there was an organised group on the
other side—many of whose members are no longer present, of
course, it being after dinner time—who found a huge interest in
this Bill in order to keep the Report stage going. Be that as it may,
those times are obviously
passed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000097">If I
read correctly, the Minister—to whom I attach no blame at all
for what has been going on, of course—said in reply to my noble
friend in Committee that the cost in the last of the three years of
allowing this amendment would be around £50 million. Let me tell
her one way, at least, that that £50 million could be found five
times over. The communities department has £250 million to
spend, and has done for some time, in order to make rubbish collections
weekly rather than fortnightly. No doubt that is a priority for some,
and no doubt it has a validity of its own. However, compared to the
wrong which is being done by this Bill—and by others
too—and in particular the wrong addressed by my noble friend in
her amendment, could the Government not get some proper sense of
priority as to what does and does not matter, even at this late stage?
That is £50 million, compared with £250 million that is
sorted away. This was not mentioned, of course, by the noble Lords who
were this afternoon defending the Government’s position with
such vigour, because it is an inconvenient truth that in Government
there is spend which could be much better spent on protecting those who
are going to be hammered by this legislation. I ask the noble Baroness
to answer my question: what is wrong with spending part of that
£250 million, and agreeing to my noble friend’s

seemed to suggest that some kind of operation was going on in the

thing about it was that there was not a single speech from the Back
Benches of Her Majesty’s Opposition. It is amazing. We are
talking here about what we recognise as being critical issues. On each

here, but not one single speech from the Back Bench of the Official

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Lord for
letting me come back on this. Today, we started with a key debate on
whether it was right to tie future Secretaries of State’s
decisions on the rate of uprating of benefits. My noble friend Lord
McKenzie moved the relevant amendment and we had an extensive
discussion. We then had a hugely important debate on children, a hugely
important debate on disabled people and then an important debate led by
the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. The noble Lord, Lord Bates, will know as
well as I do that, as we had only effectively half a day—because
people are not here after dinner—to discuss four key issues,
either we had to postpone key debates to a period of time when no one
would be here, including his Privy Council colleagues, to listen and
take part, or we acted in a way that was self-disciplined in order that
the arguments at least in their basic form could be heard, so that
those who wished to—and there were not very many on his
side—could come in and listen to those points being made to see
whether they affected their vote. We were trying to act responsibly.
Had we had two days on Report, we could have paced it differently and I
for one would have been delighted to have spoken at least three times

Bates:</Member></B> I am going to deal with it. I want to come back to
the point that I was going to make previously, because I think it is
relevant. For the first 
<?notus-xml column=578?>six weeks of the 39 weeks of statutory maternity
pay, 90% of the benefit that is payable is linked to earnings. The
point that I was going to make is that, while benefits have increased
in line with inflation by 20% in the past five years, as we have heard
many times, average earnings have increased by only 10%. In fact,
according to the Centre for Social Justice, that increase for some of
the lowest earners, particularly females, has been 7.8%. I wanted to
make the point that in terms of helping with maternity pay at that
particular point, the best we can do is see a growth in salaries. If
salaries grow, it is axiomatic that the statutory maternity benefit in
that first six weeks will be enhanced. The problem is that salaries
have been suppressed.</hs_para>

to the Bill that we are debating shows some quite encouraging signs.
For the first quarter of 2014, we have a forecast of increases in the
order of 4.5% per year, growing to 4.6% during the period of this Bill.
Surely increases of that nature, when linked to the statutory maternity
pay of which we are talking, must have some effect. In the same way, I
inquired of the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, who introduced this
amendment, whether the stark numbers that she presented to us contained
any element that reflected the suppression of wages that we have seen
over the past five years. This has been seen particularly in the
private sector, although it has been in the public sector as well,
where wage increases are subject to a 1% cap. That is the point that I
ask the noble Baroness to clarify when she

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> My Lords, it is good to get back to the
subject of the Bill. I support the amendment of the noble Baroness,
Lady Sherlock. Although everyone is inevitably suffering under this
economic disaster, it is surely completely counterproductive for the
Government not to make specific arrangements for those who produce and
support children. This is a particularly important generation of
children. We will all need to depend upon them and will need to help
them develop to their full potential if we are to have a brighter and
more economically successful future. Not to do so will also
specifically disadvantage—I would argue even discriminate
against—women.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000108" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000108">Whatever
hopes there are for both parents to share childcare in future, to
include statutory maternity pay at present would clearly disadvantage
women, on whom the main responsibility remains for their
children’s upbringing. It will also particularly disadvantage
single parents, the vast majority of whom are women. While 30% of all
households with children are affected, 95% of lone parents—that
is 2 million—are affected by the Bill. The Government have
already estimated that the Bill will push a further 200,000 children
into poverty, so what effect will this economic deprivation have on
this vitally important next generation of children and their
well-being?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000109">First,
there is their health: the 2010 Marmot review highlighted how poor
health is strongly linked to low socioeconomic status. Children in the
lowest-income households, for example, are three times as likely to
suffer mental health problems as their more affluent peers. At the age
of 33 they are at increased risk of severe long-term and life-limiting
illness.</hs_para>

is their education. The link between economic disadvantage and
educational underachievement is widely recognised by academics, as well
as by parliamentarians. Children’s cognitive development,
related to parental social status, is evident as early as 22 months.
The earliest high-achievers from deprived backgrounds are overtaken at
five years, with this gap widening by the time children reach 10. DfE
figures also show that only 26.6% of secondary school pupils eligible
for free school meals achieved five or more A* to C GCSEs, compared
with 54.2% for all the
rest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000131" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000131">In
employment, inevitably, the educational and health inequalities drive a
similar divide. Young people who are NEET are more likely to have grown
up in socially disadvantaged households, for example, from
single-parent households and those where parents also have low

there are family relationships and children’s subjective
well-being. Living on a low income is stressful and difficult and can,
and often does, adversely affect family life and intra-familial
relationships, as well as children’s assessment of and
satisfaction with their lives. Poverty can make strong parent-child
relationships more difficult, and research shows that children growing
up in poverty are more likely to suffer from low self-esteem and to be
socially
isolated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000112">Having

focus on statutory maternity pay. I remind the House that the UK has a
strong and effective maternity and parental regime. The UK is
significantly more generous than the requirements of the EU pregnant

should benefit from 14 weeks paid maternity leave; we provide 39 weeks.
The directive states that a woman should receive at least the amount
that would be paid for sickness; our standard rate of maternity pay and
maternity allowance is £135.45 per week. That compares to the
statutory sick pay rate of £85.85 per week. In addition, the
latest available data from the OECD show that the proportion of our GDP
spent on maternity and parental pay is higher than that in Germany or
France.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031987000117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000117">It is
also worth reflecting on the fact that in the past decade, the length

doubled. Under the previous Government, it was doubled. It is important

we have to take on statutory maternity pay will mean a slightly smaller
increase for people over the next few years, but that is in the context
of a strong and effective maternity architecture in our country which
will remain firmly in place. Indeed, the Government are committed to
make this architecture even stronger. Noble Lords will soon be debating
provisions in the Children and Families Bill which allow working
parents to choose which parent takes parental leave and parental pay to
care for their child in the early years.</hs_para>

understand these changes in the context of other government reforms
that support women, families and children and help make positive
changes to their lives. I said this in Committee, but it is important,
so I will repeat it. For example, a woman working full time at the
national minimum wage for six months of the tax year who then receives
statutory maternity pay for the next six months will still be better
off overall as a result of changes to the income tax personal
allowance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000120">We
have debated universal credit many times before, and it is acknowledged
that its purpose is to make it worth while for people to move back into
work. Once universal credit is introduced, some 800,000 out-of-work
lone parents would benefit significantly if they started to work just
10 hours per week. In nearly all such cases, these parents would see at
least £40 more in their pocket per week than they would have
done under the current system. Also as part of universal credit,
£200 million extra is being spent to support families with
childcare costs. For the first time, this support will be made
available for families who work fewer than 16 hours per week. That
means 100,000 more working families will be helped with
their childcare
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031987000121" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-0002.htm#13031987000121">Looking
ahead, as my noble friend Lord Newby mentioned in one of the earlier
debates today, we have set out changes that will increase eligibility

have also announced today a further £200 million additional

families that the Government provide is about more than income
transfers. I do not deny that families value them and they can make an
important difference, but money is often better invested in
interventions that really can change lives. In demonstrating this

not come from the measures set out in the Bill, that could clearly put
additional pressures on to public services. The noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, mentioned alternatives that he would like to propose. They

answer the noble Baroness’s question about why we are including
statutory maternity pay, we have sought to address the very significant
welfare bill, which I am afraid is unsustainable, but doing so in way
to protect the most vulnerable. We discussed and debated that at length
earlier today. Regrettable as it is to have to make any reductions or
cap any of the increases in the way that we have, the infrastructure
and architecture there for women and families are strong. They provide
sound support that will make a real change to people’s lives.
While I recognise that these are difficult decisions, I hope that I
have provided enough assurance to the House to show that the Government
take their obligations to parents seriously and that we will continue
to provide a supportive environment for new mothers in the years to

to the noble Lord that it is worth noting that the poorest mothers get
the flat rate of SMP and are therefore unaffected by any impact on wage

Bill—is a double whammy for those who are finding that their
wages are frozen or have been kept down, because these benefits and tax

arriving at the current order, 21 bodies have been removed from the
previous order and five new bodies have been added. Much of the
reduction in the number of bodies is due to the recent reforms to
public bodies. As noble Lords will recall, in 2010 the Government
announced plans to reform 481 quangos to help reinvigorate the
public’s trust in democracy; to ensure that the Government
operate in a more efficient and businesslike way; and to radically
increase the transparency and accountability of all public services. A
number of these changes will come into effect on 1 April this year. It
is important that these reforms extend to areas such as official
statistics. Therefore, some of the changes have led to the streamlining
of some statistics but those most important to public life have been
preserved. The longer-than-usual hiatus between this order and the
previous one has been to ensure that the new order fully captured these
reforms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000008">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:46:54"></hs_TimeCode>

the UK Statistics Authority’s oversight; those bodies listed on

statistics; and their statistics will have the potential to be
nominated for formal assessment by the authority to be national
statistics. I reassure the noble Baroness that I have discovered the
difference between an official statistic and a national statistic, even
though it took me some time. This House agreeing the order is a vital

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for
his introduction and explanation of this order. Perhaps the only point
he missed was to stress the importance of always having accurate
statistics, and indeed that is implicit in bringing forward the order
today. It is a sign of the times that public confidence is higher and
trust is greater in statistics if they are seen to be produced
independent of government, and I think we should put on the record our
praise of the UK Statistics Authority and of the Office for National
Statistics, which is part of the executive wing, as it were, of the
Statistics Authority. In many ways, the authority acts as a check and
balance on some of the important areas of the economy. It is helpful
that the Statistics Authority can look at statements and figures so
that the policies of all political parties can be held to account. We
can ask the Statistics Authority to check the accuracy of any statement
that is
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:35:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

just about the face value of statistics, but how they are used and how
they can be misinterpreted either accidentally or deliberately. We have
seen that recently. The Minister may be aware that the Statistics
Authority had to write to MPs. Any of us can make a mistake, and in
this case it was made in a Conservative Party political broadcast on
23 January. It got into a muddle between debt and deficit,
and that had to be put right. My understanding is that the broadcast
said that it had gone down, but information from the UK Statistics
Authority showed that net public sector debt in June 2010, the end of
the second 
<?notus-xml column=137?>quarter, was £811 billion, which represents 55.3% of gross
domestic product, and that by the end of the fourth quarter 2012 it had
risen to £1,011 billion. We should thank the Statistics
Authority because it is able to make corrections to statements made by
politicians of any
party<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:37:15"></hs_TimeCode> because it

that the noble Lord has worked through the order and looked at the
different definitions. As a former Minister who was in the same
position that he is in now, perhaps I should not have been puzzled by
this, but I want to ask about the Statistics Board. The order refers to
consultation with the board and it is referred to in the legislation,
but it is actually the UK Statistics Authority and the ONS. The only
reference I can find to a board is to the Board of the UK Statistics
Authority, whose membership includes people from the ONS—the
chief executive, the National Statistician and the Director General. I
am slightly puzzled about why the order refers to the board when the
entity is in fact the authority, but I hope I am correct in assuming
that the board he is referring to is the board of the authority. It
would be helpful if he could confirm
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:38:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

and I assume that the response to the changes being made was positive.
It would be helpful to have the complete list in the schedule, but 21
organisations were removed. If I understood the Minister correctly, he
has already answered part of my question in his opening. Part of that
arises from the Public Bodies Act, about which he will understand we
have mixed views, in particular with regard to the changes being made.
If those organisations are no longer able to produce official
statistics, does that mean that there is now a lack of available
statistical information, or has the work of those 21 organisations
which are no longer on the approved list been allocated to other
organisations? Are we still able to get the kind of information that
was being produced? Further, is the Minister able to provide a list of
the 21 organisations? It would be helpful if he could write to

explanatory note also said that the charities being included as
producing official statistics will have no official burden placed on
them. Does that imply that they have previously produced statistics of
use to government and held in public regard, but that have not been
regarded as official? If the Minister can say something about that, it
would be
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000014">I was
puzzled to find that two organisations were not on the list. As I
mentioned to the Minister, later on today we will have a debate on
crime statistics. It is helpful to have this debate today to help
inform that debate later on. In my reading for that debate, it was
clear that the UK Statistics Authority says that there are two sources
of official figures for crime statistics: one is police records from
individual police forces and the other is the British Crime Survey.
Individual police forces are obviously not on here, I assume because
they feed information to the Home Office which then issues that
information. If I am wrong about that, I would be happy to be
corrected. But the British Crime Survey is not here. It is interesting
if the UK Statistics Authority recognises the British Crime Survey
statistics as being very useful, if not
“official”—because that is 
<?notus-xml column=138?>a legal term. If it uses those statistics, I wonder if it would be
appropriate for the survey to be on the list. Why is it
not?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000015">My final
point is on another organisation that I doubt has been missed: the
Office for Budget Responsibility. When they came into power, the
coalition Government were clear that they wanted to see independent
figures and assessment of the economy, and set up the Office for Budget
Responsibility in response to that. That was widely welcomed. Yet it is
not included in the list. Clearly, it is highly regarded—as is
what it produces. Like the UK Statistics Authority, it is a check and

for her constructive speech. Of course, I should have said that this is
very much an all-party set of issues. The last Government introducing
this new system of greater independence for statistics was a very
valuable contribution to more informed debate. I am in some ways a
great admirer of the <I>Daily Mail</I> and its uses statistics, and the
wonderful way it manages to imply that statistics mean something
entirely different from what most of us understand them to mean.
Usually you have to read down to the tenth paragraph on the second page
to discover that actually the story is not as good as it seems. In
politics, we want an independent body that can point out that
statistics cannot be twisted in that way. That is what this current
system most attempts to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000018"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Smith of Basildon" PimsId="5786" UID="13031972000155" xid="2058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000155">Baroness

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving the Electoral
Registration (Disclosure of Electoral Registers) Regulations 2013, I
wish to speak also to the Electoral Registration (Postponement of 2013
Annual Canvass) Order 2013. The Electoral Registration and
Administration Act 2013 received Royal Assent on 31 January.
It marks the first legislative step towards fulfilment of the coalition
Government’s commitment to speed up the implementation of
individual electoral registration (IER) so that it takes place in
2014-15, a commitment reaffirmed recently in the Government’s
mid-term
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000028">The
principle of IER has won cross-party support. Indeed, the change to
individual registration was introduced into the Political Parties and
Elections Act 2009 in your Lordships’ House with cross-party
support. In passing the ERA Act earlier this year, Parliament showed
its intention to see the implementation done using a different plan and
a different timetable. The transition to IER will begin in the summer
of 2014 and the Government are planning that it will end with the
publication of the first IER-only register in December 2015. I know
that this is familiar to all those present as we spent a great deal of
time debating all these issues. The legislation was altered in your
Lordships’ House so that the end may come in either 2015 or
2016, with an order laid by the Secretary of State of the day required
to conclude transition. I reaffirm the Government’s commitment
to concluding the transition in 2015 in accordance with the
implementation plan already
published.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000029">The
two statutory instruments before the Committee today are key components
of the transition to IER in preparing for the confirmation
data-matching process. It is one of the important changes from the
transition envisaged by the PPE Act
2009.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000030">In their
official response to pre-legislative scrutiny on IER, the Government
announced that part of the transition would be a data-matching stage
whereby all electoral registers in Britain would be matched against
trusted public datasets. Where a positive match is made between an
entry on the register and information in the dataset, that person may
be “confirmed” as having an IER entry on the register
because the electoral registration officer can have confidence that
they exist and reside at that address. These people will not have to
supply their personal identifiers—their national insurance
number and date of birth—unless they move house and apply to
register at their new
address.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000031">Preliminary
findings from pilots of this data-matching system have been published
on the gov.uk website, and suggest that approximately 70% of existing
electors will be confirmed on the register through data-matching. This
is slightly higher than the results of previous pilots, with results
suggesting that we can be confident in the accuracy of the matching,
both of which auger well for the success of data-matching in the
transition to IER. Both instruments being considered today support that
data-matching element of the transition in very important and practical
ways.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000032">Regulation
2 of the draft Electoral Registration (Disclosure of Electoral
Registers) Regulations 2013, if approved, will allow EROs, working with
the 
<?notus-xml column=141?>Government, to carry out a dry run of confirmation data-matching, so
that we can be even more confident that the new system will work when
it goes live in the summer of 2014. The regulations would enable the
Lord President of the Council to require electoral registration
officers to disclose the information on their electoral
registers to him through a conduit specified in writing for the
purposes set out in paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to the
Representation of the People Act 1983.</hs_para>

IER digital service, which is currently being developed and will be
able to carry out the secure transfers of data required for IER,
including the confirmation data match. The service is not identified
specifically in the regulations in order to allow for flexibility to
handle risks around this data transfer, whereby any problem that arose
in using the digital service could be dealt with by using a different
conduit for data transfer without the need for changes to the
regulations. The Information Commissioner’s Office has advised
us that this is the best way to legislate for this kind of digital
data-transfer
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000034">Regulation
2 also provides for the sharing of the information on the registers
with the Department for Work and Pensions, where it may be compared
against certain data held there and matched against the names,
addresses and dates of birth. Date of birth is included because this is
held by EROs in relation to attainers—those under 18 who will
become electors during the life of the current register.</hs_para>

identifiers that will be used as part of the verification process for
IER—the national insurance number and date of birth—will
not be disclosed under these regulations because they do not appear on
the electoral register, with the exception of attainers’ dates
of birth. This is also true of the full confirmation process in 2014,
meaning that considerably fewer items of sensitive personal information
will be transferred through the IER digital service and matched with
DWP data than would be the case if confirmation data-matching was not
being used as part of the transition to IER. Once the information has
been matched at DWP, a match result will be sent back to the ERO. In
the full confirmation process in 2014, this result will assist the ERO
in deciding whether the person can be confirmed on the register, or if
they should be invited to make an IER
application.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000036">In
the dry run later this year, however, there will be no contact with
electors. Instead, the EROs will have an indication of what their
overall match rate for their local authority area will be in 2014, and
therefore the extent to which they are likely to need to invite and
process IER applications. They may also find that certain areas in
their zone have lower match rates than elsewhere. In this case, they
may, for example, feel that they can focus resources in areas with low
match scores during the canvass period to ensure that the information
on the register for those areas is up to date for the 2014 confirmation
data match.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000037">In
order that this dry run and the 2014 confirmation data match can take
place, these regulations would also allow local authorities to build up
their IT resources and connect to the secure IER digital service in
order 
<?notus-xml column=142?>that they can disclose their registers in the format and through the
conduit specified by the Lord President, as they will be required to do
Regulation 2(3). By setting up this IT infrastructure and having a dry
run of the process this year, we can be confident that all the
component parts are in place and all EROs are securely connected to it
before the transition to IER and the full confirmation data-match in
summer
2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000038">Under<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:55:07"></hs_TimeCode>

pilots are being conducted. That work, under that order, will cease at
the end of 31 March this year, though, and these regulations will
enable it to continue in those authorities and to be rolled out to the
rest of Great Britain. It is vital that this work is continued
uninterrupted in the pilot areas and begins as soon as possible
elsewhere, with these regulations in force from 1 April
2013.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000039" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000039">Having<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:55:44"></hs_TimeCode>
described the context for the draft regulations at length, I now turn
to the draft Electoral Registration (Postponement of 2013 Annual
Canvass) Order 2013. The postponement of the annual canvass was also
outlined in the Government’s response to pre-legislative
scrutiny in February 2012. The purpose is to ensure that confirmation
data-matching in summer 2014 is done using registers that are as
complete and accurate as possible. We know that the completeness and
accuracy of registers deteriorates over time at a rate of around 1% per
month, so reducing the gap between the compilation of the register and
the point at which the data are matched should improve match
rates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000040">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:56:34"></hs_TimeCode>
announced that the canvass due to take place in autumn 2013 would be
postponed so that the revised register would be published in early
2014, rather than December 2013. The draft order sets out the specific
dates for the canvass and the publication, with canvass activity
beginning from 1 October 2013 and the revised register being published
on 17 February 2014 in England and on 10 March 2014 in Scotland and
Wales. These publication dates represent the best balance between the
benefits of delaying the canvass to improve the match scores and the
need for electoral administrators and political parties to have the
revised register published prior to local elections and European
Parliamentary elections, due to take place in
2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000041">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:57:22"></hs_TimeCode>
different dates for England and for Scotland and Wales reflect this
point. As there are local elections due to take place in England on 1
May, the register will be published earlier there, whereas there are no
such elections in Scotland and Wales so the register can be published
later, as long as they are available in time to prepare for the
European Parliament
elections.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000042">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:57:40"></hs_TimeCode>
is worth noting that, while 1 October is given as the date from which
canvass activity may begin, this does not mean that registration
officers must begin on that date. Indeed, many may feel that a shorter
period, beginning in late October or early November would be more
suitable for their district. By setting 1 October as the date after
which canvass activity may take place, we are allowing EROs to be
flexible in planning for their district. The October to February and
March time frame is akin to the longest period in which we are aware of
EROs carrying out canvass activity at present, from July to late
November<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T15:58:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=145?>that there would be no contact, but I do not know whether that means
that even if an ERO finds from DWP material someone who is not on the

confirm that the regulations will give the necessary authority for all
the relevant parties to release the data necessary for this work?

involved will be clear about their duties and responsibilities under

set out what safeguards are in place to protect individuals’
data security<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:08:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
We noted in previous discussions on individual registration that some
people, including those in your Lordships’ House, tend to
register their vote at one address but use another address for
correspondence. That will clearly be a major issue when using the DWP
material. Perhaps the Minister can outline how this is to be dealt with
in the
pilots<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:08:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

measure, on the postponement of 2013 household canvass, which is now to
be published in England in February 2014, and in March in Scotland and
Wales. The Minister will recall my sadly unsuccessful attempt to remove
from the then ERA Bill the ability of the Secretary of State to abolish
the canvass. That is an indication of how important we see this tool in
seeking out and registering all citizens with an entitlement to vote.
Clearly, this will be even more important in the move to IER, which
will fully replace the household register only in 2016. I ask the
Minister to confirm that he is confident that the Government’s
plans will ensure that by 2016 we will have a better register than we
have at present, and that the Government remain clear that there will
be no dropping of the household register before 2016.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031972000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000061">We are very content
that the Government push ahead with locating non-registered but
eligible electors, so that by 2016 we have the maximum possible number
of individually registered electors by a variety of means and no one is
inadvertently denied their vote in 2016. But we seek assurance that any
such work is not with the idea of bringing forward sole reliance on the
individual rather than household-registered electorate. In the mean
time, however, while we remain with household lists, as the Minister
has said that registers decline in accuracy by about 1% a month, we are
content with the canvass taking place slightly later—provided
that the information is then made available to political parties as
soon as possible thereafter, so that their work on the lists can begin,
as he mentioned. 
<?notus-xml column=146?>This is key. The Committee knows that much of the business of alerting
voters to the fact that they are or are not on the electoral roll is
done by political parties, as the voting cards tend to go out only a
short time before an election. It will be more and more important, with
the gradual shift to IER, for parties to have early and easy access to
the new registers so that they can undertake their canvass work and so
that anyone left off can be identified in time to rectify that
absence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:11:11"></hs_TimeCode>. We also
need, as early as possible after the delayed canvass, publication,
perhaps monthly, of a rolling register, showing IER

know that the ERA allows for transfer to IER to be completed by the end
of December 2016, which is a sensible date. The Committee will
understand that we remain a little nervous. The Act retains a power to
hurry it through earlier than that, but we hope that the Government are
not trying to do that, given the risk of losing eligible voters. We
would also query—and this was another point raised by the noble
Lord, Lord Tyler—whether there is a satisfactory way in which to
judge whether the 2016 date is appropriate to complete the transition.
We would like to know what criteria would be applied and what would be
the role of the Electoral Commission in such a process. Under the
Labour Government’s legislation on IER, the Electoral Commission
had a pivotal role in deciding whether progress had been sufficient to
create safe conditions for the final move to be made. This Government
removed that role, but surely the commission must have a duty to press
the “Go” button, if that decision is to clearly
non-political and based on solid
data.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000063">Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:12:37"></hs_TimeCode>

the flexibility of electoral registration officers in deciding on the
canvass, as I said in my speech, some will decide not to start until
November. I am tempted to say to those who live in the lush south, such
as my noble friend Lord Tyler, that “it’s grim up
north”. Canvassing in North Yorkshire in January and February is
not always easy. My mother-in-law, when she lived in Upper Wharfedale,
was usually snowed in for at least six weeks during that period. It
will differ from area to area and this is why we are allowing EROs a
certain amount of
flexibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000072">I
say to the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, that this is a dry run. It is

test of how far we can get matching data with the DWP database and
others so that we have a better indication of the scale of the
remaining chunk of the electorate who need to be visited or contacted
one way or another. That is the whole purpose of this activity. I
repeat the assurance that we are on track. We are confident that we
will be able to carry through this process by our preferred date of
December 2015 rather than delaying until 2016. However, as the noble
Baroness is well aware, we will be monitoring this as we carry it

that the new register will be at least as good as the one we have now,
and we will end the long-term process of deterioration from which the

suggestion of flagging the status of the register on a monthly update
is one that we will take away and consider further. On the question of
annual canvasses, I reassure the noble Baroness that we have no plans
to abolish the annual register to identify potentially eligible
electors and invite them to register. However, as we have discussed on
previous occasions, the process of doing the annual canvass is becoming
more difficult over a long-term period. It is also getting more
difficult to recruit people to do the annual canvass. That is something
we need to bear in mind as part of a much longer-term transition of how
we manage a process which was, after all, set up in the early 20th
century and may not be entirely suited to the sort of built environment
which we have in many areas of Britain. The resources are in place. The
Government are committed to concluding the transition by the end of
2015, if all is in place. That will, of course, be subject to everyone
with a stake in the process having confidence that this has been
completed, certainly including the Electoral Commission, which has been
closely involved so far and will rightly continue to monitor and
comment as we carry through the process. I hope that I have answered
all the questions. I will write to those who have contributed if there
are any further questions that I have not answered. I commend the
regulations.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13031972000185" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000185">Motion

Maginnis of Drumglass:</Member></B> My Lords, I appreciate the
opportunity to raise the albeit touchy issue of government and
administration—from my perspective, perhaps I should say
government versus administration—particularly in so far as it
impacts on the delivery of health services. Despite having been married
to a nurse for the past 52 years, my analysis will not presume to deal
with matters clinical but will very much deal with delivery, especially
concerning early intervention and diagnosis relating to children with
special
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000078">Autism
spectrum disorder—ASD—is an area that increasingly
confronted me as a Member of Parliament in days gone by, when parents
would come to me in desperation. Despite Kanner having defined the
condition as long ago as 1943, I was unfamiliar with it even though I
trained as a schoolteacher 15 years after that. I realised that there
was virtually no departmental provision of any consequence. Therefore,
when the Northern Ireland Assembly eventually got going and I was
fortunate enough to have a colleague, Michael McGimpsey, as Minister of
Health, I prevailed on him to such an extent to carry out an
independent review of autism services that he asked me to chair
it.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031972000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000079">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:43:09"></hs_TimeCode>
response to a Parliamentary Question during direct rule, I had been
told that in Northern Ireland there were 686 children waiting up to 35
months for assessment and diagnosis. That meant that children were
virtually in school before they had the benefit of any meaningful
interventions. Three years, often more, were lost—developmental
years that could never be retrieved. I want to put on record my
gratitude to Angela McLarnon, who at that time headed up the Northern
Ireland cohort of around 600 health visitors; she was the one who made
things happen. As a result of the review we carried out, we now have
uptrained all our health visitors. No child waits more than
13 weeks before assessment and diagnosis, and every child
gets a home visit for general developmental assessment at two years
old.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000080">I want to
say two things at this point. The ratio of health visitors to the birth
rate in Northern Ireland is roughly 40:1, while here in England it is
83:1. I know there is an idea that the number of health visitors will
be increased by roughly 50% here in England but I contend that this
country needs to be aiming at something like a 100% increase in health
visitors if it is to have the same service as we have in Northern
Ireland. We all know the lifelong importance of early intervention in
special needs cases. Before anyone dismisses that idea on the basis
that England is more urban than Northern Ireland, I will partly concede
that point—but only partly. I calculate that the planned
increase is at best 50% too little and that assumes that there is a
comparable and specific ASD uptraining in place for all health
visitors. Is that the case? I am sorry to bore everyone with
statistics, but the situation and outcome needs to be assessed on the
following basis. Health visitors in England should, on top of their
other responsibilities, aim to make one general developmental
assessment home visit per working week. This requires a maximum ratio
in terms of annual live births to health visitors of 45:1; it should be
no greater than that. I am talking about 16,000 health visitors, not
the proposed 12,000 and certainly not the current, unacceptable 8,000
plus<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:40:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=150?><hs_para UID="13031972000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000081">That is not the whole
story, however. Given that 1.2% of live births will be children on the
autism spectrum, English health services will cater for roughly 8,700
children with that condition every year. Extrapolate that to school age
and each health visitor is being asked to monitor five children with
ASD on an ongoing basis, which is twice the number we in Northern
Ireland consider practical and
acceptable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:40:43"></hs_TimeCode>. As a
schoolmaster, I believe there should be an overlap between health and
education, which does not properly exist today, particularly in this
specific area. We should be talking about a monitoring process up to
the age of
eight.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:41:04"></hs_TimeCode> I do not
expect the Minister to give me a detailed answer, but I hope that she
will at least be able to reassure me that her department will take note
of something that in my experience will help to meet our responsibility
to those with
ASD<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:41:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000082">One
final thought. Just like the rest of us, those on the spectrum fall
within the normal bell-shaped curve; 7.5% brilliant, 7.5% significantly
disabled and 85% who can live very normal lives. I am sorry to put it
as crudely as that, but it is the challenge facing us today. The two
year-old general development assessment is the key, not only to autism,
but to a multitude of other conditions. I will not go through them all
but they are conditions such as dyspraxia and dyslexia, which are often
classified under the term “comorbidity”. Sadly, we no
longer have answerable and responsible government as I once knew it.
Over the past 20 years we have a mere delegating procedure and this is
the challenge I ask the Minister to address today. Where among the
disparate layers of the arm’s-length administration can we
address this issue on a co-ordinated and cohesive nationwide basis? Is
it among 10 strategic massive health authorities or among 151 primary
care organisations that vary in population from less than 100,000 to
more than 1
million<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:42:59"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000083">I
will conclude. If it is not the Government who are going to preside
over and be answerable and accountable among this mish-mash of
administrative units, are we condemned to another postcode lottery? The
Minister knows that I am not targeting her personally, but if we are to
have effective, early-life healthcare her department needs to face up
to the real challenge of there being too many managers and not enough
workers and to feel the accountability that pervades most of society
today, not least our health
service.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13031972000140" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000140"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:43:48"></hs_TimeCode></I>4.43

Addington:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis,
returns to a subject different facets of which I have heard him talk
about before. Primarily, it is based on the self-evident fact that if
you identify a problem early you stand a better chance of reaching a
better outcome. So much for the rocket science involved in this, but it
is quite obvious when you are doing
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000085">How do
we do this? There is an assessment at about the age of two. The
briefing I received referred to classical autism: those with certain
patterns and conditions such as low IQ and behaviour that occurs. You
are able to spot that by about the age of two. That probably fits more
neatly into what the noble Lord was saying than anything else we will
get across. Then, as the noble 
<?notus-xml column=151?>Lord again pointed out—he can feel free to shoot my foxes as
there will always be another one coming along—that will not
apply to everyone throughout the process, so assessing until the age of
eight is another good idea. If somebody does not fit neatly into that
classical band, it is not very obvious that they have a problem. For
instance, if that person does not get much pre-school training,
education et cetera, their problems may only manifest to a noticeable
degree later on. Also, the level of training of the person observing
them has to be fairly exact. As you go through the educational process,
many people in the higher-functioning part of the autism or
Asperger’s spectrum have problems that a teacher will observe
not in the classroom but in the playground because that person will not
socialise
normally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000086">There
has recently been a little splurge of information about autism in the
papers. Some of it was accurate and some of it was not. Even a little
test in the <I>Times</I> asked how far on the spectrum you were. If you
got to 15 on this test, it said “Don’t worry, you are
still quite normal”. I, in a dark moment on a train, took the
test thinking, “I wonder how strange I will come out”. I
only got 12, thought that was a bit low, went back and discovered that
I should have marked myself at 10: it is one problem I do not have. But
if we are going to do this, we need a way of assessing at various
points where that intervention comes in. One of the classic ways for
adults to be discovered on the Asperger’s spectrum is when they
develop mental health problems: people who cannot cope with a normal
environment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000087">Effectively,
there are huge savings here for government. I thought all Governments
were interested in savings, or should be. Let us face it, this
Government will be more interested than most. That is not a position I
particularly relish but it is the fact of the matter. If you get in
reasonably early, you stand a better chance of being able to maintain
the person throughout their education and working life. Indeed, there
is a better chance of them being able to handle the bumps and bangs of
relationships later on. Will my noble friend give us a rough guide as
to what the level of intervention will be beyond that initial
assessment at age two? If we just concentrate on autism, because other
conditions will come in, exactly how much training will be required at
the various stages of the education process? How much assessment is
going
on?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000088">The
National Autistic Society suggests that at least the SENCO in every
school should have specific training in how to spot autism. Autism may
not be the highest-occurring hidden condition, but it will certainly be
there regularly throughout a teacher’s career. There should be
better basic training so they are able to spot a condition and refer
on—we do not want to create experts. They must also understand
when they are given advice. Parliament is one of those places where we
occasionally, from a standing start, we are told, “Go and make
yourself an expert”. Every person who has stood on their hind
legs in this Palace has had that experience with something they had not
come across. We all know that it takes time to get your head around a
new problem or way of thinking. Unless that is instilled throughout the
education and health services, with a basic level of understanding
where one knows where to refer back to and where to refer on, you will 
<?notus-xml column=152?>not be able to do this. It would help if my noble friend could give us
an idea of where we are on this and where we are going. This should not
be a party political point or football. It should be a point of basic
principle because unless you have just enough knowledge to be able to
access and call in the help, you will miss this and do it late, causing
secondary damage to that person’s life and costs to
society.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_19_PT_1/7946C3BB7662CB64CF891E1E8219BEBB52DC24FE" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 19 March 2013">Tuesday,

families and loved ones but in terms of the likely demands on the state

desist from making further comments on that. Does the noble Baroness
recognise those ratios because, on the face of it, your chances in
Northern Ireland of having health visitor support is clearly much
greater and more intense than in England? I do not know if the noble

want to express some concerns, particularly in education. The
Government have clearly identified gaps in services between different
sectors, education, health and care support. My concern is with the
demise of local education authorities as significant players in
education in England. I remember when we debated the new
Government’s first children Bill that there was particular
concern about provision of SEN under the new structures. Does the
Minister think—and how does she think—co-ordination of
SEN in local authority areas is now happening with the reduction in
authority of LEAs and the freedom of academies and free schools to
plough their own furrow? I know that academies operate in accordance
with the individual funding agreement and obligations are imposed on
them, but it would help the Committee to know that the Government
believe there is machinery at local level to ensure that there is
proper co-ordination between schools, linking into the health service.
I point out to the noble Baroness the recent Ofsted reports on the
first tranche of free schools is not exactly encouraging about their
performance. Could she help me in relation to whether Ofsted was able
to comment on those schools’ responsibilities in relation to
SEN<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:56:20"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031972000097" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000097">It
is clear, too, that the health service has much to do, and I fully
accept that. Co-ordination between health, education and social care
services is very important indeed. The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis,
referred to the English situation as of now and to the 10 strategic
health authorities and 190 or so primary care trusts. He referred to
that as being a bit of a mess—but if we were coping only with
the current structure. The fact is that from 1 April we are losing
strategic health authorities and primary care trusts and replacing them
with clinical commissioning groups, which are untried and untested. We
are losing the essential leadership role of strategic health
authorities, which are being replaced by local area offices of the NHS
Commissioning Board. All the signs are that those local area offices
neither want to nor have the capacity to give the kind of leadership
that is required. So at the local level, within each local authority
area, we have a worrying picture of, on the one hand, local education
authorities losing a lot of the levers that they used to have, and, on
the other, of a health service being broken up between lots of new and
different organisations. It is very worrying in terms of the
co-ordination required. Will the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=154?>reflect either now or in writing on how she thinks one can achieve a
co-ordinated approach in relation to SEN, particularly in relation to
the group that the noble Lord is mostly concerned with, in the new
structures? That is the only way in which to get early intervention and
the continuous assessments, which noble Lords believe should be
produced.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13031972000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031972000142"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T16:58:35"></hs_TimeCode></I>4.58

this disorder, and he and my noble friend Lord Addington, as well as
the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, are all absolutely right to stress the
importance of picking it up  early and supporting people from
the earliest stages. As my noble friend Lord Addington points out, it
is important to pick it up later and monitor the progress of a

want to place special emphasis on the role that the new commissioning
bodies will have in ensuring that children with special needs,

We know that there is a need to improve the early identification and
assessment of special educational needs and thus remove the duplication
and frustration which many families have encountered in securing an
assessment. That is absolutely vital. We have already made progress in
delivering the necessary improvements. For example, we have introduced
an early years progress check for children at the age of two in order
to pick up problems early and tackle them. Several noble Lords have
mentioned this assessment. It is extremely important in terms of the
early identification of autism. We recognise the importance of a key
universal service for improving the health and well-being of all
children through health and development reviews, immunisation
programmes and so on. Between the age of two and two and a half, a
child will have a full health and development review at which parents
will have the opportunity to raise any concerns, ask questions, and
prepare for the next stage of their child’s development. This
can trigger the need for a formal SEN assessment which must include
doctors, educational psychologists and paediatricians if that seems to
be
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:00:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

recognise the pressing need for a new system of commissioning special
educational needs provision, so I hope that noble Lords will be pleased

provisions of the Bill will build on the new approach to commissioning
introduced by the Health and Social Care Act 2012. They will introduce
an integrated approach to meeting the needs of children and young
people with special educational needs, requiring CCGs and local
authorities to make joint commissioning arrangements and focusing on a
single, co-ordinated assessment involving a range of professionals.
Moreover, these arrangements can include people up to the age of 25. It
is extremely important that they should go beyond the transition points
that others have found to be problematic. The assessment process will
result in an individual education, health and care plan. I hope that
noble Lords are pleased to hear about this because it will bring
together the health and education sides. The process will be focused on
improving outcomes for the child. The commissioners, working together,
must agree their relevant contributions to delivering the plan, and

plans will not be developed in isolation, of course. The boards and the
CCGs will co-operate with relevant local authorities and participate in
their health and well-being boards. Each board will provide a forum for
the effective assessment of local need, and special educational needs
will be part of that so as to ensure the translation of those
commissioning plans and arrangements into something that is effective.
Health and well-being boards will undertake a joint strategic needs
assessment and a joint health and well-being strategy for the local
authority area. The CCG will draw on this in developing its annual
commissioning plans. Moreover, health and well-being boards will help
to ensure the accountability of CCGs by giving their opinion on the
extent to which the commissioning plans take account of the local
strategy and how the CCG has contributed to its delivery. Noble Lords
need to bear in mind that special educational needs are in there, and
they have to assess what is being provided against that.</hs_para>

will be introduced in 2014, depending on the passage of the Bill, but a
number of pathfinder local authorities are working with local children

Hunt, will be aware, the mandate for the NHS for the next two years has
indicated the particular need for improvement, working in partnership
across different services in supporting children and young people with
special educational needs and disabilities. In particular, it gives the

this group, particularly in relation to the time taken from first
presentation to diagnosis. The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, highlighted

data should be presented in five-year bands up to the age of 25 to
enable the effective monitoring of that transition. That is quite a
significant change. Here, too, I want to reassure my noble friend Lord
Addington in relation to those children whose need for support does not
become apparent until they are well established in school. The
Government’s approach is to strengthen awareness in schools
through staff training; for example, extended placements in special
schools for trainee teachers. We want to ensure that needs are detected
as early as possible, but I emphasise that at any point the school can
request an assessment by the local authority. The education, health and
care plan approach provides a basis for taking an all-round view of the

it is also the collectivisation of risk, anonymity, abrogation of

identified four categories of “Gaming”. There is
“cuffing”, so called after the magician’s act of
making things disappear up the sleeve; in other words, making crime
figures disappear altogether by, for instance, not recording some types
at all. In “nodding” figures are enhanced, notably by
getting offenders to admit by a nod to other offences to be taken into
consideration, or TICs. “Stitching” is coercing suspects
to confess to guilt under threats or perhaps promises of more lenient
treatment. “Skewing” involves applying resources solely
to whatever targets are being measured to the exclusion of others; it
is the principle of “what does not get measured does not

to quantify the effects of gaming. His conclusion that it is an endemic
organisational phenomenon rather than the activities of a few officers
makes for uncomfortable reading. The Office for National Statistics
thought that cuffing alone might cause a 16% underrecording of crime;
Dr Patrick considers that it is likely to be far higher. The truth is
that we do not know and the change from an evidential to a prima facie
basis of crime recording further confuses the issue.</hs_para>

January’s ONS national crime survey was received with disbelief
by criminologists and it was subsequently admitted that the recorded
figures might be defective. But the ONS relies on police figures and
the appearance of a decline in crime fits the purposes of many others.
Did Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary advise Home
Office officials about the extent of a problem going back many years?
If so, why has so little changed? Can we be sure that the figures form
an adequate basis for analysis? If they are not founded on fact, truth
and logic, how can Ministers and Parliament rely on them? Furthermore,
what is the role of Home Office officials and statisticians in the
oversight of police recorded crime, given the ONS admission? Is it true
that cross-checks on police recording, formerly part of the British
Crime Survey process, have been discontinued, and if so, why? If the
figures are in doubt, what else may be in question?</hs_para>

Michael Atherton, Andrew Mitchell, Jimmy Savile and Lynette White. All

attracted public criticism. In the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> of 22
December last year, Andrew Gilligan pointed to seven police forces
where sackings, forced resignations, suspensions and criminal
investigations of chief constables had occurred, with almost as many
more deputies and assistants under a cloud. He put the level of
“infection”, if I can call it that, at 20% of police
forces. I am hoping that other Lords will pick up on the issue of
informal cautions, local criminal records and non-sanction detections.

police integrity. Can the Minister tell us where that review has got

reading this debate carefully and that these matters do indeed lie

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I will make one or two of the same
points as the noble Earl, Lord Lytton. Unlike some other Members who
are going to speak today, I do not have great experience or expertise
in this field. With one or two exceptions, my relationship with the
police has been generally okay. I am merely a concerned citizen here,
in that I really want to know what is happening to crime in this
country. Politically, both this and the previous Government
congratulated themselves on a falling level of crime. I did not
seriously query this claim until
recently.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000020">Of
course, government and police claims of crime reduction have always
been treated with a degree of cynicism by the general public. Public
perception of crime rates in all neighbourhoods tends to exaggerate the
degree of actual crime. Of course, there are horrendous crimes, which
receive massive publicity. Although harrowing to those immediately
concerned, as I know, these are probably not typical. There is a
general public perception that the level of particularly low-level
crime is higher than the police and the Government
claim.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000021">Sometimes
the police go over the top. I am told that the South Wales Police
notepaper says that crime is the lowest for the past 30 years. I doubt
that anybody in south Wales actually believes that—nor would
people in Dorset or the City of Westminster. There is a credibility
issue underlying this, and some of it has a good statistical basis
because of the way in which the police record crime as against, for
example, the crime survey and the way that victims see their
complaints. So there are some rational explanations for
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000022">However, I
was quite alarmed to see that the ONS itself was seriously querying the
degree of crime reduction. That is probably where I am. I probably
logically accept, despite the psychology of it, that there has been
some reduction, but it is the degree. There was quite a significant
difference between the police figures and the other figures to which
the ONS referred. The ONS gave a number of quite good reasons for this
but at the same time I became aware of the work of Dr Rodger Patrick,
to whom the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, has already
referred.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000023">According
to Dr Patrick’s analysis, some crimes are no longer recorded on
the basis of reporting by victims or the public but on the evidential
assessment of police officers and on the balance of probability. That
was always the case with third party reporting but used not to be the
case where victims themselves reported. Other cases are lumped together
and given the same crime number to appear only once in the 
<?notus-xml column=162?>statistics. Minor crimes can go unreported altogether: some are on a
local crime data list; some are subject to informal caution and are
cleared, one way or another, and do not get into the national
statistics.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000024" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000024">Meanwhile,
on the detection side, issues such as “take into consideration
cases”, to which the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, referred, are
sometimes lumped together as solved or cleared as a result of a deal
with a defendant or prisoner, without real conviction and due process.
I have read parts of Dr Patrick’s analysis, and I have no way in
which to assess the validity of all this or how widespread it is. But
it is also true—and this is in the title of the
debate—that with some crimes under the last Government there was
a drastic fall, following the introduction of targets and performance
management criteria. That might mean different things: it might suggest
that the target culture was instantly incredibly successful in
increasing overall efficiency against targets; it might suggest that
the priorities and resources were, as in other public services,
concentrated on those areas that were measured and defined as
targets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:35:25"></hs_TimeCode> while
other areas were left underresourced; or it might mean—and this
is something that we regrettably know about in bits of the

performance

we need to know from the Minister tonight is two-fold. Does he
recognise the figures on descriptions of malpractices in individual
police forces to which the noble Earl referred? What arrangements for
quality control and challenge of statistics coming from individual
police forces are there in England and Wales? Secondly, I recognise
that the Home Office and the ONS give guidance to the police on how to
record crime, but who checks the compliance? Is it the police
authority, the new police commissioners or the Inspectorate of
Constabulary? What is the role of the Police Support Unit—or is
it the ACPO high command, or the Home Office itself? How does it work
and, in particular, how far is it guided, checked and quality
controlled by non-police bodies, or is the guidance and advice from
ACPO to chief officers dominant? Like the noble Earl, I have some
concerns about the role of ACPO in this

are also reports that those who query the current system, whether from
within the police force, from community bodies or even from the Home
Office, suffer repercussions—they have been victimised or moved
to other duties. Is the Minister aware of such allegations, and what
would he instruct the Home Office to do about such allegations? I have
to phrase this in the form of questions, partly because of the
difficulty of proof and partly, frankly, because of the litigiousness
of some of those who defend their position. But these are questions
that the Ministers in the Home Office and, perhaps, the Ministry of
Justice, need to

present Secretary of State has made two key decisions in relation to
crime statistics and performance. First, she transferred responsibility
for oversight and reporting of crime statistics after 2011 from the
Home Office to the ONS. That is a very sensible move, which will
probably pay off in the long run. However, the ONS analysis is only as
good as the statistics that 
<?notus-xml column=163?>come in. Unless we can improve the accuracy and integrity of all sources
of information and eliminate natural bias and contrived distortions,
the ONS and Ministers will still be working on flawed systems of
statistical
records<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:37:58"></hs_TimeCode>, and
hence a flawed evidence base. Secondly, the Home Secretary determined
that the Police Service should move away from target-based performance
indicators and, in the light of experience, we would probably think
that was the right move as well. But local commissioners will still
need authentic, undistorted statistics on which to make their
decisions. If not, we are going to end up in the worst of possible
worlds, where there are no performance targets, but the police go on
recording the same statistics in the same
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T17:38:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000028">It
is time that we had a proper analysis of this—the review by the

confident in the statistics that we receive, bad statistics will
distort the basis by operational decisions by chief officers and

on which Home Office Ministers and officials make national policy in
England and Wales. We need a new, expert review, probably judge led,

policing matters. I have been involved in policing for over
30 years and a member of my police authority for
20 years, chairing it for eight of those. I was a deputy

Office ostensibly set only one policing target when the current
Government came into power: to cut crime. The previous Government did
much the same: to improve confidence in policing. Yet under both these
seemingly simple and unbureaucratic targets lay a plethora of
indicators, with more targets, measures, priorities and the like.
Police authorities were bewildered by their complexity but had to
comply with them through their policing plans for their local
communities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000033">Then,
about a year ago, the Home Office handed all responsibility for
analysing crime statistics to the office of the National Statistician,
the ONS. The idea was to make the collection and analysis of data more
transparent and at a stroke reduce public scepticism about crime
statistics. We must not kid ourselves that the Home Office

that as it may, the general public need to be assured that crime
figures accurately reflect what they see happening on the ground. It
would appear that there is a great deal more work to be done to
convince people that the police are performing at a consistently high
professional level. In some parts of the country, that clearly is not
happening. We know from the many recent press reports that concerns are
being widely expressed about significant underreporting of crimes such
as rape and violence against women, about 101 calls not being answered
in a timely and professional fashion and about complaints about police
corruption not resulting in any prosecutions, et cetera.</hs_para>

two years than I can ever remember during the whole of my time on a

bad behaviour of some police officers, possible corrupt practices and
abuse of the very special powers of a constable. These people have no
place in today’s police service and should be rooted out quickly
so that the vast majority of utterly professional and dedicated police

where problems may have arisen? Can the Minister say what has been done
to encourage other government departments to promote the duty to
co-operate with the police and crime commissioners among partner

Maginnis of Drumglass:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the
noble Earl for raising an issue that, however one dresses it up,
amounts to a system that encourages carelessness, misrepresentation and
possibly even corruption among today’s police service. I come
here with more than 50 years of policing experience. I first donned a
police uniform when I left college in 1958 and I served until 1965.
Then, as a commissioned Army officer from 1970 for almost 12 years I
liaised daily with the RUC and, when I came to Parliament, I acted as
its parliamentary adviser. My natural instinct is
pro-police.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000040" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000040">I
spoke during the previous debate about how arm’s length
government has now become, and how remote and ineffective are the
multiple layers of delegated accountability so that most of us no
longer believe that the Home Office is in control. Certainly the
elected commissioner aberration, rather than representing better
management, is but another waste of resources, as the electorate have
made very
clear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000041" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000041">I want
to give a practical example of how command responsibility has been
eroded to a point where accountability has become little more than a
paper exercise and, bluntly, of how this is leading to carelessness,
mistakes and, ultimately, corruption. I am not even talking about a
Hillsborough or a Savile. I want to talk about a conman called Mark
Heslehurst, who has been able to use the Cleveland Police for nigh on a
year in order to persecute a local councillor, Councillor Joan McTigue,
because she, although initially sympathetic to his story that his son
has been abducted to Cambodia, eventually saw through his intrigue and
challenged his attempts to extract money from a sympathetic
community.</hs_para>

Councillor McTigue, I met Heslehurst, made a few simple inquiries and
came to a similar conclusion. I do not have time today to go into his
cover story in detail. My complaint is that Cleveland Police have, on
behalf of Heslehurst, exclusively concentrated their inquiries to the
point of harassing a local councillor, a lady who worked in education
and is now semi-retired. Yet Heslehurst, using various
aliases—for example, Ian Blagg, who by coincidence tweets with
exactly the same grammatical and punctuation errors as
Heslehurst—is allowed free rein to publish outrageous claims
against this lady and against
me.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000043">Community
compassion has enabled Heslehurst to travel to the United States and to
stand for the Middlesbrough parliamentary seat after the death of 
<?notus-xml column=166?>our late friend, Stuart Bell, an individual who, like Councillor McTigue
and me, was badmouthed by Heslehurst because he was too astute to fall
for this conman. Enough about Heslehurst—I am running out of

material.</hs_para>

must ask is why Cleveland’s Sergeant Copley seems to concentrate
only on the actions of Councillor McTigue, to the extent that he has
seized and held this lady’s computer for the past four months,
but has found no reason to do likewise with Heslehurst’s,
despite the fact that she and I are blackguarded on an almost daily
basis. When I spoke about this to Inspector Wrintmore, he told me that
the matter was awaiting a decision from the north-east Crown
prosecutor’s office and that it had asked for more information.
However, that is not true. Let me read from two letters that I received
from the CPS. On 19 February the deputy CCP wrote to me
saying:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13031986000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000165">“I

I had time, I could tell a similar story about an 83
year-old lady in the North Yorkshire Police area, where police have
conspired to ensure that she is kept out of her home and where those
who have tried to help her, particularly a Tim Hicks, have been
threatened with arrest, only to find out when he came one-errand from

conclusion, I had similar personal experiences with the Met and the
PSNI when I was threatened with arrest due to totally unsubstantiated
complaints of assault. Do I look like I would assault anyone? I shall
leave that. Once in a Committee Room here, it was alleged that I
assaulted someone and that there were more than 45 witnesses, but not
one turned up. It also happened once after I gently reprimanded a road
hog. That is two more non-offences solved. I rest my

management is vital in the public and private sectors, both of which I
have worked in for the past 40 years. Performance management drives
improvement, can provide transparency and comparability, and ultimately
assists accountability. However, I agree with others that for too long
reported crime figures have been overrelied upon as the most important
police performance measure, despite their fragility as a true
reflection of crime levels and their vulnerability to manipulation and
massaging by rogue police officers. Others have spoken about
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031986000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000052">Many
years ago, as a young and new Chief Constable of Kent Police, I tried
to broaden the basket of police performance measures beyond the
traditional crime figures. After wide consultation with the public in
Kent, three additional measures were regularly published by my force:
first, on the police response to emergency calls; secondly, on visible
and reassuring police presence and availability on the streets; and,
thirdly, on overall public satisfaction with Kent Police. That force
became the first and only police service to be awarded a
Citizen’s Charter for its overall service to the public, and I
think that that was partly because we did not overrely on crime
statistics.</hs_para>

recent years, however, has fallen throughout the developed world.
Despite wide variations in police resources, methods and
accountability, there has been a relentless fall in reported crime in
all the major developed countries. Why has crime fallen? Policy, police
and government issues have clearly helped, but I firmly believe that
the main reason is the significant advances in technology and product
development that have dramatically changed the volume and patterns of
theft. For example, new cars are now very difficult, if not almost
impossible, to steal. Pin numbers and other anti-theft characteristics
have dramatically reduced the motivation to steal electronic goods. If
you cannot use or sell an item you have stolen, what is the point of
stealing it? The volume crime of theft has dropped dramatically
throughout the developed world.</hs_para>

slightly frivolously, there is scientific speculation that the removal
of tetraethyl lead from petrol and the consequential reduction of
harmful pollution to babies has led 20 years later to reductions in
violent crime levels in developed countries such as the United States,
the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France and West
Germany. There are very strong correlations between improvements by not
using lead in petrol and dramatic reductions in violent
crime.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031986000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000055">Moving
on to police manipulation, the perhaps understandable but flawed
overreliance on crime figures has also led to the manipulation and
massaging of crime figures by some rogue police officers. During my
first few weeks as Chief Constable of Kent, I had to deal with a major
discipline case involving Kent detectives who had been visiting
convicted burglars in prison. Through various inducements such as
taking them out for the day, letting them meet their girlfriends and
extra cigarettes, the detectives got them to admit to crimes they had
not committed, thus fraudulently improving the Kent crime detection
figures.</hs_para>

overreliance on crime figures with not enough being done to prevent
fraudulent behaviour. What should be done to improve the situation? I
think 
<?notus-xml column=168?>that the Government have already taken some important steps, including
the transfer of responsibility for the independent reporting of
national crime statistics to the Office for National Statistics. That
is vitally important. Improvements have been announced to the British
Crime Survey. Transparency through making changes to the collection of
crime statistics is, as I say, very important. I also welcome the
statement by the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice earlier
this month about changes to police recording practices and how crime
will be recorded. Some of those changes will come into effect from
April of this year, with others to follow in April next year.</hs_para>

vitally important for all stakeholders in this arena to acknowledge the
strengths, limitations and frailties of recorded crime statistics.
Crime figures must not be the only significant proxy for police
efficiency. Of course good policing and intelligence-led policing help
to reduce crime, while equally, bad policing and confused priorities
allow crime to flourish. However, reported crime is only a part, albeit
a vital part, of measuring police performance. It does, has not, and
will never provide the full picture. ACPO, the inspectorate, the Home
Office and now the new police and crime commissioners must accept the
limitations of crime figures, and they must give clear and unambiguous
signals that only the highest ethical standards are acceptable in
recording crime and detection figures. They must be ruthless in dealing
with malpractice by rogue police officers, whatever the motivation for
corrupting crime figures. It is wrong, however they try to justify it,
such as by using the euphemism of “noble cause
corruption”. These abuses must be exposed and dealt
with.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031986000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000058">I am
confident that the Minister will be able to reaffirm the
Government’s commitment to improving standards in this area and
that, with the support of the police service, further improvements will
be made. This is a vital area which impacts on public confidence in
policing.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_19_PT_1/5C8B1611C54CD287774E202DAC2C1FE0E3440DAA" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 19 March 2013">Tuesday,

standard Criminal Records Bureau check or on enhanced disclosure or

sufficient to trigger a “non-sanction detection” and
resultant entry on a computer. Needless to say, the Information
Commissioner was most concerned and I would like to know if this issue
has been addressed. Does the Home Office know how many such databases
are operated by police forces or associates, what they are used for and
how they are authorised, and will it ensure from today that all data

now turn to south Wales and a matter that I last raised on 15 May 2012
in a debate on the Queen’s Speech. It would appear that little
attention was paid by the Home Office to my comments, nor did it take
steps to use the powers it already has or, if necessary, to seek new
regulations. South Wales, its police force and the independence and
governance of its commissioner concern me. It seems that the chief
constable, Peter Vaughan, was part of the selection panel for the
deputy and assistant commissioners, the deputy being a political
appointment. I do not feel comfortable with this, or with the
appointment of his former ACC, David Francis, as assistant
commissioner. Surely this process should have been free of cronyism? I
thought that the idea was to introduce independence and new
ideas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000065">What I
previously called systemic corruption by a small number of that

included a number of FOI requests, which he neither answered nor
acknowledged receipt of in his reply of 10 September 2012. I therefore
submitted a complaint to the Information Commissioner for him to pursue
answers in full. The answers to the FOI requests appear to have been

happened in south Wales that was very similar to the type of case that
the noble Lord, Lord Condon, was referring to in Kent. A young person
was taken out of the prison in Bridgend and treated in the sort of way
mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Condon, except that he was plied with

<?notus-xml column=170?>four cans of cider and then asked to agree to a considerable number of
“taken into consideration” dwelling burglaries that he
had not committed. Unfortunately for the police officers doing the
questioning, the young chap was actually in police custody on the days
concerned. The two detectives received written warnings only as a
result of the IPCC investigation; the chief constable would have
exposed himself if he had committed the officers to trial. Why am I not
surprised? How long do we have to wait for a criminal judge or judges

Smith of Basildon:</B> My Lords, this has certainly been an interesting
and very wide-ranging debate and we should be grateful to the noble
Earl, Lord Lytton, for giving us the opportunity to look into these
issues and get some response from the Government, who I understand also
have concerns. He certainly raised some significant concerns about the
accuracy of crime statistics, which have been endorsed by other noble
Lords. It would be helpful if the Minister could say whether he intends
to pursue this
further<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:06:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000068">I
will not repeat what has been said but will instead look at some of the
evidence for the points made, particularly concerning the accuracy of
statistics. The UK Statistics Authority recognises two main sources of
crime statistics: police-recorded crime and the national crime survey.
Although they have different numbers, the trends are often very similar
as to whether certain categories of crime are rising or falling and to
what degree. It was therefore quite worrying to read a BBC report that
said falls in crime in England and Wales may have been exaggerated by
the police. According to the report, the Office for National Statistics
said the “rate of reduction” in recorded crime
“may overstate” the decrease. It went
on:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13031986000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000167">“The

colleague David Hanson MP has asked the HMIC to look into these
discrepancies. It was interesting to try to get some information from
the Office for National Statistics about why there could be a
discrepancy and what was the real issue about the falling level of
crime, which all of us want to see. I agree with the noble Lord,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:07:45"></hs_TimeCode> Whitty,
that we want to believe that crime has fallen. I suspect it has been
doing so for some time now, but to what degree and how accurate are the
figures? That impacts on the kind of crime strategy that we have. One
reason given by the ONS for underrecording is that more low-level
crimes are being dealt with informally and outside the formal crime
recording system, with officers being given greater discretion to do
so. The Office for National Statistics spokesman added that it was also
“possible” that 
<?notus-xml column=171?>lower budgets and fewer police meant that less crime was being
recorded—basically, there are not enough police to record and
act on all
crimes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:08:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000070">There
are different ways to deal with low-level crimes. At present there is a
very streamlined process of out-of-court disposals, which are
non-judicial measures available to the police, such as cautions. I am
sure that the noble Lord is aware that the Magistrates’
Association has raised concerns about out-of-court disposals being used
far more widely than was originally intended. In response to a Home
Office consultation on this issue, it
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13031986000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000168">“In

with all the crime that is being reported and dealt

that process being available to police, it is difficult to understand
why other low-level crimes have not been recorded by the police in
official statistics. However, if we look at some of the figures from
industry, the British Retail Consortium has reported a 15% increase in
the cost of retail crime and yet there has been a drop in the
proportion of crime reported by retailers from 48% to 16%, which is
highly
significant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000072">It
is difficult to get to the reasons for this, but it is clear that the
police are under increasing pressure. There are fewer officers, and
that could play a role. The Home Office recently published the summary
of a consultation titled <I>A Revised Framework for Recorded Crime
Outcomes</I>. The Government looked at the change in the way that
crimes which have been cleared up by the police are actually put into
the framework:</hs_para>
<hs_quote UID="13031986000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000169">“Since April
2011, to address the fact that the current framework does not recognise
informal disposals, the Home Office has been receiving data … on
crimes ‘cleared up’ by the application of local community
resolution or restorative justice disposals”.</hs_quote>

assure me that these informal reports are actually recorded as crimes
in the official statistics from police forces? I suspect they are, but
I would like an assurance that this is not a way of sliding statistics
in another
direction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:10:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="13031986000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000073">It has been recognised
for some time that there is a lack of confidence in crime statistics;
it is nothing new. In May 2010, as one Government left and another
Government came into office, the UK Statistics Authority produced a
report. I have to admit that I was the Minister responsible for the
statistics authority at the time, but I was not responsible for
implementing the report. Titled <I>Overcoming Barriers to Trust in
Crime Statistics</I>,<I> </I>it recognised the problem of lack of trust
in statistics on crime and made recommendations for enhancing public
confidence and the government action to be taken. Many of them dealt
with making published statistics easier to understand and increasing
clarity on how the information could be used. Transparency often means
producing lots of statistics that no one can get to the bottom of or
understand. Real transparency means that people know what the figures
mean. Of the recommendations made by the authority in 2010, how many
have been implemented and how many others are being acted on now? If
the Minister cannot respond today and wishes to write to me, I would
appreciate
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:11:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Condon. In any debate about crime
and crime statistics, there has to be room for reference to the
statistics on crime detection, which are an extremely important measure
of crime. They concern how many criminals are brought to justice, which
is the reason we support our police service. Last year, some 30,000
fewer crimes were solved. Does the Minister have any information on why
that
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:12:06"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031986000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000075">I have many other
points that I would like to make, but time is short, and I am sure that
there will be plenty of other opportunities to debate this issue.
However, I will say finally that it is important that the Government
should get a grip on the issue of confidence in the accuracy of crime
statistics. Data transparency is not enough; there has to be public
confidence and the Government have to be aware that this is an issue.
The 2010 report will be helpful in this. If the noble Lord is able to
give us some reassurances and can address the points made by the noble
Earl, Lord Lytton, that will be
helpful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:12:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:12:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_19_PT_1/79ECC0FD83431B8349ED368283F617BC9DA120B5" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 19 March 2013">Tuesday,

good that we have been able to air these issues in such a frank way. It

start from the position of being very proud of our police officers.
Every day they put themselves in harm’s way to protect the
public. Thanks to their hard work and the reforms that the Government
have brought forward in the police service, the police are succeeding
in their core mission to cut crime. I do not think there is any dispute
about that achievement. They are also coping with a difficult financial
situation. All public services—and, indeed, business as a
whole—are having to cope with the economic situation and the
need for deficit reduction.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=173?><hs_para UID="13031986000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000080">Before going into the
detail, it might help to place the importance of the integrity of crime
recording within a wider context. As noble Lords know, this Government
have undertaken a radical programme of police reforms that have placed
local crime concerns and priorities at the very heart of policing. Our
reforms have put an end to Whitehall interference and bureaucratic
accountability and introduced a new era of democratic accountability
based on locality. We have scrapped national targets. I think most
noble Lords recognise that that has probably been a great stimulus to
adopting a more local focus and a more straightforward approach to
these issues. We want the police to respond to local concerns. We have
given the public better information about crime in their area and we
have changed how forces are held to account. As noble Lords will know,
the website means that people are now aware of crimes in their
community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000081">In
order to empower communities to hold their local forces to account, we
must strive for greater transparency. The public must have a clear and
accurate picture of the issues that affect their community and what is
being done about them. The noble Lord, Lord Condon, with his
professional experience in this area, made a very thoughtful speech. I
reassure him that we have already announced that we are replacing
detections with a wider framework of outcomes, because outcomes matter,
removing the incentives to manipulate those figures to meet locally
maintained
targets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000082">I say
to the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, that informal disposals are included
in the crime figures. The crime maps, to which I have already referred,
enable people to compare their area with other areas. I think all noble
Lords are aware what a great hit this has been. Crime data have never
been more transparent to the public. People can see where crimes have
been committed, not only in the area in which they live but in the
areas in which they shop and work. Therefore, the integrity of crime
recording and the overall integrity of the police service are
interlinked, particularly in the eyes of the public. Recording crime
properly is essential to maintaining public trust in policing and
ensuring that victims of crime get the best possible service.</hs_para>

crime recording very seriously and we are committed to improving
transparency and building public trust in the
figures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:29:18"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
why we transferred the publication of crime statistics to the
independent Office for National Statistics. The Government also agreed
to the establishment of an independent advisory committee to scrutinise
the statistics and advise Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of
Constabulary on issues that need further examination. The new committee
will examine the statistics and advise on areas that HMIC should be
auditing. That is a new development, which will put increasing pressure
on accuracy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:30:07"></hs_TimeCode>. As
the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, knows, the ONS is independent of

HMIC review of crime recording found that the majority of forces
perform to a reasonable standard, and the ONS has recognised that the
quality of crime recording by the police remains among the best in the
world. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, was anxious 
<?notus-xml column=174?>about the figures that we have talked about with regard to a fall in
crime, and the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, was also concerned that we made
sure that the figures were accurate. Crime is down according to both
measures that we use; according to the Crime Survey for England and
Wales, it is down by 8%, while police-recorded crime is down by 7%; the
Office for National Statistics, too, has recognised that crime is
falling. UK crime recording is recognised, in an international context,
as being among the best in the world, as I have
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:31:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000085">Every
police officer has a duty to record crime accurately, which is made
clear in the guidance and regulations that cover their conduct. Police
officers are required to report colleagues whose behaviour breaches the
standards of professional behaviour. I reassure my noble friend Lady
Harris of Richmond that when crimes recorded by the police do not
reflect local crime experiences, we expect the police and crime
commissioners to hold their forces to account on those issues. We
continue to work with HMIC to improve the quality of crime recording
and build public trust in national crime
statistics<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:32:48"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T18:32:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000086">Every
organisation has bad apples, and the police are no different. Noble
Lords have cited some examples today. But it is important to remember
that the vast majority of police officers serve and protect the public
with honour, bravery and integrity. Noble Lords have mentioned a few
specific cases, such as those in south Wales and Kent. These are all
historic examples of where those concerned have been dealt with and
lessons have indeed been learnt. I hope that noble Lords understand
that the purpose of all investigations and inspections is to help to
maintain high standards. Recent reports by Lord Justice Leveson and Her
Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary have found no evidence
that corruption is endemic in the police. However, with every
accusation of corruption or that forces are gaming or manipulating
their crime figures, public trust in the police is eroded. So I
recognise the seriousness of this issue. The Home Secretary retains
powers to commission HMIC to undertake urgent work if there are
pressing systemic or serious issues, which, as noble Lords will know,
she has recently used in the Savile

Morris of Aberavon:</Member></B> My Lords, the question for this debate
on diabetes follows on from the debate on diabetes initiated by my
noble friend Lord Harrison on 29 November, when the House had a caring,
helpful and painstaking reply from the Minister—who of course is
responsible for health only in England. However, since the
preponderance of contributions then were on type 2, it was not
surprising that the Minister’s reply on diabetes type 1 could be
measured in half a column of
<I>Hansard</I>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000093" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000093">I
shall particularise again on type 1, about which I have already
declared a family interest. In sheer numbers, the lion’s share
of the diabetes problem is type 2, where some individual action can be
taken by those who suffer. Not a great deal can be done for type 1
except a great effort to mitigate the problem by management of the
disease, including the use of insulin pump therapy where appropriate. I
make three points. First, 400,000 people are currently affected by type
1, of which 29,000 are children, and incidence is growing 
<?notus-xml column=176?>at 4% a year. Secondly, lifestyle intervention will not prevent the
increase in the number: obesity is not the problem. Thirdly, only
research will find a cure for type 1. It is at present incurable and
can strike at an early age. My aim in raising the subject is to seek
once again to disaggregate the cost of diabetes type 1 from type 2,
both in the cost of treatment and the provision of funds for research
to find a cure. I have so far failed. The Department of Health does not
currently calculate the cost in the way I would hope. Why can it not do
so in future? That is my first question. Specifically, what are the
obstacles?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000094">We
have estimates. The direct and indirect cost of treating type 1 is said
to be of the order of £1.9 billion. With the projected increase
of sufferers, the cost will be even more astronomical. Until the
department is able to tell us what, in its view, is the order of
expenditure, we cannot hope to make good decisions as to what
expenditure is appropriate. We now have the opportunity of the
shortly-to-be-born National Health Service Commissioning Board to look
afresh at the two different types of disease. Aggregation of
expenditure under the general figure of diabetes will not help the
boards, as the Minister said,
to,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13031986000180" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000180">“guide

rely on those words. I am advised that representations were made to the
Department of Health that type 1 sufferers are a small
group—though not so small at 400,000 people—with the need
for highly specialised support. However, the request that type 1
sufferers be commissioned separately or at least differently has not
been approved. How is that decision justified? That is my second
question. Since this is the second time that I have raised this matter
in debate, perhaps the Minister could expand his reply tonight by
writing to me with the department’s detailed reasoning. I would
like
that.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13031986000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000096">It can
be of enormous material help to type 1 sufferers to provide insulin
pump therapy and its monitoring as an option. There is immense
international variation in the provision of pumps. In this country, as
with the management of diabetes type 1 care there was a postcode
lottery in the past. I was encouraged by the Minister’s reply
that 8% now had pumps here in this country. He went on
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13031986000181" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000181">“we

the obstacles to enable this and why have we been so slow? It is
estimated that the savings to the National Health Service that could be
achieved by reaching the NICE benchmark would be £30 million and
£60 million a year. We are talking about big sums of money. I am
told that in the United States, probably 40% use the subcutaneous
infusion. Norway, Austria, Germany and Sweden have higher figures of
use than us, while of course other countries have lower ones. I have
already questioned why the then health Minister, Mr Paul Burstow, was
able to write to me on 25 April last year saying, “that we were
generally in line with the United States”. That was a
significant reply which took a great deal of wind out of my sails as I
had relied on anecdotal accounts of disparity. It was a crucial
response. How could the 
<?notus-xml column=177?>department have advised him to write as he did? Given the evidence that
has emerged, that is now my third specific question for the
Minister.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031986000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000098">I
come now to research. In addition to government funding, a great deal
of work is done by charities, and I welcome the work of the Juvenile
Diabetes Research Fund. I understand that the Wellcome Trust is also
active in Cambridge, Oxford, UCL, Leeds and Hanover in Germany. Since
the last debate, I have been to Oxford to discuss with Professor Paul
RV Johnson, the director of the Oxford pancreatic islet transplantation
team, its work on an artificial pancreas. JDRF believes that research
into closed loop glucose control stands on the cusp of a breakthrough
that will represent the first step towards improving the lives of
millions of people with type 1 diabetes. They will be provided with an
artificial pancreas. This is where we are and that is what they
believe.</hs_para>

achieved by a partnership between experts in various disciplines and
industry for development, along with the regulatory agencies to ensure
safe management. The need for disaggregation is exemplified by the fact
that in 2009 the government spending bodies committed £51
million to fund research into diabetes, but of this only £6
million was applied to type 1 diabetes. I was encouraged by the
progress being made at Oxford and the successes achieved with adults so
far. I am sure I shall be further encouraged when I visit Cambridge and
discuss the matter with the team led by Dr Roman Hovorka. While both
the Government and the charities have to exercise care in the funding
of projects, I hope that the Minister will himself examine whether
there are any bureaucratic problems over the supervision of the
spending of research funds, both public and private. It would be a pity
if researchers had to spend an undue amount of time meeting
overprescriptive requirements regarding the minutiae of how money is
spent.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031986000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000100">I made
this point in the last debate, but I shall repeat it. There has never
been a real budget for type 1 diabetes services. They have been
developed on the back of academic interest and the clinical recognition
of need. What has been done so far is a great tribute to the
professionals. I earnestly hope that the commissioning boards will not
miss the opportunity properly to recognise that type 1 diabetes is a
disease with many different causes and characteristics from those of
type 2 diabetes. We should ensure that the good research work now in
hand is encouraged and adequately funded so that fresh hope is brought
to the 400,000 sufferers of type 1 diabetes—and their number is
growing each year.</hs_para>

Lord highlighted the amount of money being spent on type 1 and type 2
diabetes, which is familiarly known as some £10 billion a year,
but evidence from a European study that I am going to quote in a minute
suggests that it could be nearer 
<?notus-xml column=178?>£14 billion a year. This illustrates the theme of the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris, that there is a large degree of
uncertainty about the knowledge and facts that we have in this field
and it is something we need to repair, which I will turn to
shortly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000103">Having
said that, we should have an update on the debates we have had in the
past with regard to the treatment of diabetes. It is an odd
circumstance that as diabetes becomes an epidemic in this country it
has been largely neglected. Much more concentration has been on the
repair of cancer or the attack on heart diseases and so on. I do not
know whether the Minister has a reply to that but it is something that
we need to turn our attention
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000104">I am very
grateful that the Government have reiterated their desire to maintain
the same levels of health spending as in the past. Nevertheless,
cutbacks are beginning to happen. One of the most worrying themes,
which I hope the Minister will address, is the decline in the cover of
diabetics. We are beginning to lose the annual check-up, which is
typical of what we have had. There is a tilting over to relying on the
patient to bring to the attention of the GP a problem for the GP to
refer on. The problem with that is that it is the middle-class,
knowledgeable patient who understands that—so often at the cost
of neglecting those who do need the annual check-ups and the variety of
check-ups that were put in place by the previous Labour
Government.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031986000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000105">I
encourage the Government to spend wisely. For instance, I have made
this plea before about the DAFNE programme, which provides structured
educational courses for type 1 diabetics. It is claimed, and I believe
it may be true, that it pays for itself in four to five years, but it
is not generally applied throughout the United Kingdom and that is a
bad thing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000106">The
general rush to do away with bureaucracy sometimes has a fatal element
to it. I saw one of my many health advisers on Monday and at the end of
the consultation she looked at the screen and said, “We no
longer have the appointments done elsewhere and a paper notification
for you”. She has to do it. It took her about six minutes,
typing away. Of course, she is taking on administrative duties that
take away from her skills at the coal face. I hope that the noble Earl,
Lord Howe, will ensure that we leave the bureaucracy to the bureaucrats
and that the health specialists have the opportunity to do what they do
best.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000107">I want
to turn to a study by LSE Health at the London School of Economics,
<I>Diabetes Expenditure, Burden of Disease and Management in 5 EU
Countries</I>, which was published last year. It makes very informative
reading. Noble Lords will know that I am a passionate pro-European. One
reason for that is the ability to compare and contrast the practice of
the 27 countries of the European Union. This is a study of the five
biggest countries, but it offers us insights that we can adopt and
adapt here, or which they can adopt and adapt in their
countries.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031986000108" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000108">I
was surprised to note that the study firmly declared that blood glucose
monitoring is a cheap and hugely effective way of ensuring the health
of diabetics. The Minister will recall arguments we have had in the
past over testing strips, for instance. He will remember that 
<?notus-xml column=179?>he responded to a debate in which I tried to highlight diabetic foot
care, which I have always thought was quite expensive. I am clad in
shoes which are appropriate for my very strange feet as they give
protection which enables me to continue to do the kind of stuff I am
doing, as is the case with thousands of other diabetics throughout the
United Kingdom. I know that the noble Earl is familiar with these
debates. I sometimes think that he has been answering them since the

Galen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000109">The

occurs in people before they are 40 but I am extremely concerned about
the rate at which it is increasing in children. That in itself is
causing problems because people whose children have diabetes very often
find that they have to give up their job in order to attend school. I
hope that the Minister will come in on this: there surely ought to be
more collaboration between the health service and education. I tabled a
Question to the Education Minister and I must say that the
reply did not provide any more information. He said, “Yes, there
ought to be programmes”, but there must be more collaboration
because unless that happens, help will not be available to people with
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T19:02:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

because the cost of types 1 and 2 diabetes to the NHS
amounts to £10 billion every year; and the direct patient costs
of type 1 alone is £1 billion. Indeed, care for the
illnesses induced by diabetes that make it necessary for people to take
time off work if they are not treated properly—all sorts of
things occur to them—costs £0.9 billion. We ought to be
doing a lot of things about diabetes, and that is why it is important
to have debates such as this which attract attention to the
issue and raise its profile. As my noble friend said, there is no
reason why people who are well treated cannot live healthy lives. Not
enough of them are getting direct help and care. As I have said before,
that often affects their work and their careers. They need a little
more help from the health
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T19:03:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T19:03:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000116" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000116">How
many people are receiving the nine tests that are available to them? In
particular, how many children are receiving their annual tests? These
tests should be given annually. Why is that not occurring? I say again
that this matter should be given the priority that is needed. There is
no doubt that if people are given the special care that should be
available to them they can continue to hold down a job and have a
career and a healthy life.</hs_para>

other big concern that I have is with some of the side effects that
occur from diabetes. There is no doubt that people are not receiving
the education that they need; it is very patchy in relation to how many
get it, but if they do get the education programmes, it helps them
enormously. The 2009 data that I have seen show that of 6,500 people
diagnosed with diabetes—the Minister may dispute my
figures—only 180 received offers of help with education, and
only 30% of those diagnosed attended a
course<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T19:05:20"></hs_TimeCode>. Surely
we can do better than that—I should think
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T19:05:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000118" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000118">I
would like to refer to the mental health side, because the figures show
that people with diabetes are more likely to suffer from depression.
Poor mental health has a very negative effect on people, as we know,
and it is likely to need more care and attention from the NHS. Surely,
we could offer people psychological care as well. That is a very
important part of the treatment, and I do not know whether the Minister
has any figures to show how many people are receiving that, or not.
Like other noble Lords, I am disturbed by the idea that diabetes may be
pushed further down and may not be receiving the attention that it
should receive in the NHS. I was interested to see that there has been
a new appointment of a national clinical director for obesity and
diabetes. I welcome that appointment, but I hope that it is not only
going to be about obesity, which is very important—but so is
diabetes. I would like an assurance from the Minister that this new
director will be concerned equally with diabetes as he is with obesity.
Having said that, I welcome and look forward to the Minister’s
reply.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_19_PT_1/C4940D1E2C022DD2A967A975B2D17F511A8063AD" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 19 March 2013">Tuesday,

Collins of Highbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I have no doubt that my
contribution will be interrupted very shortly. I, too, thank my noble
and learned friend Lord Morris for initiating this important debate. As
a type 2 diabetic, I am acutely aware of the possible causes of my
condition and how lifestyle changes can improve matters. That is not
the case with type 1 diabetes, which is a chronic, life-threatening
condition with a lifelong impact on those diagnosed and their families.
It cannot be prevented and there is no cure. No one is quite sure what
causes it; possibly it is triggered by an auto-immune disease. It does
not involve lifestyle factors such as poor diet or lack of exercise, as
my noble and learned friend has
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T19:08:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000120">Although
the major increase is in type 2 diabetes, type 1 is also rising. As my
noble and learned friend said, estimates suggest that between 300,000
and 400,000 people living with type 1 diabetes in the UK, which
accounts for around 10% of all people with diabetes. People with type 1
diabetes are at greater risk of dying younger. The first ever report
into mortality from the National Diabetes Audit was published just over
18 months ago, and I referred to it in the previous debate.
It found that up to 24,000 people with diabetes are dying in England
each year from causes that could be avoided through better management
of their condition. About three-quarters of those are aged 65 and over.
However, the gap in the death rate between those who have and who do
not have diabetes becomes more extreme when comparing younger people.
It is truly 
<?notus-xml column=182?>shocking to learn that so many young people are dying from diabetes.
Type 1 is a particularly difficult condition to live with, as my noble
and learned friend pointed out. We need to raise awareness and campaign
to help to prevent and detect diabetes, as my noble friend Lord Hoyle
said. I am therefore sorry that the Government decided not to accept
the Public Accounts Committee recommendation on this particular aspect
of its report about mounting public
campaigns<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T19:09:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T19:09:33"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T19:08:20"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T19:09:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<I>Impact Diabetes</I> report, the current cost of direct patient care
for those living with type 1 diabetes is estimated at £1
billion, along with indirect costs of just under £1 billion
related to increased death rates and illness, work loss and the need
for informal
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T19:10:17"></hs_TimeCode>. Last
year’s Public Accounts Committee report also recognised that
while the department had improved information on diabetes, it was not
being used effectively by the NHS to assess quality and improve care.
It recommended that the department should work with the NHS to ensure
that the costs of diabetes are fully captured and understood in order
to promote appropriate services and better outcomes for patients. In
their recent response, the Government agreed with the
committee’s recommendation. I would therefore like to ask the
noble Earl what progress has been made in implementing it, especially
on the further work required to improve the underlying financial
information collected at both the local and national level, and how
quickly this will be made available to commissioners.</hs_para>

people with type 1 diabetes can live long, healthy lives if their
condition is well managed. However, too many are not getting the help
and care they need, leading to devastating complications, avoidable
deaths and greater costs to the NHS. Everyone with diabetes should
receive the nine agreed care processes recommended by NICE as part of
their annual review. However, two-thirds of those with type 1 diabetes
do not receive all nine. Can the noble Earl give more detail on how the
target of 80% coverage by 2018 given by the department in the PAC
response will be met? The concern is that the disbanding of NHS
Diabetes may result in a number of established work programmes either
not continuing or being suspended. It is really important that these
programmes continue. They include integrated care supporting
self-management, clinical safety, paediatric care and education,
specialist foot care, older person’s care, inpatient care and,
as we have heard from my noble and learned friend, insulin pump
networks. Will the noble Earl support further development of these work
programmes with the input of clinicians and patients to drive quality
improvement?</hs_para>

people whose checks are being recorded are getting all of the
recommended diabetes care, services and support that they are entitled

glucose levels higher than the recommended targets. As many noble Lords
here will know, on 13 March, Diabetes UK launched its type 1 essentials
for children and young people campaign. In seeking to help end the
variation in levels of diabetes care, the organisation wants to see
specific diabetes leadership and a diabetes service improvement
function in the new NHS improvement

the fact that type 1 diabetes is a condition which people have to live
with every day of their lives, my noble friend Lord Hoyle pointed out
that education for people with diabetes is not universal or guaranteed.
NICE guidance recommends that people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes
should be offered patient education programmes to help them understand
more about their condition and develop the skills needed effectively to
self-manage their diabetes. An economic analysis performed by the York
Health Economics Consortium, referred to by my noble friend Lord
Harrison, revealed that DAFNE, a structured education course for people
with type 1 diabetes, would pay for itself within four to five years
due to the reduced complication rate expected from improved management
of an individual’s
diabetes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000125" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0001.htm#13031986000125">As
my noble friend Lord Hoyle said, the National Diabetes Audit has been
collecting data on structured education in England and Wales since
2005. However, the completeness of the data is limited and therefore
has not previously been reported nationally. The 2009 data show that of
the 6,444 people who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during that
year, just 180 recorded offers of education. In Diabetes UK’s
2009 membership survey, only 36% of people had attended a course to
help them manage their diabetes since diagnosis.
All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-19T19:15:53"></hs_TimeCode> people with
diabetes, whether recently diagnosed or those with pre-existing
diabetes, should receive access to the education and support they need
to enable them to manage their condition. It should be available in
their local area and be accessible and flexible enough to meet their
individual needs. Like other noble Lords today, and like Diabetes UK, I
welcome the appointment of Dr Jonathan Valabhji as the National
Clinical Director for obesity and diabetes for England. However, I
would seek from the Minister an assurance that type 1 diabetes will not
be forgotten and that it will remain a core part of the new
director’s responsibilities. I have completed my speech without

education is essential. NICE has specified this and I support its
guidance. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris, asked what we were
doing to increase the use of insulin pumps. The national clinical
director chairs the Insulin Pump Working Group, which met today. It
exists to increase pump use and provided the insulin pump audit showing
that 8% of adults and children in the UK have pumps. Within that
figure, it is 6% of adults and 19% of children, but the work of that
group continues. I am happy to write with a full and detailed response,
as the noble and learned Lord
asked.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0002.htm#13031986000143">The
noble and learned Lord also quoted from a letter he had received from
my honourable friend Paul Burstow, which indicated that we in this
country were in line with the United States. I confess that I am
puzzled by that, as he is. The figures that I have are that the United
States has around 30% coverage. That compares to Spain, Finland and
Portugal at around 5%. We are, as I say, at 8%. I will look further
into that situation and write to him as
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0002.htm#13031986000144">The
noble Lord, Lord Harrison, referred to blood glucose monitoring, which
is, of course, essential to managing type 1 diabetes safely and well.
The national clinical director and the chief pharmaceutical officer
wrote to all doctors to remind them of that this year. Dr Hillson
recently wrote to the NHS on behalf of the Minister for Public Health,
highlighting the Minister’s concerns, and reminded the NHS of
the importance of appropriate prescribing and
management.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031986000145" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0002.htm#13031986000145">The
noble Lord, Lord Harrison, also asked about guidelines for type 1
patients. NICE produces patient-friendly summaries which I believe are
very helpful, while NHS Choices includes information about type 1
diabetes. The National Clinical Director for Diabetes has worked with
Diabetes UK to produce its guidance and we support the
organisation’s 15 healthcare essentials checklist. He also asked
why everyone with diabetes does not get an annual check. In the
Government’s response to the Public Accounts Committee we set
clear objectives for the NHS Commissioning Board and we will monitor
them closely.</hs_para>

was raised by the noble and learned Lord and the noble Lord, Lord
Hoyle. Recently, the Government announced that £775 million
would be invested over five years through the National Institute for
Health Research to drive innovation focused on major diseases,
including diabetes. The department is currently supporting more than 60
studies into type 1 diabetes through the Diabetes Research Network.
Diabetes research in the UK punches well above its weight and the
results are seen prominently in international diabetes meetings. The
noble and learned Lord also asked why type 1 is not included in
specialised commissioning. I will write to him with an explanation on
that point.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031986000147" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130319-gc0002.htm#13031986000147">I
would like to support very strongly the remarks made by the noble Lord,
Lord Hoyle, about children with diabetes. Children with the condition
should have equal opportunities in schools. Collaboration between 
<?notus-xml column=187?>children’s diabetes services, children’s carers and
education services is absolutely key to allow children to achieve their
full potential. All local authorities and schools should be encouraged
to read the <I>Managing Medicines in Schools and Early Years Settings
</I>booklet. He asked how many people are getting the nine care
processes. The answer is 54% of adults, but I regret to say that it is
fewer than 10% of children. However, as I mentioned, we now have the
Paediatric Diabetes Best Practice Tariff, which demands better care in
regional paediatric diabetes networks.</hs_para>

more to say and I will write to those noble Lords whose questions I

20%—equivalent to the basic rate of tax—of yearly

full-time hours for low and middle income parents. £200 million
of support will be provided within universal credit, which is
equivalent to covering 85% of childcare costs for households qualifying

the phasing out of ESC. The £200 million universal credit offer

were contracted out will see their national insurance contributions
equalise to the same rate as the rest of the population, but will also
build up access to the same flat-rate state pension, set above the
level of the basic means test. I can also confirm that 90% of affected

£0.6 billion is employer national insurance contributions from
private sector, £1.4 billion is employee national insurance
contributions from public sector and £0.2 billion is
employee national insurance contributions from private

referrals relating to a military veteran for diagnosis or treatment,
where they are aware of the patient’s veteran status, to record
that status as part of the referral. If the patient does not want the
GP to record their veteran status the information should not be
included. If GPs consider that priority treatment might be appropriate
because the condition to which the referral relates is likely to be
related to the patient’s time in the services, GPs are asked to
include details in the referral. There is no specific definition of a
service-related condition and it will be the judgment of the individual
GP based on the information provided by the veteran. The veteran may

State for Transport set out his initial preferences for the route in
January and a consultation will start later this year ahead of
announcing a final decision by the end of 2014. The Government continue
to support a direct high-speed connection to Heathrow, as there is a
case for providing significant rail capacity to the country’s
major hub airport. However, in September 2012, the Government launched
an independent Airports Commission to identify and recommend options
for maintaining the country’s global hub status. We consider
that further work on a link to Heathrow should now await consideration
of the conclusions and recommendation of the Airports Commission. We
have therefore paused work on the Heathrow spur. A station at East
Midlands Airport was considered by HS2 Ltd. However, the airport market

cessation of hostilities which would enable humanitarian access to all
areas. The estimated numbers of people affected (approximately
900,000), reports from agencies and from those who have fled to camps
in South Sudan and Ethiopia, give us cause for great concern. Access is
urgently needed for a full and independent humanitarian needs
assessment. We reiterated our calls to parties to allow access in the
United Nations Security Council on 12 March. We will keep the
possibility of further action in the council under review should
forthcoming talks between the parties not yield any progress.</hs_para>
