as a key element of the film industry. It attracts substantial
audiences and is an important part of cultural cinema-going. That is
why the British Film Institute—BFI—which is funded by the
taxpayer and the National Lottery, has three strategic priorities: to
connect the widest possible range of audiences with the broadest range
of films; to support film; and to preserve film

culturally insensitive since it puts at risk the picture houses,

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I entirely understand and,
indeed, sympathise with the noble Earl’s concerns, but
responsibility for regulating mergers falls to the independent
competition authority. The Competition Commission has decided that
Cineworld, having bought the Picturehouse chain, should sell one of its
cinemas in a number of towns. I know that the BFI has already
communicated its concerns to the commission, and it is open to
concerned parties to apply for a review of the decision to the
commission appeal tribunal.</hs_para>

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend has hit upon
a problem, which is the precise definition of art picture house. There
are independent cinemas as well as the mainstream ones. The problem is
that a lot of art-house cinemas show mainstream films as well as the
more cultural films. However, I think that we are talking about 300
independent cinemas.</hs_para>

Kidron (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as a
filmmaker and a recent governor of the BFI. A report last week,
<I>Rebalancing Our Cultural Capital</I>, documented the way in which
arts funding has shifted towards the capital over several decades. The
benefit to a Londoner is now three times that of someone living
elsewhere in England, and I think that it is in this context that my
noble friend asks the Question. Does the Minister agree that if we are
to address this cultural imbalance, we must build on the success of
existing art venues, such as the excellent art-house cinema in
Cambridge that does so much more than show films? Could the DCMS,
through its relationship with the BFI, perhaps find a way of
distinguishing between commercial screens and the added cultural value
that art-house cinema
provides?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000014"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Gardiner of Kimble" PimsId="5760" UID="1311049000814" xid="2035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000814">Lord
Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> First, I think that the British Film
Institute is doing a great deal of important work, with many
programmes. The one that I will mention to the noble Baroness is the
BFI Neighbourhood programme, which is part of a programme to help
establish and develop up to 1,000 community venues for films across the
UK. That is an important feature of what the British Film Institute is
seeking to do. In addition, there are of course many other initiatives
that the BFI is particularly concerned about, to ensure that there is
the broadest range of opportunities for people to see
films.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000015"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Earl of Glasgow" PimsId="3458" UID="1311049000815" xid="1851" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000815">The
Earl of Glasgow (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, these so-called art-house
cinemas are very important to the health of the British film industry.
They are sometimes the only place where our films ever get shown. Does
the Minister fully appreciate the importance of their survival,
particularly outside London and the major
cities?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000016"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Gardiner of Kimble" PimsId="5760" UID="1311049000816" xid="2035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000816">Lord
Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend is
absolutely right. The picture houses are very important, particularly
outside London; in particular in Cambridge, which of course is the
venue for the Cambridge Film Festival. There are many reasons why these
establishments are particularly important. They are part of our global
reach, and all film industry is very important for the British economy.
That, of course, is why the film industry has the tax relief it does,
which is an indication of the Government’s support for
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000017"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall" PimsId="1817" UID="1311049000817" xid="1765" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000817">Baroness
McIntosh of Hudnall (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest
as a regular patron of the Cambridge Arts Picturehouse. Will the noble
Lord consider that perhaps the Government have more of an interest in
this issue than he has yet indicated? These picture houses often show
live performances of work—for 
<?notus-xml column=4?>example, from the National Theatre—which is a way in which the
public funding that goes into our major theatres is made to work much
harder than it would if it depended simply upon people coming into the
theatres to see the shows. There is a serious interest here for the
Government to consider, which is why it would be a good idea for them
to put some pressure on whoever needs to have pressure put upon them to
make this
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000018"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Gardiner of Kimble" PimsId="5760" UID="1311049000818" xid="2035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000818">Lord

that to many parts of the regions, where it is vital. I have to repeat
that there is a procedure that has to be undertaken. Concerns have been
raised and, as I said, it is open to interested parties to appeal on
this matter. However, the problem is that when we have independence, we
must mean

Undoubtedly the continued interest in this issue from all sides of the
House and well beyond it will have had an influence on ensuring that we
had a positive response to the Silk commission’s first report.
The Silk commission made 33 recommendations but the announcement on
Friday did not go into detail on many of those. A full response to the
Silk report will be issued in the next couple of months so that we will
be able to deal with this by the end of the year. The intention is that
a draft Wales Bill will incorporate Silk recommendations that the

agreement in October 2012 between the Welsh Government and the UK
Government on the future of the Barnett formula. The agreement was that
there would be a review process at each spending review, and that if

Regarding the aggregates levy, the noble Baroness will recall that the

air passenger duty, the Government are not yet persuaded of the case,

general question with regard to the transfer of powers to Scotland,
Northern Ireland and Wales. As the Minister will know, in relation to
Scotland and Northern Ireland, transfer was on an all-embracing basis
subject to a few specific clear exceptions. With Wales, the situation
is very different. It is all piecemeal, sometimes involving hundreds of
minor transfers over the years. Will the Government look kindly,
therefore, upon a proposal that the situation in Wales should equate to
that of Scotland and Northern Ireland, thereby bringing cohesion and

recognise that there is a problem with the level of UK
representation among staff working in the European institutions. The UK
represents 12% of the EU’s population but makes up only 5% of EU
staff, half of whom are expected to retire over the next 10 years. The
Government are committed to reversing this downward trend. In the short
term, we are increasing

such a dramatic decline in the number of British civil servants in
Brussels and that, further, we have not succeeded with one British
national in the concours since 2010. Does he not agree that part of the
reason must be that able British civil servants are deterred by the
constant sniping at Europe on the part of this
Government—although not, I may say, on the part of the party
that he represents? Could not that be in part allayed by giving a
guarantee to any civil servant from the UK who goes to Brussels that
they will be able to return if they so choose? That was something that

for the European Commission started before the current Government came
into office. It is partly a question of language inadequacy; you have
to take the competition partly in your second language. Applicants from
most other countries take it in English as their second language, in
which they are very often highly fluent; we lack sufficient English, or
British, students, who are fluent in French or German, the other two
languages. If I may say so, there is no evidence that there has been a
decline because of uncertainty about Britain’s future relations
with the European Union. May I also say that the noble Lord is
misinformed, and that some 20 British candidates have succeeded in the
concours since 2010? He may have read an article that said that no
British civil servant has succeeded in the concours since that

a year studying in both French and English in the College of Europe, in
Warsaw or in Bruges, is very helpful in getting students accustomed to
the ways of Brussels and what is required in the concours. The last
Government cancelled the 24 British scholarships for the College of
Europe in 2009. They have been partly reinstituted, with five from BIS
for British officials next year, and a number of others from the
devolved institutions. In addition, a small group of people, which I
think includes several Members of this House, have contributed to a
private scholarship scheme, which will fund three scholarships this

evidence is not there. In terms of the secondment of national experts
into the European External Action Service, the British are second after
the French in the number of those who have succeeded in gaining places;
so there is some considerable evidence there. The members of the
Diplomatic Service have also been going round to graduate recruitment

without QTS. Indeed, under this Government, the number of teachers
without QTS has gone down by 20% from the level of 18,600 it reached
under the previous Government. By the Labour Party’s sole
measure for this, we are therefore doing rather well. We merely seek to
ensure that our children are taught by the best teachers, not just
those with a particular qualification. Under a Labour Government, a
teacher who had been teaching brilliantly for 30 years and
who had a PhD in his subject but did not have that particular
qualification would either have to get it or face the sack. How daft is
that?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000052"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T15:14:02"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall" PimsId="1817" UID="1311049000853" xid="1765" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000853"><B>Baroness

congratulate the noble Lord on somewhat sidestepping the Question that
I put to him. In passing, I also note that he did not refer to the fact
that his right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister takes a
different view from him on this matter, but perhaps I should not
intrude on private grief. The point is that knowledge, enthusiasm and,
indeed, natural gifts may be necessary but they are not sufficient in
developing professional competence. Does he not accept that, somewhat
against the tone that he took in responding to my noble friend Lady
Blackstone a couple of weeks ago, to make this point is not to be
dogmatic? I do not think that he would disagree with me if we were
talking about train drivers or brain surgeons. Will he explain why

among those from whom you buy your electricity. However, the issue of
competition at the other end and separating the generators from the

parliamentary draftsmen to render politicians incompetent to assess its

respect are particularly acute in connection with the provision of a
so-called route to market. Such a route should enable the independent
generators to survive what seems to be the clear intention of the big
six energy companies to squeeze them out of the market. The independent
generators are important because they represent the germ from which a
genuinely competitive energy market could develop. They are also
important because they could be expected in ideal circumstances to
provide a large proportion of the investment in renewable energy
generation. Some of the Government’s documents recognise this
potential. They imagine the proportion of new investment in renewables
attributable to independent generators being between 30% and 50% of the

been for a state-sponsored electricity and marketing board that would
purchase its supplies from independent generators. It

O'Neill of Clackmannan (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, when an amendment
of this character came up in Committee, I pointed out that we were
talking about an amendment that would take us back to some of the
original ideas that were circulating at the time of energy
privatisation—you might say at the time just before
liberalisation, because the two did not happen with quite the speed
that one would have wished. I do not think much attention was paid to
that point, but initially, we had a system in the UK where we had
massive generators responsible for nuclear and the Central Electricity
Generating Board. We also had regional electricity companies which
could generate no more than 15% of their
requirements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000076">Due
to the attractiveness of the liberalisation process to some foreign
energy companies, many of them in North America, we saw the acquisition
of a number of the regional electricity companies by American
companies. Thereafter, we began to see the merging of some of these
regional electricity companies, and we boiled it down to what you might
call the “big four”. Two of the companies had always been
vertically integrated—that is to say, the two Scottish companies
which at that time were Scottish Hydro and ScottishPower. By a process
of merger acquisition, we had the vertical integration of the
companies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000077">This
was not what was intended by some of the ideologues who were the
original authors of the liberalisation and privatisation programme.
They wanted a system which would be akin, in generating terms, to
something along the constitutional arrangements of pre-Cavour Italy. It
would have had a catastrophic effect if it had been allowed to happen;
a number of city states generating electricity in bits and pieces over
the country, much as we had with gas and electricity prior to the
Labour nationalisation in the
1940s.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000078">It is
fortunate that we did not have that, but what concerns me is that if we
are going to have generators of a relatively small kind coming
in—windmills attached to the national grid and water mills here
and there—they are not going to change the character of the
market to any great extent. We could have a situation similar to that
in North America, where there are companies still considering the
construction of nuclear power stations. In some instances, those
stations cost twice the capitalised value of the companies that want to
build them, so they have to look for partners across the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000079">While
these two amendments are well intentioned, I do not think that they
will do very much in terms of promoting competition. My feeling is that
if we are going to have the promotion of competition and the protection
of the consumer from oligopolistic malpractice, we have to have a
system of regulation which is capable of addressing that. These
amendments go no real way to doing that. Quite frankly, I think they
are something for another Bill. That is one of the reasons why I am
supporting my party’s proposition that we spend 20 months after
the next Labour victory putting 
<?notus-xml column=15?>through effective legislation which will change the regulatory
framework, and may well result in a degree of reduction in the vertical
integration
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000080">It
is a problem; I do not deny that. However, we have to recognise that if
we simply try to create opportunities for small players to become
involved, we are not necessarily going to challenge the oligopolistic
power of the big players. To challenge the purchasing power of the big
four, big six or big seven if you were to include First Utility which,
as I understand it, do not presently do any generating, we need far
more in the way of regulatory conditions that would work. At the
moment, I am not confident that these amendments can do that.</hs_para>

is useful that, even at this late stage, we have probing amendments,
but I find it very difficult and rather embarrassing that colleagues on
my side of the House are supporting some of the random writings of the
Austrian school of discredited economics that landed us with a great
many of the problems that we are now confronting. I would like to think
that my noble friend will withdraw his amendment. At the same time,
something needs to be done but I do not think that the terms of the
Bill and what we are trying to do at present makes the amendment
appropriate. It is one thing for us to try to change the electricity
market; it is quite another, at this stage, to try to change the
structure of electricity generating and the integrated nature of our

the time for an amendment of this character. It needs to be better
thought out and a lot more care and attention needs to be paid to the
significant point which was the undoing of the Austrians in the recent
past—that through a process of merger and acquisition you can
easily change the nature of the industry. It could be argued that the
Major and early Blair Governments did nothing about that process of
acquisition and merging. However, unless we had changes on that side of
the legislation as well, we could simply encourage the end of vertical
integration and then see a process of merger and acquisition. That
would take us back to where we are at present, which I do not think

a clear indication that there is something very wrong with
our electricity market. It is another layer of complexity that the Bill
introduces to the market, and it is needed because we have probably all
had considerable representation from independent generators saying
that they are simply not able to gain access to the market
on fair terms. That is very regrettable and a clear sign that something
major needs to take place in the shake-up of the electricity
market. Unfortunately, the Bill does not do that and was never intended
to, and I am inclined to agree with my noble friend Lord O’Neill
that another Bill would be needed to sort this

extra complexity, and my general rule of thumb is that increased
complexity equals decreased efficiency. I am sorry that we have had to
enter into this market with new provisions to enable independent

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Energy and
Climate Change (Baroness Verma) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank
noble Lords for the debate on the amendments and I shall speak to them
after I have spoken to my own amendments in this group. The amendments
standing in my name pertain to powers that enable the establishment of
a power purchase agreement scheme, which could provide generators with
access to an offtaker of last resort. The offtaker of last resort
mechanism will benefit both independent renewable generators and
investors by providing a guaranteed backstop route to market through
which generators can sell their power. This will enable generators to
use new and different routes to market, ending their dependency on
established players and stimulating new entry and innovation in the PPA
market.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311049000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000088">The
amendments I am speaking to today address specific concerns raised in
Committee that the price at which electricity is purchased in PPAs
under the scheme should be determined by reference to the current
market price. Amendment 61 clarifies that a PPA under the scheme is an
arrangement under which a supplier agrees to purchase
electricity,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1311049000336" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000336">“at

amendment confirms our policy intent that the offtaker of last resort
mechanism is exactly that: a last resort. Electricity purchased through
the PPAs under the scheme must be purchased at a discount to a market
price. This will give confidence to suppliers that they will not be
required to purchase electricity at above-market prices. I assure the
House that it is the Government’s intention that the level of
discount should also represent a sufficient level of revenue to enable
generators to raise finance. The discount level will form a key part of
our consultation in early
2014.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="1311049000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000090">Amendment

61A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, and the noble Viscount,

no more than 5%. It is important that the discount is large enough to
ensure that PPAs under the scheme are a last resort. The requirement
for the discount to be no larger than 5% is not compatible with that;
given that open-market PPAs typically have larger discounts, the scheme
would quickly become a first, rather than last, resort. This would
undermine new entrants to the PPA market and mean that anticipated
benefits of the scheme in terms of facilitating a more dynamic and
competitive PPA market would not
materialise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000092">On
Amendment 59A, I begin by stating my strong, and, I believe, shared

market, and what this Government will do should Ofgem’s reforms
be delayed or frustrated. If it proves necessary for the Government to
act, they should consider all options to achieve their objectives,
including those listed in Clause 43. However, it would not be prudent

already begun to discuss the issue of the independent generators, whose
success is extremely important if we are to have a significant increase
in the amount of new generation in renewables; perhaps 35%
to 50% of what we need will have to come from independent generators.
Therefore, a viable route to market for these generators, in what is
not a particularly 
<?notus-xml column=18?>satisfactory market, is important. The need to break into the current
dependency of the independent generators on the big six is obviously
important. That is why we had discussions both in the Commons and in
Grand Committee on the need to find an appropriate solution. The
Government tabled an amendment, which is now Clause 44, to enable the
creation of what is referred to as an offtaker of last resort.
Curiously, the words “offtaker of last resort” never
appear anywhere in the legislation, which is a little confusing to say
the least, but that is what we are talking
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T15:45:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000097">This
is particularly important, but it is not totally clear what the
effectiveness of the provisions put forward in Clause 44 will be,
particularly in light of the wording of the letter that the noble
Baroness, Lady Verma, wrote to the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington and
copied to other noble Lords on 22 July, which was rather cautiously
hedged as to how far there was a commitment. The reference was that
there would be implementation only “if necessary”. The
amendment, and the clause now before us, give only a power to the
Minister, not a duty. One of the things that we need to do, and which
these amendments attempt to do, is to ensure that it is clear that
there will be a an offtaker of last resort.</hs_para>

year and that the Minister may therefore feel limited as to how far she
can go in responding about the nature of such an offtaker of last
resort. However, it is essential that before the Bill leaves this House
we are clear that the consultation is not about whether or not there
will be an offtaker of last resort but of how that offtaker of last
resort will operate. That is perfectly legitimate. Unless it is clear
that there is to be an offtaker of last resort, the independent
generators will not have a bankable proposition that they can discuss

arrangements should be operational in time for the allocation of the

those contracts. Otherwise, the independent generators would find it
difficult to get the financial resources to get bids in those
allocations. It is therefore a reassurance to their investors that
independent generators will be able, if necessary, to sell their
electricity and cover their debt and equity from the outset of the new
regime. Until the OLR is operational, the contracts for difference will
not be of such value for the independent generators. It is therefore

make the arrangement bankable for investors and for the generators to
negotiate with investors, there should be a fixed discount off the

Jenkin of Roding (Con):</Member></B> My noble friend Lord Roper has
spelt out very clearly the purpose that lies behind this group of
amendments. The Government have allowed themselves to get into some
difficulty on this. A very good point that may have been made during
the discussion of the previous group of amendments concerns feeling on
the part of the independent generators that, although they welcome the
addition of four clauses to provide for these power purchase agreements
that represent the offtake of last resort, there is considerable
scepticism within the industry as to whether they are actually going to
be operated. As I mentioned at some length a week ago when I moved the
amendment about more competition in the industry, there is a feeling
that the oligopoly of the big six larger operators—they account
for 92% of the electricity supply to domestic and commercial users in
this country—is not going to allow this to
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T15:52:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000104">Some
of the reactions from Ministers have to some extent been contradictory.
This is what creates the uncertainty, and in some quarters a degree of
scepticism, about whether this is in fact intended. In private, my
noble friend’s ministerial colleague, my right honourable friend
the Minister for Energy Michael Fallon, was reported as
saying:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1311049000279" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000279">“I

yet. These matters were discussed briefly at Second Reading. More
importantly, there were some considerable debates in Grand Committee.
Any statement of that kind was conspicuous by its absence. As my noble
friend Lord Roper said a few moments ago, before the Bill leaves this
House we must have a clear statement from my noble friend that that
will happen. As he said in the previous debate, this is not just
something to be enabled as a last resort; it has to be seen as an
integral part of the new system. That is how it was presented but not
how it has 
<?notus-xml column=20?>actually been drafted. The reluctance of Ministers to say on the Floor
of the House what they have said privately to the industry is, quite
frankly,

is not the first time we have seen that. Last Monday, I moved an
amendment about competition in the capacity mechanism system that is
being introduced, which my noble friend was quite firm in resisting.
She has since written a letter saying that she is prepared to go on
negotiating with the independent generators concerned, which is very
welcome, but that was quite different from what Michael Fallon said
before the Bill reached this House. He made it clear that he was
expecting amendments seeking to promote more competition and to make it
a very clear duty on the Government, and that he would not quarrel with
that. I know that my noble friend was under some pressure last Monday
because the Leader of the House was waiting to make a Statement on the
European Council, but none the less she refused to do that. I felt it
right to withdraw the amendment rather than spend more time dividing
the House, and it was not at all clear that there were enough noble
Lords in the House at that stage who would have supported it. Still,
the fact of the matter is that we were faced with a contradiction
between what the Minister for Energy said and what my noble friend has
so far been able to say, no doubt under legal advice from her

the greatest of respect to her, that is not good enough. If this
offtaker of last resort is to mean anything at all, it must be
perfectly clear that it will be able to operate where necessary and on
the terms that my noble friend Lord Roper has already indicated. If my
noble friend is unable to give that undertaking today, I ask that she
goes back to her department and discusses the issue with her colleague,
perhaps when he has returned from the Middle East, where he is at the
moment. We should get a very clear statement on this when we reach

substantial sections of the independent industry, which feel that they
are being messed about. One reads in the article in the
<I>Telegraph</I> today about the difficulty in getting the investment
going—as the <I>Telegraph</I> says, a large amount is simply
waiting on the drawing board. To a large extent, that is due to a sense
of uncertainty about the intention of this legislation. It is open to
my noble friend, now or at Third Reading, to clear up some of these
uncertainties, particularly those relating to hire-purchase agreements
and the offtaker of last resort, on the lines of the amendments to
which my noble friend has spoken, so that the companies and the funds
that will be providing finance for them will know where they stand and

would perhaps be kinder than the noble Baroness’s noble friend
as I think that the noble Baroness probably 
<?notus-xml column=21?>does get the issue that we are seeking to articulate here. It is about
giving a degree of certainty to companies that are of necessity much
smaller than the big six and have difficulty raising finance because in
many cases they are involved in infant industries. In the front of my
mind is the generation of renewable energy in the islands of Scotland;
for example, in the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland. I know there is
to be a consultation on that, but there are opportunities throughout
the United Kingdom to access the various kinds of renewable energy that
will be available through the activities and investments of independent
generators. However, independent generators need to go to the market to
raise their funds and if there is not certainty that the Government are
really committed to the offtaker of last resort—that it is not a
programme for a situation that exists in extremis but is integral to
the operation of the market for that 8% or perhaps even less that
exists—not only will the market become unbalanced but we will
fail to give support to industries and generating capacity that already
have the potential to be world leaders.</hs_para>

she says. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is right. I suspect that the

Deben (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I might help my noble
friend on this issue. There is a win-win solution, which is to
recognise what has happened very recently in Germany. The big
generators always start off being unhappy about the competition.
However, RWE in Germany is expected to announce, after decisions made
very recently, that it has concluded that it is no longer possible to
take that attitude towards other generators in the German market. The
Germans have been so tough about the provision for smaller generators.
As I have said before in this House, it is remarkable that 50% of the
very significant amount of renewable generation in Germany is done by
municipalities, co-operatives and individuals.</hs_para>

generators have fought that because they felt that their own business
model was being undermined. It is quite clear from the latest evidence
that RWE will take a different view, that it ought to become much more
a facilitator of this rather than an opponent of it. If we get the way
this is phrased in this Bill right, we will be able not only to help
the independent generators but to help the bigger ones to move rather
faster in understanding that this is going to be a multiple market in

Cameron of Dillington (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I support all the
amendments in this group, as well as the amendments to which I have put
my name. Last week we had our debate on the need to open up all sectors
of the electricity industry to more competition. We on our side of the
amendment were surprised at the reluctance of the Government to
acquiesce enthusiastically to what we were proposing. We were even more
surprised when later in the week the Secretary of State for Energy and
Climate Change went on the “Today” programme and also
spoke in the other place about how greater competition was at the heart
of the Government’s electricity market reform. I have to admit I
had the surreal feeling that there seemed to be one Government at that
end promoting competition and talking about its importance and a
completely different Government at this end seemingly trying to ward
off competition. I hope that this week we have one pro-competition
Government in both
Houses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000116">In my
short remarks in the debate last week, I linked the need for
competition with the need for investment and spoke about how the two
are closely intertwined. The UK’s aging energy infrastructure
needs some £75 billion invested in new, largely renewable,
generation facilities by 2020, and the Government are relying on
independent generators, or at least their investors and financial
backers, to produce some 35% to 50% of this—that is,
£27 billion to £38 billion—before 2020, so this is
not a marginal problem. Only by solving it will ensure that we get the
investment we need along with the much needed
competition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000117">Of
course, there is a problem. In an ideal world, an independent generator
would want a backer for 15 years, because that is the normal
length of any form of mortgage agreement for such a scheme, but no
supplier is going to gamble on a 15-year PPA because the demand for
electricity could reduce over 15 years and a supplier could find itself
having bought more power than it could sell. Indeed, already four out
of the big six suppliers are not buying power at all from independent
generators, while the other two are charging up to 15% or 20%
commission on even short-term contracts, which for the independent
generator makes for an unviable PPA.</hs_para>

explained, this situation scares the independent generators and, above
all, their investors, so no truly independent generator is going to
invest without some form of compromise in the long-term marketplace.
Equally, no aggregator is going to enter the fray with the big six
oligopoly holding all the cards. We desperately need these independent
generators to invest and, as the Government—well, the Government
at the other end—keep telling us, it is only by encouraging more
competition that we will achieve that investment.</hs_para>

for an offtake of last resort—an OLR—to solve this
problem, which is fine, but as it stands, the solution in the Bill is
completely useless, as Clause 44 is so hedged about with
“may”s rather than “must”s that no
self-respecting financier would put any trust in it at all. The
Minister’s letter of 26 July, I think it was, does not give them
any encouragement either. It is a political cop-out rather than a
financial foundation on which to build a competitive electricity
industry. The words “political cop-out” may be a bit
harsh, but the clause is clearly written from a political perspective,
rather than the drafters putting themselves in the minds of an investor
or a mortgage company and thinking, “What can I put in this Bill

itself squeezed out of the marketplace without a commercial PPA. It is
vital that the price on offer is evidently—I stress that word
“evidently”—going to be enough to reassure a

will not reiterate my earlier comments, which are that I consider this
whole section of the Bill to be a sad necessity that need not have been
there had the Government grasped the bigger picture of properly
introducing competition during their energy market reforms. However,
Amendment 60 seems to be eminently sensible. It is clear, from all the
contributions we have heard today, that there is insufficient
confidence among independent generators that the Government are serious
about introducing something to assist them at this time. It is also
quite clear that the clauses we are now debating are a last-minute
addition to the Bill.</hs_para>

Government with the power to close the renewables obligation to new
capacity. As noble Lords know, this closure is planned for
31 March 2017 as part of the transition to contracts for difference.
We had previously considered that the renewables obligation
could be closed using existing powers within the Electricity
Act 1989. However, we have now concluded that a specific
power in this Bill will put the closure arrangements on a more reliable
and transparent legislative
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:25:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:25:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000142">To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:25:00"></hs_TimeCode>
ensure that consumers and industry have confidence that closure will
take place consistently across the UK, the amendment provides the power
for the Secretary of State to close the RO in England, Scotland and
Wales. It enables the Northern Ireland Executive to make similar
provision for the Northern Ireland renewables obligation. To give
industry early certainty on the way in which the Government propose to
use this power, we intend to publish this week detailed proposals on RO
grace periods for those projects that are delayed due to circumstances
beyond their control. These proposals will include a 12-month grace
period for projects subject to current investment decisions, giving
developers making such decisions this winter substantial reassurance
that their investments are not at undue risk from the RO closure

helpful points made in Committee by my noble friend Lord Stephen and by
the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, the Government have brought
forward Amendments 67 to 69 to clarify the scope of the powers for the

regular reviews of support levels under the fixed-price scheme. The
Government have no plans to change these support levels as, in a closed
and grandfathered scheme, we are unlikely to need to do so. It is
therefore appropriate to remove the provision for regular reviews,
which implied that we expected to make such changes. However, it is
also appropriate to retain a mechanism to change support rates if
unexpected developments were to make that essential. I assure noble
Lords that the conditions that must be satisfied for a review to take

Teverson (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Amendment
71, I will speak to my Amendments 73 and 74 as well. I understand that
people who know better than I have described my Amendments 71 and 73 as
clunky and I immediately put up my hand. I am trying to do the very
simple thing of turning something that the Government described as a
grandfathering clause into something that really is a grandfathering
clause. It came as some surprise to us in Committee, when we perhaps
read the Bill with greater care than we had done previously, that in
terms of emissions performance standards, the Bill effectively fixes an
EPS right up until the beginning of 2045. I refer not just to plants
that already exist but to those that will be built well into the
future. The emissions performance standard in this section of the Bill
applies to plants built right up to
2044<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:39:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000190">I
seek to improve this position. I hope that I am offering greater
investor certainty in terms of grandfather rights to those who might
invest in new gas plant or plant in other power sectors covered by the
EPS. Certain vehicles, for example, are approved when they are
manufactured and first go on the road and keep the relevant grandfather
rights until the end of their working life. That is what I propose in
this amendment. As I say, it would provide investor certainty in terms
of grandfather rights but, just as importantly, it would ensure that a
regular review takes place.</hs_para>

5 of the 2010 Act refers to three-yearly reviews, but those are
non-statutory. I have been reminded that Clause 58, on page 56 of this
Bill, contains a statutory mechanism to look at these things every five
years. I suggest that this should be done every three years and that
there should not be a need to change primary legislation—that is
the difference—in order to change the EPS. It seems to me a very
strong lock if the EPS is defined specifically in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:36:48"></hs_TimeCode>. I
understand that the existing provision in the Bill seeks to provide
investor certainty but I seek to give greater investor certainty by
saying that once a plant is consented it keeps that EPS right the way
through, at least until it has to be reconsented. I hope that the
Government will think that that is an
improvement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000192">Amendment
74 deals with a very important area. Coal plants are effectively
excluded from the EPS under this legislation. However, unabated coal
plants are one of the main sources of our nation’s overall
emissions of CO<Sub>2</Sub>. This is a major challenge in terms of our
climate change targets and our desire to bring down carbon emissions in
the United Kingdom. The amendment seeks to do a number of very positive
things. It would help fulfil the Government’s
intentions around carbon emissions and their
energy policy. The Government have rightly made provision in
the Bill that if certain major modifications are made to fossil fuel
generating stations they have to be reconsented and the EPS
becomes applicable, thereby making it impossible to run an unabated
coal station. I seek to extend that provision to all major changes,
including those plants attempting to reinvest to comply with the
industrial emissions directive—the successor to the large
combustion plant directive. We seek to do this because the
Government’s trajectory for their carbon plan has always assumed
that fossil fuel unabated coal stations will come out of UK 
<?notus-xml column=33?>generating capacity in an ordered manner after 2016. All that this
amendment intends is to make sure that that actually
happens.</hs_para>

is there a question mark now? It is because coal, primarily
because of shale gas in the United States, has now become incredibly
cheap. One of the outcomes has been that last year coal accounted for
around 40% of total electricity generation and overtook gas
which is now only about 28% of electricity generation—hence the
UK’s carbon emissions went up last year quite significantly. The
amendment would ensure that, although investment to prevent the output
of mainly nitrous pollutants and thereby comply with the IED might now
become economic and allow coal stations to carry on with this exemption
from the EPS for many decades to come, the Government will
actually keep to their trajectory in terms of taking carbon out of
the

me first stress, perhaps paradoxically, what the amendment would not
do. It would not take out coal immediately. As I said, it complies with
the carbon plan which the Government have already published.
Coal can continue to operate beyond 2016 under
derogations and, in fact, can operate for some 17,500 hours,
limited, right up to 2023. The importance of that is that coal-fired
power stations can still operate during peak times and therefore make
sure that we do not have blackouts. So the amendment does not get in
the way of security of supply.</hs_para>

other thing the amendment would not do is put up electricity prices. As
we well know, electricity prices are primarily driven by the wholesale
gas price and although coal prices have come down quite significantly,
unfortunately, as we know, wholesale gas prices have not and so
electricity prices have not either. It sometimes makes me ask what the
generating companies have done with the extra margin from the coal
production, but we will leave that argument for another

amendment would ensure that there is no longer a baseload coal
generation into and beyond the next decade. That is crucial for climate
change and the Government’s wish to bring down carbon emissions.
It would also meet those Government predictions. There are two other
things that the amendment will make sure of: one is that there is a
continued incentive for carbon capture and storage. Clearly and quite
obviously, if unabated coal can continue exempt from the emissions
performance standards, then CCS will go absolutely nowhere.</hs_para>

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, if no one else wants to stand
up at this stage, perhaps I may just say a few words. I have found this
a very difficult question. I have received a good deal of
representations in favour of my noble friend’s amendment, and
others sounding a warning note. I have said to them all that I will
want to listen to the full debate, particularly to what my noble friend
on the Front Bench has to

be wrong, and I am open to be corrected—the Government face
something of a dilemma. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, quoted the
figures on the existing volume of coal-fired electricity generation in
this country. I think he said that it is now about 44%, despite the
significant closures of some of our biggest coal-fired power stations
which have taken place in the past 12 months. The Government clearly
recognise that there must be no power cuts and that the impact of such
cuts on the country’s business and, indeed, on the
Government’s reputation would be quite devastating. Therefore,
as the Prime Minister said to me and a number of my noble friends back
in July, there must be no power cuts and we will have to do whatever we
have to do to make sure that we keep the lights on. As the Minister who
presided over the three-day week back in 1974 I have every sympathy
with that, because it is not a comfortable position for any Government
or Minister to be
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:47:03"></hs_TimeCode>. That is the
first priority of which the Government have to take

the Government want to make it possible for coal-fired power stations
to continue, there will be a severe impact on the incentive to build
new power stations. The gas-fired power stations have much lower
emissions; a modern station may have as little as one-third the
emissions of a coal-fired station. Given that we have spent a lot of
time during our consideration of the Bill discussing the need for a
proper financial structure for the new generators, many of which would
want to build gas-fired stations, one can see the Government’s
dilemma. I am not entirely sure that I can see the matter as clearly as
my noble friend Lord Teverson has, and I will want to hear the
argument<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:48:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> article. My noble friend left out rather a
significant sentence and was very kind to my noble friend on the Front

Government’s “dithering”. We have heard a certain 
<?notus-xml column=35?>amount about that—it is what the <I>Telegraph</I> said and what
my noble friend left out. As has been said many times, there is no
doubt that there is a considerable hiatus in the investment in new
generating capacity, a consequence of which has been the oft-repeated
and increasingly serious Ofgem warnings about the narrowing of the
margin between capacity and demand. The Government, therefore, simply
cannot go on risking that hiatus. So what is to be
done?</hs_para>

got existing coal power stations, they are producing energy and they

Stern of Brentford (CB):</Member></B> Coal is the dirtiest of fuels: it
emits around twice as much carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour as gas; it
is responsible for more than 40% of world energy greenhouse gas
emissions, and for more than 25% of UK greenhouse gas emissions.
Amendment 74 will encourage the switch from coal to gas; delaying that
switch could substantially increase the cost of meeting our climate
change targets. Gas itself has emissions which, if unabated, are far
too 
<?notus-xml column=36?>high for the medium or longer term but may provide a useful bridge in
the shorter to medium term—that is, until around 2030 or so.
After that, gas or coal would have to be abated or replaced with
renewables or nuclear if we are to meet our targets. Unless the world
acts to phase out or abate via carbon capture and storage, in the next
few decades coal will be very likely to take the world into very
dangerous levels of greenhouse gas
concentrations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000213">If
we could be confident of a strong carbon price then Amendment 74 might

Oxburgh (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, support these amendments.
We have to recognise that the Bill has been a long time in gestation.
What has changed since the Bill was originally conceived is that the
bottom has dropped out of the coal price. It is very important to point
out to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, that in fact cheap coal does not
mean cheap power: it means big profits for the owners of coal-fired
power stations. As the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, pointed out, the
electricity price is effectively tied to the gas price because of the
operation of the
mechanisms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T17:02:27"></hs_TimeCode>. As
things are at present, it is effectively the low coal price that is
driving the operation of coal-fired power stations and giving very
substantial profits to those companies that have them. Indeed, roughly
half that capacity is owned and operated by the big six.</hs_para>

patience longer, but simply say that I understand the point made by the
noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. There is effectively a chicken-and-egg
situation here. Unless we give the market the certainty that these

needed to maintain the attainability of our longer-term

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin has rightly
pointed to the crucial problem, which is: how do we deal with that
period in which there is fear that the lights will not stay on? That is
a proper fear to have and should be the first fear of any Government,
because there is a responsibility to keep the lights on. There ought to
be a second fear, too: namely, that we keep the lights on in such a way
that the next generation has an even worse position, because we have
polluted the atmosphere further and made the fact of dangerous climate
change even greater. We naturally have to look at this very
carefully<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T17:04:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T17:04:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000228">However,
on this occasion it seems that those who are most concerned with
keeping the lights on, and I certainly put myself in that category, and
those who are also concerned with climate change, and I put myself in
that category, too, are in fact pushing at the same door. If we do not
have a mechanism whereby it is sensible to invest in gas, that bit of
the transition will not take place. That would seem to most of us to
make it more difficult to provide affordably for the energy that we
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T17:05:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000229" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000229">The
noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, as so often, put his finger on one of the
other problems. When we talk about these things, let us not confuse the
cost of production with the price at which it is sold. Those of us who,
like me, have represented constituencies, know how many people are
close to the edge when it comes to warming their homes. The whole
question of affordability is utterly crucial. However, the idea that if
we burnt coal we would get cheap power is not so. We need to have a
mixture—a portfolio of means of generation—in which gas

game-changing matter. They are both wrong, but there is a place for

those who tabled the amendments and the Government are on the same
side—both groups want to achieve this. The real question is that
there is a kind of fear of letting go of nurse’s
hand—that is, the coal—in case we do not get the gas. I
would like to turn it around the other way: if we do not do this, I am
not at all sure that we will get the gas. That is crucial. I hope very

way that the EPS is drafted does not achieve that aim. The EPS was a

credit for introducing this policy. However, in California they are
clear that the limits that are placed on coal stations apply in the
event of a coal station seeking a life extension. That is what this

coal was never the most carbon-intensive source of electricity; old

mentioned, we have seen UK emissions going up, not down, and our carbon
intensity increasing last year, not decreasing. How are we going to hit
decarbonisation targets if we do not have a tool in our armoury to do
something about this issue? We could have a policy of carbon pricing,
as the noble Lord, Lord Stern, has mentioned. However, carbon pricing

to the security of supply, 8 gigawatts of old coal capacity has

stations that are still operating, representing 15 gigawatts of power,
are base-loading. They are no longer providing back-up power in the
winter peaks but are operating throughout the year and making their
owners a considerable amount of money. The Committee on Climate Change

12 stations that I have mentioned have tightening air quality

face of those tightening regulations. One is not to refurbish; they
will then be required to close by 2023. Another option is to convert to
biomass. The final option is to fit the filters that would enable them
to comply with the air quality standards. They could then remain open
indefinitely. In that situation, they would certainly wish to continue
base-loading, since they would have made new capital investment on

the lead department, is in danger of not complying with those

information about what these power stations are planning to do. This
can be only because it is intent on giving the maximum flexibility
while the details of the Bill are worked out, because the Bill contains
another very important element that changes the fortunes of coal: the
capacity mechanism payments. The capacity mechanism will give existing
coal plants an up-front cash injection just at the time they need it to
make those refurbishment decisions. Plants will be eligible for
three-year contracts. We cannot be certain how much those contracts
will be worth, but it will certainly be in the range of £80
million to £100 million or more over the three years. The cost
of fitting the filters is a surprisingly similar number of around
£100 million for a 1 gigawatt

they decide to make these capital investments and tip into this

that is also being added. Fitting these

coal is allowed to remain unanswered, how can any investor in
replacement capacity move forward? If you are not sure how many plants

it very difficult indeed to make the case for investment in new

go into too much detail on this but we have all had representations
from gas investors saying that they support this amendment. We should
just remember that, in a carbon-constrained world and under a
carbon-budgeting system, every coal station that remains on the system

have made it clear that it is needed now. Only those defending the
status quo and continuing to profit from the use of their existing

of these stations ought to be fully aware that, as we move forward to a
low-carbon economy, their stations will be the first to go. It is far

hopeful about the next decade. This EPS does not mean that we will not

through in carbon capture and storage projects. The arguments that have
been made today about investor certainty when it comes to gas equally
apply to CCS. It is in the coal industry’s best interests to see

final reason that the Minister may offer for not supporting this

not needed because we have a carbon floor price. No one can really say,
with all honesty, that there is any political certainty that the carbon

Minister and others that have very much cast doubt on whether that
carbon floor price will still be around. You cannot roll back green
levies, or even review them, without seriously looking at the carbon
floor price again. Even if it were to be maintained, it would need to
be at a very high level, around £40 a tonne, in order to achieve
the sort of fuel switching that this amendment would

<?notus-xml column=42?>sulphur limits. The benefit of having an asset in an existing, connected
station, with all the staff that you need, is enormous. A bird in the
hand is always worth two in the bush, and these companies are very
likely to make these decisions to invest. I would go as far as to say
that we will see Scottish and Southern, the owners of Fiddlers Ferry,
making that decision if we do not get this policy right. EDF, which
owns West Burton and Cottam, will do the same, as will Scottish Power,
owners of Longannet. There may be others. There are certainly 12

final point that I am sure will be raised is that this is somehow going
to push up the cost for consumers. The noble Lords, Lord Teverson and
Lord Oxburgh, have already eloquently explained that it is gas prices
that set the wholesale price and therefore we are not seeing the
benefit of the very reduced price of coal. It is true that, upstream,
the generators are making in the region of 20% profit, a large part of
which comes from these coal stations. However, it is far from clear

speak to the amendments in my name. I am grateful to my noble friend
Lord Teverson and the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for their amendments and
to all those who have contributed to this debate. I remind the House of
the policy intent behind the EPS. It is to ensure that no new
coal-fired power station is built without CCS, and that it is done in a
way that does not undermine the investment we will need in gas
generation to keep the lights on at a reasonable cost to
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000248" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000248">Amendment
72 seeks to shorten the grandfathering period of the EPS from the end
of 2044 to 2029. This shortening by some 15 years will increase
uncertainty for gas investors. Without this certainty, we risk
deterring or increasing the cost of new gas investments, with the
obvious potential consequences for security of supply and costs to
consumers. I recognise that 2044 is a long way off but this date is
derived from what investors tell us is required. Under the current
provisions, new gas plants consented in the later part of this decade
and built in the early 2020s would have a little over 20
years of certainty in respect of how the EPS will apply to those
assets. That is the amount of time that investors tell us is required
to pay back all debt and see a return on equity in the project. In
other words, with grandfathering, the EPS is not a barrier to financing
new gas generation plants.</hs_para>

concerned that we may be locking in high levels of unabated gas
generation well 
<?notus-xml column=43?>into the future that could risk achieving our legally binding 2050
carbon emissions target. I reassure noble Lords that the other measures
under our market reforms will ensure that this is not the case and,
therefore, that the EPS is consistent with our 2050 decarbonisation
target. This is because unabated gas generation will be increasingly
displaced by low-carbon generation over time. The Government set out
clearly in our gas generation strategy how we expect gas plants’
load factors to decline as low carbon comes on to the system, and how
in the very long term we expect it to be economically attractive for
gas plants to retrofit carbon capture and storage equipment.
Grandfathering the EPS until 2044 will not prevent this from happening.
Grandfathering to just 2029 would risk deterring or increasing the cost
of the investment in the new gas plants that we need to be built up to
2030.</hs_para>

and 73. The approach proposed by my noble friend is very close to the
one that we have already adopted. The Government have already committed
to a regular three-yearly review of the EPS. The EPS will also be
reviewed as part of the statutory review of EMR under Clause 58 of the
Bill. The amendments would enable the statutory rate of emissions and
the period for which it will apply to be revised very quickly following
a review by way of an order. This is an approach that the Government
have considered but have concerns about. The ability to revise the EPS
very quickly could result in a specific investment hiatus in the run up
to a review, due to the uncertainty that the review process introduces.
Pre-development costs for power projects can run into tens of millions
of pounds, so investors will be very aware of the risk that a quickly
implemented decision to revise the EPS could render a project
economically unviable, with the financial loss that could
result.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311049000251" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000251">That
is why we have taken the approach that any future changes to the EPS
should be by way of primary legislation. Combined with the three-year
period between reviews, this will help to ensure that projects that are
already in the planning system—by that stage having already had
significant financial commitment—are able to complete that
process before any changes to the EPS that would affect their project
come into force. However, I recognise the spirit in which my noble
friend has brought this amendment and the helpful intent to bring
greater certainty to the review process and the process for making any
future changes to the EPS. I will reflect on his suggestions with a
view to how we might underpin his concerns without creating any
unnecessary investment hiatus.</hs_para>

the Government’s goal is an orderly transition away from coal to
lower-carbon fuels over time in a way which does not create unnecessary
costs for consumers. While we do not expect large numbers of coal
plants to invest in clean-up equipment, a very small number of our more
efficient plant may wish to do so. This amendment is very likely to
deter that investment. In this scenario, more coal stations would have
their operation constrained, and there could be more stations closing
around the end of the decade than might otherwise be the case. This
could require more gas plant to be built earlier to fill the gap at
greater cost—ultimately, to consumers. Why should 
<?notus-xml column=44?>we close down our options in this way now when it could put our security
of supply at risk and significantly increase costs to consumers? A
small number of cleaned-up coal plants could provide greater diversity
and bring additional resilience to the electricity system in the coming
years, helping to ride any bumps in the road, given the significant
investment challenge that we
face.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311049000253" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0001.htm#1311049000253">I
have also considered carefully the argument that by taking action to
drive the closure of all of our coal power stations, we would be giving
certainty to investors in new gas generation. While this may be
conceptually true, it could also be true to say that you would give
certainty to investors in electric cars if you banned all petrol
vehicles, but that does not mean it would be a prudent or

turn now to the amendments that stand in my name. They seek to assist
the development and commercialisation of carbon capture and storage by
providing that a time-limited exemption to the emissions performance
standard will apply to carbon capture and storage projects during their
commissioning phase. While this has always been the Government’s
policy intention, these amendments seek to provide certainty in the
Bill. Amendment 73B provides for a three-year exemption period for
fossil fuel plant that use a complete 
<?notus-xml column=45?>CCS system. It also provides that the exemption period may only begin
once the complete CCS system is ready for use and is physically in
place. The exemption is time-limited and available until the end of
2027. This reflects our view that the exemption is a temporary measure
designed to assist the development of CCS and we expect learning from
the first projects and those expected quickly to follow to remove the
need for an enduring

74B adds to the existing powers available under Schedule 4 and enables
the exemption to be applied with modifications so that it can be

have seen £35 billion-worth of investment come to the UK,
£20 billion of that in renewables. We know that we must do all

Government are doing so. My department is determined that we should not

<?notus-xml column=46?>we need to be practical and down to earth and to get involved in the
reality of energy. This amendment was precisely about that. We have to
remember that, as this provision stands, it does not guarantee that
coal capacity will be there; it is left entirely to the whims of
investment committees of the big six as to whether they decide to
invest. We give up control at that point—we do not know. The
future is indeterminate. If we passed this amendment and it became part
of the Bill, we would then know what would happen. To me, that is
better than knowing what might or might not happen.</hs_para>

the Minister said, we are looking for investor certainty here. The only
way that new gas will be invested in as an intermediate technology is
through that certainty. At the moment, that investment is not taking
place, despite the clear ambitions that it should. However, I
understand the position of the Minister that if it were not for this
Bill we would not have an emissions performance standard. I advocated
it several times to the party opposite pre-2010 and it was never
accepted, so this is a major step forward. I beg leave to withdraw

Report last Monday, proponents of the decarbonisation target amendment,
backed by an impressive coalition of businesses, investors and civil
society groups, powerfully argued that such a target would provide
businesses with the certainty that they needed to invest. The target in
their view would have lowered the cost of borrowing, the benefits of
which would have filtered to consumers in the form of lower energy
bills. A speedier move from a carbon-based energy system, which is
becoming progressively more expensive, to a low-carbon system with high
investment in energy efficiency would have guaranteed comparatively
lower energy prices in the long term. In addition, the certainty of a
target would have encouraged development of low-carbon supply chains

decarbonisation target amendment, this amendment would provide
investors with greater certainty 
<?notus-xml column=52?>so that we can end the dumping of a substantial renewable energy source
in the form of organic waste into landfill. This will benefit business
and consumers, and help the UK to meet carbon and renewable energy
targets. There are four key benefits. First, it will help the UK meet
its renewable energy and climate change targets. Waste emissions,
mostly from organic waste in landfill, represent about 3% of total UK
emissions. Secondly, it would reduce the amount of waste going to
landfill. As recently as 2009, the UK was still land-filling nearly 21
million tonnes of organic waste. Thirdly, the diversion of food waste
from landfill would drive at least £693 million of feedstock to
anaerobic digestion each year. Diverting this food waste from landfill
would also save over £500 million in disposal costs. This is
well demonstrated in valuable research by the Green Alliance. Fourthly,
it would reduce risk. AD plants are not being built because of concerns
about feedstock. Of Tamar Energy’s 40 proposed AD plants, 25 are
at risk due to difficulties in sourcing food waste. Investment in these
plants, which is already secured, represents the single largest
clean-tech capital deal of 2013.</hs_para>

Committee that AD does not require targets because these would risk the
creation of new compliance burdens for business and local authorities.
However, the amendment would offer certainty to business. For example,
as I have just outlined, Tamar Energy recently called for a
ban on food waste to landfill. Feedstock risk is currently a major
contributor to financing problems for the AD industry: banks are simply
not lending to incineration plants without guaranteed feedstock
arrangements with local authorities. It was recently reported that 25
of Tamar Energy’s 40 proposed AD plants are at risk
due to difficulties in sourcing food waste, and that a landfill ban and
separate food waste collections would address this problem. Indeed, PDM
Group also supports a landfill ban for food waste as this would
underpin investment in AD

is more, it is worth noting that the lack of concern in official

Earl of Erroll (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am flailing around
slightly but I want to make a different point. The noble Lord’s
point is well taken: there is no point in food waste unnecessarily
going to landfill. It can also be composted in the right mixture with
other green waste, and so on. That is an alternative, because it then
makes a very good soil improver. The only problem is that the
regulations around the mobile plant SR2010 No. 4 permits that you have
to get can hold things up. They can be quite difficult to get and there
is sometimes quite a backlog. The other thing is that you do not really
know how much they are going 
<?notus-xml column=53?>to allow you to put on. Instead of trusting your agronomist to get your
fertiliser recommendations right, the Environment Agency insists on
trying to do it some time ahead. I am not quite sure why.</hs_para>

Agency seems to think that farmers are trying to poison their soil. A
sensible farmer is not trying to poison their soil. They will have a
proper agronomist giving recommendations. That would be much easier to
manage, because you have to start putting the waste onto heaps during
the year. You cannot suddenly get, in our case, 12,000 tonnes out of a
composting operation in one month. You can only put it on in
that gap when you are harvesting, before you cultivate the next year.
You are expected to incorporate it within a day, because if
anyone complains about the smell they come down on you like a ton of
bricks—even though there can be other farmers spreading slurry
and all sorts of manures around the place, so the smell could easily be
coming from them.</hs_para>

who are trying to avoid food waste going to landfill are sometimes
having a difficult time. It might be nice if the Environment Agency
looked slightly more kindly on it at times. So far we have not had any
real problem, but I can see it building up. Last year we suddenly had
the amount that we could put on reduced, which caused a certain amount
of chaos to our planning because we buy fertiliser a long time in
advance, and so need predictability. It would be far better to leave it
to our agronomist.</hs_para>

the debate highlighted the achievements made by the previous Labour

the developments made at EU level with the landfill directive, setting
up targets to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste

landfilling of waste. Amendment 76 is designed to require the Secretary
of State to set out a plan and timeframe, as soon as is practicable,
for reducing and eventually eliminating the landfilling of organic
waste. It would make it available for renewable energy generation and
other appropriate uses, consistent with the waste hierarchy as defined

reduction of food waste and the increase in the number of anaerobic
digesters generating energy from food waste. We very much agree with
the points that the noble Lord made during that debate about the value
of avoiding emissions of greenhouse gases from landfill. Preventing
food waste is the most effective approach in carbon-saving terms:
compared to landfilling, each tonne of food waste prevented means 4.2
tonnes of CO<Sub>2</Sub>-equivalent emissions are
avoided.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110421000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110421000020">We
have worked very successfully with industry to reduce supply chain food

waste is down by 13% since 2006, and we expect a
20% reduction to be achieved during the three phases of the Courtauld
commitment that all the major supermarkets have signed up to. These
results show that the voluntary approach can deliver real reductions 
<?notus-xml column=55?>in waste while allowing businesses to be more efficient and competitive.
We want to build on this work with businesses rather than impose
targets or restrictions. When food waste cannot be avoided, anaerobic
digestion is currently the best option that we have, because it
produces renewable energy and a valuable fertiliser. Over the years, we
have provided a range of support through WRAP for anaerobic digestion,
including £11 million in grant
funding.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110421000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110421000021">The

Government’s anaerobic digestion strategy to tackle barriers to
anaerobic digestion, we estimated that there was a potential to

food waste prevention and supporting a growing anaerobic digestion
industry without introducing further targets to those set out in the EU
landfill directive. I also add that current evidence suggests that
further statutory targets would have an impact on businesses and local
authorities in compliance and monitoring, risking additional cost
burdens on business. It is likely that these additional cost burdens

now come to the central part of this Bill which takes up 60 pages of
the main Bill; it comes to something like 60 clauses and a large
chunk—two-thirds—of the schedules. It has received
relatively little attention in the course of the Bill’s
proceedings, and virtually none in another place. We gave it reasonable
consideration in Committee and we reached a degree of consensus. There
are some things I still have queries about, but I am grateful to the
Minister for explaining aspects of that and also to her officials who
explained some of the aspects even further.</hs_para>

still remains, however, that this is part of the Bill which has
received very little public and wider attention. Yet it is one of the
most important parts of the Bill because it regulates the nuclear
industry. The policy of the Government, and to a large extent the
policy of all 
<?notus-xml column=57?>parties now, is that of a significant shift towards nuclear power within
our energy mix. We know the history of nuclear power is controversial,
not only in the past here, but also worldwide. It is therefore
essential that we get the system of regulation in this area right and
the balance right. The Government have, to a large extent, done that.
It has been quite a long gestation period taking what will be the ONR
out of the Health and Safety Executive, giving it certain additional
powers and clarifying in one piece of statute what its role is. I
commend that. While it makes for a rather lopsided Bill, it is an
important achievement. My amendments, therefore, are not attempting to
upset the main thrust of the provisions within these sections, but they
are trying to clarify some aspects of it. I hope that the Minister can
give me some satisfaction on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:14:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110421000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110421000032">One
of the main roles of the ONR, and one of the most important public
roles, will be the approval of designs for new reactors and the
construction process that goes with it. Yet in all those pages there is
very little mention of that role. It is mentioned here in Clause 60 and
it is mentioned specifically under nuclear safety. The reason that it
is so important is that both those who argue strongly in favour of
nuclear power and those who argue strongly against it are concerned
about the nature of the design of the reactor. It has been an issue in
relation to the Hinkley Point approval that this reactor may not be the
most appropriate reactor for the future—it may not be the most
cost-effective and it may not be the best in terms of the contribution
to the environment. Whether those criticisms are true or not, the
Government rightly had a very heavy assessment, verification and
approval process before they gave the go-ahead to the Hinkley Point
project. The ONR in its shadow form and the Environment Agency both had
a role in looking at that design. They looked at the design itself, its
engineering, its safety requirements, its operational requirements, its
effect on the ecology and the environment and of course they looked at
its economics. They gave approval following a pretty long process and
managed to rationalise the number of planning and other approvals that
were needed.</hs_para>

of the board of the Environment Agency and I took a particular interest
in the nuclear dimension of its activities. Both on the ONR/HSE side
and on the Environment Agency side that was a very effective
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:16:47"></hs_TimeCode>. It was,
however, an ad hoc process. It was a process that the Government
invented when we were talking about several different designs that were
possible and several different sites a couple of years earlier. It is
still true that there has been some criticism of the choice of design
being what some people refer to as an old design for what is a 35-year
project. I do not want to enter into an argument about the merits of
those criticisms myself, but it is important that the Government and
the regulatory system have a robust system of ensuring that the design
has been through the most rigorous appraisal
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:17:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110421000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110421000034">There
are of course other designs that will be coming along. We have other
sites that are capable and have been already designated by the
Government as potential nuclear sites. There are other designs out 
<?notus-xml column=58?>there which are already operational or nearly operational: the CANDU
system, a boiling water system, a PRISM system and there are companies
and consortia that are promoting those here and elsewhere in the world.
It is therefore highly possible that a different consortium from the
one that is operating at Hinkley Point will come up with a different
design which will need to be subject to an equally rigorous process. In
that process it is vital that part of the responsibility of the ONR is
to be at the cutting edge of nuclear technology and all the
sub-technologies that go to make up the design. It is also important
that it is
cost-efficient.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110421000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110421000035">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:16:42"></hs_TimeCode>

much for it. I again make no point on that at this stage. It is clearly
right, however, that it is done on the most cost-effective basis, both
for public acceptability and for the importance to the economy of
moving to a greater share of nuclear power through the 2020s. It is
also important that maximum safety is built in and, more generally, the

these sections of the Bill, one would not immediately deduce that this
is, in a sense, the central role of the ONR. The approval of new
systems, the new reactor designs and the appropriateness in the
timescale is an important part of our ability to meet our carbon
targets and to ensure that there is no detrimental effect either to the
economy or to the environment. It deserves at least
underlining—which is all my amendment does—that the role
of the ONR in this respect is crucial and comprehensive, and that it is
not only to do with safety but all these other matters as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:20:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110421000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110421000037">Amendment
76A makes it clear that it is not only the safety of persons that is
relevant but the safety of, and impact on, the environment. For that
reason it is also important that there is specific reference in the
Bill to the role of the Environment Agency. That agency played an equal
role in the Hinkley Point case. The Environment Agency clearly has
powers under the environment Acts but what we discussing is a joint
responsibility. The ONR is not taking over that responsibility from the
Environment Agency, which presumably could have been an option when the
ONR concept was

78B underlines what I have been talking about and makes it clear that
in approving a design, and the construction plans that go with it,
there is an absolute obligation on the ONR to ensure that they are of
the very highest quality. The amendment also covers issues of
cost-effectiveness, safety and security. This is central to the task of
the ONR, as I have argued. The safety dimension is central to the
safety of the population and of the environment. It is also important
in a political sense. The public’s acceptance of the shift to
nuclear power is fragile. It is significant but fragile, as we saw in
Germany and other countries following the events at Fukushima.
Therefore, it is important that the regulator we put in control of this
system is seen as having a comprehensive and robust responsibility to
deliver on all those elements when approving a major new reactor
design. On every occasion we need to go through a very detailed
process. It is important that it is written in large letters that this
is one of the ONR’s central
functions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:22:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that this amendment is superfluous but in terms of reassuring the

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, the House is very much
indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for the amount of time and the
expertise that he has brought to bear on this important part of the
Bill, as he rightly said. It has been a very long time in gestation. It
was recognised two, even three, years ago that the difficulties which
the ONR—it was then the nuclear inspectorate—faced in
recruiting people to do the very specific task that is required when
approving nuclear designs meant that they had to be sui generis so far
as the terms of the employment were concerned. They could not be
subject to the normal standard Civil Service rules. That is the primary
aim of this part of the Bill: namely, to take the ONR out of the
standard Civil Service terms of contract for the people it employs. It
takes anything up to 20 years before an inspector becomes fully
qualified to carry out the extremely expert work that is necessary to
approve the designs of nuclear power stations and they are difficult
people to come by. One needs to be competitive in this regard. The
Select Committee on Science and Technology heard evidence from the
former chief inspector, Dr Mike Weightman, who was very
clear about this and, indeed, was glad that the issue was at last
coming forward in this Bill. He made it clear that he had had to wait
rather a long time for this to be done. The Government are very much to
be congratulated on including the issue in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:24:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110421000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110421000041">Amendment
76A, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and others, seeks to
add the words “and the environment”. As a former board
member of the Environment Agency, the noble Lord has had much more
experience of this issue than I have. As he rightly said, the
regulation of this area is done by both bodies—the inspectorate,
now the Office for Nuclear Regulation, and the Environment Agency.
Their roles may overlap but they are most emphatically not the same.
Nuclear science and technology is essentially the area of expertise of
the ONR whereas the Environment Agency has the broader role of looking
at the impact of a nuclear plant on the surrounding environment and at
atmospheric pollution and so on. These roles are not the same. I will
be interested to hear what my noble friend has to say on this. However,
if I may say so, to add “and the environment” would
confuse the issue. This part of the Bill does not deal with the
Environment Agency, which continues to do exactly what it did when the
noble Lord was a member of its board. I would be interested to know the
reaction of the Environment Agency to the amendment. I think it would
say, “It is not for them, it is for us”, meaning the
agency. As I say, I shall be interested to hear what my noble friend
has to say but it raises a

regards Amendment 78B, we need to pay greater attention to
cost-effectiveness. I do not know how many noble Lords have read the
very interesting article 
<?notus-xml column=60?>by my noble friend Lord Ridley published a few weeks ago in which he
talked about the cost pressures of the nuclear inspectorate on the
price of a nuclear power station. I do not have the article in front of
me but I remember he said that the inspectorate is taking a very, very
safe system and insisting that it will be a very, very, very safe
system. The question is: what will that cost? I would be interested to
know to what extent it is the inspectorate’s role to consider
the cost of the additional requirements that it may impose on the
design of a plant.</hs_para>

am absolutely satisfied that the public will expect the inspectorate to
have very high standards. Indeed, I spent some years as the honorary
president of the Energy Industries Council, which represents some
650 companies in the supply chain for all the energy
industries. One of the things I find myself saying over and over again
is that if firms are going to sell to the nuclear industry they must
get used to nuclear standards which, for the most part, are
considerably higher than general engineering standards, and rightly so.
However, is it the role of the ONR to look to the question of cost? It
has to consider the design of the plant that is put before it. As the
noble Lord rightly said, there will be several. It is already looking
at the advanced boiling water reactor put forward by Horizon Nuclear
Power, which is now owned by Hitachi. It is not yet looking at either
CANDU or
P<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:27:48"></hs_TimeCode>RISM—the
other two items the noble Lord mentioned—which are still being
examined by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and the department.
However, if a design is put forward for either of those two items, the
inspectorate will have to look at those as well. Should it be concerned
about the cost? The only cost with which it ought to be concerned is
whether we are expecting too high a standard at too great a cost, and
whether this is absolutely essential. I suspect there is a temptation
to say that anything which makes an installation safe—even it
has to be very, very, very safe—should be done even if it costs
a lot. I do not agree with that. There must be a role here for looking
at the particular cost for the particular requirement that the
inspectorate is asked to look at.</hs_para>

Wigley (PC):</Member></B> My Lords, I apologise that I was unable to
play much of a role in Committee on this important Bill because of a
clash with other work here. When one is in a party of one, or one and a
quarter at best, it is difficult to spread oneself around. I have a
considerable interest in the question of nuclear energy and I am not in
the mainstream of my party’s opinion. My party has tended to be
anti-nuclear on the basis of fearing consequences if accidents of the
sort we have seen in Japan and elsewhere were to happen. I did a degree
in physics at Manchester University which contained a large element of
nuclear physics; I worked for a time building the Trawsfynydd nuclear
power station; and the Wylfa nuclear power station is also within the
old county of Gwynedd, my home area. Therefore, I was most grateful to
the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for introducing the amendment in a 
<?notus-xml column=61?>broad context, bringing in the environment, because the environmental
consequence of nuclear decisions is central to the public
perception<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:31:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110421000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110421000047">We
are expecting the go-ahead, in Anglesey, for the Wylfa B station,
something that I am very much in support of, as is a majority of
opinion within the county of Anglesey. There are, however, many people
who have worries about safety. As the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,
mentioned, those worries have to be taken on board and have to be
central to the thinking of the structures we are dealing with here. I
listened to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, a moment ago, saying that
there is sometimes the danger of going for the extra step of safety at
a disproportionate cost. Obviously, there is a risk that has to be
taken at some point, but the communities are only happy to support the
nuclear industry when they think that that risk is very small indeed,
that all steps can be taken to minimise those risks and that structures
are being put in place to do
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:32:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110421000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110421000048">In
the context of this part of the Bill and this amendment, one aspect of
the environmental impact that arises from nuclear energy is the
environmental impact associated with decommissioning. The Minister may
recall that I raised this question at Question Time not so long ago: it
is a matter of some concern. The new generation of nuclear power
stations have easier and faster decommissioning built into
them—one is very much aware of that. It is not the same
decommissioning process as was necessary for the previous generations.
One thinks of the Trawsfynydd nuclear power station which stopped
generating electricity 20 years ago and is still being decommissioned,
with 700 people still working on site on the decommissioning and
another three years at least of work for those 700. That is an enormous
cost. One accepts that, with luck, the costs of decommissioning will be
less when the technological needs of decommissioning have been more
appropriately designed into the original design of the nuclear power
station, but there are always
uncertainties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110421000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110421000049">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:39:30"></hs_TimeCode>

construction and running of nuclear power stations and who are charged

cost package were to go bankrupt? What if that company goes to the

guarantee, at the end of the road, that the communities that are
hosting this new generation of nuclear power stations cannot, under any

reason for that is that I think that it confuses the issue. My noble

the Environment Agency and design should be with the ONR. If we give
the ONR the environment as well, I think that there will be more
confusion than light and that would be an unhappy

This is a crucial issue and Amendment 78A in the name of the noble

to say that this has the seal of approval under the highest standards

article of not so long ago in the <I>Times</I>. One of his arguments
was that we should have a number of smaller nuclear plants, all
identical. You could then set the safety standards right at the
beginning, replicate the plants and have in-house expertise. Although I
am a great proponent of and believer in competition, there is an
argument here for saying that, having reached this stage, we ought to
stick with one design and replicate it because that will help lower
costs and help us get the relevant expertise into this area. If you
have to have one set of expertise for what you are building at
Hinckley, another for Anglesey and another for elsewhere, that might
stretch us too far. I would therefore welcome anything that my noble

Duke of Montrose (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to express
my opinion and interest in Amendment 76A. It is clear from what it says
that the ONR will have responsibility for protecting
“persons” against risk of harm from ionising radiation.
In fact, pretty well all the risks that one can think of are those that
affect persons. Perhaps in slight contrast to my noble friend Lord
Caithness, my worry would be that the Environment Agency will have a
big role in the approval, design and putting in place of a nuclear
power station but it is more likely that the Office for Nuclear
Regulation will be the body that is watching what happens day by day as
the plant is running. While one can state that someone has
responsibility for the environment—which is a nice,
all-embracing term that we might think would take care of
everything—we need to consider what the threat to the
environment might be. We do not expect nuclear power stations to blow
up but a whole lot of my sheep were prevented from going to market
because of the nuclear explosion at Chernobyl, 
<?notus-xml column=64?>and various neighbours of mine were required to put all their sheep
through a nuclear scanner. One man actually tried to put his dog
through it in order to show the possible dangers from radiation.
However, there is the possibility of food supplies being affected. At
Fukushima, the issue was marine pollution. I want to be sure that the
Office for Nuclear Regulation will be aware of the ongoing operation of
plants in order to protect those
elements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:44:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_04_PT_1/8386041682EFD4D35A86E479094CBB5942D9A1A9" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 November 2013">Monday,

78B seeks to include a new clause in the Bill concerning the design and

I reassure noble Lords that the regulation of the design and
construction of nuclear installations is firmly within the ONR’s
purposes and that the organisation, through well established
legislation such as the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and the Health
and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 will continue to do this. Secondly,
the ONR has a strong working relationship with the Environment Agency
in its generic design programme, and this will continue to be in place.
To place such a duty in the Bill is therefore unnecessary. It would
also be inappropriate to place the ONR under a duty to require the
industry to use the most advanced technology available. The role of the
ONR is to ensure that the design and construction of nuclear
installations meet safety standards. This may involve the use of new or
advanced technology. However, the focus is rightly on achieving the
highest possible safety standards.</hs_para>

that in undertaking its function with respect to the design and
construction of nuclear installations, the ONR will work to ensure that
these plants are designed and built not only to be safe but to make use
of appropriately advanced and proven technology. It would be grossly
inappropriate to place a duty on the safety regulator to regulate the
cost efficiency of the construction of these installations. Such a
requirement risks diverting the ONR’s attention away from its
crucial safety role and placing potentially conflicting requirements on
its regulators.</hs_para>

sentiment that nuclear installations must be designed, built and
operated to deliver value for money. However, I do not believe that
this should or can be achieved by placing the safety regulator in the
position where it must ensure that this is the case. It is for
companies such as EDF to build and operate new nuclear power stations
and make decisions about which reactors they use. It is important that
any reactor used is safe and effective in its design, and the UK has a
strong regulatory regime in place to ensure that that is the case. I
understand that we need to have value for consumers, but it is not the
role of the ONR to involve itself in the cost of design. The central
role for the ONR is to ensure that we have the highest standards of
safety in
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110421000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110421000068">My

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister and everybody who
has taken part in this debate, and I will answer some of their points.
The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is clearly right that the trigger for
setting up the ONR under a new statutory basis was to take it out of
the Civil Service, and a large part of the reason behind that was the
need to ensure that we have adequate expertise in this field. It is a
field that has been allowed to run down; we are probably not without
expertise at this point, but they are ageing. Some of them are tempted
elsewhere and it is a global market, and therefore it was important for
us to ensure that this
happened.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110421000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110421000080">Although
that may have been the trigger, we have a wider prospect here of a
largely comprehensive regulator having its duties set out in a fair
amount of detail in this Bill. It would be wrong to say that it is
entirely a reflection of the fact that we potentially face a scarcity
of resources. Having said that, it is of course important, as the noble
Lord, Lord Jenkin, and my noble friend Lord Judd have said, that we
address that issue in terms of training provision, investment and our
ability to compete for global talent. However, there are wider issues
involved here as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110421000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110421000081">Objection
was made to the reference in the first of these amendments to putting
“and environment” in the responsibilities of the ONR. I
have no desire—and my previous colleagues at the Environment
Agency would no doubt shoot me if I had—to change the boundaries
of responsibility between the EA and the ONR. It is important that they
are both operating in this area and operating to their own expertise.
However, it is also true, if you look at nuclear processes, and some
other processes as well, that the hazard involved, the potential risk
and the need for minimising that risk is not only to the personnel in
the immediate area and those who may be visiting in the immediate
population, but also to the environment. If my noble friend Lord Judd
lives 12 miles from Sellafield, he will know what I am talking about.
If anything were to happen at Sellafield, not only would he and the
population in his village be at risk but the totality of the
environment of West Cumbria would be at risk as well. It is therefore
important that, in approving a particular process or way of dealing
with that process, the ONR at least takes cognisance of the fact that
there is an environmental dimension. The expertise and regulatory
authority may rest with the Environment Agency but the ONR will also
have to take that into account. I do not find that confusing; it rounds
off what the responsibilities are but does not change the regulatory
boundaries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:00:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

78B refers to the ONA acting in conjunction with the Environment

was not making an absolute distinction between design and construction,
but the role of the EA is different in each case. In terms of
construction, all sorts of things come into place in 
<?notus-xml column=68?>terms of the effect on the ecology, the flood risk and everything else,
but in terms of design, both environmental and safety issues have to be
built in by the two bodies acting in

Earl, Lord Caithness, it would be interesting if the Government decided
that all the designs would be the same, but we are talking about
50 years of new nuclear build. We are already faced with the
view of some people that the design at Hinkley Point is out of date.
That may be wrong or it may be right, but it would be wrong for us to
close our minds and say that we are looking for a single design for all
the nuclear power stations in the places that we have designated as
potential sites. There are existing designs and there will be more.
There will be improvements in the designs that are currently out there
and therefore it is important that this is an ongoing issue. We do not
want to have a standard design. If I may say so to the noble Earl, it
is taking a slightly Stalinist view of these matters to say that we
should decide what is fitting now in 2013-14 for the operation of
nuclear power stations in the mid-2020s, with a view to that design
lasting for the next 25 years. I do not think that that is sensible at
all. Therefore, the ONR will have an ongoing responsibility to approve
new designs and to look at potential designs, whether or not we proceed
with
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:02:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

second of these amendments because I regard that as being, in a sense,
the central operational responsibility of the ONR. That is why I sought
to underline it. As I said, it is also, frankly, the central political
role of the ONR in relation to a new station so that it can reassure
the kind of people whom the noble Lord, Lord Wigley, referred to and,
more widely, address the general concern about moving into a new
nuclear era<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:03:20"></hs_TimeCode>. I
think that that objective needs underlining.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:59:59"></hs_TimeCode> noble and
learned Lord, Lord Mackay, made it plain that my wording is not
entirely clear and there have been other objections to it. However, I
hope that the Government will take on board the need to ensure that
that is seen as almost the number one priority for the ONR and that it
will somehow be reflected in the final version of the Bill that the
rest of the ONR’s responsibilities relate to the ongoing
operation of nuclear installations but that this is the key one. In my
view, it needs a greater emphasis than it currently has in the Bill.
However, for now, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

that the ONR is, essentially, a spin-off from the Health and Safety
Executive. Since 1974, the Health and Safety Executive has operated on
a tripartite basis. That has been reflected in its superstructure and,
in a slightly informal way, in the oversight structure of the shadow
ONR that operates under the HSE’s purposes. It has helped the
engagement and co-operation of the workforce and has ensured that the
worker side of operating complex plants and sites is fully taken into
account. It is my contention that that needs to be reflected explicitly
in the new structure. If it is not, a valuable part of the whole HSE
experience will be lost; and it is unnecessary to lose it in a
structure in which the ONR is responsible not only for nuclear safety
but for health and safety generally on nuclear sites. It is important
that we retain that structure and oversight.</hs_para>

just a question of not wanting to rock the boat. Worker engagement on
nuclear sites is a particularly important issue. A complicated site
such as Sellafield, which has huge potential hazards and where the
workforce itself has huge expertise, will have to undergo a number of
very difficult changes in the way in which it is operated. The
co-operation and expertise of the workforce is vital; that needs to be
reflected at the highest levels of the ONR. To provide confidence in
the system among the several thousand people who work at Sellafield and
the few hundred who work on nuclear sites elsewhere, we ought to retain
the essentials of the HSE structure and the provisions of the 1974
Act.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110432000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000008">There
are two deficiencies, therefore, in the governance structure of the
ONR. The first relates to expertise; the second relates to the way in
which the workers themselves, or, at least, knowledge of their views,
can be represented at the highest level. Unless we address both of
those, the management structure underneath may not regard them as a
priority to the degree that is essential if we are to make nuclear
sites operate both effectively and at the highest levels of safety. I

amendments go too far. We are talking about only five non-executive
members who are going to be appointed by the Secretary of State. One
must have regard to the main purpose of non-executive directors of a
board, which is, broadly, to hold the executive to account. I have been
a chairman of a board, although only part-time, in a totally different
environment, and found the non-executive members of that board
extremely 
<?notus-xml column=72?>useful. They assisted me in holding the executive members of the board
to account—not because of their expertise in a particular area

provision in the Bill for at least one non-executive member to have
responsibility for the security aspects of the ONR’s job. I do
not know whether this is the Government’s intention but it seems
to me that what is wanted is not somebody who is expert in nuclear
security, but who has wider experience of the whole of the national
security position and can bring that background knowledge and
perspective to the particular issues that arise in the nuclear
field.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110432000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000011">If
that is right, it is entirely understandable that the Government should
want to see that in the schedule. On the question of safety, however, I
do not understand what, exactly, a non-executive member’s role
would be. This is essentially a management matter. A non-executive
director would want to be sure that the right procedures were being
followed, particularly when it is a question of appointing someone who
will have some executive responsibility in this. You want somebody with
the experience of being able to do it, but to have a specific safety
non-executive person would be very difficult. I am not sure where it
leaves the professional management. Is it constantly being
second-guessed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:20:04"></hs_TimeCode>?

some extent, that is equally true of labour, staff relations and so
forth. I would not expect a non-executive director who had come
straight from a human resources job to say, “I’m going to
tell the human resources director exactly how to do his job”.
That is not the way in which non-executive members of the board should
be expected to operate.</hs_para>

amendments mistake the purpose of having non-executive directors. The
Bill has the right approach because having someone with a wider
experience of national security could be extremely useful, and nuclear
security could be looked at in that context. However, I would not want

Jenkin. We are not talking about a chocolate factory or even a motorcar

and the wider public acutely. It is not either/or; it is a matter of
having people with wider experience. The noble Lord is right: that is
the purpose of a non-executive director. However, there must be people
on the board who know what they are talking about, if they talk about
it, when we come to the specific issues of this special, advanced and

record of property development and all the rest, but it was suddenly
realised after Hatfield that it had neglected the very special

on the broader workings of power stations and other installations.

this amendment to Part 3 of the Bill, and my noble friend Lord Jenkin
for his sensible and measured intervention. Noble Lords will recall
that we debated the matter of the make-up of the ONR board in
Committee. Amendment 78A would introduce a requirement for the ONR
board to have at least one member with experience of, or expertise in,
nuclear safety management and one member with experience of, or
expertise in, employee health and safety
representation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000020">As
currently drafted, the legislation allows the Secretary of State to
appoint non-executives with skills and experience that best meet the
needs of the ONR. This may include experience or expertise in nuclear
safety, which I think is what the phrase “nuclear safety
management” means, although this is already provided by the
chief nuclear inspector, who is an executive member of the board. This
experience or expertise may include that of employee health and safety
representation. However, that should be a matter for 
<?notus-xml column=74?>the Secretary of State to determine over time and, while the matters
identified in the amendment are no doubt of great importance, it should
be left to the Secretary of State to determine whether that experience
would benefit the ONR.</hs_para>

flexibility to change its skills-mix over time as it develops as an
organisation and as the industry it regulates changes. The amendment
significantly restricts the flexibility available to the Secretary of
State in setting those appointments to only two non-executives. It
would be unwise to restrict ONR’s flexibility in this way.
However, the legislation does make provision for a non-executive with
security expertise. This role is required to ensure that ONR’s
security interests are carried out in the context of wider national
security policies. It is required to prevent nuclear security matters
from being developed in isolation from the wider, national security
agenda. The current security non-executive, for instance, does not have
specific nuclear security
experience.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000022">Turning
to employee representation on the board, as I have explained, the
intention is to have a skills-based board, not one made up of

inappropriate to mandate a representative of workers.

is important to remind noble Lords that the Health and Safety
Executive, which will retain overall policy responsibility for wider
health and safety in Great Britain, including health and safety on
nuclear sites, will have a trades union representative on its board.
Thus the interests of employees will continue to be represented in the
ONR’s wider work on health and safety on nuclear sites. In
addition to this, Schedule 7 makes provision for the Health and Safety
Executive to appoint one of its members to the ONR board, should it
wish to do so, and for the arrangement to be reciprocal. This will also
provide for employee interests to be represented on the ONR board. I

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, on this occasion I cannot say that I am
happy with the Minister’s response. The nature of the board,
together with the expertise of the personnel of the ONR, will determine
the degree of confidence there is in the ONR. On the issue not of
worker representation in the sense of somebody who represents the
workers of the nuclear industry on the board but of someone who has
knowledge of working concerns, which in HSE terms has normally been a
trade union representative, the fact is that the Government are taking
out of the HSE an important, high profile and, in industrial relations
and personnel terms, quite a delicate part of its responsibilities.
They are abandoning what was the great strength of the HSE, that at the
highest level it had tripartite representation which had the confidence
of all sides of industry and the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:31:44"></hs_TimeCode>. Most
of the other provisions of these clauses of the Bill reflect procedures
and responsibilities which have been directly or indirectly under the
aegis of the HSE. It is odd that the one thing removed is the
HSE’s governance, which has proved its worth for over 40 years.
That is a serious
mistake<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:32:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

safety management affects the confidence that the management of the
industry has in the ONR. One hopes management will have confidence in
the inspectorate and the chief inspector, but it has been put to me and
I expect it has been put to the Government that the operators of
nuclear installations want to think that there is somebody who knows
their side of the story in the governance structure. They are worried
that that is not prescribed in the Bill. The Minister says the
Secretary of State will make a judgment and it is quite possible that
he will appoint people with these qualifications or background, but the
Government do not want to stipulate that in the Bill. However sometimes
it is the Bill which gives the confidence and the particular
appointments are what give confidence. At the moment we are potentially
reducing the confidence that workers in the nuclear industry might have
in the governance and therefore the direction of the
ONR—unnecessarily threatening it, because the rest of the
provisions, I think, look after their interests well. We are also
threatening the confidence of management of nuclear sites in the
overall governance of the
ONR<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:40:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000026">These
may not be big issues in practice but in certain circumstances they
could become big issues. It is therefore important that the Government
take on board the argument so that, if we cannot stipulate it in the
Bill, the Secretary of State will have regard to these two dimensions
to make sure that the ONR operates not only in the best traditions of
the HSE but in a way that inspires confidence in the industry and the
workforce. I fear that, by not accepting this amendment, the Minister
may be jeopardising both. It would not be a big thing for either
proposal to be included, maybe not in the terms that I have them here

Government should opt in to the negotiation of the proposed regulation
reforming the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice
Co-operation—the agency which is more commonly known as
Eurojust. The proposal falls within the area of justice and home
affairs which will apply to the United Kingdom only if the Government
exercise their right under EU treaties to participate in its
negotiation, adoption and implementation or, in other words, to opt in
to this. The Government have to do this within three months of the

fear that this decision by the Government not to opt in to these
negotiations from the outset could be construed by our fellow member
states in the EU as representing a lack of commitment by the UK to a
very important crime-fighting agency. The UK is one of the
agency’s main users and, after the terrorist attacks in the US
in September 2001, has played a key role in the agency. For example,
for seven years of its 11-year history, the elected president of
Eurojust has been the UK member. I note that the Minister says that the
Government’s decision not to opt in has been taken pending
Parliament’s view, but it seems that their intention is clear:
the UK will not be opting in. In this context, it is difficult to
foresee the position of president of Eurojust being bestowed on the
current UK member. Although the committee acknowledges the validity of
the Government’s concerns for the UK’s criminal justice
system, the Government must also accept that the simple example of the
Eurojust presidency illustrates that there is a price to be paid,
perhaps in relation to our influence, when the UK chooses not to opt in
to EU
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000034">Essentially,
the regulation retains Eurojust’s core functions but includes
new provisions reforming the agency’s governance and management
structure. Notably, this includes Eurojust’s interaction with
the proposed EPPO, the UK’s participation with which has been
ruled out by the coalition agreement. The proposed regulation also
includes provisions augmenting the 
<?notus-xml column=80?>existing powers of Eurojust’s members and new arrangements
governing Eurojust’s accountability to the European Parliament
and to national
parliaments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000035">The
Government have some concerns. In their Explanatory Memorandum, the
Government praised the current legislation governing Eurojust and, in
the context of the Government’s 2014 block opt-out
decision—into which my committee has undertaken two recent
inquiries, along with Sub-Committee F, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord
Hannay of Chiswick—communicated their intention to opt back into
the current legislation. On the other hand, the Government also raised
a number of concerns with the proposed regulation on Eurojust,
including its potential ramifications for fundamental rights. However,
in light of the Minister’s letter of 21 October, it now appears
that there are two key concerns which have convinced the Government
that it is not in the UK’s interests to opt in to this proposal.
Both concerns are discussed in our
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000036">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:44:21"></hs_TimeCode>
first of those concerns relates to the aspects of the proposal which
change Eurojust’s governance and management structure, including
in respect of Eurojust’s interaction with the proposed EPPO.
Once the Commission followed the treaty requirement that the EPPO be
created out of Eurojust, it was inevitable, given the
Government’s clear policy of non-participation, that this issue
was always going to be difficult for the Government. However, the
report argues that the issue is not enough to rule out the
Government’s participation in the negotiations about the
Eurojust regulation. Indeed, the committee believes it strengthens the
arguments in favour of opting
in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000037">The second
of the Government’s key concerns relates to the requirement in
the proposed regulation that the powers conferred on members of
Eurojust by their member states are mandatory rather than
discretionary, as is the case under the current legislation. The
Minister says in his letter that mandatory powers of the type envisaged
by the
proposal,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13110432000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000156">“would

overwhelming weight of the evidence taken during these inquiries, which
is reproduced in the report, highlights the importance of
Eurojust’s work to member states. The report argues that the
Government’s participation in these negotiations is all the more
important given, first, the provisions in this proposal introducing
significant interweaving of 
<?notus-xml column=81?>Eurojust with the proposed EPPO and, secondly, the Government’s
clear stance of non-participation with the EPPO. It is my
committee’s view that the UK Government will not be alone in
their opposition to the EPPO—indeed the treaty anticipates this
eventuality by including specific enhanced co-operation provisions for
agreement. Furthermore, last week saw sufficient reasoned opinions
issued by national parliaments, including one from this House and one
from the other place, to force the Commission to review the
proposed
EPPO.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000040">Our

the noble Baroness, Lady Corston. We return tonight to the issue of
European co-operation in judicial and criminal investigative matters.

noble Baroness has pointed out, the pattern of the Rubik’s cube
has changed in the past week with the decision of this House and the
other place to issue a reasoned opinion on the grounds of subsidiarity
against participation in the European Public Prosecutor’s
Office. I spoke in the debate in favour of that decision on
theoretical, legal and operational grounds. We heard in that debate
from the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, who introduced the subject, of
growing concern among other states about the proposal. As I understand
it, from what the noble Baroness has said and from what the noble Lord,
Lord Rowlands, told us in our committee meeting earlier this week,
since then concerns have been found to be even more widespread and
substantial than was originally thought—indeed, so substantial
that it appears that the EPPO proposal in its present form is now
effectively dead in the
water<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:50:40"></hs_TimeCode>. The

principled objection to Eurojust in any form. It would appear that they
cannot and do not. First, because this country has been part of the

secondly, because although the Eurojust regulations fell within the
subjects covered by the opt-out afforded to us by the treaty of Lisbon,

issues which could underpin the Government’s apparent plan not

structure and governance of Eurojust. I find it hard to believe that
this country should not opt in to a body on the sole grounds that an
executive board should replace a management board with a director. It
seems to me to be arguing about a distinction without a difference.
Secondly, there is the different nature of our legal system compared
with those of most of our fellow EU members—in short, the
adversarial as opposed to the investigative
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:53:53"></hs_TimeCode>. I
recognise this challenge and I see why the Government have drawn our
attention to it in their explanatory memorandum. However, since the UK

appear to have been insuperable problems in the past and I see no
reason why they should be so in the

that Eurojust is an organisation which has proved its value in the
past, evidenced by the Government’s decision to opt in again to
the existing regulations. The major threat implicit in the regulation
we are discussing tonight was the introduction of the EPPO, but that is
not now going to happen. In my view the Government ought to take
advantage of this changed mood among our fellow EU members to opt in
and to ensure that this regulation is fashioned to 
<?notus-xml column=83?>the advantage of this country. Otherwise, having avoided participating
in the negotiations, we may find ourselves having to accept a directive
that has not been fashioned in the manner most advantageous to this
country. It is also hard to understand how we are going to be able to

acceleration and execution of European arrest warrants and the funding

the sub-committee to which I belong has recommended that we should opt
in. The real problem with Eurojust is well recognised. It is the extent
to which the new proposal interacts the European Public Prosecutors

is likely that the current Eurojust arrangements will change. If we are
not part of the negotiations, we will not be able to influence the
outcome as effectively as if we were at the table. It is not
impossible, as we say in the report, that if the UK fails to take its
place at these negotiations, they will proceed. Eurojust
will change, and the UK will find itself unable to opt back in to the
existing arrangements, leaving us at a significant disadvantage in the
fight against crime. The existing Eurojust will disappear, and we will

powerful and compelling case that the noble Baronesses, Lady

consensus on our report on the EPPO. As I understand it, we have a

Hodgson, said, since we wrote this report, the context has changed. We
have seen a very significant and “important”—in
inverted commas— rebellion across a number of European
parliaments to the draft proposal on the EPPO. It was our case that if
the Government joined in the debate and discussion on Eurojust, they
would find enough allies to change and alter that report effectively.
Surely the evidence of the past week or two has been that there are
such allies and that if one engaged in an active and proactive way on
this measure, one would find enough allies to change or transform the
report itself. Our case has been strengthened by the events of the past
week or two, and therefore I am puzzled if both Front Benches for some
reason oppose the conclusions of our

the Government’s concerns about the existing draft
proposal. Almost all those concerns are about the
interrelationship between it and the proposed draft for the EPPO. If
those fall—if, in fact, the Commission is going to have to
withdraw or revise its proposal—surely there will be a
consequential fallout in the draft Eurojust proposal. Will
the Minister bring us up to date on what has happened since last
Monday, when there were enough reasoned opinions across Europe to mean
that the Commission will have to review it? What has the Commission
intimated? It has suggested that it is going to
do so, and it accepts and understands the voices of concern. If it does
that, does 
<?notus-xml column=86?>it not also have to review and almost withdraw this proposal because
they are totally interlinked? A portion of the Eurojust draft is

this case, we have a compelling case for joining in the negotiation

have said, one of the things that swung me in favour of our
report—and I was sceptical at the beginning because I
understood and appreciated the Government’s concerns—was
that we could influence this because we sensed there would be a lot of
other supporters. The other reason why I supported it was that I looked
down the road and thought that a bizarre situation could happen in
which the Government opt in to the existing measure and then find that
this measure has been revised and it belongs to an existing measure
which down the road may well be of a different kind, and they have
opted out of that. I think that would cause a very puzzling and bizarre

Monday and whether the impact of what happened in the past week or two
means that the Government should rethink their position on this issue
and should at least keep an open mind on the question of opting in,
negotiating and influencing what I think is a very important
organisation.</hs_para>

Elystan-Morgan (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the matter before the House
concerns only Eurojust, but it is clear that Eurojust and the EPPO have
a very close nexus one to another. There are two ways of looking at
that nexus: one is positive and the other is negative. It seems to me
that the Government, and the Opposition for that matter—one is
in the luxurious position on the Cross Benches of being able to say,
“A mild plague on both your houses”—are
approaching the matter from an utterly negative point of view. The
Government have asked the question: is Eurojust in any way tainted by
association with the EPPO? They answered yes; ergo, it must be
rejected.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110432000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000067">I
argue that there is a forceful and utterly convincing case to the
contrary. I am proud to say that I, too, am a member of Sub-Committee
E. We have heard a great deal of evidence over the months with regard
to European fraud. The official figure for fraud was
€440 million or something of that nature. I do not
think that anybody applied their minds to it properly, as the evidence
was very different, appearing to range somewhere between €3
billion and €5 billion, possibly even in excess of that latter
figure. Nobody was charged with overarching responsibility. That is
where the case for the EPPO comes in. There is a saying in Welsh:
“Everybody’s concern is nobody’s
responsibility”. That is the situation here. Unless there is a
body that is charged with the particular commission of looking at 
<?notus-xml column=87?>European fraud in a serious way, as has never happened before, I think
that the whole system will be jeopardised to its very
roots.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000068">If one
accepts that there should be an EPPO—and the noble Lord, Lord
Hodgson, has pointed out that the objections are sere thin, casuistic
and have no merit whatever—it seems to be the case that the
Eurojust situation very much fits into that picture.
It seems to me that the whole situation is tainted by the
prejudices that have become so prevalent in the last few months in
relation to Third Pillar matters. We have heard abundant
evidence to show that it does not matter a row of beans what we do
about 90 to 95 of those 130 measures, as most of them have
virtually no effect upon our situation. One or two are of peripheral
significance. Yet somehow or other the Government have managed to taint
the whole situation by pretending that this is a massive battle for
British sovereignty. In doing so, they are jeopardising something like
30 to 35 matters that are of crucial significance in so many different
fields, and doing so cynically in order to pretend that we are somehow
winning a great victory in relation to the 95 matters that never
mattered at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000069">I

initially there was a certain amount of suspicion as to whether it
would be right for the United Kingdom to have any part to play at all,
for reasons that are easy to understand: we have our own system for the
administration of justice, our own prosecutors and prosecution system,
which is so very different from that in the countries on the continent.
However, I have kept an eye on this from a distance, and everything
that has happened since then has supported the points that have just
been made: Eurojust is beneficial and indeed essential to the battle
against cross-border crime that we all must face up to. The only way to
deal effectively with cross-border crime is cross-border co-ordination.
The report says that pan-European co-ordination is required. Indeed, it
is global co-ordination that is
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000072">From
my position, based in Scotland, I would attach considerable importance

various issues have arisen where they have been hands-on in
dealing with cross-border matters and the co-operation that
is available through Eurojust has been absolutely
crucial to the way in which they have been able
to carry out their work. I do not think that anyone in

us to two questions. Given that in Article 41 we see participation with
the EPPO being proposed and all the things that might follow from that,
does that make a difference? If it does, what do we do? Of course it
makes a difference, for reasons that everyone understands. The answer
to the second question—what do we do about it?—is, I
would suggest, made very clear near the end of paragraph 41 of the
report: it concerns the importance of being at the table. This is all
about negotiation. This is not going to the final decision-taking
stage. As I remember from Sub-Committee E, the essential point is to
take part in the negotiation process as documents that come from

is its purpose. It is inevitable, in a competitive single market, that
just as capital, labour and goods will move between borders, criminals
recognise no borders either. They will use whatever weaknesses there
are in domestic legal and police systems to ply their trade and to seek
protection. It makes no sense, as the Government have recognised, that
we should pull out of Europol, Eurojust or the European arrest warrant.
They all complement each other. The Government have agreed this, and
last week we also agreed that the further proposal for a linked
European prosecutor was a step too far, and the coalition is opposed to
that.</hs_parafo>

proposals for a new regulation for Eurojust which will look at its
structure, its new provisions for governance and management structure,
new provisions for its accountability to the European and national

They are concerned about the ramifications for fundamental rights, the
change 
<?notus-xml column=89?>to Eurojust’s existing governance and management and the whole
nature of the extended powers given to national members. However, as we
have heard, it makes no sense at all and it is silly that we are not

the great danger to us is that if we opt out of these negotiations
things will emerge that we are not happy with. We know that there are
many countries in Europe that agree with us on the whole issue of
whether or not to have a European prosecutor and on getting further
accountability of Eurojust. It is too important a body to us for us to
ignore the process of reforming it. Finally, on this question we should
send in the openers to bat, not rely on the tail end to pick up the

point is a general one. I apologise to your Lordships if it is
trite—it probably is—but to me it is blindingly obvious
that you cannot play the ball if you have taken your bat home. Every
noble Lord will have had experiences of negotiation in some context, if
only the domestic, and we know that if you choose to walk away you have
to pick your moment. You have to be clear what the deal breaker is and
know what your own compromise would be. However, until then you have to
remain part of the story, not least because you risk losing respect if
you are not prepared to get stuck in and stay stuck in to the project.
You certainly risk losing influence. My noble friend’s phrase
that you are “looked on as petulant” was absolutely spot
on. You risk not being regarded as a serious player, if and when
negotiations resume. Indeed, you risk being thought of as having
disqualified yourself from further negotiations in a serious way if you

has already been said, the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice
Co-operation—Eurojust—was established just over 10 years
ago. Provisions in the 2009 Lisbon treaty agreed by the member states
included provisions that required the EU’s institutions to pass
legislation in the form of regulations to determine Eurojust’s

has already been said, the proposed Eurojust regulation will apply to
the United Kingdom only if the Government indicate a decision to opt in

<?notus-xml column=90?>21 November. The Government’s position in the House of

should not opt in to the new Eurojust proposals at the outset of
negotiations but should conduct a thorough review of the final agreed
text to inform active consideration of opting in to the Eurojust
regulation post-adoption, in consultation with Parliament. If the
Government decide to opt in to the negotiation of the proposed Eurojust
regulation, which seeks to replace two existing Council decisions, the
legislation currently governing Eurojust will no longer fall within the
scope of the Government’s 2014 opt-out decision, under which the
Government are seeking to rejoin the current Eurojust arrangements as

the House of Commons debate last week, the Minister referred to
government concerns about the proposed connections between Eurojust and
the proposed and strongly opposed European Public Prosecutor’s
Office. The Minister also expressed government concern about the
proposed new Eurojust regulation creating mandatory powers for national
members. These powers, said the Minister, would allow a requirement for
coercive measures at a national level with the ability to insist that
national authorities take investigative measures in some circumstances,
which could cut across the division of responsibilities and separation
of powers between police and prosecutors in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, and the sole ultimate responsibility of the Lord Advocate in
Scotland for determining investigative action in
Scotland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000086">Unusually
for this Government in regard to a European Union agency, they publicly
rather value Eurojust. Their stance indicates they would prefer to stay
in rather than find themselves outside because they do not like the
look of the new regulation once it has been adopted following the
deliberations of all those member states participating in the
negotiations. In this regard it would at least clarify the
Government’s position if the Minister could indicate whether, if
the European Public Prosecutor’s Office proposal does not
proceed, and with it the references to the link up with Eurojust, the
Government will still not opt in to the proposed Eurojust regulation
unless other significant changes are made to the proposed regulation.
In other words, is it the connection with the EPPO proposal that is the
showstopper for the Government or are there other aspects of the
proposed Eurojust regulation that the Government also regard as a
showstopper as far as opting in to the regulation is
concerned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000087">The
Government should be able to answer that question in general terms
since they are not disclosing their negotiating position on what
significant changes would be required as, under their stance in the
House of Commons, they do not intend to opt in to negotiations anyway
on the proposed Eurojust regulation. What the question does—if
the Minister will give a straight answer—is indicate whether the
Government’s relative enthusiasm for Eurojust is
greater than their dislike of the proposed new regulation as it stands
minus any interweave between Eurojust and the EPPO,
or whether the Government’s dislike of the proposed
new Eurojust regulations minus the interaction with the European Public
Prosecutor’s Office is still such that if there is no
significant change in the

Government’s key issues with the text could be dealt with during
the proposal’s negotiation, but they recognise that the Eurojust
proposal has not been brought forward in a vacuum but is closely
associated with the Government’s policy towards the EPPO
proposal. However, as has already been said, there will be changes in
relation to the EPPO proposals since those proposals have been given
what I think is known as a yellow card as a result of decisions by a
not inconsiderable number of member states’ national
Parliaments, which means that the Commission is now required to review

European Union Committee considers that the non-participation in the
EPPO by other member states in addition to the UK, will inevitably mean
that the contentious aspects of the proposal dealing with the reform of
Eurojust will be subject to negotiations in the Council, and that the
United Kingdom ought not to miss out on such negotiations. The
committee takes the view that if the UK Government decide not to opt in
to this regulation they will not be at the table for the important
discussions addressing the position of those states wishing to
co-operate within Eurojust but who choose not to participate in the
EPPO. The committee says that it could not advocate such a course of
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000090">Referring
to the Government’s position that they value the work of

participating member states co-operate under the new proposal once it
is agreed. The European Union Committee has therefore recommended that
the UK opt in to the negotiations on the proposed Eurojust regulations.
Its report points out that the Director of Public Prosecutions said
that the UK’s involvement in Eurojust provides many benefits and

their work on this report. As noble Lords have said, we were here a
week ago to debate the issue of the European Public Prosecutor’s
Office when the House concluded that it should issue a reasoned opinion
against that proposal as it breached the principle of subsidiarity.
Today, we have turned to the related matter of the opt-in decision
triggered by the European Commission’s parallel proposal for a
Eurojust regulation. We have had a full debate and I have listened to
it with great
interest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000095">The
Government’s view is that the UK should not opt in to the draft
regulation on Eurojust at this time and we should conduct a thorough
review of the final agreed text to inform active consideration of
opting in to it, post adoption, in consultation with Parliament. I am
pleased to say that a Motion to that effect was agreed in the other
place last week. It has been very good to have the support of the noble
Lord, Lord Rosser, expressing the Opposition’s view that this
presented the right approach in the interests of Parliament and of
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000096">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T20:32:58"></hs_TimeCode>
Government have said clearly that we value the current Eurojust
arrangements, which is why we are seeking to rejoin them as part of the
2014 opt-out decision. I can only agree with the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, and all other noble Lords who have
pointed out the merits of the current Eurojust arrangements. Moreover,
prior to the publication of the new Eurojust proposal, we said
consistently that there was no need to reform Eurojust at this time; 
<?notus-xml column=93?>indeed, the Security Minister in the other place, James Brokenshire,
made that case clearly at the 10th anniversary of Eurojust last
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T20:33:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000097">Current
legislation is still undergoing a peer evaluation, which will not be
complete until next year, and the Commission has not put forward a
convincing case as to why the new proposal is needed. However,
regrettably, it has come forward with a new Eurojust proposal that
contains a number of substantial concerns. In particular, as the
European Union Committee’s report elegantly describes, the
Eurojust proposal is interwoven with the EPPO
proposal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T20:35:29"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T20:34:33"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T20:34:09"></hs_TimeCode>.
The reforms proposed to Eurojust would see deep connections made to the
EPPO with operational, management and administrative links between the
two bodies. At this time we cannot be certain either about the shape of
the EPPO proposal itself—not least given the subsidiarity yellow
card that has been issued, as we know, as a result of our debate and
debates in other parliaments—or how the relationship between the
EPPO and Eurojust might ultimately be
defined.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110432000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-0002.htm#13110432000098">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T20:39:19"></hs_TimeCode>

Elystan-Morgan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T20:35:04"></hs_TimeCode>,
that our concerns articulated in this House last week have not gone
away. To update the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, who asked where we were
we now as a result of last Monday, the number of votes from national
parliaments on the EPPO means that the Commission must now review its
proposal. Officials speaking on behalf of Commissioner Reding, however,
have interpreted this as being the majority of national parliaments not
opposing the proposal. It would be a huge mistake no longer to consider
the EPPO presenting a risk for the new Eurojust proposal. That is our
view of the situation at the present time.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T20:36:03"></hs_TimeCode> Government
therefore believe that it would be extremely and unnecessarily risky to
bind ourselves to the European Public Prosecutor’s Office
through our participation in the new Eurojust proposal at the start of
negotiations. This would be a needless risk when we can review our
place in Eurojust upon its adoption.</hs_para>

new Eurojust measure also proposes to create new mandatory powers for
Eurojust national members—powers which would enable them to
require coercive measures at a national level. The current Eurojust
measure works well and it does not force member states to give their
national members such extensive powers. The new proposal unnecessarily
removes this discretion. These proposals would cut across the division
of responsibilities and separation of powers between police and
prosecutors in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T20:37:14"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
quite clear that these proposals would conflict with the role of the
Lord Advocate in Scotland, who has been at the apex of the Scottish
criminal justice system since at least the time of the first recorded
holder of that office, Sir John Ross of Montgreenan, in 1483. Before
this debate I had no idea that the office so ably held by my noble and
learned friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness had such ancient
roots.</hs_para>

evidence that the Lord Advocate gave to the committee was on the
existing Eurojust measure about which there is no dispute among
us—it is a valuable measure—not the new proposal. That
evidence is therefore not relevant: the new proposal might actually
undermine the role of the Lord Advocate. It was following consultation
with the Scottish Government that we 
<?notus-xml column=94?>came to our view. On consultation, we have consulted the devolved
Administrations in Scotland and Northern Ireland. They have told us
that they understand our reasoning and they would not seek to demur
from our proposed
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T20:38:32"></hs_TimeCode>. The
concern in relation to the Lord Advocate’s role follows
consultation with the Scottish Government. Our clear view is that we
should not opt in to the new Eurojust proposal at the start of
negotiations because the risks it presents are unacceptably high for
our criminal justice system arrangements.</hs_para>

European Union Committee’s report that we might “miss

the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, made such remarks and they have been
reinforced by the speeches of the noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan

Droxford and Lady Hamwee. All have talked in terms of our missing out
or not being involved in the negotiations. I assure noble Lords that
where we do not opt in at the start of negotiations we will
nevertheless be actively involved. Not only will we be present in the
negotiating room at all levels, we will be able to intervene as and
when we wish. If we do not opt in to this measure now, we will
nevertheless be at the negotiating table energetically representing our
interests, and we will be able actively to consider opting in
post-adoption based on the final text and the further views of
Parliament. I hope that reassures noble Lords that this may be an
opt-out or a non-opt-in to the revised proposal but it is not an
opting-out of our responsibility to negotiate and make a success of
Eurojust, which it has been for all participating countries in the
past. I assure noble Lords that we will vigorously represent our views

that because my amendment provides a simple insertion to Clause 36. It

some children with cancer go through treatment with minor disruption to
their education, some find that they are disadvantaged for years as a
result of aggressive and debilitating treatment and have huge gaps in
their education. Their needs are very different. Some would be able to
return to school with minimal extra provision, while others may require
significant additional support. In some cases, that may be during their

part of the school is key, which is not surprising considering that
such children and young people are few in number. About 3,500 new cases
of child cancers are diagnosed every year and a similar number of other
children have other long-term diseases. Because of the variety of
conditions, each school will not have the necessary experience. The
issue is further exacerbated by the fact the child’s needs will
often not be immediately apparent, but learning can still be affected
in the longer term as a result of chronic fatigue, attention and
concentration difficulties and even psychological and emotional
problems. These issues can all directly impact on a child’s
ability to learn.</hs_para>

other benefits in involving hospital school staff and other
professionals such as clinical nurse specialists in the process, as
they are much more likely to have specialist knowledge about the impact

approach to previous parts of the Bill which sought to involve families
more in the process. I know, from discussions we have had about young

draft code of practice is very light on the scope to include families
in assessments. The emphasis is on parental involvement in discussions
and decisions, which is fine, but we are making a different point:
families do not just need to be consulted; their own needs for help and
support also need to be assessed. This whole-family approach is a
fundamental principle which should thread through the clauses and be
spelled out in the Bill. I hope noble Lords will support this

limit for responding to such requests. We feel that this is a
reasonable timeframe, given that such requests would not be made unless
there was a view that a child’s education was suffering in some

are aware that this requirement is included in the draft code of

important to realise that the suggested time limit of 15

Amendment 128A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, it is a key part
of the reforms that anybody working with a child or young person who
thinks that they may need an EHC plan can refer them to the local
authority. This includes providers of alternative provision, so that a
child or young person’s needs can be met. I reassure the noble
Lord that Clause 23 will enable providers of alternative provision, and
anyone else working with children and young people, to make a referral.
The local authority must then determine whether an EHC assessment is
necessary, as it would following a request under Clause 36.</hs_para>

129, 132A, 140, 141 and 142 are concerned specifically with time
limits, both for the assessment itself and for notifying children,
parents and young people of decisions made as a result of assessment.
We share fully the desire of noble Lords to ensure that parents and
young people have clarity about timescales for assessments, including
when they can expect to receive correspondence where a decision is made
that special educational provision provided through an EHC plan is not
necessary. Therefore, we give reassurances that we are maintaining and
improving protections for parents on timescales. The draft assessment
and plan regulations set out in one place these timescales including,
at Regulation 5, a timescale of six weeks for the local authority to
notify the parent or young person whether it will undertake an
assessment, as currently, and, at Regulation 13, an overall timescale
for assessment and planning to be completed within a maximum of 20
weeks, as compared to 26 weeks currently. We feel that these matters
sit best in the code of practice.</hs_para>

Amendment 132A, we believe that requiring further prescription about
notifications would not be helpful as it does not focus on timely
communications of decisions, which will vary from case to case. Setting
a 15-day period to communicate the decision may mean that local
authorities take the full 15 days rather than doing so as soon as
practicable, as required by draft Regulation 4. It may well be possible
within 15 days in many cases.</hs_para>

133 and 136, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady
Jones, concerning the right of appeal. We reassure the noble Baronesses
that we are committed to retaining current protections for parents. We
have already set out in the Bill and in Regulation 5 of the draft
assessment and plan regulations the right of appeal following a local
authority’s decision not to carry out an EHC needs assessment,
and the local authority’s duty to communicate this right to the
parent or young
person.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000027">In
response to the internal review aspect of Amendment 133, as
my honourable friend the Minister for Children and Families noted in
the other place, parents do not currently have a right to request an
internal review. We believe that it would create an extra level of
bureaucracy in the system. The Bill and draft regulations require that
parents and young people must be fully engaged throughout the
assessment and planning process. Taken together with the provisions on
mediation set out in the Bill, this will mean that an internal review
should not be
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000028">I
turn to Amendment 131, which was also tabled by the noble Baronesses,
Lady Jones and Lady Hughes. We share their intention that it is vital
to ensure that local authorities work closely with the child or young
person and their family throughout the assessment and planning process,
from a request for assessment to the issue of an EHC plan. In deciding
whether a plan may be needed and whether there should be an assessment,
we are clear that the local authority should base the decision on the
special educational needs of the child or young person, and whether
their needs are sufficiently complex that they may need provision
beyond what is 
<?notus-xml column=6?>normally available in mainstream schools or other educational
institutions. For those who may need a plan, the assessment process
will include looking at the needs of the child and young person across
education, health and care, including the circumstances of the family
for those under 18 with social care needs. For example, for a disabled
child who is “in need” under Section 17 of the Children
Act 1989, the local authority’s social worker will decide what,
if any, service to provide, including taking into account family
circumstances.</hs_para>

138A, tabled by my noble friend Lord Lingfield. The regulation-making
power in Clause 36(11) in relation to EHC needs assessments lists a
number of circumstances to illustrate the potential use of the power. I
appreciate that my noble friend very reasonably wishes to ensure that
important details regarding the assessment process are not left
unspecified. The use of “may” rather than
“shall” in Clause 36(11) is in order to retain a degree
of flexibility when making regulations in the future. It will ensure
that we can make sensible use of further learning from the pathfinders
and the experience of implementing the SEN reforms, enabling us to
adjust the regulations if that becomes necessary. For the purposes of
the consultation we have now published detailed draft assessment and
plan regulations which demonstrate how we intend to use the power. The
draft regulations demonstrate our commitment to retain the legal
protections for parents in the current system, and to extend them to
young people in further education and
training<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T15:49:54"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T15:49:54"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T15:49:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000030">Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T15:50:02"></hs_TimeCode>,
we would like to support Amendment 139, tabled by the noble Baronesses,
Lady Hughes and Lady Jones. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee said that imposing a requirement on anyone to attend
assessment meetings, including the requirement on parents to present
their child at such meetings, would be meaningful only if there was a
corresponding sanction for failing to attend, mirroring current
legislation. One of the central parts of the new system is that parents
and young people will be involved more fully in the assessment and
planning process, and from much earlier on. Clause 19 ensures that the
views, wishes and feelings of children, their parents and young people
will be listened to and respected, and that they participate as fully
as possible in the decisions that affect
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T15:50:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000031">We
do not want to impose a sanction in such circumstances, and after
consulting the pathfinders we remain convinced that existing
safeguarding legislation is the best route for any issues caused by
parents not presenting their children for assessment, where there are
welfare concerns. Given this, we do not believe, as do the noble
Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady Jones, that a power to require
attendance at assessment meetings, with a corresponding sanction, is
absolutely necessary, with the exception of Amendment 139, which I am

Touhig (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 137 is tabled in my name
and those of my noble friends Lady Hughes of Stretford and Lady Jones
of Whitchurch, and the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston. I shall speak
also to Amendments 145, 165, 173 and 175 in this group. Amendments 137,
145, 165 and 173 seek to amend various clauses, including Clause 36,
“Assessment of education, health and care needs”; Clause
37, “Education, health and care plans”; Clause 44,
“Reviews and Re-assessments”; and Clause 45,
“Ceasing to maintain an EHC plan”. All these clauses
refer to a local authority “having regard” to a young
person’s age when making a determination. Examples include the
review of a plan or the decision to cease to support a plan. Similar
amendments to these were tabled in the other place seeking to replace
the reference to age with a reference to having regard to
“educational outcomes”, but these amendments go further
and would simply remove the references to age altogether. This is
something that I am sure colleagues in the Committee know that the
sector is much exercised about. These amendments seek to ensure that
children or young people with 
<?notus-xml column=8?>education, health and care plans are supported to achieve qualifications
similar to other children and young people regardless of their age, so
long as they are under
25<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T15:55:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

currently outlined are restrictive and there is a lot more that should
be taken into account by local authorities when deciding whether a
young person needs a plan or remains in need of one. Many young people
have specific circumstances such as spending periods of time not in
education or training, the reasons already discussed in relation to
previous amendments, or they may lag behind because of their specific
learning difficulties. It is therefore essential that decisions should
be based primarily on educational outcomes rather than a young
person’s

amendments, and removing the reference to age is not an argument for
support to go on indefinitely. Indeed, I think that the age of 25 is a
sensible and proper target, but it is also wrong that age should be the
overriding factor that is considered by local authorities, as the
clauses currently suggest. The Minister in the other place agreed that
age should not be the only factor considered when determinations are
made, but he did say that the Government,</hs_para>

organisations, and my view, is that the Bill genuinely wants to ensure
that young people with special educational needs have all the
opportunities that they need to get the best out of education. The
publicity around it has made much of the nought-to-25 system that is
being introduced. It has also made much of the need for
personalisation, which the amendments reflect. The aim of the
amendments is therefore to ensure that the individual needs of the
young person are recognised through the planning process, and that
decisions about continuing their learning are made on the basis of need
rather than an artificial link to their
age<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:03:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, is that there has been
something of a tendency to think that, because the ages 18 and 25 are
mentioned, these are the appropriate points rather than anywhere
between those two ages. We are concerned that parents will feel that
they have to battle to get a 
<?notus-xml column=10?>place beyond 18 in order that their son or daughter may stay until they
are 25, setting up perhaps inappropriate expectations that they will
continue through to 25 when it might be more appropriate for them to
move into looking after themselves at an earlier
age<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:03:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

why a young person with special educational needs might need to be in
education beyond the age of 18. Their learning difficulty may mean that
they take longer to learn, practise and consolidate their skills. They
may need additional time to become more autonomous learners, moving
away from a situation where support is very hands-on to support that
promotes their independence. They may need to learn how to use
technology that can support this autonomy. Young people with special
educational needs often mature later than their peers, and it is not
until they move into a more adult environment that they really make a
step towards more effective learning and taking on greater
responsibility.</hs_para>

required to progress into mainstream education. He has completed the

the college. He also started, in supported learning, on a next steps
course for two years, progressed to a level 1 foundation course in IT,

cite the example of Shaun. Shaun first studied on an ACE course, which
is a transition programme, at college. He had very low self-confidence
and complained about being bullied. Although matters were resolved,
Shaun requested a move to another college. Shaun started off very
quietly at the new college, but gradually built up his confidence and
became more sociable and responsible through the year. After completing
his year on the ACE course, he was confident enough to join a
mainstream course. He then completed an entry award in motor vehicles,

show that a successful outcome is linked to an effective learning

again, it is a question of recognising that many young people with
special educational needs need help and support through to 25. If the
Government are genuine in their intention to create a comprehensive
nought-to-25 system, it must include arrangements to monitor the
outcomes for 19 to 25 year-olds. Indeed, the success or otherwise of

noble friend met some very severely disabled young people. I was

young people at Chailey are not of that sort at all: 

<?notus-xml column=12?>they are much more severely disabled. However, they do well at school,
within the limits of their disabilities; some have 15 or more
medications a day and none of them can walk or power their wheelchair

Despite their very complex needs, we have plans for four of our young
people to move into assisted living and we are seeking some sort of
employment for them, although we realise that it will be very limited.

the academic year in which they are 19. It is unclear why having regard

Reintegration into adult life was always the problem. The noble
Baroness is absolutely right that the potential to make a successful
transfer into adulthood must be the ultimate criterion. It is obviously
true that educational achievement and, indeed, age may be factors in
the judgment, but what about the ability to succeed? It is important
that that context should be established, because institutions must have

and modest amendment in the group, Amendment 172. It is based on the
fact that Clause 45 allows a local authority to cease an education,
health and care plan if the outcomes set within it have been achieved.
The amendment would require a local authority to continue the plan if
ongoing support were needed to maintain those outcomes, so it is pretty
similar to others. In effect, my amendment seeks to prevent the Bill
from giving local authorities a green light to end plans prematurely,
when children may still need specialist support. That issue greatly

recognise that sensory impairment in itself is not a learning
disability. There is no reason why most children with a sensory

support just as a child is starting to make progress. It would also
seemingly allow local authorities to remove that support, even if
ongoing support is needed to maintain and consolidate the progress that
the child has already made.</hs_para>

Touhig, said, these amendments do not seek a blank cheque for
continuing education for all young people to the age of 25 regardless
of the type and purpose of the course they are pursuing; rather, they
envisage local authorities supporting young people to achieve their

who become disabled for the first time as they approach adulthood,
which obviously delays their educational progress. Decisions about
whether to maintain a young person’s education, health and care
plan beyond the age of 19 should be based solely on the young
person’s progress in relation to their planned outcomes. Their
age up to 25 is not the most significant factor. Focusing
disproportionately on age will divert attention from supporting the
young person to achieve the agreed outcomes in their education, health
and care plan, which should be the prime consideration

Wilkins (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I support Amendment 172 tabled by
the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. I will not extend much further this
excellent debate. It is very important that the Bill and the
accompanying guidance is clear on the need to maintain specialist
support when this is needed. It should not simply be cut when a child
starts to do well. On this point, it seems that there is an inherent
tension in the draft code of practice that needs to be resolved. I
would be grateful if the Minister would look into
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:35:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000089">On
the one hand, the definition of special educational needs includes
children or young people who have a disability which prevents or
hinders them from making 
<?notus-xml column=18?>use of the educational facilities of a kind generally provided for
others of the same age. There are some groups of children, such as
those who are deaf, to which this particularly applies. The implication
is that these children have a special educational need by virtue of the
fact that they are in need of specialist support to enable them to
access those same educational
facilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:36:26"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, there are times in the code of practice, from the tone of what
is being said, when the reader can be forgiven for thinking that only
children who are not making progress should be regarded as having a
special educational need. For example, on page 75, it is suggested that
SEN specialists should be involved when it becomes apparent that the
child is making little or no
progress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:36:54"></hs_TimeCode>. Many
believe that this reflects a tension between the special educational
needs framework of supporting children who fall behind and the
disability equality framework of taking proactive steps to support
disabled
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:37:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

again at this to make sure that it is crystal clear that no local
authority should cut support for a child because they are making good
progress when it is only because they are receiving that support that
they are able to make that good progress? I would also welcome his
clarification for the record that children who need specialist support,
such as deaf children, should be regarded as having a special
educational need regardless of whether they are falling behind or
making good

Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to all who have spoken in
this important debate. I know that we all share the same concern to
ensure that young people who need educational provision up to the age
of 25 will receive it. I hope that I can offer some reassurance and
will be delighted to discuss the matter further with my noble friends
Lady Cumberlege and Lady Sharp, the noble Baronesses, Lady Howe and
Lady Howarth, and others if that is not the case. I will first respond
to those amendments regarding the genuine worry that the various
clauses which require local authorities to “have regard”
to a young person’s age when they are over 18 will give local
authorities the ability to refuse to assess a young person or to cease
their plan based solely on
age<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:38:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000092">From
the outset, I would like to state categorically that this concern is
unfounded. Local authorities cannot make decisions based on a young
person’s age alone. The legislation requires local authorities
to maintain EHC plans while it is necessary for special educational
provision to be made for the young person in accordance with a plan.
The draft code of practice makes this completely clear, stating in
Chapter 7 that local authorities must not make decisions based only on
the fact that a young person has turned
18<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:39:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110428000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000093">Let me be clearer
still: our vision is for a system that is ambitious for children and
young people with special educational needs. There is no hidden agenda
to cut costs or to reduce the number of families we want to help.
Instead, we want a system that raises the aspirations not only of
children, young people and their parents, but of those professionals
working with them, and that has high expectations about what children
and young people with SEN can achieve. Our ambition is 
<?notus-xml column=19?>that with the right support and opportunities, many more of these young
people will have completed their education and made a successful
transition to adulthood at the age of 18, along with their peers. Our
vision is that where young people need longer to complete or
consolidate their learning, they are able to remain in education and
continue to receive co-ordinated help and support through their EHC
plan—until the age of 25 if
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000094">What
we must not do is create an expectation in law that all young people
with SEN will simply stay in formal education until age 25. Creating an
automatic right for all young people with EHC plans to remain in
education for that long would dilute the focus on outcomes that we want
throughout the new system and particularly from year 9 onwards. Local
authorities could delay proper consideration of outcomes until after
age 18, by which time it is likely to be too late, and many young
people will simply drop out of the system at that point, as happens
now. Worse, it could create a cliff-edge at age 25, when support would
have to end for all those with EHC plans regardless of whether outcomes
had been met. Surely the focus must instead be on supporting them to
achieve outcomes and make a successful transition to adulthood,
wherever possible, along with their peers. We need to end the
presumption of failure attached to special educational needs and make
sure that local authorities are doing all that they can to help many
more children and young people with SEN achieve positive outcomes by
age
18.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000095">Turning to
the point made by my noble friend Lady Cumberlege about the word
“must”, we think that adding it to Clause 45 would serve
to create an expectation that all young people with EHC plans should
remain in education until after 25. On the question of why we refer to
18, and not 19, a young person aged over 18 has the legal
meaning of a person who is aged 19 to 25, and it
is our intention for the clause to apply to 19 to 25 year-olds. I hope
that that provides some
clarification<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:42:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:42:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000096">The
noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, asked why we use the phrase “have
regard to age” at all. Following pre-legislative scrutiny, the
Education Select Committee stated that there was confusion about
whether the Bill created an entitlement for young people with EHC plans
to remain in education until 25. It recommended that we make that clear
in the Bill. Including the phrase “have regard to age” is
our best solution to address that recommendation. It simply requires
local authorities to take a young person’s age into account as
part of a range of things that they must consider when making
decisions. All other suggestions that we have had err on the side of
creating a presumption that young people should remain in education
until  25 unless certain conditions are
met.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000097">Young
people with SEN over the age of 18 must be supported to remain in
formal education where this will enable them to complete or consolidate
their learning, achieve outcomes and make a successful transition to
adulthood. Local authorities must, in consultation with young people,
consider whether that has already been achieved by the time compulsory
participation ends at age 18 or whether the young 
<?notus-xml column=20?>person needs, and indeed wants, further support through an EHC plan.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:42:30"></hs_TimeCode> have made it
clear in the draft assessment and plan regulations and code of practice
that the EHC plan process should prepare and support young people for
adulthood, facilitating a successful handover to new opportunities and
support in the adult world. That transition planning must start from
year 9 of a child’s schooling and continue until they have left
formal education and made a successful transition to adulthood. This
includes enabling young people to access learning opportunities, such
as those offered by the Chailey Heritage Foundation, which prepare
young people to live more independently. Such opportunities are a vital
part of what is needed and I am grateful to my noble friend Lady
Cumberlege for enabling me to see at first hand, in an extremely
impressive and moving visit to Chailey, what a difference such
approaches can make to the lives of those with complex
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000098">Not
only do our reforms protect the current position for those aged 19 to
25, they go further by creating a legislative requirement for local
authorities to focus on outcomes and prepare young people for
adulthood. In addition, where young people disagree with decisions made
by local authorities, they now have—for the first
time—the right to appeal to the
tribunal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000099">It
is right that once these educational outcomes have been achieved, local
authorities should no longer be required to maintain EHC plans. Young
people with ongoing health and social care needs will continue to
receive those from the relevant services; that will not stop simply
because they no longer have an EHC plan. Young people who have made a
successful transition to adulthood and are now in employment, higher
education, adult learning and so on will continue to receive support in
those settings to enable them to maintain and build on the outcomes
achieved while in formal education. For example, Access to Work is
available for those in employment, Disabled Students’ Allowances
for those in higher education and so
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:46:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

ensures that where young people with an EHC plan are still in education
when they reach 25, their plan can continue until the end of that
academic year. Furthermore, where a young person’s programme of
study is not linked to a conventional academic year—in an
apprenticeship, for example—regulation 31 of the
draft assessment and plan regulations now allows local authorities to
continue support to the end of their programme of study or until the
day before their 26th birthday, if earlier. I hope this reassures noble
Lords that young people aged over 18 will continue to receive the
support they need to help them complete and consolidate their education
and make a successful transition to adulthood. The noble Baroness, Lady
Wilkins, raised a point about the code of practice and whether a child
will be supported if they make progress. It is intended to do that, but
we will look at it again and I will write to the noble Baroness with
more detail and
reassurance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000101">I
will now to speak to Amendments 205AA and 205AB regarding the
collection and publication of data relating to young people with
special educational 
<?notus-xml column=21?>needs. I would like to thank my noble friend Lady Sharp for tabling
these amendments and I support her commitment to ensuring that data
about special education provision is robust and used effectively. The
Skills Funding Agency and the Education Funding Agency already collect
and publish SEN data annually for students aged up to 25 in the further
education sector. The information is gathered through individual
learner record and expenditure reports; this will continue. In
addition, plans are in place to strengthen our understanding of where
children and young people with SEN go when they leave school and
college. Key stage 4 destination data were published earlier this year
and key stage 5 data are due early in the new year. Given that we
already have the flexibility to seek and publish data, the changes set
out in these amendments are not needed.</hs_para>

his wording to actually saying that we want a successful transition to

question of going through to 25, it is a question of when, between the
age of 18 and their 25th birthday, it is appropriate for them to move

duty on local authorities in Clause 73 to establish and maintain
registers of sight-impaired and severely sight-impaired adults

registers, which have been maintained for some 65 years now, play a
critical role in enabling local authorities to assess population level

receiving integrated support from an early stage, following

main purposes. First, they provide a local resource to support the
local authority and partner agencies with the strategic planning of
services. Secondly, they indicate a person’s eligibility for
certain benefits. As a matter of fact, under universal credit, children
who are registered blind will be entitled to receive the severe
disability addition in recognition of the household’s need for
greater support. Thirdly, in the case of children and young people, the
process of being registered with the local authority assists with early
referral to specialist services and support, including help from
voluntary
groups<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T16:58:02"></hs_TimeCode>. The
requirement to maintain a register for adults assists local authorities
in planning services and meeting individuals’ needs. If the same
duty is not placed on local authorities with regard to children, it
seems inevitable that the service planning and arrangements to meet the

provisions on the maintenance of a register of disabled children are
inadequate. The Children Act 1989 states that local authorities
“shall open and maintain” registers for “disabled
children”, but those 
<?notus-xml column=24?>general registers are scarcely used and do not meet sensory services
requirements. The certification and registration process in relation to
those with a visual handicap is unique in its potential to bring health
and social care together. The situation for children is even more
complicated, because social care and education both need to be
involved. For example, early access to mobility training arranged
through social care has a profound impact on blind and partially

blind and partially sighted children reach the age where they are
eligible for adult social care, it would greatly ease the process of
transition if they were already recorded and recognised by their local
authority as sight impaired. On a general population level, visual
impairment is a low-incidence disability. However, we now have a strong
body of evidence to suggest that in the youngest age cohorts, the
incidence of visual impairment is steadily increasing. The annual
incidence of new paediatric blind registration has increased: an
incidence of 0.17 per 10,000 in 1982 had doubled to 0.41 per 10,000 in
2011. The annual incidence of new paediatric partially-sighted
registration showed a comparable trend. Over 30 years, there has
therefore been a greater than twofold increase in blind and
partially-sighted registration of children in England. This underlines
the need for registers to assist with service planning.</hs_para>

rate is especially prominent in children with profound, multiple and
complex disabilities. Better awareness of this is needed to ensure that
adequate resources are available to help these children. Amending the
Bill to include a duty to establish and maintain sight-impaired
registers will help local authorities and schools to maintain an
accurate overview of what care services need to be developed alongside
education. This amendment would 
<?notus-xml column=25?>introduce a new clause after Clause 36, which would require local
authorities in England to establish and maintain a register of
sight-impaired and severely sight-impaired children and young people
ordinarily resident in their area. Local authorities have been required

matter has been raised during the Commons stages of the Bill and there
has been extensive discussion with Ministers and officials but the
department seems to have set its face against making this change. For
the life of me, I cannot think why, since all that is being asked is
that the current system for children should be maintained and put on
the same footing as that which operates for adults, with generally
beneficial consequences. Not to do so will simply amount to a
derogation from established practice, which has operated successfully

replicate Clause 76 in the Care Bill, which would establish registers

register in planning services. However, local authorities are already
under a duty to maintain a register of disabled children and young
people under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989: the noble Lord, Lord
Low, referred to the 1948 Act. This register includes blind children
and young people; changes proposed through the Care Bill will not
remove this duty. The RNIB, and the noble Lord, report that local
authorities sometimes neglect their duty to maintain such registers.
However, the same risk and difficulty would apply with the proposed new

that disparity between existing social care law and the Children and

Amendment 164. It places a duty on local authorities to provide the
social care services set out in an EHC plan. Amendment 164, which is
about making the provision, should be considered with
Amendment 143, which is about the assessment. In the Bill,
the education provision set out in an EHC plan must be secured by the
local authority. The Government’s amendment to the Bill in the
House of Commons places a duty on health bodies to arrange any health
provision in the plan; this leaves social care as the only part of a

164 would create parity across all the services in a single plan. I
believe that this has really been the Government’s intention all
along. We know that social care services do not always work as well as

enforceable part of education, health and care plans; secondly, whether
the Government accept the rationale for EHC plans, including the social
care services which a child or young person is entitled to receive

accept that there is already a duty to deliver social care services

so far because I do not consider myself to be an expert on education

the Care Bill being taken in the main Chamber along with this Bill in

the last amendment, my noble friend Lord Attlee said that there might
be some duplication. I should say that I would rather see duplication
than a hole. It is terribly important that this is taken into
consideration. Even for those most in need of special educational
support, there seems to come a time when education comes to an end.
However, care needs continue in terms of the social behaviour of the
person as much as anything else, and that can be quite a worry if
someone falls into bad company. It is important that their social

to push them on to the other one. If this provision reached over all of

their name, we need to decide how to put the final piece of this jigsaw
in place, which is the duty to provide the social care services that
are set out in the plans. This is critical to children and young people
with learning disabilities, a significant number of whom need care to
help them to achieve their educational and personal aspirations. Let us
imagine the position of a parent. They receive an education, health and
care plan for their child which sets out all the education, health and
social care provision that their child needs. Their child has a legal
right to receive the education and health components of the plan, and
the parent can hold those agencies to account if the services are not

nothing that they can do about it. We know that there can be problems
with the way in which social care is currently delivered.
Ofsted’s thematic inspection of social care for disabled

co-ordinated and that many social care plans were not detailed enough

know that unless there is help from specialists or social workers, if
you have a child with serious behavioural problems at home, they will
never get into ordinary school or even be able to survive properly in

amendments regarding the placing of a legal requirement on local
authorities to secure the social care provision specified in EHC plans.
I welcome the opportunity to debate this important issue and I
understand the desire to ensure that our most vulnerable 
<?notus-xml column=33?>children and young people receive the support that they and need are
able to seek redress where necessary. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Low,
my noble friends Lady Gardner and Lady Sharp and the noble Baronesses,
Lady Hollins, Lady Hughes and Lady Howarth, for speaking on this
matter. However, as my honourable friend the Minister for Children and
Families noted in the other place, there are already important
protections for children and young people aged under 18 in the existing
legislative framework for social care support. That is provided in
Section 17 of the Children Act 1989, and for disabled children under
Section 2 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. Both
these Acts will still apply alongside the measures being introduced in
the Bill.</hs_para>

I may also give him the opportunity to deal with a point? He seems to
be making a distinction between social care, special educational needs
and healthcare. He said that there is a general duty in the Chronically
Sick and Disabled Persons Act because social care needs, and therefore
duties, are essentially limitless. That is why local authorities must
be protected so that they can decide their priorities in the context of
their resources. However, surely the same argument could be made about
healthcare. Health needs and their care are essentially limitless, so
the health service 
<?notus-xml column=34?>has to decide on its priorities in relation to its resources. Yet here
the health service “must” provide the services set out in
the plan while the same does not apply to social care. I do not see the

Amendment 143, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Low, we are not convinced
that there should be a requirement that all services provided under
Section (2) of the 1970 Act must be included in EHC plans

young people with learning difficulties or a disability that gives rise
to special educational needs. Where this also gives rise to health and
care needs, that must be included in plans so that a co-ordinated
approach can be taken across services. Where there are unrelated health
or social care needs, it may or may not be appropriate to also include
them in an EHC plan, for example, depending on whether the child or
young person would benefit from a co-ordinated service response. I
believe that those decisions should be left to local professionals, in
full consultation with children, their parents and young
people.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110428000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000173">At
the same time, Amendment 144A would remove the important discretion the
Bill gives to the local authority to decide whether provision made
under Section 17 of the Children Act should be included in the plan,
where it is unrelated to the child or young person’s learning
difficulty or disability. This discretion is essential as there may be
circumstances where the children’s interests that we are trying
to meet require that we do not bind the hands of local services in this
respect—for example, where there is provision related to child
protection, which is highly sensitive and is not always appropriate to
include in an EHC plan. Whether or not social care provision is linked
to the learning difficulty or disability of the child or young person,
it will continue to be provided in accordance with existing

there is not a lot of point in specifying provision if 
<?notus-xml column=36?>there is no possibility of enforcing it. As I see it, my amendments were

simply contained provision for education but the department was
badgered about putting in an integrated approach, so it badgered the
Department of Health and, in due course, got it to cave in. A health
provision put in but, for some reason, we do not seem to have had the
social care provision inserted at the point of provision. That seems
extremely odd since, as has emerged in the debate, there are already
provisions in the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act for
ensuring the provision of social care services anyway. I am not quite
sure what the difficulty is in delivering social care, when there are
already those statutory obligations in that Act to lock this
legislation on to. It seems clear that there should be no difficulty in
bringing in the social care provision, using the Chronically Sick and
Disabled Persons Act as the vehicle.</hs_para>

limitless and that it is wrong to privilege some children over others
has been advanced by the Minister as a reason for not unifying the
legislation. However, it seems to me that that splits off the
enforceable obligations relating to social care at the wrong point. As
the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, if social care provision is
specified in the plan then it should be provided. Otherwise, what is
the point of the plan? If the authority thinks that it cannot provide
certain services or cannot make certain kinds of provision, it should
not put them into the plan. Providing for things to be specified in the
plan without providing the legislative framework for securing the
provision seems to be a mistake, and that view has prevailed throughout
the debate.</hs_para>

and families, such as short breaks or the provision of transport. He
said that the Government did not think it necessary to add anything

amendment to explore two specific concerns about this clause. The first
is about the support available to young people with special educational
needs aged between 19 and 25. Although educational psychologists
principally work with children and young people aged from nought to 19,
the profession is increasingly supporting young people over the age of
19 in a number of settings, including the further education sector.
Currently, educational psychologists across the country are playing an
important role in supporting these young people. However, under the
provisions of this clause, it is not clear what role educational
psychologists will continue to play in post-19 settings, and how this
will be promoted. The proposed age extension to 25 years has been
welcomed for the assessment process, but that will need careful
workforce development planning to ensure that young people aged 19 to
25 years are well supported by a sufficient number of educational
psychologists in future.</hs_parafo>

would certainly be helpful if the Minister, when he replies, could set
out clearly how he envisages the new proposals helping educational
psychologists to contribute to supporting young people. It would also
be useful if he could explain the impact of the changes on future
workforce development. The Government clearly need to ensure that
enough educational psychologists are being trained to meet future
demand. I would also like some clarification on the role of educational
psychologists in the assessment of children and young people who come
in from outside the system; that is, if they have moved to the UK from
abroad. Under the current proposals, it is unclear how these children
and young people will be supported. I hope that the Minister will be
able to provide us with adequate reassurance on this important
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110428000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110428000194">I turn

the Bill will retain the existing protections for parents, including an
explicit right for them and for the school to request education, health
and care plans. I know that during scrutiny of these clauses in the
other place, the Minister for Children confirmed that under the
proposals, there will be access for all children and families to
specialist services such as educational psychology on an equitable
basis. Currently, under statute, a reassessment of SEN follows
essentially the same process as the initial assessment. If a child or
young person’s needs change, a further assessment can be
requested and, if carried out, the local authority must comply with all
the statutory requirements, including meeting time limits and
consulting

under the Bill, a new concept of reassessment is now being introduced
which allows a local authority to determine the format of the
reassessment. Local authorities will no longer have the same duty to
consult and obtain evidence from designated professionals and can
choose to review only a specified aspect of the EHC plan. Although the
code of practice states that reassessment must follow the same process
as an initial assessment, I know that there are concerns that under the
Bill, there is no guarantee that EPs will be consulted when a
reassessment takes place. The fact that children and young people
undergo a reassessment because there is a significant change in their
needs makes it more important that educational psychologists are
involved, to ensure that the child’s voice is considered.
Educational psychologists will also work with parents and schools to
ensure that the right support is found for the
child.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_04_PT_1/CFB03C6617219C9E62C0051E5E7B50F300B2C72C" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 November 2013">Monday,

amendment has been drafted to seek confirmation from the Government
that a prescribed range of specialist professionals should contribute
to reassessment. This would ensure that future provision for children
and young people with SEN is informed by robust research evidence and
specialist knowledge offered by qualified professionals. Without such a
prescription there is a fear that local authorities, especially in the
current financial climate, will be tempted to use unqualified and/or
inexperienced staff to carry out reassessments. Although in the short
term this might save money, the implications of less rigorous
reassessment will lead to incorrect judgments and poorer outcomes for
children and young people, and may well result in greater financial
cost in the long term. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Minister

process in a little
detail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110434000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110434000002"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T17:04:19"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lingfield" PimsId="5882" UID="13110434000123" xid="2096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110434000123">Lord
Lingfield:</Member></B> My Lords, I have one amendment in this group,
which is to Clause 37(5). It is to provide a standard form of
education, health and care plan rather than use the more discretionary
wording of the Bill. At the moment—and this touches on the point
made by the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, concerning passports for special
educational needs—statements are in a standard form. If there is
no similar standard form for education, health and care plans they will
surely be subject to each local authority’s drafting
preferences. As a result, EHC plans may not be in a consistent format
and may vary widely in their level of detail. This could cause
confusion and difficulty for parents and young people, especially if
they move from one local authority to another. Relocation of this kind,
under current economic circumstances, is becoming extremely

This might be the child with disabilities of a showman who is based in

of the family where there are social care needs for someone under the

ensure that educational psychologists are involved in decisions about

quite a few detailed points, and I think that it would be better if my

EHC plans best to meet local needs. To ensure consistency, we have
included in section 7.9 of the draft code of practice a list of the key
information that every EHC plan must include in distinct sections,

amending and disclosing education, health and care plans. Equivalent
provisions currently exist in paragraphs 2A(5) and 7 of Schedule 27 to

Amendment 163A, I thank the noble Baronesses, Lady Jones and Lady
Hughes, for their amendment, which gives me the opportunity to explain
the health commissioning duty to the
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:30:32"></hs_TimeCode>. The
word “arrange” in Clause 42 reflects the commissioning
role of clinical commissioning groups and NHS England, which do not
provide services directly. The word “secure” is broader
and can also include the direct provision of services. However, I can
assure the Committee that the effect will be the same. CCGs and NHS
England, where appropriate, need to ensure that the healthcare
provision specified in the plan is made, just as local authorities do
for the special education provision specified in a
plan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:31:04"></hs_TimeCode>. Should a
health partner fail to arrange what had been agreed in the plan, the
family or young person could reasonably complain to their local
clinical commissioning group. Clause 26 requires the establishment of a
dispute resolution procedure between partners that could be used, which
also must be
effective.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110434000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110434000023">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:31:27"></hs_TimeCode>

I would like to reassure her that I understand and approve of her
desire to ensure that reassessments of education, health and care plans
are carried out with as much attention  to detail and care as
the initial
assessment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:31:47"></hs_TimeCode>. That

clarify why we do not believe it necessary for educational
psychologists to be involved in every review meeting. The draft
regulations require that the school or other institution attended by
the child or young person and local authority education service are
invited to the review meeting, which must be held at least annually,
and that a report must be prepared which may include advice from an
educational psychologist where necessary. We do not think it is
proportionate to require that an educational psychologist is involved
in every review. This will depend on the progress being made by the
child or young person and be informed by the views of the parent, young
person and school or other institution
involved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:33:32"></hs_TimeCode>.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:33:29"></hs_TimeCode> is also
important to note that local authorities provide educational psychology
services to all state-funded schools as a matter of routine, which
enables ongoing concerns about pupils with plans to be raised outside
the annual review schedule as
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110434000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0001.htm#13110434000025">I

review and reassess EHCs required by Clause
44<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:34:19"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government believe that the best approach is to be less prescriptive in
primary legislation than currently in order to allow learning from the
pathfinders and to allow time for us to understand where local
flexibility will have a positive effect on the system before finalising
the detail of the regulations. This will also keep relevant legislation
together in one place in the regulations.</hs_para>

which the Government envisage this power being applied are to replicate
current legislation both in relation to time and where the local

includes specifically where a reassessment has taken place in the past
six months. The circumstances are set out in draft assessment and plan
Regulation 24. We do not wish to specify particular circumstances in

finally to Amendment 175A, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Touhig, for drawing attention to the importance of EHC plans
transferring smoothly when a child or young person moves areas. It is
vital that children and young people’s needs continue to be met.
As the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, observes, we have set out in draft
assessment and plan Regulation 15 the process for
transferring EHC plans, which is based on the current process for
statements. To ensure continuity, it requires that the old local
authority must transfer a plan to the new authority within 15 days of
becoming aware of the move. The new authority is then legally
responsible for maintaining the
plan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:36:21"></hs_TimeCode>. Following
the transfer, the new authority must decide within six weeks
whether to undertake a new assessment or merely to review the EHC plan,
depending on the needs of the child or young person, and inform the
child’s parent or the young person of that decision.</hs_para>

regard to the review, I agree that there must be a focus on outcomes.
Draft assessment and plan Regulation 19 requires reviews to take
account of the child or young person’s progress towards
achieving  the outcomes specified in the plan, which will apply
equally to reviews following a transfer.</hs_para>

Touhig, mentioned the position of servicemen when they move. I
absolutely agree with him about the issues that face service families,
which is why we have included a specific section in the code giving
guidance and support for the children of service families, including
when they move area. When families move, the new authority must
maintain the plan until there has been a reassessment. The new
authority should use existing assessment information where still
relevant as set out in Chapter 7 of the draft code. We are content to
come back and check that this is covered adequately in the regulations
and code. Finally, the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, asked about
coverage for Traveller children. Broadly, children will be included as
part of the regulations on transfers of plans and we 
<?notus-xml column=46?>will write to the noble Baroness with further
details<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:38:19"></hs_TimeCode>. I

157 and 159, which relate to Clauses 39 and 40, arrive from
the duty to admit created by Clause 43. This duty has aroused
considerable concern in many specialist independent schools that are
organised 
<?notus-xml column=48?>to cater wholly or mainly for pupils with SEN. Under these amendments,
admission would take place with their consent, which would provide such
independent schools with the assurance that they would like

of admission.</hs_para>

amendments, I have been told clearly that a number of ISC schools are
likely to decide not to apply to become approved under
Clause 41. Their decision would be taken with considerable
reluctance because, if that happens, it could lead to the loss of
excellent specialist provision for local authorities and, as a result,
the loss of very valuable teaching and care for children with
particular needs, which in some specialist cases would not be readily
available at the required level elsewhere. So a difficulty exists here,

perhaps worth noting that independent schools often have pupils from
many local authorities. The ISC specialist schools tell me that they
can have statemented pupils from up to  25 local authorities at
any one time. Ceding too much control over admissions to local
authorities could thus have a much greater impact on specialist
independent schools than on those in the maintained sector, 
which normally deal with just one local authority. Amendments 157 and
159, which provide that local authorities should secure the consent of
independent specialist schools before they are named, will address
these concerns in full. I beg to move.</hs_para>

drafted, the clause sets out that if the school requested is unsuitable
for the child, or incompatible with either the provision of efficient
education for others or the efficient use of resources, the local
authority will ensure that the plan names a school or specifies the
type of institution which could be appropriate. This amendment would
ensure that parents agreed with the school chosen by the local
authority when their first choice did not work out, before the local
authority is able to name the second choice school in the EHC plan.

is, shamefully, already the case that some schools unfairly reject

“We welcome children with disabilities and special educational
needs”. The next sentence started, “However”. That
is, I fear, too often the case. Concerns have already been expressed
about this issue by other noble Lords—notably, at Second
Reading, by the noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson. This amendment
would ensure that, where parents try to name a school and a local
authority relies on an exception under 
<?notus-xml column=49?>subsection (4) in order to refuse to name that school and then puts
forward another school, the second choice school can only be named on a

161. Clause 41 enables the Secretary of State to approve certain
institutions,  such as independent schools, for the purpose of
enabling the institution to be the subject of a request to be named in

Perry of Southwark (Con):</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, I very much
support the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Lexden. I
recently spent a day at Gretton School in Cambridge: an independent
school entirely for children across the whole range of autism. Some of
the most severely autistic young people are in classes of four and
five. At the end of my visit, I took my hat off to the patience and
skill of the school’s teachers. As I said, it is an independent
school; it also offers boarding. It takes children from a wide range of
local authorities from the eastern and East Anglia regions. Most of
them come with statements from their local authorities and are
supported by them, but many parents have to pay additional fees for
boarding. Gretton School and others such as those my noble friend
described have an important part to play in the range of offerings for
disabled children. It is important that they are named in the Bill, as
otherwise local authorities may simply assume that they cannot be
included in EHC statements. I very much hope that the Minister will
look sympathetically at these
arguments.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_04_PT_1/AF38BC485FBD172134AA5AFAB83207AC6BD95104" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 November 2013">Monday,

something. It has been a tradition that the independent sector has

Nash:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, this group of amendments concerns
independent specialist provision. I thank  all noble Lords who
have spoken in this debate. I particularly thank my noble friend Lord
Lexden for his Amendments 153, 157 and 159, which seek to ensure that
independent schools, including those specially organised to cater for
children with special educational needs, continue to play an important

request that a maintained school is named in a statement of special
educational needs. The local authority is then under a qualified duty
to name that school and, if so named, the school has to admit the
child. The Bill extends to young people the right to ask for a
particular institution to be named in an EHC plan and the coverage is
extended to a wider range of institutions. Parents or young people will
also be able to ask for an academy, including a free school, a further
education or sixth-form college, a non-maintained special school or an
independent institution approved under Clause 41 to be named in an EHC
plan. The local authority will then be under the same qualified duty to
name the institution and the institution will be under the same duty to
admit the child or young person. For this change to be of real benefit
to parents and young people, it is important that, when a parent or
young person requests one of these institutions, the local authority is
under a qualified duty to name that institution in the EHC plan and
that the institution is under a duty to admit the child or young
person.</hs_para>

153, I understand my noble friend’s desire to ensure that
parents and young people can ask for any independent school to be named
on  an EHC plan and not just those on the list under Clause 41.
I reassure my noble friend that parents and young people will be able
to make representations for any independent school, and the local
authority must consider their request. In doing so, it must have regard
to the general principle in Section 9 of the Education Act 1996 that
children should be educated in accordance with their parents’
wishes, so long as this is compatible with the provision of efficient
instruction and training and does not mean unreasonable public
expenditure. Paragraph 7.11 on page 111 of the draft SEN code of
practice makes this clear.
Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:57:31"></hs_TimeCode> course, the
local authority would not be under the same conditional duty to name
the school in the EHC plan as it would in the case of an institution
approved under Clause 41, and the school would not be under a duty to
admit the child or young person.</hs_para>

friend’s amendment would place local authorities under a duty to
name an independent school in an EHC plan with no guarantee that the
independent school would admit the child or young person, leaving the
local authority unable to fulfil its 
<?notus-xml column=51?>statutory duty to secure the special educational provision in the plan.
As we have heard many times from noble Lords in this debate, it is
important that children, parents and young people are clear about what
they are entitled to. This is key to their confidence in the new
system.</hs_para>

157 and 159, I reassure my noble friend that Clauses 39 and 40 require
the local authority to consult the institution which might be named in
an EHC plan, including an independent special school or independent
specialist provider approved under Clause 41. This will allow
meaningful discussions, especially if a school or college feels that it
cannot make appropriate provision to meet the pupil’s needs.
After this consultation, the authority will name the institution that
it feels is appropriate. If it is decided that an institution approved
under Section 41 is appropriate and that institution is named in the
EHC plan, the institution is under a duty to admit the child or young
person. It is important to remember that only those institutions that
have chosen to apply to be approved under Clause 41 and are
subsequently approved will be under such a
duty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110434000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0002.htm#13110434000052">Amendment
158, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady Jones, and
the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, seeks to protect the right of children,
young people and their parents to choose the school or institution
named in their EHC plan. I agree with the intention behind the
amendment—the importance of a person-centred system is at the
heart of our reforms. The Bill places specific duties on local
authorities to consult a child’s parents or a young person while
drawing up an EHC plan. Clause 38 requires the local authority to send
the draft plan to the parents or young person and to make clear their
right to make representations about its contents, including the right
to request a particular school or institution. In the event that a
parent or young person is not satisfied with the school or institution
named in their EHC plan, they have recourse to mediation and an
independent tribunal.</hs_para>

makes the local authority statutorily responsible for producing and
delivering EHC plans and for securing the special educational provision
specified in them. Although I agree that the child, their parents or
the young person should be at the centre of all decision making, the
noble Baroness’s amendment could make it impossible for the
local authority to fulfil its statutory obligations if a parent or
young person refused to accept the school or institution named in the
plan. As noble Lords will have heard me say before, the focus of our
reforms is that decisions should be made collaboratively, but the
ultimate responsibility for securing support is with the local
authority.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110434000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0002.htm#13110434000054">I
turn now to Amendment 161 and the questions raised by the noble Lord,
Lord Touhig. Clause 41 and the regulations made under it allow the
Secretary of State to approve independent special schools and
independent specialist colleges to be included in a published list.
This clause is not an approval process for the institution per se. The
majority of institutions 
<?notus-xml column=52?>which are approved under Clause 41 will already exist. An institution
which is removed from the list will not be closed
down or have funding withdrawn. Children and young
people may still attend the institution and may ask to have it named in
an EHC plan. However, the local authority will not be under a
conditional duty to name the institution; it will have to agree to do
so. It will also need to seek the institution’s consent, since
it would not be under a statutory duty to admit the child or young
person. Since this is a limited, enabling clause which does not affect
the operation of an institution, we do not believe it is proportionate
or necessary to set out a process for appeals. I hope this reassures
the noble Lord. The list will be kept up to date so that parents and
young people can make informed decisions about the range of specialist
provision available to them. It does not seem appropriate for this to
be prescribed by regulation.</hs_para>

Lexden referred to a letter I recently sent to the Independent Schools
Council in which I said that draft regulations made under
Clause 30 will ensure that a link to the list of approved providers is

assessment and plan regulations requires local authorities, when they
send a parent or young person a draft EHC plan, to advise them where
they can find information about the schools and colleges that are
available for the child or young person to attend. This would include
institutions on the list produced as a result of Clause 41 and other
independent schools catering for children with SEN.</hs_para>

Amendments 177 and 179 in my name. In Clause 49, we move to the issue
of personal budgets and direct payments. The purpose of these
amendments is to probe issues concerning direct payments and 
<?notus-xml column=54?>personal budgets. The Bill provides an entitlement  for schools
or colleges to make representations to  the local authority
when it is considering making a direct payment to a child or a parent.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:08:53"></hs_TimeCode> amendment
provides an alarm for local authorities to be able to exercise a
judgment about whether to make an individual
payment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:08:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110434000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0002.htm#13110434000059">Clause
49 gives the parent a statutory right to require the local authority to
prepare a personal budget and to meet direct payments, even in
circumstances where the school or college does not think that this
would be sensible or justified in terms of efficiency or economy. This
is not to disparage the vital contribution that parents make, but to
suggest that there will be occasions when their wishes would not
necessarily be in the best interests of their children or reasonable in
the context of an efficient and cost-effective
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110434000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0002.htm#13110434000060">The
case has not been made in the pathfinders  that the
introduction of direct payments to parents will help children with
special educational needs. The evaluation of the pathfinders shows that
the demand for direct SEN payments to parents has been extremely low.
The evaluation states that many commentators are apprehensive about the
extent to which this testing should be rolled out to a wider
population. Of the  290 direct payments across the 14 case
study sites in the pathfinders, 270 out of 290 dealt only with school
personal transport. That means that there has been no investigation of
the feasibility or desirability of making direct payments to parents
for educational elements of the provision, such as the deployment of a
special teaching
assistant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110434000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0002.htm#13110434000061">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:11:17"></hs_TimeCode>
pathfinder information pack acknowledges that personal budgets are more
established in social care and health settings than in educational
settings. The pathfinders themselves found that schools, colleges and
parents were often confused about which elements of funding, in an
educational context, could be used as a personal budget to give
families more choice and control. The reasons cited for poor take-up
are the challenges and complexities in the direct payments offer.
Personal transport budgets were in fact by far the easiest to
disaggregate.

remaining concern for teachers is that the fragmentation of budgets
will have a detrimental effect on the viability and quality of services
which pupils need to access, and will lead to a lottery of appropriate
SEN provision. Teachers are also concerned about the loss of the
quality assurance role carried out by local authorities and do not
believe that giving individual packets of money to individual parents
is the most cost-effective way to deliver the provision to meet
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:12:03"></hs_TimeCode>. The case
for direct payments, they feel, has not been proven by the
pathfinders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110434000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0002.htm#13110434000063">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:13:59"></hs_TimeCode>
warning in the evaluation report that there are reservations about the
extent to which testing can be rolled out to a wider population needs
to be carefully heeded. Teachers continue to have significant concerns.
In a recent survey, 65% of SENCOs—the special educational needs
co-ordinators in schools—were concerned about allowing parents
to control funding for SEN provision. That is not because teachers fail
to 
<?notus-xml column=55?>recognise the essential role of parents, or their unparalleled knowledge
of their child’s individual needs and aptitudes; it is because
teachers also recognise that teachers, schools and parents must work as
equal partners, with the professional judgments and expertise of
teachers respected and valued alongside the contribution from
families<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:13:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110434000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0002.htm#13110434000064">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:13:05"></hs_TimeCode>
pathfinders have not, it seems, proven that to be an option that
parents are demanding or which teachers have confidence can work, or
will benefit the children with special educational needs whom they
teach. Demand for direct SEN payments has been low, and many
children’s charities believe that the introduction of individual
payments will further accelerate the disintegration of specialist
services, such as the support services for deaf children, which the
Council for Disabled Children is campaigning to save in different local
authorities. The case that direct payments will support the SEN reforms
in a meaningful way has not yet been proven. I beg to
move.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_04_PT_1/8545B9EE710ED05FF12AE9590F710D4BBD7AECDE" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 November 2013">Monday,

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, we have Amendments
180, 271 and 273 in this group, which I shall address. We have touched
on personal budgets in a previous debate. At that time, the noble
Baroness, Lady Howarth, spoke movingly about some of the problems
experienced by those in adult social care in managing employment
challenges when they had to employ staff and the financial complexities
of the budgets that they were expected to manage. We understand the
concerns that have been expressed and share a number of those that were
raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. We have taken a slightly
different approach to the issue. In principle, we support the concept
of personal budgets and direct payments, which give parents more
flexibility and say over the support that their children get. It is a
principle that we have supported for other forms of care in the
past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110434000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104-gc0002.htm#13110434000066">This is
a new area of social policy. We feel strongly that these reforms are
based on evidence and are not rushed through. As we know, the
pathfinder pilots have been extended and now will not finish before the
autumn of 2014. We very much appreciated the chance to meet with some
of the pathfinder champions a couple of weeks ago when there were some
very good examples of the improved quality of life that personal
budgets could bring, as well as some of the difficulties and challenges
that they presented.</hs_para>

rollout of personal budgets is the least well researched and analysed,
not only the impact on the individuals concerned but also on the
institutions from which the services will be procured. Our Amendment
180 would build in essential time to reflect and learn from the pilots
by requiring regulations to be made by affirmative resolution and a
report to be published after the pathfinders have concluded, setting
out the evidence and guaranteeing proper scrutiny by
Parliament.</hs_para>

though we are legislating on this issue prematurely. Given that we are
considering the Bill now, it is not clear how the Government plan to
take account of the findings of the pathfinders. There are many things
on which we remain unclear—for 
<?notus-xml column=56?>example, how devolving budgets will work on a practical level; how they
will impact on the quality of provision and on costs; and how we can
ensure that providers are reliable and accountable. It is also unclear
how institutions with devolved budgets—for example,
academies—can be required to make a contribution to personal
budgets from their own funds. These are some of the issues that we feel
need to be debated

in relation to the arrangements to assist young people and parents
managing a personal budget, should they choose one. I therefore wish to
support the noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady Jones, on Amendment
180. It is clear that some families find that personal budgets bring
them freedom, and freedom of choice, but only if they have help in
understanding how to manage that budget. I agree with the noble
Baronesses that this is little researched, yet we have more information
from the adult services which could be looked at. Some of the problems
for these young people and for the families of these children

anxieties about this moving forward quickly, and not only on behalf of
the parents and young people. If it is not thought through, in terms of
funding, there is a grave danger that educational institutions that
depend on payments could find themselves unable to plan; if families
have personal budgets with which to pay for the educational element, it
could cause serious difficulties. I therefore support the amendment,
which moves forward on personal budgets to give families
freedom—where there is proper research—but takes it
steady so that we do not cause even more difficulties than we already
have in the adult

that there is more to learn. That is why, as the noble Baroness, Lady

the report has yet to be finalised, but it will involve in-depth work
with a small cohort of pathfinders and include further research on how
direct payments for special educational provision have operated. In
addition to the thematic research, I should stress that this is not the
only source of evidence to support this policy. A quick comparison of
the indicative code, published to aid consideration of this Bill in the
other 
<?notus-xml column=58?>place, against the consultation draft, shows how far our knowledge and
understanding have developed this year. This knowledge
continues to grow. Pathfinders are increasingly
offering personal budgets to all new EHC plan-holders with a resultant
increase in numbers. We have also recently supported the development
and publication of an implementation framework, for personal budgets

bad bank to separate and wind down RBS’s poorly-performing and
high-risk assets that are a legacy of what went wrong in its past. This
will enable RBS to look to the future and deliver its new strategy.
Instead of an ‘external’ bad bank that would
require further support from the taxpayer, this will be an
‘internal’ bad bank funded by RBS itself. This will
target the wind-down or sale of approximately £38 billion of
assets within three years.</hs_WAIndent> <hs_WAIndent>ii)

should over time address many of the bank’s challenges and areas

the outcome of a consultation on subject content for new GCSEs in
English literature, English language and mathematics, which will be

mathematics because they are both fundamental to facilitating learning
in other subjects, and yet PISA evidence demonstrates that 15 year olds
in nine other countries are, on average, at least half a year ahead of
students in England in both reading and mathematics. Reform of these
key subjects is, therefore, a matter of pressing urgency.</hs_para>

mathematics that is required for further education and future careers.

new mathematics GCSE will be more demanding and we anticipate that
schools will want to increase the time spent teaching mathematics. On
average secondary schools in England spend only 116 hours per year
teaching mathematics, which international studies show is far less time
than that spent on this vital subject by our competitors. Just one
extra lesson each week would put England closer to countries like
Australia or Singapore who teach 143 and 138 hours a year of
mathematics respectively. We announced on 14 October that
mathematics, alongside English, will be double weighted in secondary
school performance measures from 2016. This will also provide a strong

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord Nash)
(Con):</Member> The Department for Education collects
pupils’ home postcodes as part of the School Census. This
identifies the percentage of pupils attending a school outside their
home local authority area (in 2013 this was 3.6% of all primary school
pupils and 8.6% of all secondary school pupils) and the distance
travelled from home to school, but does not allow for an assessment of
school selection or parental preference. The Department currently only
collects the latter at local authority level in relation to secondary
schools, but from April 2014, the Department will for the first time
also collect pupil level parental preference data, for both primary and
secondary schools.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311043000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131104w0001.htm#1311043000126">Home to
school distance is one of a number of options that local authorities
and schools may choose for prioritising the admission of children when
a school is oversubscribed. Academies and Free Schools also have the
freedom to prioritise children attracting the pupil premium in their
admissions arrangements. Adopting this admissions priority encourages
the parents of disadvantaged children to express a preference for
schools that they might not otherwise have
considered.</hs_para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2013-11-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_04_PT_1/Index/B8D5362C98ECC8A79B4BBE3772D9ADA33317DE12" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="11" cday="Monday" cmonth="November" cyear="2013" date="4" day="Monday" issue="64" maxparts="1" month="November" part="1" price="" printing="daily" session="201314" volume="748" year="2013"><tocdate col="WS1">Monday 4 November 2013</tocdate><title>ALPHABETICAL
