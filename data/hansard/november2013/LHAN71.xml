these Benches with the condolences expressed by the Minister and,

refused on three successive occasions over the past few months to give
an undertaking that the decline in the size of the Regular Army will
not proceed until the increase in 
<?notus-xml column=722?>the trained Army Reserve is secured. Now we have
figures—incomplete figures—about how this is going, but
it does not seem to be going well. The data should be available and
open. This should not be a clandestine experiment. Will the Minister
commit to publishing all the figures? Does he share my concern that the
Government are not meeting their targets and that the untrained
strength of the reserves has gone down year on year? This does not bode

we are changing the way that we recruit for both regulars and reserves,

to furnish the highest readiness front-line defence and reaction

can and do provide vital capability, such as medical and intelligence.
They will continue their contribution in these fields, but we also

certificates are ministerial instruments used in legal proceedings

noble and learned Lord’s Answer relevant virtually only to the
case of Asil Nadir? Is it not ridiculous, and a mockery of British
justice, that Asil Nadir came back to this country with all the
evidence to clear his name, and that the Serious Fraud Office sought to
hide behind more than 35 public interest immunity certificates? The SFO
used the international status of the Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus to avoid going there to examine the books although,
20 years previously, it had already been told by the

this not a contradiction of British

determination with which the noble Lord has pursued these matters. As I

before coming into your Lordships’ House, I inquired about the
status of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. It is my
understanding that these issues were raised during the trial of Asil
Nadir and that Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials were examined
on the matter. As a matter of general law, the use of a PII to prevent
disclosure of sensitive material does not render any trial unfair.
Whether materials are or are not disclosed is not a decision for
Ministers or for the prosecution; it is the decision of the trial
judge. The trial judge will not allow a PII claim to stand if to do so
would render the trial of the defendant

for his reply. Good social housing requires stable communities where
neighbours look out for each other. That is one of the differences
between social housing and the scattered private rented sector. How
will half a million disabled families cope without their
neighbours’ support because they are forced to move by the
bedroom tax? How will frail elderly relatives cope when their
middle-aged children who care for them have to move away because of the
bedroom tax? Ministers quote the changes to the private rented sector
in 2008 but those changes were not retrospective, whereas these are,
and that is what is so wrong. Will the Minister undertake to ensure, as
a transitional arrangement, that the bedroom tax applies only to new
lettings and will he lift the bedroom tax for existing tenants and help
us to maintain stable communities on which our civic life is

Whichever parties are in government in 2015, they will have to tackle
long-term unemployment. We have tried to tackle this problem over the

share the concern. If we cannot share the concern, is it not time to
put our differences aside and to work together to resolve this

the previous Government were extraordinarily expensive. The Future Jobs
Fund was introduced by the previous Government. At the time, I was in
the department as an independent adviser, and that shocked me somewhat.
It cost £6,500 for each job and half the people were back on
benefits at the end. That is more or less the same performance as the
work experience programme, which costs only 1/20th.</hs_para>

agree that the figures about which my noble friend is so concerned are
a real concern and have been for a long time. I look at the figures for
the unemployed and inactive youth. In 1997, it was 1.1 million

risen to 1.4 million. Under this Government, in the worst recession

amendment is unusual for a first amendment on a Bill because it deals
with a specific point rather than a general one that might lead to some
general discussions, but there are amendments that are coming up fairly
quickly where those general discussions can take place on the

proposal to abolish ASBOs and introduce injunctions for the prevention
of nuisance and annoyance. The proposal is that injunctions of this
nature can be taken out against people from the age of 10 upwards.
There was some discussion at Second Reading, which I read with great
interest, about whether the age of 10 was appropriate or whether it was
too low. The amendment provides an opportunity for some probing and

points out that the breach rate for teenagers has been over 60%, and I
believe that it is now around 68%. Clearly this policy is working
neither for the young people involved nor for the local communities. If
people go back and breach their ASBOs, the anti-social

actions and interventions, working with the parents and attempting to
get successful acceptable behaviour contracts. These
work much better than ASBOs do at the moment, when you get
to ASBOs. In too many places ASBOs have been taken as a quick means of
dealing with problems. The direction of thinking and government policy
is to be applauded. Later on, there are amendments down about

amendment puts forward a compromise suggestion. It takes the view that

The age of 12 means that by the time they have got to secondary school

used. Below that, while they are still at primary school, they are
possibly not appropriate. This is clearly a judgment, but I put this
amendment forward as a means of probing what the Government intend for
these very young children and presenting the opportunity for debate in

This is on the place of guidance, as used by all those who will be

has a significant place in the way any measure is applied. However,
guidance is only guidance. If an issue is really important, it should
not be left to guidance and therefore, while it may or may not happen,
it should be a matter for the legislation itself. I am glad that my

Earl of Listowel (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I speak as vice-chair of
the All-Party Parliamentary Group on children and young people in care
and leaving care. Half of young people in custody have experience of
care: they have been fostered or have been in residential care. Many of
those unfortunate young people, who are in that position principally
because they have been abused by their families, are also likely to get
tangled up in the law and in the situations with which we are concerned

questions to the Minister. First, there has been concern in the past
that the assumption relating to media reporting when dealing with
children is reversed in these circumstances. One of the tabloid
newspapers published a string of photographs of children and their
addresses some time ago. This was a few years ago and perhaps things
have moved on, but I would be grateful to the Minister if he could
write to me on where things stand with regard to publicising the names
and photographs of such
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T15:20:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311187000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#1311187000072">My
second question relates to youth services. We all know that the devil
makes work for idle hands. With the cuts that have come about, youth
services have taken a very heavy blow. Research has shown
that where there have been summer activities for young people, the
crime rate among young people reduces. We need to think about the
positive things that we can do as well as the negative
things—the stick and the carrot, if you like—when we
discuss this issue. What guidance and advice on protecting youth
services are being offered by central government to local authorities
at this difficult time? In particular, what advice is being offered to
the new PCCs, which have a lot of resources and which could perhaps
funnel some of them towards supporting youth services? I was very
gratified to hear recently how much support the Government are giving
to mentoring young people in the criminal justice system and
in schools<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T15:21:39"></hs_TimeCode>. That

sorry to speak for so long but I should like to make just one point.
Many of these young men—boys, I should say—grow up
without a father in the home. We know that two-thirds of black boys in
the United States grow up without a father in the home. According 
<?notus-xml column=734?>to the OECD, the level of lone parents in this country is even higher
than that, so many boys here are growing up without fathers in the
home. The risk is, and my experience shows this time and again, that
such young men feel a sense of guilt. They are not rational in trying
to understand why their fathers are not interested in their lives. They
think that it is something that they did that caused it. I can think of
an occasion when I was with a group of looked-after children in
Parliament. Somebody popped their head in to ask a question, suggesting
that somebody might have done something wrong, and there was an
immediate look of guilt among them—“What have we done
wrong? What are we to blame?”. You hear from adults who have had
such an experience that they are ridden with guilt and feel negative
about their lives, even about the good things in it. The risk is that,
by having a low age of criminal responsibility or by introducing these
measures for people of such a young age, the state is coming along and
saying, “Yes, there isn’t anything good in you. We will
put your photograph in the local newspaper. You will be described as a
bad person”. In that, we are reinforcing what their parents have
told them and what their experience has
been<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T15:23:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311187000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#1311187000074">I
remember as a border at school becoming particularly attached to my
housemaster, who was with me for several years. When he moved on to be
the headmaster of a new school, for several weeks I would ask myself
before going to bed at night, quite unreasonably, what I had done to
him that was driving him away. I felt guilt for driving him away. I
cannot stress enough that my experience points to such a sense of guilt
in these young people. Yes, they must be made to feel responsible; no,
they should not be allowed just to be called victims. There are
sanctions available but I worry that there may be a perverse outcome if
we keep the age as currently proposed in the Bill. I look forward to

Responsibility Bill, introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. I
commend some of the things that were said then about the ability of
children of the age of 10 to comprehend fully all the businesses of the
criminal justice system when they were motivated against them. During
the debate I cited the fact that the well known 10 year-olds Thompson

four.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311187000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#1311187000076">You
cannot expect a child with the developmental age of four to be able to

an anti-social behaviour order, which does. I am glad that the noble
Lord, Lord Greaves, introduced age very early in this Bill, because all

sure that it is

Therefore, while I am glad that the intention is not that the
injunction should carry a criminal record, we ought to take seriously
the question of whether 10 is an appropriate age to start
whatever process we have, because within society there should be other
ways of doing it. I know that these are not very satisfactory at

the Department for Education is not actually the key organisation in

Then we find that the Department for Work and Pensions has a role to
play in all this, as, of course, does the Department for Communities
and Local Government. Therefore all sorts of initiatives are going on,
all aiming at the same thing, which lack co-ordination. I feel that
there ought to be a Minister of child development in the Cabinet

my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham on an issue which I raised at Second
Reading: the position of the court granting an order. I raised the

rules to be made requiring the court to make sure that the individual

consequences if the injunction was to be breached.</hs_para>

saying that nothing in the Bill requires rules to be made to deal with
that matter, but will the Minister tell us whether the guidance deals
with the position of the child in court? Obviously, the guidance deals
with the steps preliminary to taking this action against the
individual. However, if the age of 10 is to be adhered to, it is
extremely important—for all the reasons that the noble Lord has

Harris of Haringey (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, is not part of the
problem that the Government are trying to sweep away a whole range of
different responses to 
<?notus-xml column=736?>anti-social behaviour and replace them with what is essentially a single
measure, at least as far as the individual is concerned, and that
therefore there is no gradation? There is no way to modulate what is
done or provide a specific response to individual circumstances. That
seems to be what is causing this problem. If there were some gradation,
there might well be measures that it would be appropriate to take
against children of the age of 10 or 11, who have an understanding of
when they are behaving outside societal norms. However, there would not
be the same level of sanction implicit in breaching an
injunction.</hs_para>

with all of the amendments which your Lordships will be considering

deal with a multiplicity of problems. That is why trying to find the

one difficulty. Because the Government have decided simply to do away
with all the existing arrangements and replace them with one simple
measure, we will face that difficulty.</hs_para>

saying that the late scheduling of today’s Committee sitting is
rather unfortunate. There will be noble Lords who would have wished to
table amendments to today’s debate but who, given that the
sitting was scheduled only on the last sitting day before Recess last
week, may not have had the opportunity to do so. The noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, made the point that we now have a clash with the Children
and Families Bill, which is also in Committee as we speak. I suspect
that, given the nature of the subject before us today, many noble Lords
who are in that Committee would also wish to contribute here. My final
plea is that this time yesterday I was in Argentina, and I arrived in
the UK only a few hours ago. I promise not to do my Eva Peron
impression on this issue—although perhaps in passion if not in
length. The scheduling is unfortunate, and I hope that the Minister
will take that message back. I would not want noble Lords who have a
contribution to make to this debate to be unable to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311187000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#1311187000087">The noble
Lord, Lord Greaves, has done us a service with his amendment, and I am
also eager to probe the Government’s thinking on this issue as
well. I am certainly not against children and young people being held
responsible for their actions; we defined that principle in anti-social
behaviour orders. We have had some debate today about the criminal age
of responsibility for young people, but the amendment and the Bill are
not really about that. They are about whether a young person aged 10 is
likely, on the balance of probabilities, to cause annoyance or nuisance
to anyone. I am not a parent, but my experience of 10 and 11 year-old
children is that they inevitably cause nuisance and annoyance to
somebody at some point. I do not know whether the Bill is an
appropriate vehicle to make that kind of behaviour subject, on the
balance of probabilities, to such an injunction. I find that 
<?notus-xml column=737?>somewhat strange and I would like the Minister to develop his thinking
and explain why the Government think that it is
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311187000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#1311187000088">I
can think of numerous examples where 10 and 11 year-olds
would cause nuisance and annoyance: persistently kicking a ball at a
fence, breaking that fence or causing disruption in the neighbourhood.

Government are trying to squeeze a range of interventions into one
which, inevitably, will not be appropriate in every case.</hs_para>

wonder, if a complaint is made about a young person aged 10 or 11
causing nuisance or annoyance, how the police are going to investigate
to see whether it is appropriate that such an injunction be placed on
that young person. The JCHR made the point that there is no requirement
whatsoever in the Bill to judge what is in the best interests of the
child before such an injunction is imposed. It would be helpful if the

The anti-social behaviour order, as we shall debate later, required a
much higher level of proof of nuisance. In the injunctions contained in
amendments made in 2003 to the Housing Act, there is a lower level, as
we have heard from the housing associations which have contacted us. In

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friend Lord Greaves for tabling this amendment, because it does seem to
be a good place to start. The issue has certainly triggered a lot of
arguments from colleagues, if I may say so. We have set this age of 10
because that is the age at which children are currently deemed capable
of being responsible for their actions under the criminal law. My noble
friend showed quite clearly that this is something that has been
enshrined in legislation for some time, but I emphasise that the focus
of the injunction is to nip issues and problems in the
bud.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311187000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#1311187000093">Many of us
agree that the move away from automatic criminalisation of young people
is a step in the right direction; noble Lords have backed the
Government’s decision to move in that direction. Breach of an
injunction does not result in a criminal conviction, giving the young
person a chance of reform with a clean slate. 
<?notus-xml column=738?>This is not the case with anti-social behaviour orders, where breach is
a criminal offence; this change has been widely welcomed by, among
others, the Home Affairs Committee in another place. In addition to the
injunction, positive requirements can be used to help address the
causes of a young person’s anti-social behaviour, to help them
to turn their life around before that behaviour escalates to something
more
serious.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311187000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#1311187000094">We
have also built in requirements for the local youth offending team to
be involved at different stages in the process, to allow for the proper
and thorough consideration of the needs of the young person. This goes
far beyond what was required for the anti-social behaviour order.
Furthermore, on the recommendation of the Home Affairs Committee, we
have limited the maximum period of an injunction to 12 months where it
is issued against someone under the age of 18, whereas the minimum
duration of an ASBO is two years. Twelve months will provide agencies
with sufficient time for them to work with other agencies to address
any underlying issues driving anti-social behaviour. It strikes the
right balance between providing victims with the respite they need and
sending a strong message to young people that anti-social behaviour is
not
acceptable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311187000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#1311187000095">My

important document. It is available on the Home Office website, but if
those who want a hard copy let me know, I will ensure that one is sent
to them. It will be relevant to the youth offending teams and, in
relation to Part 6 of the Bill, to police and crime commissioners;

private conversations with the noble Lord about this—that all
this legislation is of a piece. It is designed to address the failure

They welcome the opportunity of intervening
earlier—pre-offending, one might say—because one of the
deficiencies of the current system is that the remedy lies in an
anti-social behaviour order, which is a rather heavy hammer with which
to deal with the problem. This is much more nuanced. I cannot answer
the noble Lord in specifics because I am not thinking quickly enough on
my feet. However, I hope I have reassured him that the early stages of
anti-social behaviour are likely to be dealt with informally, as they
would be at present. The injunction method gives a framework for
remedial activity, particularly with a young offender, but we should

enthusiastic. I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in
this discussion, which has been useful. It has shown that there is not
quite as much clarity about how the youngest children in

the new system. I hope that perhaps the 
<?notus-xml column=741?>Government might find ways to be clearer about that as the Bill

had to dash back from Argentina. Since she took up her responsibilities

Minister said that the Government are replacing ASBOs, which are a
“heavy hammer”, with a more nuanced approach. The noble
Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, pointed out that they are doing this by
sweeping away a whole range of means that perhaps on the face of it
ought to provide a more nuanced approach and a greater choice of
measures in each case, and replacing it with one. The crux of the
matter—whether this injunction will work for young people and
for people generally—depends on whether it is sufficiently
flexible. The Minister referred to the draft guidance that has been
published. For much of the anti-social behaviour parts of the Bill this
draft guidance is still very skeletal. The part of this draft guidance
that deals with the new injunctions and the way in which they might be
the end of a series of actions is one of the better parts, although it
can no doubt be further improved.</hs_para>

had ASBOs, once they are given one, for most of them the system has
failed. There will be the same sort of thing with the IPNAs. Once kids
are hauled up before a system of justice and have these things imposed
on them, perhaps without sufficient support to make sure that they
adhere to them and do not breach them, for most of the them the system
has failed at that stage. They are far from being rescued from a life

towards it. That is my experience of people in our area. We all hope

19B, I shall speak also to Amendments 20E and 22Q in the same group.
The relationship between the new systems and statutory nuisances might
appear a slightly obscure subject but I do not think it is obscure. It
is fundamental to how it will work on the ground and to the workability
of the measures in the Bill. Amendment 20E introduces 
<?notus-xml column=742?>a third condition for using IPNAs—injunctions for the prevention
of nuisance and annoyance—which is that they do not cover the
same ground as existing statutory nuisance powers.</hs_para>

forward a little in the Bill to community protection notices, which are
a parallel measure that the Bill introduces, again sweeping away quite
a number of former powers into one power to prevent local nuisance such
as litter, dog nuisances or whatever it may be. This

these amendments I am trying to probe the relationship between the new
measures and statutory nuisances, but also perhaps to probe the

statutory nuisance involved? Will the community protection

designed to be used quickly and, in many cases, preventively, to stop
problem behaviours before they escalate. These problem behaviours will

additional condition which suggests that statutory nuisance should be

landlords or police forces being unable to act quickly to protect the
victim. We expect social landlords and police forces to work in
partnership with local councils to deal with shared problems, such as
anti-social noise nuisance. If social landlords and police forces felt
obliged to seek advice from the local council’s statutory
nuisance team before every injunction, this could delay the process of
the application unnecessarily, and lead to victims suffering even more.
Moreover, this new third limb of the test could open up the process to
prolonged and costly legal challenges, as respondents sought to argue

undesirable scenario. Some perpetrators might use the appeal mechanism

Greaves also asked about the choices available. There is no choice as
to whether a local authority serves an abatement notice for statutory
nuisance. It must serve one if it is satisfied that a matter is a
statutory nuisance. He referred to the Explanatory Notes. There is a
good example in there that is illustrative of what may be a nuisance,
but not a statutory nuisance. A dog bounding over a fence, or through a
hole in a fence, can be a nuisance. Recently, I experienced that with
my young son, aged 20 months. Suddenly, a dog scurried under a fence,
and appeared next to him. It was certainly more than a nuisance to his
father, who was far more startled, whereas the dog was just being
playful. In those cases, the first and most sensible thing for anyone
who is trying to be a good neighbour to do is to talk their neighbour
and see if the matter can be resolved locally. Where such behaviour
persists, a non-statutory injunction is not appropriate, and a sensible

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, I have found the Government’s
answer to these amendments a bit less satisfactory than their answer to
the previous group. We will get on to community protection notices
later but I think that the last example that the Minister put forward
was a good one. It provided a good reason why CPNs may be a very
important and useful new power compared with what currently exists:
they will not relate specifically to one thing, such as litter, dogs or
whatever, but will be a general power based on whether an anti-social
nuisance is taking
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:10:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

other examples that the Minister gave show that the people here who are
preparing these things and explaining to us how they will work do not
fully understand how things work on the ground, if they work well.
Noble Lords seem to think that the police and social landlords operate
in one little area and that the local authority is something quite
different. Where these things work well, those different groups work
together on these issues all the time. The first people to go and
investigate the noise may or may not be the police and it may or may
not be the social landlord. However, most people who experience
anti-social behaviour do not live in social housing. In my experience
and, I think, that of many people, most people who experience
anti-social behaviour live in private tenanted accommodation, and
therefore social landlords are not relevant. The people who turn up to
deal with the noise nuisance may be local authority officers. In my
part of the world, there is a scheme in 
<?notus-xml column=746?>which the local authorities work together. They have an out-of-hours
service whereby, even at three o’clock on a Sunday morning,
somebody will answer the telephone and try to do something about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:12:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

work well, they work well because people on the ground from those three
agencies, as well as from other agencies that may exist
locally—some of them voluntary—work together in that way.
That is why I think that saying that, on the one hand, there will be
the council and the environmental health officers with their statutory
nuisance abatement powers and, on the other hand, there will be
everybody else with these powers is not quite how it is going to work.
I hope that it will work but locally everything has to be much more
flexible than the Minister seemed to
suggest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:12:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

be crucial but, as it stands, I do not think that it is adequate in
this area. I am aware that work is taking place to improve it but, when
it comes down to it, the idea that local authorities will stop the
police or a social landlord going ahead and taking action because they
may be investigating and they have other powers is just not how it
works. In any case, even a local authority may have a statutory duty to
serve an abatement notice if it is satisfied that a statutory nuisance
is taking place, but in practice that is not how it works. In practice,
a local authority will always go down the route of contacting the
people involved, as well as the landlord, and attempting to resolve the
matter without serving a notice. If it does serve a notice and the
matter gets to court because people appeal against the notice, then, if
the local authority has not gone out of its way to resolve the matter,
the court will send it back and say, “You’re not having
this. Go and do it

lives made a misery by it. There can always be improvements to whatever
system is in place. However, most of us—if not all of
us—also agree that civil liberties are also precious, and
freedom of expression is particularly so, as it is often through the
expression of ideas that society is changed for the better. These three
amendments are tabled with the aim of helping the Government to get the
balance right between the two. Many of the people who spoke at Second
Reading on this Bill—and 
<?notus-xml column=747?>many, many more who have written to and lobbied Peers on all sides of

anti-social behaviour must surely be precise, targeted and
given proper safeguards. If not, it would be capable of undermining
fundamental human freedoms; it would be likely to distract the
authorities and swamp the courts, hampering the tackling of genuine

creates what we are already calling here IPNAs: injunctions to prevent
nuisance and annoyance. The very wording exposes the main problem in
the present drafting, because you cannot actually outlaw nuisance or
annoyance by all people and in all places. The concept of both of those
things without a proper definition is vague and, above all,
subjective<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:16:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

covers all human life: there is no human activity, I suggest, that does

no attention. The present test is very carefully restricted to conduct
affecting the housing management functions of the relevant landlord. It

IPNA is applicable to everyone but, most importantly, there is a vast
difference between the thresholds of the two. Instead of targeting
harassment, alarm or distress, Clause 1, as I have already said,
catches any behaviour by any person that is capable of
causing nuisance or annoyance. Each of us in this Chamber probably
passes that threshold several times a day in the
eyes of someone or another—in refusing to give way at Question
Time or by talking for too long or too often. That is quite apart from
outside this Chamber—snoring loudly in the Library or not

there are other tests in Clause 1 but that it could at its base level
encompass the most ordinary activities of human life is breath-taking.
Further, instead of having to prove necessity, as under the ASBO, the
courts for the IPNA application will operate the ordinary civil court
test for injunctions; that is, deciding where the balance of
probabilities lies. ASBOs currently are handled by the
magistrates’ court, which must be convinced beyond reasonable
doubt—in other words, the criminal standard of proof. But IPNAs
are to be handled by the civil courts, which need to be convinced only
on the balance of probabilities—the civil standard of
proof—that a person has engaged in the alleged

Section 1(5) of the Crime and Disorder Act, where an ASBO is sought the
individual has a defence if he can show that his conduct was
“reasonable in the circumstances”. But, as yet, there is
no reasonableness defence in Clause 1 of this Bill, although I see that
the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, has a suggested amendment on the
Marshalled List. Therefore, IPNAs have a far lower threshold with fewer
safeguards, making them much easier to obtain than an ASBO. That is of
course the Government’s intention. They want to reduce the
present evidential burden, about which some have complained, and to
speed up the court

arguments that most of the anti-social behaviour which the public worry
about is caught by existing criminal law offences, such as criminal
damage, public order and harassment laws. It is also said that it is
not the lack of laws but the lack of political will and, I have no
doubt, funding on the part of those responsible for enforcing those
laws which renders them less effective than they should be. There are
undoubtedly problems of court delays and not just with ASBO
applications. However, the solution to that is surely not to remove
civil liberty safeguards. Ironically, by making IPNAs easier to obtain
than the old ASBOs, there is a real prospect that Clause 1 will slow
courts down even further by clogging them with large numbers of IPNA
applications<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:23:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
Some local authorities—notably Camden, which has a serious

the current ASBO legislation is applied by a magistrates’ court

Committee of this House in 2002, it was held that the criminal standard
of proof should determine whether anti-social behaviour had occurred.
Given the huge impact such an order can have on an individual’s
life and bearing in mind that an IPNA can make positive as well as
negative requirements, we believe 
<?notus-xml column=750?>this standard must be retained. As the noble and learned Baroness, Lady

the necessity test needs to be retained. The requirements of necessity

important for them to appear in the Bill to reduce the risk of trivial
applications and to help avoid unnecessary and disproportionate orders.

currently in use, “harassment, alarm and distress”. There
is a real danger that if the currently proposed, worryingly low

Lloyd of Berwick (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I had not intended to
speak on this part of the Bill, so I am afraid that I have not done as
much homework as I should. For many years, however, I have protested
against using the civil law to do the work of the criminal law, because
it leads to problems when you adopt that approach. For that reason I
have always been uneasy about ASBOs. For example, it was years before
it was decided—if it has now been decided—whether the
standard of proof on ASBOs is the criminal standard or the civil
standard but as near the criminal standard as makes no difference. So I
shall not be sad to see the back of
ASBOs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:31:26"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:31:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Injunctions are a civil procedure. Therefore, on the face of it, one
would expect to see the civil standard apply. When the question comes
to whether the respondent is in breach of the injunction, the criminal
standard applies under paragraph 1 of Schedule 2. That seems a sensible
approach. With regret, therefore, I cannot support the noble

it needs to be closely examined to see whether it is justified. The

deciding what constitutes ‘nuisance or annoyance’,
applicants must be mindful that this route should not be used to stop
reasonable, trivial or benign behaviours that have not caused, and are
not likely to cause, harm to victims or communities. For example,
children simply playing in a park or outside, or young people lawfully
gathering or socialising in a particular place may be
‘annoying’ to some, but are not in themselves
anti-social. Agencies must make proportionate and reasonable judgements
before applying for an injunction. Failure to do so will increase the

power of arrest will be attached only if the seriousness of the
allegations merits the exercise of such a power. A point made cogently
by the Law Society in its briefing on this part of the Bill is that
injunctions are used in the case of noise nuisance as an alternative to
possession proceedings. They result in the person or their family
staying in their homes, but with restrictions as to their conduct

respect, there seems to be a number of difficulties about the proposed
amendments as explained by the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu. They
would essentially create a criminal regime—there is a criminal
offence later in the Bill—for low-level anti-social behaviour,
in that before an injunction could be granted there would
have to be proof beyond reasonable doubt. This would mean that hearsay
evidence could not realistically be used. Witnesses are often afraid of
the perpetrators of anti-social behaviour and give their complaints to
a housing officer who can then present evidence. One should not
underestimate the misery that can be experienced by residents of, let
us say, a block of flats where one of the occupants is determined to
make the rest of the occupants’ lives a misery. The amendment
would probably necessitate seriously frightened residents having to
give evidence and be cross-examined. It is much more likely that they
would simply refuse to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311187000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#1311187000171">In our
anxiety to ensure that civil liberties are preserved we should neither
lose sight of the victims of anti-social behaviour nor underestimate
quite what a scourge it can be. I understand entirely what lies behind
this amendment and the concern expressed by a number of noble Lords
that essential freedoms could be at risk if the powers under Part 1
were used too enthusiastically. However, I feel that the really
substantial amendments here will emasculate the right to obtain an
injunction under Part 1 and result in a failure to protect those who
are the victims of anti-social behaviour. Nevertheless, by way of
acknowledging the very real and sincere concerns that a number of
people or groups have about Clause 1, I propose in my amendment, which
I will outline shortly and is supported by the Joint Committee on Human
Rights, that a degree of objectivity be imported into the definition of
conduct capable of causing nuisance and annoyance. That amendment,
which I will be submitting, would help, but I am afraid that I am

Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> My Lords, I find myself in the
difficult position of agreeing with much of the excellent speech by my
noble friend Lady Mallalieu and much of the speech just made by the
noble Lord, Lord Faulks. The reason for that is the mess that this Bill
is. The reality is that the original concept of anti-social behaviour
orders was introduced because of a real, prevalent problem in many
parts of this country. The problem outlined by the noble Lord, Lord
Faulks, is that of people whose lives were being made a misery by the
actions of others, but because they were often frightened, or did not
think that it was 
<?notus-xml column=753?>appropriate or possible, they would never bring those matters in a
formal complaint and would be very reluctant to give evidence. That is
why the test was lowered from the criminal standard of
proof.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311187000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#1311187000173">Those

think that anyone suggests that anti-social behaviour orders have all
worked perfectly, but they made a real difference to the lives of very
many people. The reason was that we were changing the way in which

problem with what the Government are doing is not that they are trying
to simplify the system or make it better but that they have swept away
what has over time developed and then moved to this system of applying
for an injunction, or IPNA. By changing the test to one of nuisance and
annoyance, they have opened up the prospect of a lower standard of
proof being applied in far broader areas. We can all add to the list of
things that cause nuisance and annoyance. While it is true that Clause
4 limits the list of organisations which might apply for an IPNA, it
does not deal with the circumstances in which there will be very
powerful local lobbying about much lower levels of nuisance and
annoyance. The regime will be applied to local authorities; it will be
applied to local housing providers—and an interesting question
is what a local housing provider is. Is it somebody who happens to rent
out one room? In which case, can they apply willy-nilly for IPNAs
against all and sundry in the local neighbourhood? I am sure that this
issue has been addressed in the guidance but that I have just not read
it yet. There will be all sorts of cases where people raise matters
which at the moment would not qualify for the ASBO

reason why we are debating this amendment is that the Bill has created
these anomalies. It would be clearly obnoxious for injunctions to be
issued in respect of trivial matters on the basis of this lower level
of proof. Equally, we are in danger, for those very legitimate reasons,
of throwing away all the progress that has been made in the past few
years by reverting to the criminal standard of proof. I think of my
time as a local councillor and my time on the London Assembly, where
much of my constituency work related to anti-social behaviour issues.
The difference that it made for the local authority or for the housing
association to be able to pursue these matters as they were able to
under anti-social behaviour legislation, provided relief for many
people. That is not to say that there were not problems or that some
places were not more reluctant and so on. I shall propose an amendment
later which states that there should be some coherent planning locally
as to what the arrangements should be for pursuing IPNAs in a
particular area and that there should be an anti-social behaviour
strategy in local areas, but we will come to that later. However, the
important point is that, because the Government have 
<?notus-xml column=754?>made such wholesale changes and have then tried to force them into the
single IPNA process, we are in danger of sacrificing the civil
liberties or well-being of many people who were protected by the regime

and communities together. It is a group of residents who meet police
and councillors in the ward each month to talk about these problems:
local crime and particularly disorder and anti-social behaviour. It
works. Sometimes, a handful of people turn up. Then, when something
erupts in some of the streets, a lot of people turn up and it provides
a focus for dealing with these problems. However, it requires the local
police to have the time and resources to take part in such activity. It
also requires the local authority’s anti-social behaviour staff
to be there and to be prepared to get involved at the case, area and
street levels. If it is in an area of social housing, it involves the
social housing providers as well. Other people get involved as
well.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311187000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#1311187000182">In our

into high-level crime. They might also be given a choice between
low-level crime and local disorder or the preventative work where the
local neighbourhood teams go round to talk to people, getting to know
the patch and its lads and lasses who are hanging around on the streets
and might get into bother. The police might find diversionary
activities for them, if they have the resources. If that is going on,
the system will work, but once that is withdrawn, hen all the IPNAs,

Ponsonby of Shulbrede (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I want to make one
brief point which follows on from that made by the noble Lord, Lord
Greaves. At Second Reading, the Minister made a lot of the breach rates
for ASBOs; he said that they were about 60%. The point that I made in
my Second Reading speech was that, in my experience as a sitting
magistrate, breach rates have declined over the past few years as ASBOs
have been more appropriately introduced. I have checked my recollection
with my colleagues and I think that they would agree with my comments.
Why does the Minister think that breach rates will decline when he is
proposing through IPNAs to reduce the burden of proof to a balance of
probabilities, and to address nuisance and annoyance rather than
“harassment, alarm and distress”? Those two changes are
very likely to lead to an increase in the number of breaches, which
seemed to be a fundamental point in his seeking to replace ASBOs. I
know that later in this Committee there will be a proposal to run the
two systems in parallel, which seems a sensible way forward while the

Ramsbotham:</Member></B> My Lords, in principle I am very keen on the
idea that Governments should lay down what should happen and leave the
how up to local areas to decide, because there will obviously be
different local conditions. I remember that fairly soon after the ASBO
was introduced, there was considerable concern about what great
differences there were in how it was being introduced in different
parts of the country. It was shown that there was something of a
postcode lottery in it. I suspect that we have heard less and less of
that over time because people have got used to the
ASBO.</hs_para>

because the ASBO was quite tightly defined; the definition of what

insufficiently precise. I fear that if there is no more precision in
this initially, we shall have exactly the same as we had with the
introduction of the ASBO: there will be a postcode lottery. If the

not being a criminal activity—there is a need to sharpen up the
precision to prevent that and to give better guidance to the local
authorities who will have to enforce

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been an interesting
debate. All speakers have sought to be helpful to the Minister, perhaps
seeking to protect the Government from themselves by this
amendment—they were certainly not trying to be a nuisance or
annoyance in identifying so many difficult issues that arise here. So I
do not expect to have an IPNA taken out against us but, on the balance
of the judgment that is in the legislation before us, I suppose we
should wait and see. This debate strikes at the very heart of the
issue, and the contributions that we have heard today reflect the
balance of opinion at Second
Reading.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111821000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#13111821000002">The
noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, made a very powerful case and addressed
a number of the concerns that were raised, including the concerns of
those who have argued against the amendment. Like the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, I spent a number of years as an MP,
although not as many as he did. Anti-social behaviour was then and
remains a very serious issue. I recall that many of those dealing with
the problem welcomed ASBOs, despite some of the failings and problems
we have heard about, and I think that ASBOs have improved with time and
experience. The test of “harassment, alarm and distress”
was rightly a higher bar than we see before us today, because it
recognises the seriousness of the issue, but it also recognises the
penalties for breaches of the order. That is an important point to make
in the context of this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111821000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#13111821000003">I find
it very interesting that, in the Second Reading debate and again today,
the anti-social behaviour orders gained support from distinguished
Members of your Lordships’ House with expertise in law, policing
and the magistracy. There were criticisms, and I still have some
criticisms about the implementation of anti-social behaviour orders and
measures. There are those who do not understand how seriously and
dreadfully victims 
<?notus-xml column=757?>of anti-social behaviour are affected. Unless you have suffered yourself
or have spoken to people who have been through that totally
debilitating experience, it can be hard to understand how that
constant, unrelenting pressure of harassment, intimidating behaviour or
excessive noise can leave people terrified of living in their own homes
and very distressed. I remember one lady who I spoke to at great length
on many occasions. She was so distressed by what some might regard as
kids mucking around, but very seriously so, that she was terrified to
live in her own home. We are now seeing ASBOs being more appropriately
used and we have seen a reduction, as we have heard, in their
breaches.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111821000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#13111821000004">We
have also heard that there can be injunctions for anti-social behaviour
under housing legislation and that the test of causing nuisance and
annoyance already exists, but that is in very limited and specific
circumstances. The noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, made that very clear
in her comments. Anti-social behaviour injunctions were brought in in
2003 and have been used sensibly and wisely since then. Today, we have
all had correspondence from housing associations—in many cases,
very similar letters—explaining why they want to retain the
power they have and explaining the benefits they have been able to
bring to their tenants, in many cases, very vulnerable tenants, because
of those powers. Their letters highlight a problem referred to by the
noble Lord, Lord Harris, a few moments ago, and by others; a problem
which the Government have created by trying to rationalise the number
of orders, procedures and interventions that can be taken against
anti-social behaviour. Clearly, housing associations with very
vulnerable tenants welcome the powers they have, but these are not
appropriate for every single case of anti-social behaviour. We are not
against all forms of injunctions but we are against making this
test—on the balance of probability, for nuisance and
annoyance—the test that should be applied in all cases where
somebody complains about something that they consider to be anti-social
behaviour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:59:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111821000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#13111821000005">In
some cases there has been a misunderstanding that only small areas are
covered; perhaps only social housing estates or council estates. In
fact, anti-social behaviour, and certainly the test that the Government
wish to apply, of nuisance or annoyance, is much wider spread than
that. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T17:02:37"></hs_TimeCode>In many
cases, injunctions to prevent nuisance and annoyance can involve
similar and indeed wider matters than those raised in current ASBO
applications. They can address relatively minor issues involving
nuisance neighbours and minor disorder. Because as an order an ASBO can
represent a serious slight upon the reputation of a respondent, as well
as carrying serious consequences for breach, it is completely
inappropriate for something of that seriousness to have a lower
standard of proof to apply.</hs_para>

also note that ASBOs can impose only prohibitions. These injunctions
could include positive requirements, and I welcome that, but of
indefinite duration, which would be the equivalent to or more serious
than many community sentences that we see people getting at present

those procedural 
<?notus-xml column=758?>guarantees in the criminal process protected by Article 6(3)

is also enormous concern, as we have heard, that although this low and
pretty vague test that has been applied by the Government does not
automatically bring a criminal sanction, it can lead to imprisonment

original behaviour but the breach of the injunction, but it is a long
leap from “nuisance and annoyance” and the balance of
probabilities to someone receiving a detention order. As we have heard
today from your Lordships’ House, that is something that causes
enormous concern. The IPNA test is far too low. We are in danger of
seeing behaviour that ought to be accommodated and dealt with in a far
more reasonable and appropriate way becoming subject to

that that is what lies at the heart of what we are trying to achieve
here. It ensures that police, local authorities and all those other

action to bring respite to both individual victims and communities.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T17:03:29"></hs_TimeCode> noble

to replace the “nuisance or annoyance” test for the IPNA
with the anti-social behaviour test of “harassment, alarm or
distress”. Finally, Amendment 20D seeks to revert from the
requirement that it must be “just and convenient” to

people they knew out of fear. That was the reason for the particular
wording of that Act, which a number of noble Lords referred to and said
worked perfectly well in that context. However, in each context where
that lesser definition has been used there have been very clear
statutory limits on the circumstances. What the Government are
proposing to do now is to open that definition and apply it to
everybody in all circumstances. They are apparently going to allow what

permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the
disaster in the Philippines and the Commonwealth meeting in Sri Lanka.
Ten days ago a category 5 super typhoon brought massive destruction
across the Philippines, where the city of Tacloban was devastated by a
tidal wave almost two and a half metres high. The scale of what
happened is still becoming clear, with many of the
country’s 7,000 islands not yet reached or assessed. But already
we know that more than 12 million people have been affected, with more
than 4,400 dead and more than 1,500 missing, including a number of
Britons. This disaster follows other deadly storms there and an
earthquake that killed 200 people in Bohol last month. I am sure the
thoughts of the whole House will be with all those affected, their
friends and their
families.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111821000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#13111821000036">Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T17:19:43"></hs_TimeCode>
has been at the forefront of the international relief effort. The
British public have once again shown incredible generosity
and compassion, donating £35 million so far, and the
Government have contributed more than £50 million to the
humanitarian response. In the last week, HMS “Daring” and
her onboard 
<?notus-xml column=763?>helicopter, an RAF C17, and eight different relief flights, have brought
essential supplies from the UK and helped get aid to those who need it
most. An RAF C130, a Hercules, will arrive tomorrow and HMS
“Illustrious” will also be there by the end of this week,
equipped with seven helicopters, water desalination and command and
control capabilities.
Beyond<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T17:20:29"></hs_TimeCode> the
immediate task of life-saving aid, the people of the Philippines will
face a long task of rebuilding and reducing their vulnerability to

the Commonwealth, and then to the issues in Sri Lanka. The Commonwealth
is a unique organisation representing 53 countries, with one-third of
the world’s population and one-fifth of the global economy. It
is united by history, relationships and the values of the new
Commonwealth charter, which we agreed two years ago in Perth. Britain
is a leading member. Her Majesty the Queen is the head of the

with all the international organisations to which we belong, the
Commonwealth allows us to champion the values and economic growth that
are so vital to our national interest. At this summit, we reached
important conclusions on poverty, human rights and trade. On poverty,
this was the last Commonwealth meeting before the millennium
development goals expire. We wanted our Commonwealth partners to unite
behind the ambitious programme set by the United Nations High Level
Panel, which I co-chaired with the Presidents of Indonesia and Liberia.
For the first time, this programme prioritises not just aid but the
vital place of anti-corruption efforts, open institutions, access to
justice, the rule of law and good governance in tackling
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T17:22:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111821000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#13111821000039">On
human rights, the Commonwealth reiterated its support for the core
values set out in the Commonwealth charter. Commonwealth leaders
condemned in the strongest terms the use of sexual violence in
conflict, an issue championed globally by my right honourable friend
the Foreign Secretary. We also called for an end to early and forced
marriage and for greater freedom of religion and belief. We committed
to taking urgent and decisive action against the illegal wildlife trade
ahead of the conference in London next year. Britain successfully
resisted an attempt to usher Zimbabwe back into the Commonwealth

rights and political
freedoms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T17:22:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111821000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0001.htm#13111821000040">The
Foreign Secretary and I also used the meeting to build the case for
more open trade and for developing our links with the fastest growing
parts of the world. The Commonwealth backed a deal at next
month’s World Trade Organisation meeting in Bali that could cut
bureaucracy at borders and generate $100 billion for the global
economy. Before and after the summit in Sri Lanka, I continued to bang
the drum for British trade and investment. I went to New Delhi and
Calcutta in India before heading to Sri Lanka, the third time I have
visited India as Prime Minister, and I went from the summit to Abu
Dhabi and Dubai where Airbus 
<?notus-xml column=764?>agreed new orders from Emirates and Etihad airlines that will add
£5.4 billion to the British economy. These orders will sustain

the Opposition for her support for the 
<?notus-xml column=767?>action that the British Government have taken so far to provide help in
the Philippines. I noted in particular the support that she gave for
our troops and the work that they are doing, and for the generous
response of the British public in providing charitable
help<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T17:33:37"></hs_TimeCode>. I think
that, as the noble Baroness said, other countries will need to do more
to make sure that the commitments that have been made are honoured. The
Government will work, through the Foreign Office and DfID, to try to
make sure that they fulfil those commitments and follow the kind of
lead that the British Government have
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T17:33:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

also right to emphasise the importance of humanitarian relief reaching
the remote areas, where there is obviously a particular problem. I hope
that HMS “Illustrious”, with its helicopters, will help
to deliver aid more readily to such areas, along with the United States
carrier in the area, which is providing more capacity for lifting and
for getting aid to those remote places. The noble Baroness is right to
remind us of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T17:34:30"></hs_TimeCode>
that. I was glad of the support that she gave for the communiqué

noble Baroness’s specific questions and the Prime
Minister’s decision to go to this CHOGM. In essence, he went for
two reasons, and I happen to think that he was right to do so for both.
The first was to lend his support and encouragement for the general
work that the Commonwealth as a whole is trying to do to take forward
its agenda on the development of human rights and so on. The second, as
he has argued very forcefully and, I think, convincingly was to bring
more pressure to bear and to shine a spotlight on the awful things that
appear to have happened in Sri Lanka.</hs_para>

am not sure how he would have been able to prosecute that case if he
had not been there. To take what is perhaps a trivial example, we would
not have been having this discussion and this Statement today if
Britain had chosen to sit on her hands. Therefore, I think that it was
the right decision. If one looks at the political and media coverage to
date, the profile that the summit has achieved over the past few days
is far greater than would have been the case if my right honourable
friend had not been

questions that the noble Baroness asked me, the Prime Minister pressed
the case for an independent, credible and transparent inquiry to start
by March. We will continue to build on the work started at CHOGM to
maintain pressure on the Sri Lankan Government for that independent
inquiry to get under way. The Prime Minister was absolutely clear that,
if that does not happen, he will use his good offices through the UN to
press for an international inquiry. That obviously remains a

President Rajapaksa is an appropriate person to be chair-in-office, the
noble Baroness will know that the whole basis on which the Commonwealth

of a member state from the chair-in-office. As it happens, there is no
formal role for the chair-in-office following the CHOGM 
<?notus-xml column=768?>other than chairing the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers meeting in
September. The Commonwealth is effectively run by the Secretary-General
and not by the country that happens to be in the chair. As I said,
there is no precedent for removing a member state. The decision was
effectively taken back in 2009 and, given that it is an institution
that proceeds on consensus, there was no prospect at all of that being

Howell of Guildford (Con):</Member></B> Does my noble friend accept
that, despite the perfectly understandable concerns about human rights
issues in Sri Lanka, the visit of the Prime Minister, my right

investment with a rapidly expanding pattern of economic dynamism
throughout the modern Commonwealth? Does he also accept that the words
of His Royal Highness Prince Charles, who said that the Commonwealth
was a means of bringing a “touch of healing” to a
troubled world, were extremely apposite? Does he therefore conclude
that the mugwumps, including the <I>Financial Times</I> and the British

my noble friend also explain to the noble Baroness that at Perth in
2011 there was absolutely no chance of reopening the Colombo decision,
because it had been settled at the 2009 meeting, which was attended by
Gordon Brown, the then British Prime Minister? It was agreed that there
should be a postponement but that the decision for 2013 should be
locked in. It is all very well after the event saying that somehow the
decision should have been reopened. It could not have been; it was
settled in Trinidad in 2009. Will he explain that to the noble Baroness
opposite? I think that those opposite are experiencing some
embarrassment that they suggested that Mr Cameron should not go when it
was obviously wise for him to do so. He did a lot of good for us, for
the Commonwealth and, indeed, even for Sri
Lanka<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T17:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

any progress that we can make to encourage that to be taken forward can

here—that in future, any chairman of such a conference must

Britain, along with other Commonwealth countries, could do a lot more
to advance the rule of law in Sri Lanka for both communities and

my noble friend Lord Steel, I am sure that people will learn from some
of the decisions taken in the past. As has already been alluded to, a
lot of the decisions about where these things will take
place are made many years out. The Commonwealth is an institution which
proceeds on the basis of consensus, so the notion that
Britain alone is able to determine these things clearly is not the
case. I understand the noble Lord’s point about the
need for continuing an emphasis on the importance of human rights. I
did not mean to imply any negative response to that. I very much agree

Perhaps I may ask the Leader of the House about not just the emergency
phase, which is so important, as regards food, water and shelter, but
the recovery phase in disasters such as this where we are looking for

The Prime Minister was very clear in his Statement that one cannot
disassociate oneself from the awful history of Sri Lanka over the past
30 years and the history of bloodshed and civil strife that it has gone
through. That having been said, I do not accept that the Prime Minister
made his case to the President of Sri Lanka in an unbalanced way. There
is quite a lot of contention around figures of the sort to which my
noble friend refers. That is precisely why my right honourable friend
the Prime Minister stressed the importance of having a credible
transparent and independent inquiry to get to the bottom of what
happened during the closing phases of the civil war and then addressing
the situation so that it is possible on that basis to move forward with
reconciliation to a shared understanding of what the future might be

levers in the hands of the Welsh Government which, if used wisely, can

give the Welsh Government the tools they need to stimulate the Welsh

constitutional settlement, we must remember that it is how these powers
are used that matters. On our side, no one is seeking more powers
simply for the sake of it—they are important because of how they
can be used to support the living standards of the people of Wales. The
people of Wales have been hard hit by this Government’s
policies, with real incomes down by £1,700 a year, energy bills
rocketing, public services under pressure and welfare cuts hurting the
most vulnerable. It is therefore critically important that Wales has
borrowing powers which are afforded to other devolved Administrations
in Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as to local authorities, to
enable it to invest in infrastructure. This is particularly important
given the huge cuts to the Welsh Government’s budget. The
capital budget will shrink by a third over this Parliament as part of a

referendum; secondly, a period of assignment to ensure that Wales is
not worse off; and thirdly, a fair funding settlement. That remains our
position. We are pleased to see that the idea of a sunset clause, which

the rest of the UK. It has lagged behind the rest of the UK for many

Wales that it has fallen further and further behind the rest of the UK.
This is not a recent thing since the coalition Government came to
power: it is something that has existed for far too long, and the
coalition Government, in making this series of announcements today, are
determined to give the Welsh Government and the National Assembly for
Wales the tools with which to do the job—the tools with which to

clearly going to be some time before any kind of actual building on the

relation to the question on the level of borrowing that the Welsh

borrowing possible for the Welsh Government with the minor taxes, but
there will be a much higher level of borrowing if the Welsh Government
and the Assembly go forward with a referendum and the people of Wales
vote yes on that.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> timing of

noble Baroness asked about the model for income tax devolution. The
Government have taken the view that the Scottish model is appropriate.
It has been welcomed in many quarters and therefore it is a good model
to follow in this case, particularly as Wales has a very porous border

than they do between Scotland and England. There was concern that the
model of income tax put forward in the Silk commission report could

rates of income tax can only be varied in tandem, without the right to
vary one rate independently of the other? In other words, if the Welsh
Government wanted to bring down the top rate from 45 pence to
40 pence—an 11% reduction—there would have to
be a 25% reduction in the standard rate of income tax, making such a
choice totally impossible. Does she understand that the Holtham and
Silk reports rejected such a lock-step approach? This not only denies

that you are going to vote yes for a referendum. Would my noble friend
the Minister be good enough to say who is going to frame the question
which is to be put to the Welsh people? It has been noticeable that the
First Minister, Mr Carwyn Jones, has not been overanxious to commit
himself to timing for a referendum. Can we take it that the legislation
will ensure that a referendum will be held and will not be deferred
until some replacement for the Barnett formula has been found? In the
13 years of the previous Labour Government, they were unable to do
that, despite all the pleas that were put to them at that time. Will my

issues, the first relating to the question for the referendum. The
Government’s response on this has laid great emphasis on how
well we believe arrangements worked for the previous referendum on full
legislative powers. In that case, the matter was very much in the hands
of the Welsh Government and Welsh Assembly in consultation with the UK
Government. However, there was a very important role for the Electoral
Commission, whose advice was taken and 
<?notus-xml column=782?>was pivotal. I hope that the Welsh Government will lead the call for a
referendum and that the situation in Wales will enable them to lead
that call relatively soon. It is important that the Welsh Government
feel that they are in a position strongly to call for a referendum,
because the UK Government believe that the joint statement of October
2012 meant that there was agreement between the two Governments on the

constitutional changes in the United Kingdom are concerned they should
be planned and administered on a comprehensive, and not a piecemeal or
haphazard, basis? In other words, once the Scottish people have given
their verdict on the issue of independence, a powerful body of the

relationship of the House of Commons to the House of Lords and vice

devolved authorities, whether they be two or three in number. Does she

would flow with milk and honey and that the Welsh economy would be
rejuvenated. Surely she recognises that the substantial cost of
investment in transport and other infrastructure needed in Wales can be
met only in limited part—I would say in small part—by the
revenues from the minor taxes that are to be devolved and the limited
borrowing powers that are proposed for Wales. Surely devolution should

in the devolution settlement in Wales, we have to look back to the
Government of Wales Act 2006 and the original devolution
settlement at the end of the last century. It has possibly been
difficult in the past for the Welsh Government to deal with major

annoyance” and is not only for the reasons which other noble
Lords have given during the course of the afternoon as examples of
conduct that each of us undertakes which our colleagues might regard as

which these new provisions will have on people with a learning

heard in the debate on the previous bank of amendments, the Bill
introduces civil injunctions to prevent nuisance and
annoyance—IPNAs as they are called. These may be imposed if the
court considers it “just and convenient” to prevent
anti-social behaviour. The Joint Committee on Human Rights, in
scrutinising the Bill, highlighted that this is a lower test than the
test of necessity, as required by human rights law. Furthermore, it
considered that the new IPNA definition of anti-social behaviour is
broad and
unclear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111831000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0002.htm#13111831000011">This
has set alarm bells ringing with Mencap and others who work with people
with a learning disability, fearing that this will lead to IPNAs being
used 
<?notus-xml column=786?>inappropriately. As many know, people with a learning disability are
disproportionately likely to be victims of anti-social behaviour.
Mencap's report <I>Living in Fear</I> found almost nine in 10 people
with a learning disability had experienced bullying, harassment or some
form of anti-social
behaviour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111831000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0002.htm#13111831000012">The
root of this, of course, is attitudinal and is based on the value that
we as a society place on disabled people. In some people's eyes they
are different and sometimes regarded, sadly, as dangerous. This was
brought into sharp focus by the recent murder of Bijan Ebrahimi. Bijan
was a disabled man picked upon for being different on his estate in
Bristol. He suffered from low-level harassment before being accused of
being a paedophile. He was questioned by the police, who found him
innocent, but unfortunately by this point rumours had begun circulating
that he was a child abuser and two days later he was brutally
murdered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111831000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0002.htm#13111831000013">My
concern is therefore that a lower threshold for IPNAs, together with a
murky definition of anti-social behaviour, will result in these new
injunctions being used out of misunderstanding, fear and ignorance of
people with a learning disability, and of behaviour that might be
associated with their impairment. It could also lead to a rise in
vigilantism and will do nothing to improve people’s
understanding of the needs of disabled people.</hs_para>

that victims may in turn be branded perpetrators. For example, a person
with a learning disability might be continually verbally abused by a
neighbour. What if that victim is at the end of his tether and snaps,
so to speak, at the neighbour? Such behaviour might in turn result in
an IPNA being placed on that individual. The Bill sets out examples of
certain prohibitions and requirements in Parts 1 and 2, and the
amendment would include consideration of learning disability at this
juncture. Such a step, if backed by robust guidance, would undoubtedly
go some way towards meeting these concerns. I hope that the Government
might look at this area further, not least because I understand that no
equality impact assessment of the Bill has been carried out to date. I
look forward to hearing the Minister’s thoughts on these

Berridge (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 20 was
recommended by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its fourth
report—a committee on which both my noble friend Lord Faulks and
I serve. Amendment 20 is a modest compromise and adds an element of
reasonableness or objectivity, giving the test more rigour, and will
aid the authorities and other agencies. It will enable them to better
explain their refusal to act on behalf of some people who just have
different views on what they should have to tolerate from their
neighbours and other people in the neighbourhood. I agree with my noble
friend Lord Faulks that at this earlier stage, the test should have a
reasonableness requirement, as it is at this stage that the officials
of the authorities outlined in Clause 4 have to consider that
behaviour.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111831000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0002.htm#13111831000016">As
has already been outlined, reasonableness and proportionality are a
requirement that the judiciary have to take into account when granting
an injunction. This means that there will be reasonableness applied 
<?notus-xml column=787?>in the test by the officials and, of course, by the court rather than
having a more subjective test by the officials and only later on
encountering the reasonableness threshold. I spoke at Second Reading
about the inordinate lengths to which witnesses have to go to collect
the necessary evidence to get an ASBI or an ASBO. Merely adding after
“conduct” the words “that might reasonably be

to what has just been said in support of Amendment 20. The words
“any person” at the end of Clause 1(2) are rather
important; I would have thought that they make it all the more
important that the words which the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, has
suggested are put in. Without that, one would have the very difficult
task as a judge of having to assess the evidence of one individual and
deciding whether that individual is to be believed. If that individual
says that he or she has been annoyed or suffered a nuisance, it would
be quite difficult to say that the test was not satisfied. The
reasonableness test is the one which would soften this and make it more
realistic, and I would have thought that it was compatible with the

Greaves (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, if I sometimes tell my noble
friend Lady Hamwee that she is being legalistic, that is a compliment
since she is a lawyer and I am not, which means that she sees things
that I do not. When it comes to the meaning of words, however, I take a
straightforward, common-sense view. Words have meanings and we ought to
try to stick to them, but sometimes words have different meanings. A
word that may well have a respectable legal background in terms of its
meaning may not necessarily mean what ordinary people in the street
think it means. I think that that is why “annoyance” is
causing a reasonable amount of difficulty in the Bill. It has caused
many to ask, “Are we really going to have an injunction just
because someone is being annoying?”. I take the view that it is
a human right to be annoying to other people from time to time, because
if it does not happen there will never be any progress. Perhaps that
explains some things. The difficulty, however, is at what level
annoyance becomes unacceptable. “Harassment, alarm and
distress” are clearly degrees of annoyance but they go rather
further than what people nowadays tend to think annoyance
means.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111831000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0002.htm#13111831000019">In the
representations that we have had on this there has been quite a concern
among those who are used to ASBOs—civil liberties groups and so
on—about the way in which the changes are being made, switching
from ASBOs and apparently making it easier to obtain an injunction to
prevent nuisance and annoyance, and about the possibility that the
words “nuisance” and particularly
“annoyance” are far too feeble. On the other hand, the
housing associations which have been writing to us in the past two or
three days are saying, “No, the existing
ASBIs”—which are injunctions—“work very
well and those are the words that they use”. They would be very
concerned if the test was increased.</hs_para>

that you might live next door to somebody who says something foolish to
you or wags their finger at you every time you go out in the morning.
If it happens to you one time out in the street, and even if the person
is going round doing it to lots of people, it really is no reason to
serve an injunction on the person, however daft they may be behaving.
But if it happens day after day or every time you go out of your house,
it becomes a very serious matter. There is a considerable difference
between repeated, annoying, low-level anti-social behaviour which
irritates and harasses neighbours and is totally unacceptable in a
residential context and the same behaviour out in the street. This is
happening partly because, as the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey,
told us earlier, the Government are bringing lots of different things
under the same umbrella.</hs_para>

Lady Hollins. There is a serious issue about people with learning
disabilities. It does not mean that they are not capable of causing
distress through anti-social behaviour, but the measures by which it

amendment raises the important issue of the proper considerations which
must be considered in applications for IPNAs under Part 1 against
respondents with learning disabilities. The amendment may not be
necessary, because I have already spoken at length about the test for
the injunction and the two limbs of the injunction, but I reiterate
that, in deciding whether to grant an injunction, the court will
consider whether it is fair, reasonable and proportionate to do so.
That is within the terms under which a court would consider any
injunction. In doing so, the court will be aware of its obligations to
prevent discrimination against any respondent and to ensure that a
respondent’s human rights are respected. Of course, the court
will also ensure that the respondent is capable of complying with the
terms of the injunction—indeed, that is specifically mentioned
in the guidance. If the noble Lord will look at that section he will
find that it is referred to. It is all part of the “just and
convenient” part of the test which goes along with the whole
business of nuisance and annoyance as being a joint, two-limbed
test<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111831000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0002.htm#13111831000027">Returning
to Amendment 20B, my noble friend Lady Hamwee pointed out that the
Housing Act refers to “a nuisance”, not simply
“nuisance”. I can reassure her that the test for the new
injunction is based on that used for anti-social behaviour injunctions
in the 1996 Act. No difference is intended but one of the two usages
had to be used in this case to provide that continuity. Similarly, in
respect of Amendment 20C, the use of the term
“annoyance” in addition to “nuisance” also
derives from the Housing Act 1996. The two 
<?notus-xml column=790?>terms will take their ordinary meaning. The dictionary definitions we
have heard from my noble friend Lord Greaves are very interesting, but
there is a meaning in law, by precedent, which is clear to the courts
and, indeed, the Law Society has made clear that it welcomes that
definition. They are commonly used together and may cover a broader
range of behaviours than either would alone. We see the benefit in
retaining the familiar test that includes both; that was mentioned in
previous

noble friends Lord Faulks, Lady Hamwee and Lady Berridge, and the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, all made similar points about
Amendments 20 and 20H, as, indeed, did the noble Baroness, Lady Smith.
The amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Faulks was, of
course, one of those recommended by the JCHR. Both amendments seek to
add an explicit test of reasonableness to the threshold for making an
injunction. The Government are aware of the concerns about the test for
the injunction under Part 1 and I listened carefully to those concerns
expressed at Second Reading and again today. I agree that it is
important that the courts consider reasonableness, fairness and
proportionality in deciding applications for injunctions to prevent
nuisance or annoyance. The courts will consider these factors as a
matter of course as part of the second limb of the test—that it
is just and convenient to grant an injunction—as I said in my
answer to the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Wigley.
However, the courts will be aware of their obligation to discharge
their functions compatibly with the European Convention on Human
Rights, an exercise which requires a consideration of necessity and
proportionality. However, we will want to consider whether we have done
everything necessary to ensure that this is so with the drafting of
Clause

is not to say that we necessarily agree with the amendments as they are
drafted. Both would revise the “nuisance or annoyance”
test, and I have made it clear that we see the merit in keeping a test
that is already familiar to the courts. However, we want to consider
whether we can make it clearer in the legislation that the courts must
be satisfied that it is reasonable to issue an injunction under Part 1.
This is what the amendments seek to achieve and, in that sense, we are
not very far apart on this issue, so I will reflect
carefully on Amendments 20 and 20H in advance of Report.</hs_para>

for the new injunction is tried and tested, it has a long pedigree and
I see no evidence that it has given rise to the difficulties that a
number of noble Lords have suggested in this and previous debates. The
previous Administration sought to recast and strengthen the
“nuisance or annoyance” test for an anti-social behaviour
injunction back in 2003. This House endorsed that strengthening and on
this issue, as I have said before, I am happy to endorse the position
then taken by the noble Lord, Lord Bassam. The police, local
authorities and others will not act lightly in seeking an injunction.
They and the courts must exercise such powers in a reasonable, fair and
proportionate manner. As I have said, I am ready to take away
Amendments 20 and 20H and explore, without commitment, whether it would
be appropriate to introduce into the test an explicit reference to
reasonableness. That point aside, for the sake of the 
<?notus-xml column=791?>victims of anti-social behaviour, who must be at the forefront of our
deliberations on the Bill, I would be loath to weaken the effectiveness
of the new injunction. I have no doubt that we will return to this

grateful to the Minister for his reassuring noises; he has shown
himself, as usual, to be a listening Minister. The expression
“nuisance or annoyance” has a pedigree, as I think he

it been used over the years in the context of breach of covenant in
common law, and it has found its way into statute.</hs_para>

housing situation is not precisely analogous to anti-social behaviour.
Nonetheless, there is a substantial accumulation of case law that the
judges will understand and, I suggest, they will interpret it
accordingly. I repeat what I said earlier: it seems that in any event
the reasonableness is part of the judge’s task in deciding
whether or not it is just and convenient to grant an injunction.

the nuisance and annoyance so that neither the agencies nor the court

interpretation of what counts as anti-social behaviour. I hope that the
Minister will reflect on that. I appreciate that this does not in any
way weaken the power, but it should reassure those who are naturally
concerned about the potential for this power to be used oppressively,

is right that people should not have to give up religious beliefs or
practices in order to comply with an injunction. There are some people
who have strong ethical humanist views that might involve regular
attendance at events each week that they would say were equivalent to
religious events—they are clearly not religious so do not come
under that definition—and it seems reasonable to include those.
It is also possible that there may be genuine objections by some people
to requirements in an injunction that require them to take part in
otherwise excellent facilities or proceedings that are organised by
religious groups or particular religious groups. It therefore seems
that the word “ethical” ought to be there as well to
cater for probably the very small number of people with humanist
beliefs who would have these

Lords will remember that in 2001, 390,127 people put down on their

whether, for the purposes of excluding someone from requirements under
one of these new injunctions, saying that you had to follow your
religion of Jedi would enable you therefore to say, “I should be
allowed to carry on exactly as I wish”. Similarly, are we
including in religion Satanism or the proponents of animal

pose these questions not because I seriously seek to know whether, when

proponents of animal sacrifice or even those who consider themselves to

plenty of people who behave in an anti-social fashion who, if they
thought that there were some exemption from the requirements of an
injunction, would suddenly pronounce that they had all sorts of
religious beliefs, beliefs that a normal person—or to your
Lordships here, if that is not the same—might consider was not
really a bona fide religion. Is there a requirement now for the
Government to define what they consider to be a religion? If there is

second concern is that, even in an established religion which we would
all recognise as bona fide, there are certain norms of behaviour. If,
however, you pursue your belief in that religion with an excessive
degree of zeal, does that excessive zealotry automatically mean that
you can have exemptions from the requirements of an injunction? What is

not.</hs_para>

Sunday mornings, next to a black church where the singing of hymns was
extremely loud. The church was extremely well attended: far better
attended—and probably more fun—than the meetings of the
Tottenham Labour Party. However, what constitutes reasonable pursuit of
your religious beliefs? For example, is it acceptable that, in pursuit
of your religious beliefs, you decide to go into the common parts of an
estate and pray extremely noisily every night at 2 am? Some people

final point is: even if this is the reasonable pursuit of a bona fide

elucidation from the Minister on what is intended by this phrase. I
absolutely support and accept the principle that these injunctions

raise an important point in respect of the duty on the court to ensure,
so far as is practicable, that any prohibitions or requirements
attached to an injunction do not conflict with the
manifestation—as my noble friend so eloquently put it—of
the respondent’s religious beliefs. In line with the Equality
Act 2010, reference to religious beliefs should go further than
so-called “traditional” religious beliefs. I believe that
this can be covered in guidance but I would like to go away and
consider further the points made by my noble friend. We can return to
the wording of this section if required. I hope my noble friend will

turn to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Harris. I support
the words of my noble friend Lady Hamwee: he raised bold and
challenging concepts. As I said, in response to an earlier amendment,
what may be perceived as perfectly acceptable to one person may not be
acceptable to another. The courts are used to considering a
person’s religious beliefs and do not need to be told that they
can reject beliefs if they are spurious. In addition, to try to
second-guess what would, in the words of the amendment, constitute
activities “that would normally arise” is very difficult
given that two people of the same religion may have different ways of
practising their faith. I am a Muslim and there are 73 different
denominations within Islam. During Ramadan, the time of your fast can
differ 
<?notus-xml column=795?>depending on where you are. One obviously prefers to be at a place where
the fast closes as the sun sets rather than when the sun is set
totally. That is a practical illustration from a faith which is widely
recognised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T19:27:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111831000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0002.htm#13111831000052">The
crucial point here is that, in considering an injunction, the court
must avoid, so far as is practicable, any conflict with the
manifestation of a respondent’s religious beliefs. If that is
not practicable because, for example, avoiding the conflict would
result in the respondent engaging in further anti-social behaviour
purporting to be religious practice, the court would not be prevented
from imposing prohibitions or requirements that it considered
appropriate. This is something we can safely leave to the courts; they
are more than capable of assessing the bona fide status of a
respondent’s religious practice without express provision and,
indeed, we have recently seen examples of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T19:28:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111831000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0002.htm#13111831000053">Amendments
20G and 22CB, tabled by my noble friend Lord Greaves, raise another
important point. As we have made clear, the injunction should be
available to help turn a troubled person’s life around,
especially when they are young and impressionable. As such, it would
not be helpful for requirements or prohibitions to unnecessarily stop
them engaging in constructive training.</hs_para>

considered as training by some may not be worthy of special
consideration by the court and some will try to use this term to delay

it is likely to be linked to an educational establishment or even a

response from the Minister and I look forward to the results of his
reflection. To my noble friend Lady Hamwee I say, I am never
legalistic; I may sometimes be pernickety, but that is a bit different.
I had great sympathy for what the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey,
said, and had great sympathy for him, having to go to his Labour Party
meetings on a Sunday morning. However, that reminded me that in the old
days, and perhaps here and there now, there were things called
socialist Sunday schools. If lads and lasses were getting out of hand,
I am sure that going to socialist Sunday schools might have helped
them. I cannot see how it could have done so, but it might well have
helped them at least to organise their lives. Therefore, the question
of regular events—such as non-religious ethical
meetings—is important. I am grateful for the Minister’s
comments, and I beg leave to withdraw Amendment

news. The M23 rebels have been defeated militarily, so their only
option is now the negotiating table. Towns in North Kivu, in the
eastern DRC, are celebrating, and the UN has shown its capability,
along with national Governments, to deal with an intractable conflict.
The BBC reported that M23 officials in Uganda said that their fighters
had retreated because government and UN forces had launched a joint
assault. However, the UN has yet more work to do, as one of the newest
threats to regional security now lies in the little-known country of
the Central African Republic. A landlocked country, it lies at 180th
out of 186 on the UN developmental index, bumbling along near
the bottom but never getting the attention of being in the
relegation zone. It borders Sudan, South Sudan, DRC, Chad, the
Congolese Republic and Cameroon, is about the size of France and is
rich in oil, timber and diamonds. After independence in 1960, there
have been many coups and the notorious brief existence of a Central
African Empire under Emperor Bokassa.</hs_para>

predicting a full-blown conflict unless urgent action is taken to
establish the rule of law and give humanitarian

factor is that arms are flooding into the country. The flow of AK47s
has now been followed by rocket-propelled grenades and heavy weaponry.
The UK is the fourth largest European exporter to the CAR and is a key
supplier of arms to the unstable region of central Africa, including
Sudan and Chad. Now the Seleka rebellion has been boosted by heavily
armed fighters and warlords from Chad. Would the Minister clarify the

fighting has specifically targeted civilians. Rural populations had
become used to being displaced in the bush during the bush war of 2004
to 2007. However, the latest cycle of violence is different,
increasingly taking on a religious undertone. It includes the
execution, for example, by armed men of eight people who became
separated from a larger group as they fled by truck; and the targeted
killing of villagers, which caused many others of the same religion to
flee. In Bossangoa, at least 35,000 displaced people are living on a
Catholic missionary compound, far exceeding its capacity, while 1,200
people are in a 
<?notus-xml column=801?>hospital, effectively turning it into a makeshift camp. One thousand
people are seeking shelter next to an airstrip—as I think
colleagues have mentioned—while 400 others have gathered in a
school. They are mostly Christians, afraid of retribution and targeted
killings by rival Muslim groups. Similarly, Muslim communities now also
fear revenge attacks by Christian militias. People are abandoning their
villages, which often end up being burned by either party to the

the conflict is religious, Muslim against Christian. The cause is
breakdown of government and governance, creating a vacuum of power. The
solution is restoration of sound governance, underpinned by
re-establishing security through deploying AU and UN forces of possibly

that has swept from north to south since March has affected the entire
population. Since the coup in March and the Seleka offensive, the CAR
has descended from a long-term crisis of poverty into a complex
humanitarian emergency, resulting from decades of abuse, pillage and
corruption by previous leaders and regimes who ruined the country for
personal gains. It is said that the diamonds that Emperor Bokassa gave
French leaders and politicians could have fed and clothed the entire
population of the CAR. The Djotodia Government came into power
promising to reverse the collapse of the state, but the task is beyond
them and the situation is getting worse. Consequently the population,
which had expected drastic changes from the new rulers, started
returning to pre-state socioeconomic frameworks and loyalties when
their hopes failed to materialise. These local dynamics bred intense
fratricidal fighting over shrinking resources, infrastructure, food and
water.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111838000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0002.htm#13111838000037">Newly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T19:55:41"></hs_TimeCode>

entire population of 4.6 million has been affected by violence and
insecurity; 1.6 million people, one-third of the population, are in
dire need of assistance as the humanitarian support system keeps
collapsing despite great efforts by NGOs. The conflict has also taken
on a sectarian aspect. Very little has been reported in the West, and
what little we have seen portrays this as Christians versus Muslims,
but that is not entirely the case as yet. The fighting that escalated
along the sectarian fault line that runs across Africa from Uganda to
Senegal and Gambia is the traditional struggle over water and land
rights between the predominantly Muslim nomads and the 
<?notus-xml column=803?>predominantly Christian homesteaders. However, similar economic and
religious conflict in Nigeria over recent decades has been exacerbated

debate on the prevention of sexual violence in conflict. The Foreign
Secretary’s Prevention of Sexual Violence Initiative and its
team of experts ought to provide an excellent instrument to assist

that the violence and insecurity that now plagues this country has
hampered the delivery of humanitarian aid. As a result, local faith

that the church is one of the few organisations at present responding
to the crisis, by sheltering displaced people, delivering humanitarian
aid and addressing religious tensions. Its efforts, however, have been
hindered due to lack of funds and problems gaining access because of
the violence. Could the Minister assure us that the UK will recognise

Jay of Ewelme (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I too welcome this short
debate and congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Berridge, on securing
it. I must declare an interest as chairman, at least until this summer,
of the international medical aid charity, Merlin, which has been active
in the Central African Republic since 2007 and in Goma and the eastern
Congo since some years before that. It is now working closely
throughout the world with Save the Children. I visited Goma and the
eastern Congo a few years ago and the sense of insecurity there was
palpable. Nowhere else in the world have I had to climb over sleeping
soldiers with machine guns to get to the check-in desk in an

there has been an improvement since then. The M23 armed group has been
defeated—militarily at least—by government forces.
However, given the history of the region, it would be naive to think
that sustained peace will now break out, and that human
rights violations and suffering will now end. So I hope that
the Government will continue to put pressure on the
Government of the DRC and on surrounding countries, notably Rwanda, to
persist with the peace process and to prevent human rights abuses. The
Government have influence—bilaterally and
multilaterally—through the European Union, through the United
Nations and through the African Union, which is an imperfect but
increasingly effective and important organisation, and through human
rights organisations. I hope that the Minister will confirm that the
Government will continue to use their influence to put pressure on
those
organisations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T20:07:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

this House about the Central African Republic. As the noble Baroness,
Lady Berridge, has said, it is a desperate country. It suffers from
chronic instability, with coups, followed by widespread violence,
anarchy and displacement. It is in the bottom 10 on the Global Peace
Index. One noble Lord said that life expectancy is 48; I have heard
that it is nearly 50. There is a one in 10 chance of dying in infancy

African Republic matter to us? It does not matter hugely, either
politically or economically, though instability anywhere in the world
is dangerous to us all. However, poverty and deprivation and hunger and
the fear of disaster matter to the British people, wherever they occur.
We saw that some years ago in Ethiopia, and we are seeing it now with
the response to the typhoon in the Philippines. So it is right that
DfID should have a programme in the Central African Republic, and it is
right that it should be to fund NGOs, such as Merlin and others, who
can make a real difference to the lives of people who have very little
hope and very little help. It is right, too, that aid should be offered
with the flexibility that recognises that a hospital one day can be an
empty shell the next, with the doctors, the patients and the nurses
dispersed or working in the most primitive conditions but still needing
the outside help that NGOs can provide. I commend DfID for the help

may make some slightly broader points, and one or two which, I know, go
slightly beyond the subject of tonight’s debate. First, we are
debating some of the poorest and most conflict-prone countries in
Africa. However, that is less and less typical of the continent as a
whole. There are many examples of political stability and economic
progress in Africa: South Africa, Nigeria—almost,
anyway—Zambia, Ghana and others. We need to recognise that
Africa is changing to respond to humanitarian disasters and conflicts
when they occur but also to encourage economic growth in other
countries.</hs_para>

stress the role that Britain has to play, as I have said, in the Great
Lakes, in the Central African Republic and in other zones of conflict,
zones of humanitarian disaster and zones of human rights abuse. This
is, in the jargon, soft power at work. However, what matters here is
our engagement and involvement where we can make a difference. Many
noble Lords have spoken tonight about making a difference in the Great
Lakes and about making a difference in the Central African Republic,
and we can. Going a little more widely, as I said this afternoon in
this House, in my view it was right for the Prime Minister to go to Sri
Lanka and to highlight the human rights abuses there.</hs_para>

my view, it would have been right, too, to send a representative to
President Rouhani’s inauguration in Iran. It would be right now
to reopen an embassy in Tehran rather than duck the difficult issues
that the world faces or stay away from them. It would be better by far
to engage with and confront the world’s problems, however
difficult, and to use our still considerable influence, working
bilaterally and through the international

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T20:22:55"></hs_TimeCode> would like to
turn my attention to the situation in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T20:23:17"></hs_TimeCode>. There are
currently around 2.7 million internally displaced people in the DRC.
Human rights violations against civilians, including sexual violence,
are commonplace. Malnutrition and outbreaks of disease are endemic.
However, we could be facing a more hopeful situation. There has been a
recent breakthrough in the end of the M23 rebellion and hopes for
conclusion of the Kampala talks give us a better chance of building
lasting stability in the DRC than has been seen in many years.

therefore urge the region’s leaders to return their focus to
implementing the UN-brokered peace, security and co-operation framework

the regions’ leaders to establish this quickly so that the
impetus and fragile gains are not lost. Of course, there is no quick
fix to resolving the conflict in eastern DRC. The DRC and its

a solution led by the African Union and the Economic Community of

launch of the preventing sexual violence initiative in 2012, which aims
to address crimes of sexual violence by increasing the number of
perpetrators brought to justice and to help states increase their
capacity to do this. At this stage the Central African Republic is not
a priority country for the PSVI but the international effort
to restore security in the country will help to start to address this

no doubt that the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic
of the Congo both face enormous challenges. The situation in the
Central African Republic is severe. The national transitional council
must work with the region and the international community to provide
security, protect civilians, provide humanitarian assistance and ensure
a return to constitutional government. In the DRC there are many
problems to overcome but the M23 rebellion has ended and a framework
for peace is in place. It will need the sustained commitment of the
region and the sustained support of the international community,
including the UK. With these elements in place I believe that real
progress can be made both there and in the Central African

In his remarks he pointed out—I would not say with
glee—that we had now completed our consideration of Clause 1 of

difference between that person being, for example, the parent or
guardian of a young person who is accused of being responsible for
anti-social behaviour and the responsible person being the local police
force, the local authority or the local probation service. It would be
useful to understand what the balance is expected to be between those

substance of the amendment is that before the court requires somebody
to be responsible for compliance, it must be satisfied that the
requirement itself is suitable and capable of being enforced, and it is
reasonable for the person charged with the responsibility of ensuring
that the requirements are met to take on that responsibility. But if we
consider the circumstances of a parent—an individual charged
with this responsibility—that may be onerous. If they are a
parent, they may feel obligated to take it on, but it may be
impractical. If the underlying problem is that the parent cannot
control their near-adult children, what is the point of this? Is it in
fact suitable, appropriate, and reasonable for that person to take on
that
responsibility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T20:36:02"></hs_TimeCode>?<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T20:36:11"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

to the station with another witness to report the crime. When they got
to the police station they were told that, unfortunately, the police
service does not have the capacity to take two witness statements at
once because of the number of officers on duty at the time. If that is
the situation, how confident can we be in the current financial
situation that the police service will have the resources to be
responsible for enforcing some of these requirements? If it is not the
police service it could be local authorities, which are facing
reductions in their budgets of 30% or 40%. Where will they find the

purpose of the amendment is to say that the court

am sure that the Minister will be able to help me with
something else. I have searched through the Bill and cannot find what

court? Does that mean that chief officers of police will be subject to
two years’ imprisonment because they have failed to achieve
compliance? What is the requirement? If there are no penalties for
failing to achieve compliance, what is the point of this? Again, I
would be grateful for the Minister to enlighten us as to precisely what
will happen in the event of the person who the court “must
designate”, in the words of the Bill, to ensure compliance if
they fail to do so either through wilful neglect, because they do not
have the resources to do so or perhaps because it is impossible to
enforce compliance because the individual is beyond those sorts of

that they are unable to quantify the costs, but the Minister in the
other place is saying that they will save money, so they should spend
the money in the first place. That does not seem to be a sensible way
to pursue legislation such as this.</hs_para>

am also curious to know whether any assessment has been made of the
impact that having to meet those costs will have on the imposition of
requirements. If a local authority or the police say that we cannot
afford to do X, Y or Z, or, if we could, we cannot afford to monitor
it, there is little point in imposing those requirements if there is no
funding to pay for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111838000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#13111838000106">It is
highly likely that one of the drivers for positive requirements will be
the costs involved. It is a bit of a Catch-22 situation if the
usefulness of the positive measures is limited by the available funding
and quality services to meet those needs. That could create a postcode
lottery, because the position could differ across areas of the country.
We all know that there are some vagaries in the criminal justice
system, but the position for somebody in Manchester could be completely
different from that for somebody in Basingstoke or Basildon, for
example. That causes enormous concern. If the needs of the person on
whom the requirement is being put are being met, that is fine, but the
danger is that those needs will not be met because the
funding is not available.</hs_para>

they should not introduce the injunction as indicated in the

annoyance could be helpful in certain circumstances; our objection is
that they are to be used in every circumstance. Our suggestion through
this amendment is to keep ASBOs on the statute book, leaving it to
local councils and police forces to decide what best suits their local
areas and needs. We would therefore not be reducing their options, as
the Government are currently doing, but seeking to extend them. The

because it is not an automatic criminal matter if it is breached. That
is what makes it weaker. It is quite right that there is a higher test
for bringing in an ASBO in the first place. It is not just a case of
annoyance or nuisance, but harassment, harm or distress and if an ASBO
is breached then it is automatically a criminal matter. It is not with

the noble Lord. I am sure that he would never give this House any cause
to accuse him of nuisance or annoyance and therefore breach his IPNA.
Actually, it would make a difference. If somebody breaches their IPNA
and it goes to the full conclusion of being taken to court and their
receiving a custodial sentence, the level at which they have breached
is very low. With an ASBO, there is a much higher threshold. In terms
of costs, my information is from the police, who say that it is a more
complex process to pursue breach of an IPNA than it is with the
automatic breach of an ASBO. We also see the number of breaches of
ASBOs, because of their seriousness, coming down. That is why the
police indicate to us that they think that there are significantly
greater costs in dealing with a breach of an

96 and in speaking to that amendment, the noble Baroness made no
mention of criminal behaviour orders. She sought—perhaps
accurately, in her eyes—to make a comparison between the IPNA
and the ASBO. The two are not meant to be the same or to deal with the
same problem in the same way. There is a suite of six provisions in the
Bill, which are all meant to deal with situations which the Anti-social
Behaviour Act has not managed to address. ASBOs are not an effective
power. I say from this Dispatch Box that they are becoming increasingly
less effective. Let us look at the published statistics: up to the end
of 2012, 58% of anti-social behaviour orders were breached at least
once and just over 43% were breached more than once. A staggering 68%
of ASBOs issued against under-18s have been breached. By any objective
measure, if an order has been around for more than 10 years and had
plenty of time to bed down but has such a high breach rate, that is not
evidence of success. I am surprised that the noble Baroness is so
wedded to the idea of maintaining it.</hs_para>

the root cause of the failure, it is that ASBOs can take months to
obtain. They fail because they leave victims exposed while being
obtained and because they do so little to address the offending
behaviour, so are we surprised that the number of ASBOs has declined
year on year since 2005? That is why we are abolishing the ASBO and the
failure that goes with it, and replacing it with more effective powers
in the IPNA and the CBO. By replacing the hotchpotch of 19 ineffective
and under-used anti-social behaviour powers with six new, flexible and
more effective ones, we will give front-line professionals that toolkit
which the noble Baroness sought in her speech. The new injunction will
replace anti-social behaviour orders on application, anti-social
behaviour injunctions, individual support orders and intervention
orders. As I said in earlier debates, the injunction under Part 1 is
modelled on anti-social behaviour injunctions which have been used
successfully by social landlords for over a decade. For more serious
cases, where a perpetrator has a criminal conviction, the criminal
behaviour order will be available. Like the injunction, it can be used
to impose prohibitions and requirements, but breach is a criminal
offence with accordingly tough
sanctions.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_18_PT_1/3355DBAE73E9DEEA3A3AB9E1DC5A4F4B7CB31F25" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 November 2013">Monday,

key part of both the injunction and the criminal behaviour order is the
ability to include positive requirements to address the underlying
causes of anti-social behaviour. Amendment 96 also seeks to keep
individual support orders but I am afraid that this is another story of
failure. Individual support orders have had little or no effect and
have hardly been used since their introduction in 2004. Only 9.2% of
ASBOs on application have had an individual support order attached to
them. I do not understand why the noble Baroness is so wedded to ASBOs
and their structure when she shares with me, I am sure, a desire to
reduce anti-social behaviour, provide effective methods of protecting
the public and, indeed, help perpetrators mend their ways.</hs_para>

crime. We do not want our new injunctions and orders to be seen as a

young people, but it will carry serious yet proportionate penalties if
it is breached. By moving away from focusing solely on enforcement and
getting agencies to work with young people, we can get these young
people’s lives back on track. Positive requirements, which are
absent at the moment, are integral to this move and to the Bill.
Front-line professionals not only know about them, they welcome them.
When applying for an injunction agencies will consider whether positive
requirements can help address the underlying drivers of the anti-social
behaviour. They will be better than individual support orders because

by the noble Lord, Lord Harris, relates to the court’s
consideration of these requirements. Clause 2 provides that before
including a requirement, the court must receive evidence about its
suitability and enforceability. With the utmost respect to the noble
Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, I believe that his amendment is
unnecessary. The court must not only receive the evidence, it must also
consider that evidence to satisfy itself that any proposed positive
requirements are suitable and enforceable before including them in the
injunction. In the case of adults it may be the local authority which
is named in the IPNA. There could be a range of persons: local youth
offending teams in the case of under-18s, or a voluntary organisation
providing counselling to deal with drug or alcohol dependency. There is
no penalty, I must reassure the noble Lord—I do not suppose that
he really thought for a moment that there would be—for failure
to deliver success if the respondent fails to comply with the positive
requirements; it is for the respondent to comply with the terms of the
injunction. The injunction is taken out against the person. It is also
up to the person who applied for the injunction to apply to the court
to vary the injunction, so there is a provision that if the injunction
turns out to be ineffective, or circumstances change, it is possible
for the nominated person to change its
provisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311197000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000004">Amendment

is essential that front-line professionals can tailor positive

welcomed the addition of positive requirements, recognising the need to

rather than focusing purely on enforcement. That is why the injunction
is a key plank in our reforms and why I welcome its introduction. The
police, local councils, social landlords and others will be able to use
it as a preventive tool to deal with emerging problems quickly and nip
them in the bud before they escalate. This is crucial because we know

arrangements for positive requirements will need to be made and funded
locally. It is therefore not appropriate or indeed possible for the
Secretary of State to set out in guidance how the positive requirements
will be funded. This will depend on the type of requirements identified
as necessary and where the provision of such requirements can come
from. That will be decided at local level, and I make no apology for
decisions being made locally. In a tough financial climate we would
expect councils and others to use their resources more effectively but,
as we set out in the published impact assessment, we would expect that
the majority of positive requirements would typically be a service that
was provided in any case. That being the case, the additional costs of
providing the actual requirement should not be significant. We would
also expect use to be made locally of the voluntary sector, which is
often best equipped to deal with specific and tailored information.

I asked what assessment had been made of the costs and quoted the

whether or not the imposition of positive requirements would be related
to the funds available. The Minister has said that these will be made
and funded locally, and that he makes no apologies for local government
deciding how they are funded. If there are additional costs on local
government, surely the Minister and the Government should have some

organisations, local authorities and voluntary organisations are
already participating in much of that activity which is designed to
help young people, or indeed older people, who are in difficulties.
Much of the voluntary sector is dealing with this work. The whole point
of the framework of the IPNA is that it provides a framework in which
groups such as this can operate effectively. We are certain that there
will be savings as well as additional costs in the reduction of
anti-social behaviour that is

that the average cost of prosecution for breach of an ASBO was around
£1,500. So, if the figure for pursuing a breach of Part 1 is
correct, it will be no more expensive. In addition, the new injunction
will be quicker to obtain than a stand-alone ASBO. The National Audit
Office found the average cost of obtaining a stand-alone ASBO was about
£3,100, compared with a cost of £1,600 for one of the
existing injunctions which, like the new injunction, uses the civil
standard of proof. The lower test and lower standard of proof will

Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> My Lords, I assume that the noble Lord
has finished. I found the reply that the Minister gave rather
disturbing as regards the issues it covered and did not cover. He spent
the first half of his remarks talking about Amendment 96. We have yet
to hear the reason why it is necessary to repeal all the ASBO
provisions in advance of bringing in the arrangements for the new
injunctions. That is quite an important point. The Minister supports a
Government who I think believe in free-market principles. If the ASBO
and the procedures around it are so inadequate, do not work and are so
costly, what is to be lost by allowing both to coexist, at least for a
period, until we see how the new regime works? In practice,
people—local authorities, housing bodies or
whatever—might vote with their feet and decide whether to use
the IPNA route or the ASBO route. That would be consistent both with
the Government’s principles about a free market and with their
localism principle, and would also allow a bit of reality to creep into
this—which would be unique for this Government and probably for
all previous Governments. People would discover which system works by
looking at the arrangements that people followed at a local level. The
Government need to explain why it is not possible for the two systems
to coexist so that we can see which ones work and which ones do

anti-social behaviour and in our view the measures that currently exist
do not meet the requirement that we as a Government want to present as
a remedy for anti-social behaviour. That is why we do not support the
retention of the ASBOs. They are expensive, not effective in reducing
anti-social behaviour and not effective in providing a remedial pattern
of behaviour for young people who get into trouble. We want to ditch

doubts that the Minister and the Government are keen to tackle issues
about anti-social behaviour, as indeed were the previous Government,
and as I suspect has been the case for very many years. Nobody is
pretending that ASBOs are perfect or that they solve the deep-seated,
underlying difficulties of anti-social behaviour. However, we are
saying that these new arrangements are untried. We simply do not know
whether they will work or whether they will be better. If they are so
much better, as the Minister assures us they will be, then if the two
coexisted on the statute book, people all over the country, when
dealing with cases of anti-social behaviour, would opt for the noble
Lord’s system as opposed to this dreadful, outdated system that
he is apparently now so keen to scrap. However, if—just
if—it turns out that under certain circumstances the ASBO route
might have been better, that will no longer be available. I fail to
understand what is lost by leaving in place the existing arrangements,
at least for a period, to see how things work out in
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:18:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311197000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000020">I
turn to what the noble Lord calls the “positive” elements
of the arrangements. These will not be cost-free. Ensuring compliance
will involve costs. If an individual is involved—and some will
relate to individuals—it will involve costs in terms of that
person’s time and maybe their expenditure. If it involves an
agency, such as a local authority, which is required to provide
particular opportunities for individuals concerned, there will be the
cost of providing those opportunities. There has to be transparency as
to what those costs are going to be and how it is going to be
delivered. If there is not—given that local authorities are
facing very significant reductions in their budgets and the voluntary
sector is facing a crisis in its funding, in many instances, or in the
demand on its services—there is a real risk that the Government
are creating these new injunction-based powers but setting them up to
fail. I believe the Minister and the Government actually want to do
something positive about anti-social behaviour, so I think it unwise to
be setting up arrangements, and setting them up to fail, without
addressing the question of how the funding is to be taken

Flight (Con):</Member></B>
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:20:00"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I have
tabled this amendment in support in particular of Westminster
Council—my wife is a councillor there—but it has been
supported on a cross-party basis by the other main city councils of
Birmingham, Manchester, Nottingham and Southampton. I suggest that they
cannot all be wrong in believing that there is an issue here. These
major city councils have the quite demanding job of keeping public
places free of nuisance for both residents and tourists, particularly
in their city centres. Westminster has self-evidently the particular
issue of a huge tourist presence in, effectively, most of the key
places in London’s city centre.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1311197000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000026">This is not my natural
territory. It has taken quite a lot of effort to get my mind round
fairly obscure, and certainly complicated, legal issues. If I make the
odd technical error, please accept my apology. This amendment is
largely about the problem of persistent and aggressive begging in city
centres. This has been an area where the ASBO has worked reasonably
well. Local authorities can address the problem by applying for ASBOs;
they can be obtained without the individuals involved having a criminal
record, but when the ASBO is breached a criminal offence is committed
and the local authority can have offenders arrested and
prosecuted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:24:56"></hs_TimeCode>.
Certainly, not only the politicians at Westminster but Westminster City
Council staff believe that the present arrangements have worked pretty
well in dealing with the problem of inner-city aggressive
begging<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:25:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311197000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000027">The
first argument<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:25:19"></hs_TimeCode>
is, to put it simply, “If it ain’t broke, don’t
fix it”. It is a difficult area. Under this Bill, as we know,
ASBOs are to be replaced by IPNAs, 
<?notus-xml column=826?>but a breach of an IPNA is no longer an automatically arrestable
offence. Local authorities can apply for an IPNA, but they would have
to take evidence of a breach to court and apply separately for an
arrest warrant relative to cases of persistent begging. This is not
only hugely bureaucratic and cumbersome but simply would not work,
because the offenders invariably have no fixed address; by the time the
subsequent power of arrest were granted, it would be useless, because
they would not be able to find the
offenders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:26:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
Concerns have been raised about the provisions in the Bill for this
problem by Westminster council with Jeremy Browne, who was the
Minister, and now with Norman Baker, but there have not been any
meetings or no direct response has been received. Concerns have also
been raised in the other place by Westminster’s MP, Mark
Field.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311197000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000028">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:26:44"></hs_TimeCode>

deal with lower threshold
offences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:27:23"></hs_TimeCode> and to
operate as a pre-emptive tool, so they do not want them to have
beefed-up powers attaching to them across the board. My two comments
are that IPNAs already are to have powers of automatic arrest for
violent or a threat of violent behaviour, so the principle has already
been breached. Secondly, my amendment does not give beefed-up powers
across the board but only under special conditions of intentional or
persistent and deliberate anti-social behaviour, which is what
persistent and aggressive begging
constitutes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:28:15"></hs_TimeCode>.
Norman Baker’s stated objection to the stance of the main city
councils was that what is proposed is a power of arrest to every
injunction, but that is not correct; it is a quite specific
power<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:28:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311197000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000030">The
Government’s main argument and objection to this amendment is
that it is not needed as the Bill contains new powers that can deal
with the problem of aggressive begging and, in particular, the two
powers of the CPN and the public spaces protection order—and, I
might add, in extremis the dispersal power under which police can clear
an area of undesirable people. If a community protection
notice’s warning is first issued and then breached, a CPN can
then be issued whereby, if it is breached, police can have an automatic
power of arrest. But the key is the additional stage prior to issuing a
CPN, when the relevant offending individual or group has to be issued
with a written warning

likely to decrease the ability of local authorities to respond promptly
to these problems. If the requirement for the written prior notice of
offending behaviour were removed, my understanding is that local
authorities would be perfectly happy to use CPNs to address this issue.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> is also

Government argue that it would be easy to give prior written notices
and that a council such as Westminster could have a fleet of street
officers who would have preordained notice chits, rather like parking
tickets. They could be given out as and when appropriate, according to
the particular unacceptable conduct. If no notice were taken of such
warning notices, the council could then issue the CPN. Even after that,
if the CPN were breached, it could go straight for a police arrest
warrant, as a criminal offence would have been committed. The
Government think that this has an advantage over the present ASBO
arrangements because you can go straight for the arrest warrant,
whereas, under the ASBO arrangements, the local authority has to apply
to the court for an arrest warrant. Both Westminster and other councils
take that point to some extent, but they still argue that, with the
problem of persistent beggars, adding this additional warning notice
stage will undermine the ability to deal with them. Persistent beggars
are transient by nature and you cannot envisage local authorities
employing huge flocks of people to chase persistent beggars all over
their city

second new instrument is the public spaces protection order which can
be used as a preventive tool. This designates unacceptable activities,
which include persistent begging, that are likely to have detrimental
effects on citizens. It covers a particular site, and, if breached, a
notice must inform offenders of their offence. Only thereafter can
offending individuals be arrested—if they breach the public
spaces protection order and their warning notice. My understanding is
that, at that stage, an on-the-spot fine could also be applied, both as
a deterrent and because the public spaces protection order had been
breached. The Government argue that, in a city centre such as
Westminster, the authority could designate all areas which are
patronised by tourists as public spaces protection order areas. They
could then employ street wardens to police the relevant areas, who
would be equipped with notices to give out in cases of offending
behaviour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:33:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

authorities such as Westminster, is that they would have to have
substantial additional resources to police the relevant designated
spaces and to monitor the offenders. As has already been stated, they,
like every other local authority, are facing substantial cuts in their
budget. It would cost councils a considerable additional amount to
operate and to work this designation, and it would also need police to
buy in. In London, anti-social behaviour is not considered by the
police to have any priority, for fairly obvious reasons.</hs_para>

Government are not willing to agree to this amendment or to consider a
similar amendment of their own, I think that they have the burden of
convincing the main cities, and not just Westminster, that the CPN
powers in particular, supported by public spaces protection orders, are
as good as or better than the existing ASBO powers and the alternative
of similar IPNA powers, as the amendment seeks to 
<?notus-xml column=828?>provide. The Home Office has advised that it has taken up the issue with
the Local Government Association safer communities board, which is
fairly satisfied with the new provisions. However, my understanding is
that that is not the case with the major cities, which have the

central London, and in my time I have certainly given many ASBOs for
persistent and aggressive begging. When I sit, it is relatively
commonplace to have an ASBO application from Westminster City Council,
and it is something that magistrates are experienced at dealing with.
As I said at Second Reading, in my experience, magistrates are more
sceptical about granting ASBOs than they were when they were first

one changes that structure. Therefore, I think that it is incumbent on
the Minister to explain why he thinks that the new measures he proposes
to introduce will work more effectively and potentially reduce those
costs. As I said, certainly from the point of view of magistrates
administering this, it is a relatively well oiled machine, and we take

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very pleased to have
the chance to talk about this issue because I am concerned that
Westminster City Council, a flagship council, has expressed anxieties.
I reassure my noble friend Lady Hamwee that the letter has gone to
Councillor Nickie Aiken from my honourable friend Norman Baker, who was
the Minister responsible for crime prevention and was the lead on this
Bill in the Commons. I have met with my noble friend Lord Flight. I
hope that we had a very productive discussion. Much of the information
that he has been able to give came out of that meeting on Friday. It is
now Monday and things have moved in a rather compressed way.</hs_para>

will conclude my remarks in saying what I intend to do but, first, I
should express that we are aware of the problems of persistent and
aggressive begging with which a number of councils are faced. I attend
the meetings of the safer communities board of the LGA fairly regularly
nowadays because I enjoy them and find them very useful. When I went, I
think that I was able to explain to those gathered, who included the
leader of Bradford City Council—a large city—that the
measures provide a portfolio of remedies to deal with this sort of
circumstance. The criticism from Westminster City Council came to me
rather out of the
blue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311197000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000051">However,
the Government appreciate those concerns and acknowledge the impact
that aggressive begging can have on individuals, businesses and
communities. I am aware that Westminster is working with its partners
to do what it can to tackle the problem. I think that noble Lords will
realise that it is extensive. Westminster has expressed its concerns.
It is important that councils, the police and others work together on
all these matters, which is one of the underlying themes behind this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:47:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Friday I met my noble friend Lord Flight. It seems that the concerns
about the 
<?notus-xml column=831?>injunction to prevent nuisance and annoyance stem from its differences
from the ASBO with regard to powers of arrest. The breach of an ASBO is
of course a criminal offence and, as such, someone can be arrested
simply for a breach. In contrast, the new injunction is a purely civil
measure with civil penalties for a breach. Consequently, we do not
consider it appropriate or proportionate for it to have an automatic
power of arrest. As such, we have limited the court’s ability to
attach a power of arrest to the most serious cases; that is, cases
where a perpetrator has been violent or has threatened violence, or if
there is a significant risk of harm to another
person.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311197000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000053">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:48:42"></hs_TimeCode>
understand the intention of my noble friend’s amendment and I am
sympathetic to local councils’ concerns. He has mentioned other
councils and I accept that others may have notified him of their
concern. However, I should like to make two points. First, the effect
of the amendment may not actually achieve its aim and, secondly and
more importantly—we can change the amendment but it is a
question of how the Bill operates—there are more appropriate
powers that could be used as provided for in this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311197000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000054"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:49:22"></hs_TimeCode>The

behaviour”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="1311197000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000135">As
has been mentioned by my noble friend Lady Hamwee, this is rather a
broad brush. These words insert subjective elements that raise
evidential thresholds for enforcement agencies and the courts. The
courts would have to consider the state of mind of the perpetrator in
ensuring that the power of arrest has been used lawfully. Before
arresting an individual under the amendment, the police would need to
satisfy themselves that the perpetrator had deliberately or
intentionally committed anti-social behaviour. That may look easy to do
on the face of it but may be different in practice. For example, it has
been suggested that some of the foreign nationals who beg aggressively
are coerced into these activities by organised crime gangs. My noble
friend Lady Hamwee referred to that too. This is rather different from
the current situation with the breach of an ASBO where there is no
subjective element. That is why we say this amendment may not help
councils in practice in the way that they hope.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="1311197000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000055">However, there is a more
fundamental reason why I believe the amendment is not necessary. I can
understand why councils have focused on the injunction. It is, on paper
at least, the direct replacement for the ASBO on application. However,
it seems what the councils actually want are swift, efficient and
cost-effective powers to prevent anti-social behaviour, supported by
meaningful punishments. As I indicated earlier, as did my noble friend,
such powers are in this Bill. The community protection notice under
Part 4—which we will being coming to, I hope, soon—is
intended to deal with particular ongoing problems or nuisances which
negatively affect the community’s quality of life. The notice
could be used to direct an individual to stop causing the problem and
can, if necessary, be served on the spot. While a written warning is
required, depending on the behaviour in question, it would not be
necessary to wait too long before the actual notice was issued. It
could almost be done immediately where appropriate and
necessary.</hs_para>

to stop a specified action or wider behaviour, such as aggressive
begging. It will then be available to councils as well as the police to
ensure either agency was able to deal with the problem there and then.
Breach of any requirement in the notice—for instance, failing to
cease begging in a certain area—will be a criminal offence,
subject to a fixed penalty notice or prosecution. Critically, a person
may be arrested on suspicion of a breach. On conviction an individual
would be liable to a fine of up to £2,500. That to my mind is a
significant punishment.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1311197000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000057">Alternatively, where a
persistent problem is detrimental to the local community’s
quality of life, the public spaces protection order could be used by
the council to impose restrictions. For instance, in areas where
aggressive begging is a problem, a blanket ban could be imposed on it,
ensuring that the council or police can act quickly when it occurs. In
addition, the order can be used preventively, so if the council
reasonably believed that the problem would simply move to another
location—which is a real problem—it could use the new
order there too. Local authorities would need to consult the police and
other interested parties before seeking to impose an order, but the
decision to use the new power would be theirs. It would be vested in
local authorities. Again, breach of the order would be a criminal
offence, subject to a fixed penalty notice or prosecution. Here again,
a person could be arrested on suspicion of a breach. On conviction the
offender could face a fine of up to
£1,000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311197000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000058">My
noble friend mentioned the dispersal power under Part 3, which may be
useful to deal with individuals or groups causing problems by allowing
the police to move them on immediately and away from the area where
they habitually operate, for up to 48 hours. We will talk about how
dispersal orders operate when we come to consider relevant amendments.

Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> My Lords, I suppose that we should
congratulate the Minister on now having dealt with three of the 161
clauses during the course of today. The amendment addresses one of the
most extraordinary absences from the Bill, which is that there is no
mention, as far as I can see, of the role of police and crime
commissioners—or, in London, the Mayor’s Office for
Policing and Crime. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, earlier raised the
issue of police and crime commissioners with the interesting suggestion
that they might want to fund youth services to address issues of
anti-social behaviour by
juveniles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:58:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311197000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000065">Clearly,
the role of police and crime commissioners in terms of addressing
issues around anti-social behaviour should be central to the
Government’s philosophy. These are the individuals who will be
holding the police to account and doing so much to reduce the volume of
crime and so on within their areas. So it is surprising that there is
no mention of police and crime commissioners in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:59:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

our earlier debates, the Minister talked about the tough financial
climate in which all the agencies involved are operating and the
importance of using resources wisely. That is why I put forward the
amendment, which provides that there should be a proper, local

area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T21:59:33"></hs_TimeCode>. That
should outline the approach that should be taken by the police service
and local authorities in that area, and by other agencies that might be
involved in reducing anti-social behaviour. That is so important
because we all recognise that this is not an issue for which there is
one magic bullet. There is no magic bullet associated with anti-social
behaviour orders or with the new injunctions. There has to be a suite
of measures, a series of actions taken at different levels by different
organisations, to reduce the level of anti-social behaviour in a
community.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1311197000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000162">10

those who try to deal with anti-social behaviour and to enable those

behaviour. For example, some problems of anti-social behaviour on a
particular estate could be usefully addressed by the use of the
injunctions set out in the Bill. Some might be usefully addressed by
other measures that the local authority might put in place. Some might
be about the provision of support services or services targeted at
individuals that could help reduce anti-social behaviour. They might
not be of a nature that would be a condition associated with an
injunction on an individual, but one of more general facilities

behaviour is consistently cited as one of the top policing and crime
objectives in local force areas. Out of 41 police and crime
commissioners, 30 put tackling, preventing and reducing anti-social
behaviour among their key priorities in their individual plans. Eight
PCCs put reducing the impact of, and keeping people safe from,
anti-social behaviour as among their individual priorities, and three
further plans clearly set out to encourage the reporting of anti-social
behaviour. Therefore, all police and crime plans make reference to
anti-social

should Parliament require them to publish a local anti-social behaviour

Government are serious about tackling anti-social behaviour and so are
elected police and crime commissioners, as evidenced by the figures

police and their partner agencies putting the needs of victims first.
This means giving the right powers to do this. I have said already that
the new injunction is one of the key planks in our reforms. Agencies

told somewhere—that police and crime panels are doing a good and
valuable job in terms of monitoring the activities of police and crime
commissioners, but they are not part of the consultative mechanism.

local authorities in their

anti-social behaviour, one needs to work with the local authorities and

understand what a new strategy document for the whole county, taking
lots of resources in drawing it up, will add to anything in a place

relevance of this is that each of the local authorities in the area

the Environment Agency and its Welsh equivalent, the Natural Resources
Body for Wales, are on the list in Clause 4(1). I will talk about the
Environment Agency, which is the one I know most about. Surely the
whole question of anti-social behaviour is essentially local while the
Environment Agency is a national body, organised regionally. If, within
the purpose of the new injunction system, guidance will be given to
people to regard injunctions as the last resort and start with local
preventive measures such as teams on the ground, working directly with
adults and children who are engaging in anti-social behaviour, I do not
understand what resources the Environment Agency will have for that
work.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311197000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000091">If
injunctions are to have positive requirements attached to them then, as

have a role to play in working with other authorities but I do not
understand why it requires the ability to apply for injunctions itself,

friend’s amendment, which would see the Environment Agency and
its Welsh equivalent removed from the list of bodies that can apply for
the new injunction. As my noble friend may or may not know, the
Environment Agency has been able to apply for anti-social behaviour
orders since 2006. Alongside Transport for London, this was done by an
order under Section 1A of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Noble Lords
might not be aware of that provision, as it does not appear on the face
of that legislation but was done under an order.</hs_para>

has not used the anti-social behaviour order often but we believe that
it should retain access to its replacement so that, as a national body,
it can take fast and effective action to tackle serious environmental
anti-social behaviour, rather than relying on the police or council. On
Report in the House of Commons the list was extended to include the
Natural Resources Body for Wales, to give the Environment
Agency’s sister body similar access to the injunction. The
Natural Resources Body for Wales manages some 6% of Wales’s land
area, including many woodland visitor attractions and nature reserves.
As such, it should be able to apply for an injunction when someone
decides to act anti-socially on that

land that it owns, or jumps in a river when they should not. However, I
thought that the whole basis of the Bill was that injunctions are not
to be a weapon of first resort but a weapon of last resort. 
<?notus-xml column=840?>I asked what resources the Environment Agency would have to
carry out preventive work and management of potential injunctees, if
that is what they are called—potential respondents. I did not
get an answer. I asked what resources the Environment Agency might have

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I think I can move this
amendment fairly briefly. It concerns applications made for the issue
of an arrest warrant for the breach of an IPNA. One of the things that
strike us when we look through the clauses is that there is no
timescale from the time when the application is made for an arrest
warrant to when it would be issued or the application
rejected—the Bill is completely silent on that issue. My
attention was drawn to this by the report of the Home Affairs Select
Committee, when it reported on delays in county courts,
saying:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1311197000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000153">“We
heard that this was likely to severely slow down the process for
dealing with ASB”,</hs_quote>

how concerned it was. Local authorities have also expressed concern
about delays in the county court system. In Clause 9(2), it seems that
most of the applications would be to a county court; the only time it
would go to a magistrates’ court would be if it was a youth
court that had granted the IPNA. In other cases it would be a county
court, and in some cases the High Court.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T22:26:23"></hs_TimeCode> there were
delays in the county court system, that would be a serious blow to the
idea of moving swiftly—one of the major reasons that the
Minister has given for having IPNAs rather than anti-social behaviour
orders—in the introduction of these new
injunctions.</hs_parafo>

is another point that is not covered by the amendment but is also
relevant to this. All the legislation should be subject to
post-legislative review after five years. That seems quite a lengthy
time on an issue like this where, if there is a problem, it will have
to be dealt with much more quickly than waiting five years to see if
there is in fact a problem. With issues of anti-social behaviour rising
so high in public concern—and indeed in the Government’s
concern, given the Bill before us—it would not be reasonable if
we passed legislation but were then not able to enact it because of the
delays that are currently being seen in the county courts.</hs_para>

Government make an assessment of, and issue guidance on, how long it
should take for a county court, from the moment it gets an application
for an arrest warrant for a breach of an IPNA, to when that court has
to make a decision. If the Government could issue that beforehand, that
obviously would speed up justice, which I understand is the purpose of
this measure. That fairly briefly sums up and describes why we are
putting the amendment forward. I beg to

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, I have Amendment 21C in this
group. It is extraordinarily inelegantly drafted, but I hope that the
Minister is aware of my concerns that lie behind it. Where a respondent
has certain requirements imposed on him as part of the IPNA and these
have rehabilitative or therapeutic aspects—indeed, in many cases
one would hope that they did—the further proceedings should not
be taken in such a way as to prejudice the benefit of those
requirements. My straightforward question—I was going to say
“simple” question, but it might not be quite that
simple—is to ask for some assurance from the Minister that will
help to allay that

whether or not to grant applications for arrest warrants in cases where

the time of its issue but was sought subsequently, when the breach has

are not introducing a new and untested power under Clause 9. The courts
are used to handling applications for arrest warrants: for anti-social
behaviour injunctions on which the IPNA is modelled and gang
injunctions, as well as other injunctions. We should therefore bear in
mind that the courts are already 
<?notus-xml column=842?>experienced in handling applications for arrest warrants and dealing

the importance of swift action—indeed that is one of the reasons

noble friend Lady Hamwee has also tabled an amendment to the provisions
on powers of arrest. The purpose of Amendment 21C is to prevent an
arrest warrant being issued against someone who breaches a requirement
in their injunction. They would only be able to be brought before the
court to answer the breach of a prohibition in the order. With respect
to my noble friend, I do not agree with that. Whether a term in an
injunction is a prohibition or a requirement, they form part of an
order of the court. They must be complied with. The requirement to do
something about the cause of your anti-social behaviour is as important
as the prohibition to stop it. The courts must have the power to
enforce them both. If a person is not forced to do something about
their behaviour by complying with a positive requirement, it is likely
that they will eventually breach the order and cause further problems.
That has been the problem with anti-social behaviour
orders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T22:32:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311197000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000110">As
my noble friend points out, this is different from the approach we have
taken in Clause 3. At the time an injunction is made, a power of arrest
can only be attached to a prohibition and not to a positive
requirement. The reason for this distinction is that the test under
Clause 3 is, rightly, a high one. A power of arrest can only be
attached where there is a threat of violence or harm. It is difficult
to see how this test could be met by breaching a positive requirement.
However, the provisions in Clause 9 for obtaining an arrest warrant do
not include such a high test because here the focus is on enforcing the
injunction, not on preventing an immediate risk of violence or
harm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311197000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000111">On the

Beecham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister has not addressed
the thrust of my noble friend’s amendment, in terms of the
potential for delay. This is an area where, by definition, the quicker
one proceeds to a resolution of the matter, the better. There are some
constraints in the way the court system currently works which make that
rather more difficult. A number of proposed court closures have
affected both county courts and magistrates’ courts. I assume
that these breaches would be basically dealt with in the county courts,
but there have been closures there as well. Do the Government have any
indication of how long it will take to secure these injunctions, in the
light of that development and the general pressure on the court
system?</hs_para>

is not necessarily the case that a matter can be easily resolved at a
first hearing. There is also the question of the operation of legal aid
under the rather restricted system we now have. One assumes, and 
<?notus-xml column=843?>perhaps the Minister can confirm this, that legal aid would be available
for those who qualify, on financial grounds, to defend an application
for an injunction. There seems to be a potential for an undesirable
delay, which may or may not be necessary. The thrust of my noble
friend’s amendment is that the Government should endeavour to
begin properly and assess the likely timescales and the likelihood of
delays and then to give guidance to ensure that, where necessary, the
relevant resources can be made available. Could the noble Lord deal

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Lord. He did
not fully address a couple of questions in the points that I made. One
of the issues was about delays in county courts. I did not say that
county courts were facing delays—that came from local
government, the police and the Home Affairs Select Committee in the
other place. The other point I raised was that, if he is not prepared
to consider guidance prior to this being introduced to ensure that
county courts are able to deal with these matters in a timely way, will
he agree to consider and bring back to your Lordships’ House at
Report a statement on whether, rather than having guidance beforehand,
it is possible to truncate the normal five-year review period to see
whether it is working? This issue should be reviewed after one year to
see whether there are delays in the county court system which slow down
the process of justice, or whether, as the Minister said, everything is
working fine and there is no problem.</hs_para>

delays at the moment are occurring for a number of reasons—they
are under pressure to reduce staffing in county courts, and my noble
friend Lord Beecham also raised some of the issues. I also understand
that there are more litigants in person because of the reduction of
eligibility for civil legal aid. Both those issues add to the delays in
the system. We do not need to have a process whereby people suffer
anti-social behaviour when someone has breached their IPNA and then
there is a lengthy delay while they wait for the courts to assess
whether an arrest warrant can be issued. Therefore, if the Minister
rejects out of hand the issue of guidance beforehand, will he agree to

there have been any consultations with the judiciary about this aspect.
I assume that that may have been the case. Presumably the judiciary
will have 
<?notus-xml column=844?>a view on the imposition of a new burden on it. We talked about the new
burdens doctrine earlier this evening as regards the costs of some of
the proposals in the Bill on local government and whether they will be
met. From a local government perspective I cannot say that I was very
thrilled with the Minister’s response to that; he seemed rather
to ignore it. However, this is a different sort of new
burden—one placed on the courts system. That being the case, one
would have imagined that this would have been discussed with the
judiciary at some level. Has the noble Lord any knowledge of such

but I do want to raise at this point whether Schedule 2 should stand
part of the Bill. The Minister is aware of the particular concern that
I have, which is that the schedule provides for sanctions in the event
of a breach of the injunction. My concern is about the sanction
applicable to children—the sanction of imprisonment. Children
who breach an IPNA can be given a supervision order or, if they are
over 14, up to three months’ detention. I do not think that the
Minister will be surprised at concern as to whether such a sanction is
proportionate, productive, and compatible with children’s
rights, for reasons of which the Committee will be very well
aware.</hs_para>

in the case of children is something that many noble Lords are
concerned about—whether it is not only not effective but also
particularly harmful for children. I am not aware of evidence that
imprisonment for breaching an ASBO acts as a deterrent for children
committing anti-social behaviour. We are all aware of the potential
harm for children’s development and the impact on their
rehabilitation. We all know stories about fast-tracking children into
the criminal justice system by dealing with them inappropriately at a
very early stage in what may or may not—one hopes
not—turn out to be a criminal career. Only the most serious
crimes committed by children lead to custodial sentences. The IPNA is,
of course, a civil measure, and detention is a very disproportionate

an important point about the justification of detaining under-18

important to remember that, although the test for an injunction is the
civil standard of proof, in the event of the breach of the test what
applies will be the criminal standards of proof—beyond
reasonable doubt. The court must also consider whether the young person
has a reasonable excuse for breaching the injunction. Only a young
person over the age of 14 can be detained and for not more than three
months. Currently, under the anti-social behaviour regime, a young
person can be detained for up to two years. It is also important to say
that detention can be used only as a very last
resort,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1311197000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-0003.htm#1311197000157">“where

when the breach is established, it will be a civil contempt of court.
This means that a young person will not be saddled with a criminal
record, unlike with the breach of the anti-social behaviour order. We
have also said in draft guidance that informal approaches should be
used in most cases involving young people. When agencies believe that a
more formal intervention is necessary, the courts must have the power
to deal with young people who have not responded to the informal
approaches or who wilfully ignore the terms of their

Tyler of Enfield (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to propose that
Clause 76 should not stand part of the Bill. I have considerable
concerns about the clause as it stands and wish to probe the
Government’s thinking. In technical terms, Clause 76 removes
Section 11 of the Childcare Act 2006, which places a statutory duty on
local authorities in England to assess the sufficiency of childcare.
Section 11 supports the Section 6 Childcare Act duty on local
authorities to provide sufficient childcare for working parents as far
as is reasonably
practical<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T15:31:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000008">I
am aware that the Government’s view of this is that the
childcare sufficiency assessment is simply a bureaucratic burden which
can be removed with no drawbacks and, indeed, that this would allow
local authorities to spend more time on securing sufficient
childcare provision. I do not think it is that straightforward. The
assessment was not introduced simply as a bureaucratic process designed
to divert time and resources; it had a 
<?notus-xml column=296?>clear purpose. In practice, Section 11 sufficiency assessments are the
mechanism through which local authorities meet, and are held
accountable for, the Section 6 sufficiency duty. My key concern is that
repealing Section 11 and the associated regulations without an
effective replacement will effectively revoke the Childcare Act
sufficiency duty
altogether<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T15:32:39"></hs_TimeCode> in
many
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000009">Would
not a better solution to concerns about excessive prescription in the
Section 11 regulations be to maintain the Section 11 duty itself but to
simplify or revise the regulations? Evidence suggests that statutory
guidance is not likely to be an effective alternative to a duty in
primary legislation if it leads to a duty having a lower financial
priority or not happening at all. On top of this, the Government have
reduced statutory guidance on the sufficiency duty from 70 pages to a
single page—you could say that is going from the sublime to the
ridiculous—which removes important guidance on what is meant by
sufficient childcare. There are concerns that this will lead to
lower-quality
assessments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T15:33:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000010">We
all know that there are substantial gaps in access to high-quality
affordable childcare. For example, just one-fifth of local authorities
believe that there is sufficient childcare in their area for the
under-twos. In particular, there is a chronic shortage of high-quality
places in disadvantaged areas, for parents working atypical hours,
often on low incomes, and for children with additional needs. We all
know how this undermines what I think we all want to do in terms of
promoting social mobility and reducing education inequalities.
Therefore, it remains my contention that an effective Childcare Act
sufficiency duty remains an important tool in social policy. Of course,
I accept that some assessments do not assess sufficiency robustly or
reliably, not least because every local authority ends up having to
reinvent the wheel. Tellingly, the consultation on removing the Section
11 duty did not show support for removing Section 11 itself as distinct
from the outdated regulations. This is where the nub of the problem,
and my concerns, lie. Crucially, in their responses, 60 local
authorities explicitly requested more detailed guidance on sufficiency
assessments than the Government had provided. Surely some publication
of good-practice guidance to support local authorities in developing
their assessments and their action plans would be
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000011">If
this clause remains in the Bill, local authorities will be obliged to
provide only an annual report on levels of local childcare to elected
members. I am not convinced that this more light-touch approach will
provide the same level of incentive for local authority investment in
ongoing support, and indeed challenge, from early-years teams, which
currently work to ensure that childcare provision is not only
sufficient but of high quality. I think we all consider that to be very

March 2013 the National Children’s Bureau—of which I am

removal of the duty to carry out childcare sufficiency assessments.
Only 20% of respondents 
<?notus-xml column=297?>were confident that their local authority would be able to secure
sufficient childcare if the local authority duty to carry

conclusion, looking at the big picture, local authorities in England
receive £3 billion to £4 billion of early-years funding
annually. Public investment on this scale should be matched by a
legislative framework to guide effective investment and ensure
accountability. Like other noble Lords present, I was actively involved
in the Care Bill currently before Parliament. The Care Bill was
introduced with a new sufficiency duty for adult social care, modelled
on the Childcare Act, including a duty in primary legislation to
understand the supply and demand of services. It is
difficult—even a little odd—to explain the removal the
same duty in early-years provision at exactly the same time. I beg to

noble Baroness, Lady Tyler, said, Clause 76 would repeal the duty of
local authorities, under Section 11 of the Childcare Act, to
undertake and publish regular assessments of the sufficiency of
childcare in their area. In so doing—I entirely agree
with the noble Baroness —it would effectively neutralise the
general duty, under Section 6, to ensure sufficient childcare for
working
parents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000016">The
Government carried out a very inadequate consultation on this proposal,
and produced findings which can be described, at best, as one-sided.
Contrary to the Government’s claim, the consultation did not
show support for removing the Section 11 duty, but rather for the need
for revised guidance and a real effort by the Government to help all
local authorities implement that duty as well as the best authorities
are already doing. I agree that some action is necessary: where
practice is variable; where there are shortages of childcare, as in
many areas; and in relation to specific needs, for example parents who
work unsocial hours or have disabled children,</hs_para>

role of local authorities in driving up supply and continuous
improvement in childcare is important. While some local authorities are
doing it very well, they use different definitions and different
methodologies, and many have poor action plans. As the noble Baroness
said, this could and should be addressed, not by repealing the duty to
assess sufficiency, but by providing guidance, developing a consistent
measure of childcare demand, and a framework model for the action plans
that need to come through—something the five-year review of the
Childcare Act in 2009 showed was necessary. The Government may say they
have revised the guidance, but they have not changed it in a way that
addresses any of those issues. They have reduced 70 pages of 
<?notus-xml column=298?>guidance—and there is an argument that that is far too long, and
practice shows it is the case—to less than two pages of sketchy,
top-level, vague requirements, sending a clear message to local
authorities that this duty does not matter to the Government any
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000018">I think
it is worth reminding ourselves of why the Childcare Act 2006
substantially strengthened the duties of local authorities to ensure
sufficiency of childcare: first, to stimulate the local market to
increase the supply of good-quality childcare; secondly, to enable
working parents and those aspiring to work to access childcare; and,
thirdly, through that to support economic growth in those
areas—something that is very much to the fore now. Indeed, there
is a very strong business case for seeing childcare not only as
important for child development and parental choice but as an
increasingly essential part of the infrastructure to support people
getting into work, which was never more important than now, when many
families are suffering the brunt of the
recession.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000019">The
Family and Childcare Trust has undertaken detailed analysis of local
authority performance under the sufficiency duty. It shows that some
have done well, suggesting that the problem is not fundamentally one of
legislation but of good practice and the level of capability of
individual authorities. Repealing that duty under Clause 76 will drive
a coach and horses through the sufficiency duty itself, as the position
in Scotland has demonstrated. There, there is no duty—just
statutory guidance, similar to what the Government now propose for
England. A third of Scottish authorities do not collect adequate data,
and Scotland has only half the proportion of private and voluntary
providers because local authorities do not do the work to stimulate the
market and promote new childcare providers in the way that the best
English local authorities have done. A much better alternative would be
to replace the three-year assessment with an annual assessment, to
simplify the guidance and to include frameworks for consistent supply
and demand measures, to require local authorities to produce an action
plan and to monitor local authority performance against
those plans.</hs_para>

perhaps the Minister will explain why the Government are effectively
neutralising the sufficiency duty in childcare while at the same time
bringing in a new sufficiency duty in the Care Bill in respect of local
authorities’ duties to ensure that there is sufficient adult
care in their area. That seems a contradiction; I wonder why it
exists.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000021">Government
Amendment 240R is extremely important in its potential ramifications.
It introduces, at a very late stage in the passage of the Bill,
significant changes to the way local authorities have to secure
publicly funded, free early-years provision for three and four
year-olds, and potentially has serious implications for the quality of
the provision purchased, especially for the most disadvantaged
children, including those two year-olds who now qualify. The Government
consulted on these proposals, and the overwhelming view of local
authorities was that they would have a negative impact on childcare.
The proposed regulations will mean that a local authority can no longer
apply its own quality assessment when deciding which providers it will
commission the free places from. Local authorities 
<?notus-xml column=299?>will instead have to accept the most recent Ofsted
judgment. Furthermore, the local authority will no longer be
able to attach any conditions about quality or anything else
to any provider that is rated good or outstanding.</hs_para>

understand that in the interests of reducing duplication, requiring the
local authority to accept the Ofsted judgment and not to do its own
makes some sense, but I have some very specific concerns. First, the
latest Ofsted inspection may be very out of date. It can be up to four
years old. There may have been significant changes of leadership which
have affected what is happening in a particular nursery. In short, the
latest Ofsted judgment may not be a reliable indicator of current
quality. If it was given a rating of good or outstanding, even four
years ago, the local authority will not be able to look at the quality
of that provider.</hs_para>

of policy intention envisages that the local authorities would
“not normally” contract with a provider rated
“inadequate”. However, neither the government amendment
nor the indicative regulations prohibit contracting with an
“inadequate” provider. This means that if a parent wants
a place with a provider that is rated inadequate and the provider can
supply it, the local authority could secure that place,
which would mean children being placed in
“inadequate” settings or in settings needing very
considerable improvement because those providers will be able to demand
funding. We see the prospect of public money paying for inadequate or
poor

Amendment 240S would require that a provider has a rating of
“good” or “outstanding” in order to
contract with a local authority to provide free places. There is room
for a debate on where that threshold ought to be, but there can be no
acceptable reasons to force local authorities to contract
with poor or inadequate providers. We know that
there is a chronic shortage of high-quality provision in
disadvantaged areas, and therefore that disadvantaged children will
suffer most from these changes. Taken together, Clause 76 and
government Amendment 240R will seriously undermine the availability and
quality of childcare, and local government’s role in its
continuous improvement. Taking Clause 76 out of the Bill and approving
our Amendment 240S, along with new guidance, would enable local
authorities to continue to stimulate the market and protect and drive
up

Perry of Southwark (Con):</Member></B> Perhaps I may respond to the
noble Baroness, Lady Hughes. Ofsted’s category of
“needing improvement” does not close a nursery down;
other children will continue to be there. Also, if a parent has strong
reasons for choosing a local nursery, where perhaps children of friends
and neighbours are already attending, a parent should not be banned
from making that choice, despite knowing what the Ofsted judgment is.
As the noble Baroness rightly said, that judgment could be out of date
and the improvement could have happened in the mean time. It would be
wrong to condemn a child to being unable to go to the nursery of
parental choice just because three or so years ago Ofsted declared that
it needed improvement. It is more important that parents have a choice,
knowing what they are choosing. The Ofsted report is there for everyone
to see and make inquiries about, and there may be powerful reasons for
a parent to want a child to go to that nursery. As I say, other
children are still going there, it is not being closed down and it is
not being put into special

concern. Before I do that, I will add my concerns to those of the noble
Baronesses raising the issue of repeal under Clause 76. Earlier, before
we began the Committee, the noble Lord, Lord McColl, talked to me about
whether a particular group of children should be given priority and
whether we could find a way of doing that. I said that, if you try
that, you will find that almost every group of children that local
authorities currently deal with are a priority, because those are the
only groups that they deal with at the moment. It is very difficult for
local authorities at the moment to move into preventive work or into
other
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000030">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T15:51:16"></hs_TimeCode>

another piece of legislation for children, which does not have it, my
great concern is 
<?notus-xml column=301?>that children will slip down the priority list in
this particular area. I am not saying that they will not be
protected—that will be followed up—but proper assessment
for under-five provision will slip down the priority level. It has to,
because that is the only way that local authorities can manage their
finances and priority ratings. I hope that the Minister and the
Government will look again at this repeal. I think that the way forward
is to look at the regulation and the framework and to get that into an
accurate package, which would take us

other area that concerns me—this is a probing question—is
those children who have additional needs and who need to be placed in
under-five daycare so that their parents can work or develop skills. I
am thinking in particular of children with, say, autism or similar
developmental issues and am really trying to probe how this fits with
the government amendment. At the moment, a local authority may provide
funding for a place, but if the parent wishes to make additional
payments for an extra quality of service, the local authority will not
pay because that would be a mixture of private and statutory
funding—even if the organisation providing that service is a
voluntary, not-for-profit

of the people who pressed for the principle of not mixing private and

position where, as a parent, you could not give added quality to
children in need. The difficulty has arisen because some parents have
objected to having to pay—one organisation I know in particular
may have to close its doors because it cannot manage the quality of
care that they need to provide for these difficult children. This is
really a probing question: are the Government prepared to look at
mixing or is it an absolutely sacred principle that private and public

that local authorities should report to elected members annually on the
steps they are taking to address any gaps in childcare provision. The
annual report should also be made available to parents, allowing them
to hold local authorities to account for ensuring that there is
high-quality, affordable childcare in their area. The noble Baroness,
Lady Hughes, mentioned a simpler annual report. We are more in

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> Perhaps the noble Baroness will give
way on a point of detail about the consultation. I understood that the
Government did not test views on repealing the Section 11 duty. I
understand that there were two questions: first, whether to move to an
annual sufficiency assessment and, secondly, whether to remove the
current Section 11 duty and the associated regulations altogether in
one question. An analysis of the qualitative responses that people made
showed that many people were very concerned about the current
regulations, but they did not express a view about Section 11 as a duty
in itself; they were more concerned about the onerous
regulations<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000047"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="13111810000255" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000255">Baroness
Northover:</Member></B> I hear what the noble Baroness says. I have
seen some of the responses and she rightly puts her finger on the
concern about the document that was produced. Perhaps at the very least
we can agree that the three-year assessment that was put in
place—no doubt for extremely sound reasons—was not doing
what was intended. What we seek to do here is to make sure that we have
something that delivers what is required, which is the pressure on
local authorities to make sure that they know what the provision is and
that it is sufficient. Therefore, moving from three years to an annual
assessment is important, as the noble Baroness agrees. We need
something which is not so lengthy and dense that by the time it is
produced three years later, many of those children will already be in
school. The assessment needs to be a little more up to date than once
every three
years<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000048"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hughes of Stretford" PimsId="5818" UID="13111810000256" xid="2080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000256">Baroness
Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> I am grateful to the Minister for her
clarification. I think there is agreement on that particular proposal.
Perhaps she could address the point that the noble Baroness, Lady
Tyler, I and others made: namely, why do the Government want to repeal
the Section 11 duty, which we think would send a very negative message
to local authorities, rather than simply amend the regulations in the
way in which she is
describing<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

have now got my papers in the right order. My noble friend Lady Tyler
asked about good practice. The department would be happy to publicise
any examples of good practice and local authority annual reports.
Through the Children’s Partnership, the department runs a
foundation years website which provides a range of guidance and good
practice material to support early-years
professionals<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. I
also point out to my noble friend Lady Walmsley that the department
collects and publishes a suite of data on local authority performance
in the early years benchmarking tool. So information is held centrally
as well, which helps inform both the Government and local
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:04:47"></hs_TimeCode>.
Local authorities will still need to assess local sufficiency, and
these proposals will make it less bureaucratic to do so. I hope that
noble Lords will be willing to withdraw their opposition and
will be reassured that local authorities will still need to assess the
sufficiency of childcare provision and to account for it to elected
members<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:05:12"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:05:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000051">Government
Amendment 240R allows new regulations to be made that affect the way
local authorities meet their duty to secure early-years provision for
young children. The amendment will allow the Government to impose a
requirement on local authorities to meet this duty by funding
early-years provision at any provider that meets the quality standards
set out in regulations.</hs_para>

previously set out an expectation that local authorities should
undertake their own assessment of a provider’s quality before
funding it to deliver places. It seems to us that it does not make
sense for the Government to require local authorities to make quality
judgments about providers when Ofsted is undertaking a similar role.
The noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, acknowledged that we have duplication
here, but she was concerned that Ofsted’s assessments might take
a while to take place, would therefore be out of date, and so on. Where
local authorities have got concerns about a decline in quality since an
inspection, they can make representations to Ofsted, which may inspect
earlier than scheduled. Give that Ofsted is in place, however, it seems
to us that the duplication did not make sense.</hs_para>

intention is that in future, where a provider has received a
“good” or “outstanding” inspection judgment
from Ofsted, it should automatically receive funding from the local
authority if a parent wants to send their child there. Currently, local
authorities can also require providers to meet a variety of additional
local conditions in order to receive funding. Some providers report
that local authority improvement recommendations have conflicted with
the views of Ofsted and that inconsistent requirements have presented
challenges for providers operating in more than one area and looking to
expand. This clause also allows regulations to be made that limit the
nature of the conditions that can be imposed whenever a local authority
funds an early-education
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:07:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lady Howarth, asked about top-up fees for children with SEN. As she
pointed out, local authorities have a statutory duty to secure early

point. I will write to her on whether fees could be mixed in the way
she talked
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000055">We
intend to make regulations that ensure that local authorities will be
able to place conditions on providers to ensure that they meet their
responsibilities to meet the needs of disabled children, or children
with SEN, to keep children safe and use government funding properly.
Under the regulations, local authorities will also be able to set
conditions that ensure funded places are completely free, so that no
parent is denied access to their child’s funded place by having
to pay a fee, and places will be delivered flexibly to meet
parents’ needs. Of course, the noble Baroness will have noted
that they have a particular responsibility to look after children with
special needs. One would hope that the provision made would be
appropriate and that the parents would not need to be topping up with
extra fees. Nevertheless, I will write to the noble Baroness on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000056">Local
authorities will continue to have an important role to play in helping
providers improve the quality of their provision. They will still be
able to place conditions on providers judged less than
“good”, requiring them to take the necessary steps to
address issues raised by Ofsted at inspection. I hope that aspect will
also reassure noble
Lords.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000057">Taken
together, these changes will create a level playing field for all
providers across the country. Nationally consistent criteria will make
it easier for good providers to expand outside their local authority
area and for new providers to enter the market. In particular, it will
enable more childminders to deliver places, giving parents greater
choice over their childcare options so that they can do what is best
for their family. I urge noble Lords to support the government
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000058">I
turn to Amendment 240S in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes.
We absolutely share her aim that we should fund early-education places
at the highest-quality providers—there is no doubt about that.
The research evidence is clear that high-quality provision has the
biggest impact on children’s development. Therefore, we are
working very hard to drive up the quality of provision, following on
from what the noble Baroness did in her role. She will also be aware of
the challenges that government encounters in trying to do that, but we
are taking that forward very vigorously. We are reforming the
regulatory regime, including planning more rigorous and frequent
inspections and a greater role for Her Majesty’s inspectors in
quality-assuring those
inspections.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000059">To
improve the skills and knowledge of those caring for and educating
young children, we are introducing early-years teachers at graduate
level and early-years educators at A-level standard. However, we do not
think that enshrining in the Bill a quality threshold for funded places
is the best way to achieve this. Placing a quality threshold in primary
legislation would reduce the Government’s flexibility to raise
the quality bar as the quality of available provision improves. It
would also prevent the Government from easily adjusting the standard to
reflect changes to the inspection framework; 
<?notus-xml column=306?>for example, if Ofsted decided to no longer have an inspection category
labelled “good”. That kind of judgment is not usually put
in primary legislation, as noble Lords will be
aware.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000060">I may
not have addressed all the issues. I will just see if there are any
other things I need to pick up. In answer to the question asked by the
noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, about keeping the regulations, the
Government’s view is that the statutory guidance is a more
proportionate way of supporting local authorities in their sufficiency
duty than the regulations, which could be bureaucratic. The guidance is
in force and is available on the department’s website. I am
happy to write to noble Lords to provide greater detail on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000061">The
noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, and my noble friend Lady Walmsley asked
about funding inadequate providers. Local authorities retain the
discretion in extraordinary circumstances to fund inadequate providers.
For example, this would allow an authority to fund a provider judged
inadequate because of a technicality, such as out-of-date policies that
will be speedily rectified. Our guidance is clear, however, that
authorities should withdraw funding from inadequate providers as soon
as is reasonably practical if they fail for reasons of greater
substance than the kind of instance to which I have just referred. I
hope that that reassures the noble
Baronesses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000062">I

still prefer that we retain Section 11, as several noble Lords have

Northover:</Member></B> I think that this is the amendment the noble
Baroness was thinking about. I shall speak also to Amendment 273A,
which is a technical amendment to bring the substantive amendment into
force two months after Royal Assent. These amendments clarify the law
in relation to the Secretary of State’s power to intervene in
failing local authorities under the 1996 Education Act and the Children
Act 2004.</hs_para>

Lords will know, government intervention in local authorities rests on
the use of non-statutory improvement notices or, less often, on
statutory directions to ensure that locally led improvement is
effective. There are currently five local authorities in England under
statutory direction, and 20 subject to improvement notices. The
Secretary of State’s ability to remove functions entirely from a
local authority is essential only in exceptional cases of persistent
underperformance that put at risk the welfare of vulnerable children
over an extended
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000071">Parliament
agreed that those powers were necessary when it passed important
provisions in the Education Act 1996 and the Children Act 2004. That
legislation allows the Secretary of State to direct that where a local
authority fails to perform its children’s services functions to
an adequate standard or at all, those functions can be exercised
directly by the Secretary of State or by a third-party nominee. For
these powers to be exercised effectively, it is essential that the
Secretary of State or the third-party nominee can fulfil all the
functions required to keep vulnerable children safe and intervene to
improve their life chances.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13111810000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000072">However, although this
legislation is in place and its intention is clear, it leaves room for
potential legal argument over how the courts would view a direction
under subsection (4A). This is because, in introducing the provisions
in the 1996 Act and the 2004 Act, Parliament did not clarify in
legislation all the powers that are consequential upon those
provisions. It is not clear beyond doubt, for instance, whether the
family court would feel able to recognise a third-party nominee as if
it were a local authority in care or adoption proceedings. There might
also be some doubt as to whether the chief inspector had the powers
necessary to inspect and report on a nominee’s performance of
the local authority’s functions.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=312?><hs_para UID="13111810000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000073">We propose, therefore,
to clarify the relevant legislation to put these questions beyond
doubt. This is important to enable the Secretary of State to intervene
not just where the most serious social care failures occur but in the
interests of certainty for children who may be taken into
care or placed for adoption. In order that these powers can be
exercised effectively, the new clause makes it clear that where
functions are being exercised directly by the Secretary of State
himself or by a third -party nominee, the Secretary of State or his or
her nominee would, for example, be able to apply for or be named in
care orders under Section 31 of the Children Act 1989; exercise the
functions set out in Section 92(2) of the Adoption and
Children Act 2002; and exercise certain other court-related functions
in the same way that the local authority can. This is clearly the
intention and purpose behind the provisions in the Education Act 1996
and the Children Act 2004, but in such an important area that is
critical to the safety of children it is essential that there is no
room for uncertainty. This new clause therefore clarifies existing
powers. It does not seek to expand
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000074">The
amendment also makes it clear that, following a direction that local
authority functions be exercised by the Secretary of State or a
third-party nominee, other relevant references in legislation to a
“local authority” should be read as references also to
the Secretary of State or a nominee. For example, in relation to the
chief inspector’s inspection functions and powers, such as under
Sections 136 to 141 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006, the
amendment will ensure that the performance of these functions by the
Secretary of State or his nominee should also be subject and open to
inspection in the same way as when those functions are performed by a
local authority. We do not want to leave any uncertainty over
Ofsted’s power to inspect children’s services in whatever
form they might be delivered. I beg to

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> Will the Minister clarify a couple of
points about the potential scope and impact of the amendment? I can
readily understand what she is saying about the need for any
third-party nominee that the Secretary of State appoints to take over
the administration of children’s services to be recognised by
the courts in any orders for which they need to apply to
protect the safety of particular children. Because these powers have
been around for some time and have been exercised in relation to a
number of local authorities by this and previous Governments, can the
Minister provide an example of any problem that has led to the
amendment being
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:23:49"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

fundamentally, and because in the reference back to parent legislation
it is hard to discern scope and impact, will she clarify what proposed
new subsections (6A), (6B) and (6C), mean in practice? I am not clear
about why the reference here is to “a best value
authority” and whether that means that the powers in the
amendment under which the Secretary of State can intervene in a local
authority go far beyond applying to a local authority that is failing
in the performance of its duty. May it, in fact, be some reference to a
local authority that is not achieving best value, according to
someone’s criteria?</hs_para>

know I am not explaining that terribly clearly myself, but it seems
that the wording here potentially widens the scope of these powers
beyond their use in relation to what the Minister described at the
outset as authorities that have failed and have persistently failed.
This seems to be a much more generalised category of authority. I
wonder whether she could put on record the department’s
understanding of this issue in relation to proposed new subsections
(6A), (6B) and
(6C<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:25:14"></hs_TimeCode>).</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000078"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="13111810000268" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000268">Baroness
Northover:</Member></B> As the noble Baroness noted, these powers have
been there but have not been used. I want to be extremely clear that
this amendment speaks only to the very few cases where the capacity of
local authorities to improve the quality of their children’s
services is so seriously in doubt as to require them to be delivered by
the Secretary of State or a third-party nominee. As she notes, we have
never had to use this
power.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000079">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:29:00"></hs_TimeCode>
examples may help to clarify the point. In the Isle of Wight, we asked
Hampshire County Council to take over the delivery of services. In
Doncaster, where there were huge problems, we considered using
the power, but the council is now working with us to
establish a trust that is clearly separate from the local authority.
Therefore, the Secretary of State has decided not to remove the
council’s statutory children’s services functions, and
that will remain the position as long as good and constructive progress
continues to be made. In both those cases, the decision was made that
it was not necessary to use the powers that we are clarifying here.
Nevertheless, given that those powers are there, and that it was
envisaged in the 1996 and 2004 Acts that there could be instances where
they needed to be used, we feel that there needs to be absolute legal
clarity about the full range of powers that Parliament
intended<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:27:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000080">I
re-emphasise that the powers we are talking about here in relation to
children’s services would be used only in cases of extreme
failure. As I say, not even in the two cases that I have cited, where

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> Can the
Minister possibly write to me about this? I am particularly
interested in proposed new subsections (6A), (6B) and (6C). She said
that the powers would be used only in cases of extreme failure. Is that
extreme failure in the delivery of services or is it
failure, on somebody’s definition, to achieve “best
value”? In other words, it is not clear whether the reference
here to the Local Government Act 1999 and the references to
“best value” authorities go beyond failure in
service delivery and performance and could actually be a wider and more
general definition of a local authority failing to deliver best
value<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:28:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000082"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:57:25"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="13111810000270" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000270">Baroness

recently consulted on some immediate changes to regulations designed to
more effectively safeguard children living in children’s homes,
especially those in distant, or out-of-authority, places. We have also
published a comprehensive data pack, with details of children’s
homes’ locations, quality and
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:31:50"></hs_TimeCode>, and of
the needs of the children in their
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:31:49"></hs_TimeCode>. We are
considering ways to enhance the training and skills of the
children’s homes workforce, and how to support improved
commissioning of homes by local
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:32:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000088">As
my department worked with Ofsted and others on plans for improving care
in children’s homes, we reached a view that the current
regulatory framework, established by the Care Standards Act 2000, is
having a limiting effect on our ambitions to drive improvements in the
quality of care provided by homes. In our view, it should only be
acceptable for any children’s home to offer care that is
“good”, with all homes having a clear remit to strive for
excellence in respect of the children they care for. These amendments
put beyond doubt the fact that the Secretary of State can make
regulations that are able to define high standards for all
children’s homes. Every home must have the capacity to enable
all the children it cares for to achieve their full potential. These
amendments pave the way for my right honourable friend the Secretary of
State for Education to develop new, more stretching, quality objectives

intend to support innovation by creating regulations which specify high
objectives and standards. Homes should be free to decide how they
achieve these standards. We intend to set high standards for homes in a
number of areas, such as requirements for effective leadership and
management; for the provision of excellent education; and for access to
healthcare that meets recognised clinical standards. We will, of
course, have to be confident that homes respond effectively to the
risks and vulnerabilities faced by the children they care

to inform Ofsted that he or she has become disqualified, perhaps as a
result of a past offence, in order to seek Ofsted’s consent to
be involved in a children’s

quality of the experience for children in children’s homes since
I first entered this House, my perception is that the Government have
taken a very careful and thoughtful approach to meeting the needs of
these very needy young people—albeit that they are few in
number. In the past two years or so we have realised that a number of
young girls have been sexually exploited, often in children’s

Government have responded admirably to this challenge. Tim Loughton MP,
the former Children’s Minister, has children’s homes in
his Hove constituency, so he is aware of the problem. He addressed it
carefully by setting up three working groups to look at the issue,
which resulted in regulations being laid. The current Children’s
Minister, Edward Timpson MP, has pursued that direction of travel with
the attention to detail that is familiar to those who have worked with
him. I am deeply grateful for that. The Minister is absolutely correct
to emphasise the importance of staff training. It is extremely

department also highlighted the experience of three local authorities
which currently offer birth registration services: Manchester, Bury and
York. Based on these case studies, the department identified a number
of benefits of implementing birth registration in centres. First, the
benefit of improved reach; there has been a concern that in the past,
children’s centres were not reaching the hardest to reach,
particularly young teenage mothers. It is considered that this will
improve the ability to get at those hard to reach groups. Secondly,
parents seem to be more likely to come back again. Once they have
visited to do the birth registration, practitioners find that they come
back to the service. The Benchill centre in Manchester had a
re-engagement rate of 87.5% in 2012-13; which means that 87.5% of those
who came for the registration must have come back again for further
services.</hs_para>

there is a danger of stigma in visiting a children’s centre;
people may feel that they can go only if there is something wrong with
them. This, however, is a universal service. Everyone would go there to
register their child, so there would be no stigma attached to it.
Fourthly, practitioners talk about this as an important step forward in
terms of involving fathers. Fathers will go along when the child is
going to have the birth registered. I am not quite sure of the
technical details as to why it is so important for fathers to be
involved in the registration process—perhaps one of your
Lordships can tell me in a minute—but there is a strong feeling
that more fathers will be involved early in their child’s life
this way. Finally, it is an opportunity to showcase to parents the
wonderful services that are available to them at the children’s
centres.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000099">There
is a strong case for increasing provision of birth registration
services in children’s centres. This would be a very good means
of doing so. It is not onerous for local authorities to
deliver this. It is not costly to do. The risk is that with local
authorities currently carrying such burdens, this is one trick that
they might miss. This would mean families and children missing out on
the benefits of it. I hope that the Minister can give a sympathetic
response.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000100">I

engage with new parents. Sharing the live-birth data would make a
significant contribution to enabling centres to identify within their
reach area the new parents with whom they have not yet been in contact;

Lordships may feel that this second amendment is a little bit deficient
in that it is not ambitious enough, because there are other areas that
children’s centres could be advised about better—for
instance, the troubled families agenda. Centres do not necessarily know
about who Louise Casey is dealing with through the troubled families
agenda. Also, there are things called multi-agency risk assessment
conference boards, dealing with domestic violence. Again,
children’s centres could benefit by being given information
about what those boards know about so that they can reach out to
families where there is domestic violence. So your Lordships may feel
that something further should be added to this amendment and more
information should be shared with children’s centres. I hope

initiative is an excellent example of early intervention that can grow
out of children’s centres, combining home visits with increased
parental involvement in other well-being events and a dramatic
improvement in child literacy. That is just one

there is good practice in some places where data are already shared.
Other trusts feel that they are unable or unwilling to share and are
concerned about confidentiality issues. This is where the Government
could help by being much clearer about the advantages of sharing and
the terms on which it should be done. How can local authorities be
expected to carry out their safeguarding and child welfare
responsibilities or plan adequately for local services if they are not
made aware of the total picture of births in their
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:48:35"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

our consideration of the Bill, many concerns have been raised about
services working together for the benefit of children. Indeed, an
earlier amendment—we discussed it some days ago, or possibly
some weeks ago—was specifically about promoting integration,
with lead professionals taking a role in ensuring that integration
happens. I remember—again, it was some time ago—the noble
Baroness, Lady Howarth, in one of her many excellent and wise
contributions, saying that without data, strategy is not possible; the
noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, also hinted at that. I agree with that and

amendments tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, are an extension of
that concept of integration and improving data sharing in
children’s centres. The noble Earl has described the need for
NHS trusts to share with authorities records of live births to parents
resident in their area in order to facilitate the identification of and
contact with new families through children’s centres and other
early outreach services. To this end, as he said, this should include
the format of arrangements, the safeguarding of information, the
regularity of data transfer, timescales and safeguards against
inappropriate sharing.</hs_para>

a report that some noble Lords may remember, <I>Every Child
Matters</I>, which came out in about 2004—I can see lots of
nods. This was a consultation on what matters for children, followed by
a government document, in the wake of the horrendous death of Victoria
Climbié and the report by the noble Lord, Lord Laming, which
concluded that the poor co-ordination of services, including health,
police, education and social services, had contributed to that child
and other children falling through the net. It was a seminal document.
It had influence in involving children and young people in setting
priorities and in getting services for children to work together, to
look at their functions in working together and to talk to one another.
This group of amendments shows that we need to look at all that again;
we need to look at the integration of
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000114">As
others have said, poor data sharing can prevent organisations,
including children’s centres, from helping vulnerable children
and their families. If they had birth data, they could address the
needs of such families 
<?notus-xml column=321?>early. I remember one children’s centre that
I visited in the north of England having courses for young mothers.
These courses became a group support initiative to talk about
breastfeeding, about bringing up babies and toddlers and about which
services people could access—for example, classes on a variety
of issues. Crèches had been set up at the centre. Sometimes the
centre was able to offer intensive support for parents who had
difficulties with finances, for example.</hs_para>

for Children has set out reasons for effective data-sharing systems and
has listed some difficulties, which I hope the Minister will be able to
address. Those difficulties include the fact that children’s
centres may be split across district and health services; there may be
no data-sharing protocols; and there may be a feeling that such systems
are too resource-intensive. However, there are serious impacts in not
sharing data. The noble Earl has listed some such impacts of delaying
the identification of vulnerable children and their families and
delaying help for such families.</hs_para>

effective—according to Action for Children, it is effective in
32% of children’s centres—local arrangements have been
set up between health and the local authority. There have been meetings
and good relationships between, for example, health visitors and
midwives, and there has been early identification of vulnerable
families and of children who are likely to have difficulties, such as
those with disabilities. As others have said, this help should be
offered early in order to be most effective.</hs_para>

is that data sharing forms a basis for people from various disciplines
who support families to meet and to talk about the concerns, not just
swap bits of paper. It has always seemed to me that people talking
about issues to one another, either formally or informally, is a very
good way of ensuring integrated support for families. I look forward to
hearing the Minister’s
reply.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_18_PT_1/C2CB743C60E223B7A81B8FE6B54C2125C64D9427" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 November 2013">Monday,

Tyler of Enfield:</Member></B> My Lords, I support Amendment 242, to
which my name is attached. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, has already
set out very clearly the arguments in favour of piloting the
registration of births at children’s centres, but I will just
confirm my personal support for this

centres do many good things, but one of their absolutely core values
lies in their ability to reach out to some of the most vulnerable and
disadvantaged groups: people who, for all sorts of reasons, are
unlikely to enter into sustained contact with public services without
help in doing so, but who are also the most likely to benefit from
them. We have already heard the statistics from the recent
<I>Children’s Centre Census</I> from 4Children. That is
encouraging in showing us that the widening reach is really happening
and that more children’s centres are being successful in
reaching out to some of the most disadvantaged. The location of birth
registration services within children’s centres will really help
with early intervention in the lives of disadvantaged
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:56:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000120">I
am sure that all noble Lords in this Committee are well aware of the
evidence of the huge importance of early intervention and how
incredibly important what 
<?notus-xml column=322?>happens in the first three years of a child’s life is.
Indeed, as I know from my work on the All-Party Group on Social
Mobility, in some ways those first three years can almost determine
life chances for a lifetime. They are absolutely critical. That is why
I think that getting parents through the doors of children’s
centres, ideally within six weeks of their child’s birth, and
exposing them to the range of services, help and support available is
critical. It is also vital to help nurture those early relationships
between parents and professionals, which, again, can make such a
difference. That is why I am absolutely delighted that encouraging
parents to register children’s births at a local children and
family centre is now part of Liberal Democrat party
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:57:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000121">My
final point is that the proposed birth registration pilot scheme should
be seen as part of a wider strategy to provide more integrated and
cohesive public services. Children’s centres not only provide
childcare, as we talked about earlier, but a range of valuable help,
including parenting sessions, health and well-being advice, information
on jobs and employability, et cetera. For example, things such as
co-locating health visitors within children’s centres enables
parents to have the opportunity to speak to a health visitor about any
concerns they may have, for example in relation to their child’s
sleeping patterns, breastfeeding and their own health and well-being.
Co-locating important services in this one-stop-shop way has a whole
range of very powerful benefits. It should increase take-up and should
also be value for money. It make terribly good sense and is a real
win-win. Can we try it out rather than just talk about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T16:58:01"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000122"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Massey of Darwen" PimsId="1738" UID="13111810000280" xid="1343" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000280">Baroness

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, we all merge into one after a while.

turn, first, to the issue of data sharing. We agree on the importance
of information sharing. Clearly, professionals should work together to
identify families who are in need of support and offer them that
support. Indeed, the Department for Education’s statutory
guidance for children’s centres is clear that health services
and local authorities should share information, such as live birth
data, with children’s centres on a regular basis where doing so
enables professionals to work better with one another to provide
services for families. Moreover, current legislation makes it clear
that information can already be shared where there are local agreements
and processes in place that meet the legal requirements about
confidentiality, consent and security of information. Naturally, we
wish to support information sharing between professionals. In order to
encourage this, my colleagues at the Department of Health have
undertaken to liaise with NHS England and other partners to promote the
sharing of live birth data and to explore the practical
issues.</hs_para>

wholeheartedly support the intention behind this proposed new clause,
which is to ensure the most effective local practice. But I hope your
Lordships will agree that legislating is not the best approach here.
Evidence, as set out in Jean Gross’s report, shows that the most
challenging barriers to effective information sharing are about
institutional and professional practice and the culture and trust
between early-years practitioners and healthcare professionals, not
national regulation. I think this is the group to which the noble
Baroness, Lady Jones, was referring, and that my honourable friend Jo
Swinson referred
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000126">I turn to
the issue of registering births at children’s centres. Local
authorities can already make children’s centres one of the
places where parents can register a birth. We know that some local
authorities are already providing this service and that it is well
received. We very much welcome this approach and encourage other local
authorities to consider whether it would be good for their local
communities. Going to a children’s centre to register their
baby’s birth means that parents know where their local centre is
and are aware of the services they can access. The noble Earl, Lord
Listowel, made a very compelling case, supported by others, including
my noble friend Lady Tyler. Clearly, it must be for local authorities
to determine the shape and make-up of their local services but, as I
say, noble Lords have made a very cogent case on
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000127">The
Government are committed to raising awareness of the opportunity that
already exists to use children’s centres for registering births,
along with the benefits that may accrue and the obstacles to be
overcome in doing so. Indeed, in October my honourable friend Liz Truss
MP spoke about this issue during a Select Committee evidence session
and committed to meeting Councillor David Simmonds of the Local
Government Association to see how best to progress engaging local
authorities and children’s centres with the registrars to make
this happen locally.</hs_para>

summer, we asked 4Children, part of our Children and Young
People’s Strategic Partnership, to circulate this information
via its newsletter, which is sent to 50,000 colleagues working with
families and cascaded to at least this number again. 4Children has also
placed this information on its website so that as many people as
possible are able to consider the benefits of registering births at
children’s centres and are able to pursue this locally. I hope
that the noble Earl will be reassured that this very good idea is being
taken forward. I note what my noble friend Lady Tyler said about other
sources of information and other services that might be provided. This
is quite an interesting test case of trying to take this
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000129">However,
we agree that more could be learnt about whether registering a
baby’s birth at a children’s centre has an impact on how
likely the parents are to continue to access those services, which are
intended to enhance the welfare of children. The Department for
Education will look at how it can gather examples and disseminate its
findings to help inform the decisions made by local
authorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000130">Turning
to the information and data that should be published with
regard to children’s centres, I hope that your Lordships will
accept that the current level 
<?notus-xml column=324?>of published data already provides
effective local accountability and transparency, and informs the public
about children’s centres and the services available. Local
authorities update information about their children’s centres on
the Department for Education’s Sure Start On database as and
when changes occur. Information is then made available on the
Government’s website on a daily basis. This enables the public
to see a list of all the children’s centres and provides contact
details for each of them. To require all local authorities to submit
this information to the Secretary of State formally would be an
unnecessary burden on local
authorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111810000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111810000131">The
Department for Education also collects annual financial data from each
local authority, which are published on its website. The data show the
yearly budget and actual spend for each local authority. I point out
that funding for early intervention has increased from £2.2
billion in 2011-12 to £2.5 billion in 2014-15. Local councils
continue to have the freedom to spend this where it is most needed to
best support the needs of their local communities, but I am very

which I have agreed should be grouped with Amendment 243, although the
two matters are somewhat different, in the interest of trying to save a
bit of time. I am afraid that, because both require considerable
explanation, I shall have to move from my usual policy of making very
short speeches, so I hope that the Committee will bear with me. As the
Committee knows, the noble Lord, Lord Laming, reported on the sad death
of Victoria Climbié, but he cannot be here this afternoon. He
has kindly allowed me to say that he supports this amendment.</hs_para>

Section 1 the Children and Young Persons Act
1933—“Cruelty to persons under sixteen”—to
clarify that to communicate to a child, or anyone connected to the
child, that the child is possessed by evil spirits or is a witch
amounts to cruelty and therefore contravenes the Act. The Act sets out
several specific offences, although it does not mention the word
“cruelty” in the text. For example, it says that if
anyone who has responsibility for a child,</hs_para>

might think, but there is a group of children who have been treated
most cruelly, even killed, as a result of people telling them and
others that they are possessed by evil spirits or have supernatural
harmful powers. Currently, it appears that the law does not accept that
to cause a child such terrible mental trauma is cruel and against the
1933 Act. It also appears that it is not accepted that
telling other people that the child is possessed is against the law,
even though doing so often causes superstitious third parties to ill
treat and even kill the
child.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111822000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000004">This
amendment is very carefully worded. It does not make it an offence to
believe that the child is possessed. It does not make it an offence to
go away privately and pray or try to exorcise the spirit that you

to traumatise the child by telling him or to pass on your belief to
other people in the knowledge that it might cause them to harm the

this limitation was ever in there because cruelty to children does not
change its nature depending on whether you have responsibility for them
or not. Why should a neighbour or a lodger escape prosecution when a
babysitter does not? In relation to witch branding, we must remove
these words because they would allow a pastor or the sexual partner of
a relative to escape, too, even though such people do perpetrate abuse,
as was the case in the murders of Kristy Bamu and Victoria
Climbié.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13111822000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000006">The
second part of the amendment clarifies the meaning of
“ill-treats” in order specifically to include the
communication by word or action of a belief that the child is possessed
by evils spirits or malign powers, either to the child or someone
connected to him. Please note that, although these children
are often referred to as witches, the word “witch” does
not appear in the amendment in order not to catch the benign type of
witch, commonly known as white witches, or the fantasy that is often
played out at Halloween. The intention of the amendment is to outlaw
not harmless practices but a proven and serious form of child
abuse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111822000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000007">Branding
a child as a witch is an incitement to hatred and an attack on the
integrity of the child. Once a child is called “a witch”
or “possessed”, he or she is stripped of his or her
innocence and considered as a perpetrator of evil acts, instilling fear
and providing a moral ground for others to ill treat the child. Those
who believe in the exorcist rite of “beating the devil out of
the child” are then given leeway to do so. While parents and
guardians can either be prosecuted for harming a child or appropriate
social work interventions can be made under civil law, a faith leader,
neighbour or member of the family’s friends and community who
triggered the process of abuse by accusing or
“validating” the accusation against a child cannot be
brought to account under child cruelty
offences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111822000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000008">I
have been encouraged to lay this amendment by the charity AFRUCA, which
was established in the wake of the Victoria Climbié tragedy.
Victoria’s killers justified their abuse by their belief that
she was a witch. Since then, the work of AFRUCA has shown
the need 
<?notus-xml column=327?>for clarification of the law. For more than
11 years they have made efforts to raise awareness in the
community and among the public about the plight of these children, but
all that work was not enough to prevent the terrible death
of Kristy Bamu in December 2010 and other abuses linked to
witchcraft accusations. Kristy died with 135 injuries inflicted on his
body.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111822000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000009">Various
consultations carried out in the community by AFRUCA showed that the
overwhelming majority of those who took part believe that a law would
go a long way to stop the harmful behaviour of rogue faith leaders. The
branding of children as witches is not a long-standing cultural
tradition either in the UK or overseas. It is a relatively recent
phenomenon, in part arising from a deliberate exploitation of families
for monetary gain or heightened social status by unscrupulous
individuals calling themselves faith
leaders.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13111822000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000053">5.15

in the law would inform social workers and others that such allegations

is not seeking to criminalise a belief in the existence of evil
spirits, or a belief that an evil spirit could inhabit a child. While
we do not personally hold such beliefs, we respect others’
rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and to freedom
of expression. However, such rights must be exercised without violating
the child’s right to protection from significant harm.
Presumably the aim of any exorcism is to remove the evil spirit without
causing irremediable harm to the child, the innocent receptacle, yet
telling the child that he or she possesses evil powers causes injury
that lasts long after the spirit has been
removed”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13111822000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000036">I

allegations of possession or supernatural powers is a globally
recognised harmful practice that is already outlawed in a number of
African states, such as Nigeria, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa
and Tanzania. It is similar to other harmful practices such as forced
marriage, which was an issue that the UK Government at first thought
could be challenged without creating a specific criminal offence but
which now has been outlawed. In correspondence, the
Minister, Edward Timpson MP, claims that if an expression of a belief
causes a child significant harm, it is child abuse and already unlawful
under civil and criminal legislation. The problem is that the
Government refuse to confirm that such expressions of belief cause
significant harm to children. If Ministers agree, it follows that the
law should make it clear that such allegations are criminal
offences under Section 1 of the 1933 Act. It would be very
strange to say that all forms of injurious emotional abuse of children
should be criminal except this one. If Ministers do not agree that
children suffer long-lasting traumas from these allegations, I invite
my noble friend to explain why
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111822000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000012">The
Minister, Mr Timpson, claims that a majority of the National Working
Group on Abuse Linked to Faith or Belief were not in favour of
legislation “of this sort”. The reason why they objected
was that you 
<?notus-xml column=328?>cannot criminalise witch branding because of
Halloween, white witches and so on, but my amendment is carefully
worded to avoid this. He states that religious belief should not be
criminalised. That is quite right but, as I explained, my new clause
avoids that. The Government are concerned that making witch branding a
criminal offence might “drive it underground” or make
children and parents less likely to go to the authorities for help.
This is a familiar argument, which was used in relation to FGM and
forced marriage, but the truth is the reverse: until such practices are
made unlawful, they continue to exist and victims continue not to seek
help. The Government eventually accepted this in the cases of FGM and
forced marriage. I hope that they will accept the same in the case of
witch
branding.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111822000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000013">I
turn briefly to Amendment 246. Its simple purpose is to extend to
part-time schools the same protection for children against physical
violence as exists in all full-time education establishments, in
children’s homes and in local authority foster homes and early
years provision. Physical violence such as smacking and caning was
prohibited in all maintained schools in 1987 and, ever since, the
prohibition has gradually been extended to other settings by various
pieces of legislation. The Education and Skills Act 2008 amended the
Education Act 1996 to extend the ban on corporal punishment to
independent educational institutions—that is, part-time
providers which are not schools. However, this latter provision has
never been
implemented.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111822000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000014">The
defence of reasonable punishment may be available to adults in
circumstances where they are charged with common assault, having
smacked a child while being in loco parentis. However, because of the
failure to implement the measure in the 1996 Act, although
teachers and other staff in schools cannot argue this defence, it is
still available to adults in part-time settings such as supplementary
schools, Sunday schools and madrassahs, private tutoring and leisure
facilities for children, as well as by other adults to whom parents may
entrust their children, such as close relatives, step-parents and
partners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111822000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000015">Following
concern expressed about allegations of physical punishment and abuse to
children attending supplementary and part-time faith schools, the
Labour Government commissioned Sir Roger Singleton to produce a report
on the matter. It was published in March 2010 and is entitled
<I>Physical Punishment: </I><I>I</I><I>mproving
</I><I>C</I><I>onsistency and </I><I>P</I><I>rotection</I>. He reports
that during his consultations there was a significant view, including
from Muslim leaders and within African Christian churches, that the
protection of children against physical punishment should be extended
to all forms of care, education and instruction outside the family.
This was Sir Roger’s first and main recommendation.
Unfortunately, however, his recommendation has never resulted in a
change in the law or in implementation. The fact is that children are
still being subjected to physical violence in the name of discipline in
some of these settings. We need to make it absolutely clear that the
will of Parliament is that children are not abused physically in any
setting where their parents entrust them to a teacher, coach, religious
leader or anyone supporting
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111822000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000016">In 2010,
my honourable friend Annette Brooke MP and my right honourable friend
David Laws MP laid an amendment to the Children, Schools and Families 
<?notus-xml column=329?>Bill to implement the ban in all settings and I laid
a similar amendment in your Lordships’ House. We argued that
there was no justification for failing to protect children from
physical punishment in part-time settings. All the children’s
organisations and the vast majority of children themselves agree, as do
many of the public. The Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board and
the Muslim Parliament strongly support the prohibition of physical
punishment in madrassahs. Similar opposition to physical punishment in
the context of religious teaching and worship was expressed by Africans
Unite Against Child Abuse, so there is a lot of support for equalising
the protection of children wherever they are
studying.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111822000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000017">I
hope that my noble friend the Minister will be able to tell me that the
Government are at last willing to implement the ban in the Education
and Skills Act 2008. Children deserve our protection. Violence is no
way to enforce either learning or discipline and we need to make that
absolutely clear. Working with communities is all very fine and welcome
but there are still some places where the general disapproval of such
behaviour is ignored and many parents are reluctant to stand up and
complain because of the pressure from their fellow faith adherents and
senior people in the faith. We need to support those parents and make
it easier for them, since it has proved very difficult to stop this
behaviour by any other strategy. I beg to

Given that the last detailed research on this topic was carried out
more than seven years ago, I believe that it is important for the
Government to commission a study to estimate the number of cases of
possession or witchcraft among children. Following the dreadful
Victoria Climbié case and one or two other well publicised
cases, these cases are clearly still arising. The Metropolitan Police

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> My Lords, I am going to find myself
in the difficult position of disagreeing absolutely with the two noble
Baronesses. I am surprised that they have not had the context, because
much of what I hear sounds like the work that we did two years ago,
when I chaired the Trust for London committee that looked at child
safety issues in relation to witchcraft and children accused of being
possessed by evil spirits. I spent two years working with AFRUCA, the
Somali community, the Victoria Climbié Foundation and others
looking at the issue. During that time, we managed to disentangle what
was at first thought to be an issue of belief but what, as became clear
and as the two noble Baronesses made quite clear, was not about belief
but about child protection.</hs_para>

have ever heard, if proper attention had been given to present child
protection legal enactments, all those children should have been
properly protected by the existing legislation. I agree with the noble
Baronesses that if that is not so, we will need something
additional—but, as has been said, all the organisations that
took part in the round table, except for AFRUCA, did not see the need
for a change in legislation. What they saw a need for was the education
of social workers who simply do not understand the issue, and for more
work to be done with these
communities.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13111822000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111822000054">5.30

for London funded all these communities to do work. We undertook a
piece of research that looked at how many cases there were, and we
could not find many cases. The cases we found were truly horrific; I
have met the families and children. I agree absolutely with the noble
Baroness, Lady Brinton: it goes to your heart and you want to do
everything you can to protect these children. But the real difficulty
when it comes to legislation is trying to separate the belief issues

not what has been suggested. The Nigerian legislation has had very
little effect. If you talk to any group working out there at the

am ambivalent. I do not necessarily object to this—I have not
really thought it through, I have to say—but I wonder whether
having it on the statute book might in fact make it more difficult
sometimes because of the belief issue. You have to remember that there
are some quite difficult Christian communities—the Plymouth
Brethren have just been mentioned—who have very strict beliefs,
some of which I would certainly not agree with. However, whether those
are outside the law and whether this would catch some of those

will speak first to Amendment 243. For many years I was a school
governor. One of my roles was that of child protection officer, for
which I had to undergo training provided by the local council. These
training sessions were attended by people across the borough, with
responsibilities not just in schools but in community centres, Saturday
schools and churches. At one such session I realised the worrying
extent of superstition in these latter environments, involving children
who, it was believed, were possessed by evil spirits.</hs_para>

who also attended the training asked for better policies and advice to
be put in place in establishments other than schools. They highlighted 
<?notus-xml column=333?>the need for training to protect children from
what they believed was serious physical and mental abuse,
driven by traditional superstition and sometimes religious beliefs.
This abuse punished children who showed strong will or who
misbehaved, perhaps because of learning difficulties, or because of
conditions such as autism or dyslexia, or undiagnosed conditions which

also support Amendment 246. It has been brought to my attention, for
some years now and from people across the country, that many children
have had to endure corporal punishment and beatings in
part-time educational institutions if they do not remember or learn

has to stop. We must not ignore any plea to safeguard all children, no

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments both relate to
safeguarding specific groups of children. I will turn first to
Amendment 243. While of course we believe that people should be free to
express their views, I assure my noble friend Lady Walmsley and others
that what is absolutely not acceptable is where expression of belief is
intended to or causes harm to a child. My noble friends have made very
powerful cases. Sometimes children are harmed by their parents or
others. As a society we must be satisfied that we have the criminal
offences to prosecute those who commit such behaviour. The Government
have a key role to play, as do voluntary and other organisations
working in the sector. We commend them for their work in shining a
spotlight on this problem.</hs_para>

is essential to raise awareness among the relevant communities and
faith groups, and also among social workers and other
practitioners—as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth,
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T17:41:19"></hs_TimeCode>—who
may come into contact with families where such accusations have been
made. It is only through awareness of the potential threat posed to a
child’s well-being by such accusations that families,
communities and practitioners can be empowered to prevent harm from
taking place and, failing that, to act with confidence in reporting
concerns to the relevant authorities.</hs_para>

like to look at the criminal law. My noble friend made a powerful case
that she thought that these kinds of witchcraft cases were excluded.
The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, said the opposite. We have considered
the amendment carefully and we do not believe that it is necessary. We
agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, in this regard. This is
quite simply about child protection and human rights. If we cannot
include these kinds of cases, what does our child protection mean?
Although existing legislation does not specifically mention
communication of a belief that a child is possessed by spirits, the
current offence of child neglect already includes conduct likely to
cause a child unnecessary suffering or injury to health. In addition,
conduct not caught by the Section 1 offence could be caught by other
offences, depending on the circumstances of the case.</hs_para>

example, any person, not just a child’s parents or carers, who
caused physical or psychiatric harm to a child—which I think is
what my noble friends Lady Walmsley and Lady Brinton are talking
about—could be prosecuted for the offence of assault. Similarly,
any person whose words or behaviour cause serious alarm or distress to
a child, or made the child fear that violence could be used against
them, could be prosecuted under Sections 4 or 4A of the Public Order
Act 1986 —or, if the behaviour formed part of a course of
conduct, it could constitute an offence under the Protection from
Harassment Act
1997.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111833000014">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T17:43:45"></hs_TimeCode>

the Serious Crime Act 2007. For example, a religious leader who
encourages or assists parents or others to abuse or neglect a child, in
the belief that the child is possessed by evil spirits, could be guilty
of an offence. We must ensure that our child protection policy is

important that practitioners are aware of the role that they have to
play in safeguarding children. The Government published their
<I>Working Together to Safeguard Children</I> guidance earlier this
year. This has a statutory underpinning in the Children Act 1989, which
provides that if children’s services believe that a child is at
risk of harm within the family for any reason, they may intervene in an
appropriate way to protect them from such harm. This could be the case
where it appears that the child’s parents
believe—possibly because of what a religious leader has
said—that the child is a witch or possessed, and so are likely
to abuse or neglect them for that reason. In such cases, it is vital to
identify and assess the risk as early as possible so that the child
does not come to

working with families of African origin that has been campaigning for
such legislation. However, as I have said, if these issues are
identified, there are measures in place to deal with them. It is clear
that what we are dealing with here is, above all, lack of awareness.
That is why we are taking that work forward with the National Working
Group on Child Abuse Linked to Faith or Belief. AFRUCA is a member,

246. My noble friend Lady Walmsley has long been a champion for the
protection of children from physical abuse and violence, and I pay
tribute to her for her work. There was an ongoing debate on this in the
previous Government and it continues to be discussed in this one. I
reassure noble Lords that the Government are absolutely clear that
protection from abuse and neglect is a fundamental right for all
children. In recent years there have been cases, well documented by the
media, of physical assaults on children in non-school settings. Noble
Lords have flagged up a number of areas, including madrassahs. Evidence
has been gathered, and individuals have been charged, convicted and
imprisoned for physically assaulting children in these settings. I
therefore hope that this clarifies that the law already exists to
protect children from violence in these settings. Such violence is
absolutely unacceptable.</hs_para>

of enforcing the existing law can be reluctance on the part of parents
and others within communities to report allegations or complaints to
the relevant authorities. Cultural change is needed to overcome this.
Earlier<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T17:49:09"></hs_TimeCode> this
year, my noble friend Lady Walmsley met the Children’s Minister,
Edward Timpson, and suggested that a code of practice would help raise
standards in non-school settings. I am pleased to inform the Committee
that the Department for Education is working with faith and community
organisations to develop a voluntary code of practice. I hope that my
noble friend is pleased by that information. Our intention is to help
raise standards and establish good practice across the supplementary
schools
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111833000022">The
code will set out standards that providers will be expected to meet to
ensure the effective operation of an out-of-school setting. Signing up
to the code will mean that providers establish robust policies in areas
such as safeguarding and governance arrangements to help protect
children and young people from harm. This will provide parents with the
assurance that these settings are providing a good and safe learning
environment. Such a code will enable parents to make informed choices
about supplementary provision for their children and send a clear
message about the expected standards that all settings should meet, as
my noble friend Lord Storey said, to keep children safe from violence
and abuse. We expect the code to make a real difference, and we will,
of course, keep this under review. I am absolutely sure that noble

Lady Howarth, talked about the existing law, as did the Minister. She
said it is quite enough to catch people who abuse children in this way.
What I am talking about is early intervention, if you like. Although
once a child is physically abused, all kinds of laws have been broken
and people can be charged on that basis, what I would like to get
absolutely clear from the Minister is an acceptance that telling a
child that they are possessed by evil spirits is child abuse. It causes
the child enormous mental trauma, and you just do not know how that
will affect them over many years. The Minister said a great deal about
that amendment, so I will go away and read <I>Hansard</I> very
carefully to try to find out whether there was an acceptance that
simply telling a child before you lay a hand on them that they are
possessed is child abuse.</hs_para>

a number of laws under which somebody might be charged with child abuse
for doing that sort of thing, but I wonder how many cases there have
been. How many people have actually been charged and imprisoned for
that? Do communities and parents really understand that simply telling
a child that is enough to qualify as child abuse, and that it should be
reported and the child should be given special protection? Will my

Minister 
<?notus-xml column=337?>said is that you can charge and imprison somebody only when the case is
reported. One of the major problems is the reluctance of parents to
come forward and tell the authorities that the child is being abused,
perhaps particularly if the abuse is happening in a place of faith
instruction. The Under-Secretary of State for Children and Families,
Edward Timpson, has been very open to discussions with me, as the
Minister said. I am quite sure that he, like me, would like to iron out
this sort of practice once and for

in those settings. I am afraid that it is not good enough in a place of
part-time education, either. I shall undoubtedly keep on badgering
Ministers about this until the law is implemented. A piece of
legislation was passed, but it is no use if it is not implemented. It
needs implementing in order to stop this. It is not going to be a magic

am not suggesting that, just because a number of African countries have

they are horrendous. The fact is that it is very early days in those

not the law that will change what is happening; it is having a good
childcare structure with basic legislation that protects children, and
having people who understand that. That is why I think the law is not
particularly helpful in Nigeria; it has been passed because it suits
the Government’s purposes—perhaps I can say that
here—but it will not protect children. We have a much better
framework of protection here. If we have lists of children from
different groups, and there are other groups we could name who need
specific protection, it will take attention away from the others. We
have to train people to look at all these very difficult
areas—FGM is there, but it is a different issue and work is
being done by the Trust for London on that—and understand the

many noble Lords know, it was something of a struggle to get the then
Government to agree to England having a Children’s Commissioner.
Some people in this Room were instrumental in lobbying for the
appointment and then contributed to the review of the Office of the
Children’s Commissioner carried out by John Dunford in 2010. The
review culminated in his report and recommendations, published in
November of that year. One key recommendation—perhaps the key
recommendation—was that there should be a focus on
children’s rights in the work of the Children’s
Commissioner. As a result, the new commissioner will take over the
joint responsibilities of the Children’s Rights Director and the
Children’s Commissioner.</hs_para>

children’s rights generally. We have had, and will have in the
future, debates on children’s rights in a variety of contexts.
The Bill should reflect the Written Ministerial Statement of
6 December 2010, which made the commitment that the
Government would give “due consideration” to the
Convention on the Rights of the Child when 
<?notus-xml column=339?>proposing new law and policy. We still have a way to go with that. Many
of John Dunford’s recommendations cannot be implemented without
looking beyond the role, function and powers of the Children’s
Commissioner and placing duties on public authorities and on Ministers.
We will discuss that in later
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111833000038">The
Children’s Commissioner will be a key force in safeguarding the
rights and welfare of children and it is important that we get it
right. There are three main issues: the appointment of the
commissioner; the independence of the commissioner; and the promotion
of children’s rights. The appointment of the Children’s
Commissioner must be open, transparent and non-political in order for
the commissioner to be sufficiently independent to champion
children’s rights and to have credibility. The Children’s
Commissioner is appointed by the Secretary of State but, as I
understand it, is listed in the code of practice of the Commissioner
for Public Appointments, so Parliament is involved in a pre-hearing
process. However, the UN accreditation committee recommends that the
involvement of Parliaments is provided for on the face of legislation
rather than just being a political commitment. In Scotland and the
Republic of Ireland, it is the national Parliament that appoints the
commissioner. The degree of independence is critical in determining the
success of this role. The new commissioner must be under as few
constraints as possible in determining his or her activities,
timetables and priorities. My amendments would see a clear legislative
statement on such independence, which would bind future
Governments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111833000039">In
another place, MPs considered an amendment to require the Secretary of
State not to interfere with the work of the Children’s
Commissioner. The Government responded that the legislation already
repeals provisions that currently allow the Secretary of State to
direct the commissioner’s work, but that does not go as far as
an explicit prohibition on interference. The Minister in another place
cited the Equality and Human Rights Commission as an example of a body
that is able to act independently. The legislation that set up the EHRC
has similar provisions to those in my amendment. I welcome assurances
that the Government will not interfere with decisions on priorities for
the work of the commissioner, but such an assurance does not bind
future Governments as a clear legislative statement would. The UN
Committee on the Rights of the Child has made it clear that national
human rights institutions for children should meet these
standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111833000040">The
Minister may respond that the commissioner will have full membership of
the European Network of Ombudspeople for Children. This is welcome, but
it is not enough. The Children’s Commissioner should satisfy the
Paris principles to the standard that the Children’s
Commissioner should have the status of a national human rights
institution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111833000041">Amendment
257 sets out criteria for the appointment of the Children’s
Commissioner for England, stating that he or she must have adequate
knowledge and experience in all matters regarding children, must
involve children in decision-making and must be able to act
independently of government. I am aware that this issue was discussed
in another place and that the Minister stated that it would be
desirable to draft the 
<?notus-xml column=340?>person specification at the time of appointment. That is fine so far as
it goes, but setting out in legislation some objective minimum
standards would be preferable to ensure that the person has the right
skills and experience.</hs_para>

amendment required the Secretary of State to have regard to the views
of Parliament and others in appointing the Children’s
Commissioner. The Minister circulated a note to the Public Bill
Committee that set out how the appointment process would work. The
Government indicated that it would not be convention to set out in
legislation that Parliament should consider a particular matter.
Amendment 260 would place a duty on the Secretary of State to have due
regard to the views of any parliamentary committee that has published a
view on a proposed appointment or removal from office of a
Children’s
Commissioner.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111833000043">All
these amendments would support the important principle that the

about independence in support, in particular, of my noble
friend’s Amendment 245. At Second Reading, many noble
Lords raised concerns about the Office of the Children’s
Commissioner for England receiving sufficient funding from government
to carry out its functions effectively. The Minister subsequently wrote
to noble Lords acknowledging the need for sufficient resources to give
effect to the reformed office’s work. He went on to say that
decisions involving funding will always need to be taken in the context
of the prevailing economic circumstances and competing priorities for
public funding. That is understood but, whatever the economic
circumstances, such decisions must not compromise the independence of
the commissioner that my noble friend talked about or his ability
effectively to carry out his work.</hs_para>

therefore set out appropriate safeguards, such as those contained in
Amendment 262. There is a danger that, unless properly
resourced, the changes proposed in the draft legislation will raise
expectations about the commissioner’s potential impact that the
office simply cannot meet. The adequacy of the budget will determine
whether the commissioner is able effectively to promote and protect
children’s rights. According to the UN Committee on the Rights
of the Child, it is the duty of states to make reasonable financial
provision for the operation of national human rights institutions in
the light of Article 4 of the convention. The mandating powers of
national institutions may be meaningless or the exercise of their
powers limited if the national institution does not have the means to
operate effectively to discharge its powers. 
<?notus-xml column=341?>The Paris principles, mentioned by my noble friend, also underline the
importance of ensuring that national human rights institutions have
access to adequate resources. They state:</hs_para>

Dunford review drew attention to the fact that the Children’s
Commissioner had a low budget compared to children’s national
human rights institutions in other jurisdictions. At the time of the
review, this country was spending 24p per child on the
Children’s Commissioner compared to, for example, £1.89
in Ireland —hardly a richer country than this
one—£1.27 in New Zealand and £3.74 in Northern
Ireland. UNICEF undertook a global study of independent human rights
institutions for children. It underlined that independence is the
defining feature of such institutions and that sufficient and sustained
financial resources are key to that independence.</hs_para>

independence, I wish to raise another matter, which has been of concern
to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I am a member. In its
report on the draft clauses preceding the Bill, the JCHR accepted the
need for financial control of and public accountability for the public
money spent by the Children’s Commissioner but was concerned
about whether the degree of financial control exerted by the Government
through the standard NDPB framework agreement was compatible with the
requirement in the Paris principles that national human rights
institutions should not be subject to financial control that might
affect their independence. It therefore called, in December 2012, for

independence from executive

Government in their response promised to review the framework agreement
in light of the committee’s comments and to make a copy of the
revised document available for scrutiny. No new framework agreement had
been published by the time the Bill was introduced, however. In the
JCHR’s report on the Bill in June this year, it recommended that
all the changes that had been made to the framework agreement between
the Equality and Human Rights Commission and DCMS in order to safeguard
the EHRC’s accreditation as an “A” status national
human rights institution should also be made to the Children’s
Commissioner’s framework agreement and it again asked for the
revised framework agreement to be made available for scrutiny before
the Bill reached Committee in the
Lords.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111833000050">With
Committee stage fast approaching, but still no revised framework
agreement published, the JCHR wrote again to the Minister on 30
October, asking the Government to make every effort to arrive at a
revised agreement with the Children’s Commissioner and to make
it available to Parliament before today’s debate on the proposed
amendments to the Bill concerning the commissioner’s
independence. Notwithstanding that request—or requests, in the
plural—the Government have still not published a revised
agreement. Towards 
<?notus-xml column=342?>the end of last week, they published and circulated
a note summarising the main changes that will need to be made to the
framework agreement when the Bill comes into force. These
include a number of exemptions from efficiency controls that
have been made in the EHRC’s revised framework agreement, which
the Government say that they will “seek to replicate” in
the Children’s Commissioner’s framework
agreement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111833000051">The
Government’s stated willingness to replicate the changes made to
the EHRC’s framework agreement is welcome, but it is most
regrettable that the revised agreement itself is still not available.
As so often, the devil is in the detail. It will not be possible for
Parliament to be sure that the framework agreement is compatible with
the Paris principles until it has seen the text. It is not clear, for
example, how the requirement of government approval of the
commissioner’s marketing and advertising plan is compatible with
independence when, as I understand it, efficiency controls, which must
be satisfied for the plan to be approved, require such expenditure to
be essential for the Government’s objectives, not the
commissioner’s.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111833000052">The
same issue was resolved with the EHRC. I hope that it can be so with
the Office of the Children’s Commissioner. Will the Minister
give noble Lords his reassurance that he will discuss the detail of the
framework agreement with the Office of the Children’s
Commissioner as soon as possible and make a draft of the revised
agreement available before Report, so that noble Lords can be satisfied
on this crucial question of independence from inappropriate executive
control?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_18_PT_1/9CAA0A38C1C6B656AEF47A5A8049559D71C01AFA" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 November 2013">Monday,

Ramsbotham (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I support Amendment 245 in
particular. In doing so, I hope that the Committee will allow me to
reflect on the comparisons between the commissioner and my own former
position as Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Prisons.</hs_para>

inspectors of public sector organisations, the Chief Inspector of
Prisons deliberately does not come from that service, in order to
ensure complete objectivity and independence. The Chief Inspector of
Constabulary is a policeman; the Chief Inspector of Probation has been
a probation person, and so on. What was also interesting was that I was
a Crown servant, not a civil servant, which gave me another degree of
independence. I would like to see the Children’s Commissioner
given exactly the same status in order to emphasise that point. It does
not in any way lessen your responsibilities and it certainly does not
lessen your
access.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111833000055">It is
also important to realise that, again in parallel with the Chief
Inspector of Prisons, you are the quality assurer. You are there to
assure the quality of the delivery of children’s rights in this
particular case. Quality assurance carries with it a certain amount of
responsibility but it also carries a requirement to have sufficient
resources to be able to do that. I have to say that, after talking to
the Children’s Commissioner and looking at her responsibilities,
I do not think that she is adequately resourced to be able to carry out
effectively the role of quality assurer of children’s
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0001.htm#13111833000056">I have
just come from taking part in the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and
Policing Bill, where we are talking about injunctions for children aged
10 and 
<?notus-xml column=343?>upwards, in addition to the anti-social behaviour
orders for children aged 10 and upwards, and the importance of ensuring
that there is no postcode lottery in that and that they are overseen
fairly and consistently by local government around the country. Who is
going to do that? It seems to me that the one person who is, and will
have the responsibility to do so, is the Children’s
Commissioner. I do not see why it could not be added to his or her
responsibilities. Having seen some of the excellent reports that have
come out recently from the Office of the Children’s
Commissioner—in particular the one about the effects of acquired
brain injury and neurodevelopment, which I think is a model; not to
mention the very effective report on the work of mother and baby units
in women’s prisons—I think it is very important that
someone should look in greater detail than I think the Dunford report
did at some of the peripherals that come with the responsibility for
quality
assurance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000057">I
welcome the other amendments in this group, which seek to do that, but
I am just a little nervous about the Children’s Commissioner
having to report to too many separate committees in the other place.
Yes, of course, human rights are involved but in dealing with children
we are dealing not just with education but with health, justice and the
Department for Work and Pensions because of various payments; we are
also dealing with the Department for Communities and Local Government.
It worries me that we should be specifying two particular committees
out of many. I do not think we want to complicate the chain of
reporting for the quality assurer on children’s rights. We ought
to tease this out in this Committee, and possibly make recommendations
about the clear chain that we see through to the Minister, to whom the
commissioner will be reporting.</hs_para>

about the suggestion that the reporting annually to Parliament should
not go through a Minister. The reason for that is that when the prisons
inspectorate was set up there was a requirement for the Home Secretary
to publish a reply to every list of recommendations made by the chief
inspector. For the Children’s Commissioner to be properly
effective, the Minister must reply so that one can see what is going to
be done to maintain the momentum of improvements and observations that
the commissioner makes.</hs_para>

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, I will not speak in detail about the
amendments but I should like to express my general support for anything
that strengthens the independence of the Children’s

the Bill considerably improves the powers and duties of the
commissioner. I very much welcome that.</hs_para>

important that the commissioner has appropriate resources with which to
carry out those improved powers and duties. The noble Baroness,

the commissioner spends his or her money, where is the independence?

Massey said—and the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, expanded
forcefully on—the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has
made it clear that national human rights institutions for children,
including children’s commissioners, should be established in
compliance with the Paris principles, which were adopted more than 20
years ago by the UN General Assembly. These minimum standards provide
guidance for the establishment, competence, responsibilities and
composition—including pluralism, independence, methods of
operation and quasi-judicial activities—of such national bodies.
These recommendations underpin the amendments that I am supporting. The

Butler-Sloss (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I have also put my name to
three amendments and support the others in this group. It is absolutely
crucial that the appointment of the Children’s Commissioner is
taken very seriously, particularly that it should be somebody 
<?notus-xml column=345?>who can be genuinely independent of Government. May I
suggest—perhaps unpopularly to any Government —that it
requires someone who is prepared to be a thorn in the flesh. We do not
want anyone who would be a yes-man or a yes-woman. Splendidly, the
present Children’s Commissioner is certainly not that. I know
her well and I have huge respect for her, but she does not have enough
funding to do what she has to do and she certainly cannot do anything
else.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111833000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000068">If I
may relay a short anecdote: the noble Lord, Lord McColl of Dulwich, and
I managed to be persuaded by the Government not to pursue an amendment
in an earlier Bill on getting a children’s legal advocate for
trafficked children, on the basis that the Children’s
Commissioner would investigate what happened to a child who was
identified as trafficked from the moment of identification to the point
at which the child would be able to be settled, one way or another.
That promise was made outside the Chamber. The Children’s
Commissioner then said, “I cannot do this job. I do not have the
money”. The noble Lord, Lord McColl, and I went to see her and
discussed it with her. There was, with the Children’s Society
and the Refugee Council, a shortened, abbreviated and, despite all
their efforts, inadequate investigation, because it did not do what the
Children’s Commissioner would have done, which was to take it
from day one of identification through to the moment when the child
would be settled. They did their best with very limited
funding.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111833000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000069">This
was absolutely the sort of thing that should have been done by the
Children’s Commissioner and the Children’s Commissioner
would like to have done it, but the resources were not there. This is
just one example. I know we lack money and that this is
difficult, but children matter—they absolutely matter—and
the Children’s Commissioner matters. He or she must be
independent and properly appointed as somebody who really knows what he
or she is doing. As the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, has just said, the
Children’s Commissioner must be able to consult the children and
bring their voice into decision-making—as this commissioner has
done in an excellent way. For those reasons, I strongly support these
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000070"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hughes of Stretford" PimsId="5818" UID="13111833000229" xid="2080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000229">Baroness
Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> My Lords, we have heard some very
powerful arguments in favour of strengthening the process of
appointment and the independence of the commissioner. I am not going to
rehearse all the arguments that have been put very ably by my noble
friend Lady Massey and everybody in the Committee. Now that we are
several years on and there has been a review of the role of the
Children’s Commissioner, it is right that we take this
opportunity to see how that role can be strengthened. It is the right
time to do this based on our experience and the outcomes of that
review. I support the amendments in this group in general and will
speak to Amendments 255A, 258, 259 and 261 in my name and
that of my noble friend Lady Jones.</hs_para>

261 reflect other amendments in this group, by stipulating the
involvement of various parliamentarians and requiring the Secretary of
State to consider their views on the process and the detail of
appointments, or to have their consent to 
<?notus-xml column=346?>appoint. All those issues reflect the concern of the
committee to make sure that there is a wide involvement of different
groups, so that we get it
right.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13111833000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000208">6.30

I will focus particularly on Amendment 255A, which is
slightly different and deals with the other important dimension here,
which is accountability. It would enshrine in law an accountability not
to government but to Parliament, through instituting an annual public
hearing by the Joint Committee on Human Rights on the
Children’s Commissioner, on how he or she had been exercising
his or her duties and functions. I take the point made by the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that one would not want the commissioner to have
to speak to a plethora of committees. However, for the reasons he
identified—namely, the scope of the remit of the
Children’s Commissioner, which covers a wide range of factors
that can affect children’s lives: health, education, the
criminal justice system, the immigration laws, and so on—the
Joint Committee on Human Rights might be the right place to examine
that whole range of issues, in so far as she has looked at them in the
previous year. I think that any Children’s Commissioner would
welcome that. Certainly, the current one is not against that proposal.
I am interested to hear the Minister’s views on
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000073">Since
some of our amendments were tabled, the Minister has issued two notes:
one on the appointment process and one on the impact of the Bill on the
framework agreement. The note on the appointment goes some way to
identifying the detail of the process, and the involvement of various
groups, including children and young people. However, can the Minister
deal with the point that envisages that where the Select Committee
recommends that the Secretary of State’s preferred candidate
should not be appointed, the Secretary of State would be obliged to
take account of the committee’s view but not be bound by it?
There is a further possible step: in those circumstances it would be
right for the Secretary of State to have to explain publicly, and in
writing, the reasons why he was not acting in accordance with the views
of the Select
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000074">Secondly,
on the impact of the Bill on the framework agreement, I echo the point
made by my noble friend Lady Lister about why we do not have the
framework agreement in front of us, so that we can actually look at the
detail, rather than a document about a possible framework agreement.
There are two points that I ask the Minister to clarify. In paragraph
3, the note says
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13111833000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000176">“the

views?</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13111833000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000076">In
paragraph 5, it is envisaged that the commissioner will be required to
produce an annual report for Parliament, but not where and by whom that
annual report will be considered. I refer the Minister to our Amendment
255A, which proposes that the report be the basis of an annual hearing
by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Can the Minister say whether he
shares that view?</hs_para>

final point about these two notes, and in support of a number of the
amendments, is that they are just notes: they do not, as far as I know,
have any status. It may be that the Government will adhere to these
notes, but they do not have to, and no future Government would be bound
by them. They have no status, which is an argument for the Government
accepting at least some of the amendments we are considering today, so

Eccles (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I will be
leading on another group of amendments and will try not
to duplicate anything, but it is very urgent that the
Government clarify what they believe the position of the
Children’s Commissioner to have been and what they believe it is
going to be. In principle, nothing is changed by the Bill in front of
us—there is an extension of words but nothing is changed. The
Children’s Commissioner is a corporation sole, which
is quite a strange type of institution and not necessarily much beloved
by the Treasury, but there you are, that is what the Children’s
Commissioner is. The Children’s Commissioner has, I think, 27
staff and a budget of just over £2 million, or under £2.5
million. The office is one-tenth the size of the Equality and Human
Rights Commission, which has just been reduced in size by quite a large
amount but remains 10 times the size of the Office of the
Children’s Commissioner. That is a nationally accredited human
rights institution. There is a question as to whether we want two,
which I will raise in more detail in the next group of
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000079">The
fact of the matter is that the Children’s Commissioner has been
really rather successful. It is a thorn in the flesh, to quote the
noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. It has
freewheeled pretty well on a very small platform and produced some very
interesting work. It can produce only recommendations it has no power
to make anybody do anything except write back to it under the 2004 Act
to tell it, “Thank you for telling us what you told
us and this is what we are going to do about it”. It has no
executive authority at all. Do the Government intend that it should
have any executive authority? I cannot see any in the Bill. It seems to
me that some of the comment on what might or might not
happen has got rather ahead of the Government’s game, and we are
looking for clarity from the Government as to what they intend and what
they
expect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000080">The
noble Baroness, Lady Lister, raised a very interesting point about
raising expectations and then disappointing them. That is one of the
reasons why the electorate are being turned off election after
election: the Westminster system has a brilliant way of raising
expectations and then disappointing them. I hope that this will not be
another example, because it is not a good idea that it should be. There
are some very serious questions here about resources, about what the
role is and about what the Government expect of the Children’s
Commissioner. I do not think that we have had answers as yet to those
questions. I hope to hear them from my noble friend on the Front
Bench.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000081"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Nash" PimsId="7004" UID="13111833000231" xid="2171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000231">Lord
Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 245, 255A
and 257 through to 262 deal with issues related to
the Children’s Commissioner’s independence.
The 
<?notus-xml column=348?>independence of the commissioner is an important
point of principle—and it is helpful to have this discussion, so
that I may provide noble Lords with some assurances. I am grateful to
all noble Lords involved in raising these issues, especially the noble
Baroness, Lady Massey, my noble friend Lord Lester and the noble
Baroness, Lady Lister, for speaking on his behalf—all of whom I
know have long been passionate champions in relation to
children’s rights.</hs_para>

that a “perceived” lack of independence from government
had affected the Children’s Commissioner’s credibility
and, following his review, he made various recommendations to counter
those perceptions. The Government have acted on his recommendations in
full. We have removed the provisions that allowed the Secretary of
State to direct the commissioner and the requirement for the
commissioner to consult the Secretary of State. We are changing the
terms of appointment to a single, six-year term, to remove the
potential for political influence through the reappointment process. We
have also made provision for direct contact between the commissioner
and Parliament, including the laying of the annual report directly
before Parliament and the ability of the commissioner to raise matters
directly with
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000083">I
thank noble Lords who have spoken to Amendment 245 and give
assurances that the Bill already provides that the commissioner has
complete freedom in deciding his or her activities, timetables and
priorities; under the primary function, it is made explicit that the
commissioner has a free hand to investigate any matter relating to the
rights or interests of children. Having carried out an investigation,
the commissioner is free to make any recommendation that he or she
deems appropriate.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13111833000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000084">It is true that as a
non-departmental public body, the OCC is subject to some controls in
relation to its spending. These controls apply to all NDPBs and are
designed to ensure value for money for the taxpayer and to avoid
unnecessary public spending at a time when the Government are seeking
to reduce the budget deficit. Extremely important though the role of
Children’s Commissioner is, I do not think that she should be
completely exempt from these controls. However, where the commissioner
has sought an exemption or relaxation from these arrangements and has
demonstrated that they could compromise his or her independence, those
requests have been granted. This arrangement seems to be working well
and we see no need to change
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000085">The
Government agree that the Children’s Commissioner should be
accountable to Parliament through his or her annual report and are
therefore grateful that the Joint Committee on Human Rights has made a
commitment to hold an annual evidence session to scrutinise the
commissioner’s work. I share the noble Lord’s concerns
about overburdening the commissioner with reports to parliamentary
committees but it is important for his or her independence that the
commissioner is not accountable to the Secretary of State or another
Minister. That is why we have welcomed the offer from the JCHR to hold
an annual debate. This will be an opportunity for Parliament to ask
questions and raise issues with the commissioner and, in turn, the
committee will be able to raise matters with all the relevant
Secretaries of State.</hs_para>

259, 260 and 261 in this group concern the appointment of the
commissioner, any dismissal of the commissioner and the involvement of
Parliament in these processes. The role of the Children’s
Commissioner is an important one and I fully accept that the
appointment and dismissal procedures need to be fair and transparent.
However, I do not think that it is necessary or appropriate to define
the conditions for either process further than is already done in the
legislation.</hs_para>

in the other place on how the appointment process is expected to work.
That note explains that the appointment of the commissioner would be in
accordance with the Office of the Commissioner for Public
Appointments’ code of practice. This ensures that candidates are
appointed on merit, following a fair and open recruitment
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000088">The
note also clarifies that children will be involved in the recruitment
process and that we would expect Parliament, through one of its
committees, to have a role in agreeing the job description and carrying
out a pre-appointment hearing. However, the OCPA code of practice is
clear that the parliamentary committee undertaking the pre-appointment
hearing should not have a right of veto on the appointment. To pick up
the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, about the Secretary
of State explaining publicly if he disagrees with the Select Committee,
I do not think it appropriate for such a public debate to take place
about the suitability of
candidates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000089">In
addition, I do not consider that legislation is the right place to set
out the personal qualities needed for the role. These will be
determined by the panel that is established to lead the appointment
process, which is chaired by an independent assessor appointed by OCPA,
and subject to quality assurance by Parliament. I hope that this
provides the necessary
assurances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000090">On
dismissal, the existing provisions represent a high threshold. A
dismissal could potentially be subject to judicial review and
overturned if it was found to have been made
inappropriately. The courts provide ample protection against the
commissioner being dismissed on arbitrary grounds. I would expect the
Secretary of State to want to consult the chair of a
relevant parliamentary committee before taking such a drastic action.
However, there may well be reasons why such matters would need to be
treated in confidence. I hope that noble Lords are reassured that both
the appointments and dismissal processes currently in place are fair
and transparent without the need for further prescription in
legislation.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_18_PT_1/D968B020B53A3D34958A9BC5071E31FFC51B71B2" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 November 2013">Monday,

262 tabled by my noble friend Lord Lester and the noble Baronesses,
Lady Howe, Lady O’Loan and Lady Lister, concerns the funding of
the commissioner. I recognise, of course, that without sufficient
funding the commissioner may be hampered in fulfilling his or her role.
The Paris principles advise that an organisation such as the
commissioner’s should have a budget that is sufficient to allow
it to have an adequate infrastructure, staff and premises. Despite the
economic pressures of the past few years, the 
<?notus-xml column=350?>Government have gone out of their way to ensure that
the commissioner’s budget meets these conditions. I can assure
the Committee that we intend this to
continue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000092">I
understand that my noble friend Lord Lester would like to see greater
certainty for this commitment by placing it in primary legislation.
However, it is important that we do not commit future Governments to
spending commitments when we do not know what economic conditions will
prevail. The commissioner’s office cannot be immune from the
same financial pressures that all other publicly funded bodies may face
in the future. With regard to budgets, the Government must clearly act
in a way which is reasonable and which reflects the roles and
responsibilities of the commissioner. The Government will always listen
to the views of Parliament on this or any other matter and will
consider them very carefully before reaching a

with that. We have experience of two commissioners, both of whom have
put the voice of the child at the centre of activity and have done
significant work with vulnerable children. The Minister listed some
things that the Children’s Commissioner could do. However, as

Government are not exclusively depending on John Dunford. His report

another occasion, maybe on Report, I will want to have a longer
discussion about independence. I will confine myself to saying that
arm’s-length relationships between public bodies and the
Government are twisted arm’s-length relationships, and if you
are funded by public money there is no such thing as independence in
the true meaning of the word. If you consider the American War of

just make the comment that John Dunford did his report on his own, in
five months; he is a very able man. He did not have any peer

two background thoughts when I raise these issues. One is the size of
the superstructure that we have built in recent years on top of what
is, to me, the front line, which has been very frequently mentioned
during our debates. This is a very big superstructure, starting with
the United Nations—190 signatories, not including the United
States of America; some 70 of them have a national human
rights institution. The expert committee in Geneva gets a report every
five years. We last sent ours in 2008. The next one is going in 2014,
which seems to be six years, not five, and there may be some message in
that. That draft report is 200 pages long. It is sponsored
by the department present here today, which has to get evidence from
the whole of the rest of government, as the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham,
mentioned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000106">My
second amendment is also a probing amendment. I just wanted to remind
myself that everybody is concerned with the human rights of children.

our commissioner a rights-based commissioner for the first time and I

Amendment 250 is to clarify the commissioner’s primary
functions. I believe that the legislation should grant the Children's
Commissioner all the powers that a national human rights institution
should have. These are specified by the Office of the High Commissioner
for Human Rights and by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.
There are two essential functions that are not listed in Clause 79.
They are: raising public awareness of children’s rights by
promoting knowledge of and respect for them; and initiating and
participating in certain legal proceedings regarding specific cases of
children.</hs_para>

another place, when a similar amendment was discussed, the Minister
stated that this list should not include activities that are already
implicit in the commissioner’s primary functions, and that the
list was intended to describe her or his broad remit rather than being
exhaustive. However, the fact is that the list that is contained in
Clause 79 already includes many 
<?notus-xml column=354?>powers that one might describe as implicit in the
Commissioner’s primary functions. So why refuse to include these
two? It suggests that they do not belong there. I ask my noble friend
the Minister to set my mind at rest by making it quite clear to the
Committee that the Government believe that the two powers in my
amendment are indeed implicit in the broad remit of the commissioner
and that, therefore, they may be seen to be on a par with those that
are included in the list in Clause
79.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000116">Legal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T19:01:03"></hs_TimeCode>
proceedings are difficult for children, so they need their commissioner
to be able, in a few very special cases, to be able to take their
place. The current commissioner has made it clear that she does not
consider this to be something she would expect to do a lot of, but she
needs the power in a few cases. Also, I emphasise that raising
awareness of children’s rights is crucial to ensuring they are
implemented.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000117">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T19:01:26"></hs_TimeCode>
254 amends Clause 85, which introduces an expectation that the
Children’s Commissioner will report on his or her activities in
relation to children’s rights. I very much welcome this clause
but would like to strengthen it with a requirement that the
commissioner should monitor the implementation of the UNCRC in England
and report on the state of children’s rights across the country,
rather than just write about his or her own activities. Again, the UN
Committee on the Rights of the Child, in General Comment No. 2 in 2002,
made it clear that independent national human rights institutions for
children should:</hs_para>

255 strengthens the voice of the child in this section. Given that the
commissioner’s role is to promote and protect children’s
rights, it is vital that children and young people are involved in all
aspects of the office’s work. I welcome the fact that the
commissioner must take all reasonable steps to involve children in the
work but, to comply with Article 12 of the UNCRC, he or she must also
give due regard to their views. That is why my amendment says that the
commissioner’s annual report must include the extent to which
due regard has been given to children’s views. It is all very
well receiving their views, but they must be seen to be acted
on.</hs_para>

256 extends the definition of vulnerable children in Clause 86 to
include trafficked and unaccompanied migrant children and children in
custody. Clause 86 lists four groups of children living away from home
or receiving social care for whom the commissioner’s office will
have responsibility, now that the post of Children’s Rights
Director is to be incorporated into the OCCE. While appreciating the
statement by the Minister in another place that the 
<?notus-xml column=355?>Government wish to ring-fence the groups that
currently come under the remit of the Children’s Rights
Director, I have confidence that the OCCE will continue to represent
these children. This is not, therefore, an adequate reason for

list in Clause
86<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T19:04:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

well qualified Children’s Commissioner will be perfectly capable
of identifying which groups of children should be regarded as

those in custody, it would certainly make the matter very clear if my
amendment were to be incorporated in the Bill—or if I get a
clear statement from the Minister. Alternatively, perhaps my noble
friend can explain that all the children covered by Amendment 256 are
included in the duties and powers of the reformed

which the Bill already strengthens the role of the Children’s

it harks back to the Children’s Commissioner not having sole
responsibility for children’s rights. Others have expressed
powerful convictions that all children have rights, even though the
rights of vulnerable children—for example, asylum seekers,
trafficked children or those in custody—are sometimes neglected.
What really concerns me here is that we seem to fail to grasp the issue
of listening to children and seeking their contribution to improving
systems which should work for them. I cannot understand why. Involving
children in these matters which affect them has at least two functions:
it not only helps children feel engaged and more likely to respond
positively but helps make systems and structures better. It makes for
better decisions about children. As I have said before, we have become
better at listening to children and young people, but it is
inconsistent. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, will know the answer to
this much better than I do, but I wonder how much young people in
custody are consulted. From all I hear, not very
much.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13111833000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000133">Concern

mentioned earlier the <I>Every Child Matters</I> report. Schools were
at the centre of that and I want to give an example of how schools can
improve school life and achievement by listening to, respecting and
valuing the contribution of children. UNICEF’s Rights Respecting
Schools programme is a resounding success according to an independent

seems to me that any organisational system functions better if those
within the system are consulted and involved. Children are totally
capable of having a view about what is best for them, and many
organisations—not only schools but children’s services,
health services and youth clubs—do consult children and are the
better for it. The state has an opportunity to task other bodies with
the job of promoting and protecting children’s rights. A duty on

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment
251. It would allow the Children’s Commissioner to conduct an
investigation into the case of an individual child in specific
circumstances which enable the commissioner to fulfil his or her
primary purpose, which is defined as his or her strategic role. This
principle, which underpins the existence of the Office of the

pursuit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000138">We
believe that the current proposed wording serves to undermine the
ability of the commissioner to work strategically. Five years ago,
Meltem Avcil, a 14 year-old girl, slashed her wrists when her bail
application was turned down when she was detained at
Yarl’s Wood detention centre. After self-harming, the child was
handcuffed to a hospital bed. The then Children’s Commissioner
for England, Al Aynsley-Green, investigated her case of self-harm. His
report concluded that detaining the child for 80 days had amounted to
inhuman treatment and recommended public policy changes to avoid such
events occurring in the future. This is just one example of where the
ability to investigate an individual case has advanced the strategic
work of the Children’s
Commissioner.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000139">Another

to when it is judged that they can genuinely advance the
commissioner’s strategic role. Furthermore, the wording of our

249A was tabled by my noble friend Lord Eccles, who asked how we are
strengthening the commissioner’s function. We believe that
amending the commissioner’s primary function to one of promoting
and protecting children’s rights is, as my noble friend Lady
Walmsley and the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, said, an important step
forward in establishing the OCC as a credible organisation that meets
the key requirements expected of human rights institutions. There is
much support for our proposals. For example, in its report following
pre-legislative scrutiny, the Joint Committee on Human Rights described
the proposed new remit of the commissioner
as,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13111836000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000048">“a

way in which the primary function is described matters. The lack of a
statutory rights-based remit is the main reason why the
Children’s Commissioner has, to date, only been
accepted as an associate, rather than full, member of the European
Network of
Commissioners.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13111836000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000003">I
turn now to Amendment 250, which was tabled by my noble friend Lady
Walmsley, to whom I pay tribute for her effective and long-standing
work on children’s rights. I agree with her that part of the
commissioner’s role should be to raise awareness of
children’s rights. However, in determining what activities to
set out in the Bill, our approach has been to avoid including
activities that are already implicit within the commissioner’s
primary function, and we believe that raising public awareness of
children’s rights is an inherent part of the
commissioner’s new primary function of promoting and protecting
children’s
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111836000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000004">The
commissioner can intervene in legal cases where he or she has a
sufficient interest in the matter before the courts. Indeed, the
commissioner has used her current powers to intervene in a number of
legal cases in the past. However, the effect of the proposed amendment
could be to create an expectation that the commissioner would respond
to every request to intervene in legal matters that he or she receives.
I do not believe that this would be helpful. In his review, John
Dunford gave an example of another commissioner who had instigated
legal proceedings to take a particular children’s rights issue
to the courts which were unsuccessful and costly. This is not something
we would want to
encourage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111836000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000005">Turning
to Amendment 251, I assure noble Lords that there is nothing in the
Bill that prevents the commissioner talking to individual children or
using evidence drawn from the cases of individual children to inform
the primary function. In fact, it is hard to imagine that the
commissioner could investigate a matter strategically without using
evidence from individual cases to support his or her
findings.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111836000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000006">As
noble Lords will be aware, where the commissioner makes recommendations
under the primary function, he or she can require a written response
setting out how those recommendations will be addressed. Amendment 253,
tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, seeks to make similar provision
in respect of the separate advice and assistance function. This role is
currently provided by the Children’s Rights Director to the
children within his remit and is intended to be an informal,
light-touch service. It may involve as little as a telephone call to
the DCS in a local authority, and the amendment therefore runs the risk
of overformalising what is working well as an informal
process.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111836000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000007">I
fully recognise that other groups of children are vulnerable and in
need of extra support, including those mentioned in Amendment 256.
However, I do not believe that this means that we should include them
in the definition set out in Clause 86—the purpose of which is
to provide a definition of the children who currently fall within the
Children’s Rights Director’s remit—so that other
provisions in the Bill can be applied specifically to that group of
children. Clause 86 is not an attempt to define vulnerable
children for the purposes of the commissioner’s primary function
and there is therefore no reason to include other groups of vulnerable
children within it, as the Bill makes clear  
<?notus-xml column=361?>through the provision in Clause 79. When determining how best to
discharge the primary function, the commissioner must have particular
regard

am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, for highlighting in
Amendment 252 the importance of the UNCRC to the commissioner’s
primary function. Our view is that, in exercising his or her primary
function, the commissioner would be expected to take account of all
children’s rights that are relevant. This would include the
UNCRC and its optional protocols that the UK has ratified, rights set
out in other international treaties and rights within domestic law.
However, we also recognise that the UNCRC is central to the
children’s rights arena and so make an explicit reference to the
UNCRC in the Bill. We believe that this represents the best
formulation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111836000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000009">Turning
to Amendment 252A, it is our clear intention that the
commissioner’s work should be informed by the views and
interests of children. As well as the overarching requirement to
involve children as set out in new Section 2B(1) of the Children Act,
the Bill includes requirements on the commissioner to: make children
aware of the his or her role and how they can contact him or her;
consult children on the commissioner’s forward plans, before
finalising his or her business plan for the year ahead; and to report
on the action he or she has taken to involve children in his or her

requirements, the commissioner will be required to take particular
steps to involve children whom he or she considers have fewer
opportunities to make their views known. I am sure that noble Lords
will therefore agree that the Bill includes ample provision for
children to be involved in the commissioner’s activities and to
influence his or her agenda. We agree that this should include a wide
range of children’s views but we do not think it is feasible to
include a requirement to involve all children, which Amendment 252A
seeks to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111836000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000011">With
respect to reporting on the extent to which children enjoy the rights
set out in the UNCRC, I note that in response to a recommendation by
the Joint Committee on Human Rights, we have made it clear that
monitoring implementation of the UNCRC is within the scope of the
commissioner’s remit. Amendment 254 goes further than
this, however, and creates an expectation that the commissioner would
conduct an annual review of UNCRC implementation. This would be a
significant undertaking and place a burden on the commissioner’s
office that would inevitably divert resources away from other
priorities. We have no objection to the commissioner carrying out an
annual review but do not think that he or she should be required to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111836000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000012">I agree it
is important that the Children’s Commissioner should not just
consult children but take their views into consideration, but I am not
persuaded that Amendment 255 is necessary. The commissioner’s
primary function includes promoting awareness of the views and
interests of children, and it is difficult to imagine how a
commissioner could carry out that function 
<?notus-xml column=362?>without taking account of those views. Reporting on
how he or she has done so is a matter of good practice and therefore it
is expected that this would happen without having the requirement to

Amendment 266A, it is important that any organisation or agency gives
due regard to children’s rights and views when planning or

action to support children’s development and well-being across
all aspects of their lives should be planned and delivered. The UK
Government act as a state party for the whole of the UK and have
formally signed and ratified the UNCRC. This means that the UK is
already under an obligation to comply with its terms and conditions and
to give due regard to it. We take these responsibilities very seriously
and are held to account for them periodically by the UN committee. As
my noble friend Lord Eccles said, we are due to submit a report to the
UN committee early next year on the implementation of the UNCRC across

noble Baronesses will also be aware that to remove any possible
uncertainty about our commitment to the UNCRC, in 2010, the coalition

The UNCRC has been a prism through which we have considered many of the
new measures being introduced through the Bill. Our consideration of
the provisions in the light of the European Convention on Human Rights

are grateful to the Office of the Children’s Commissioner for

amendment also raises the wider question of a UNCRC duty on other parts
of the public sector. The Government have issued statutory guidance to
directors of children’s services and local authority lead
members for children’s services about this. The guidance states
that they should have regard to the UNCRC and ensure that children and
young people are involved in 
<?notus-xml column=363?>the development and delivery of local services. I recognise that
practice still varies across different parts of government and
different parts of the public sector. This is likely to be true
regardless of whether there is a duty or not. However, there will be
lots of opportunities for public sector actions to be challenged.
Reforms we are making to the Children’s Commissioner, for
example, will strengthen his or her powers to investigate matters and
bring them directly to the attention of Parliament. I welcome the offer
from the Joint Committee on Human Rights to have an annual discussion
about the commission’s work on children’s
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111836000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000018">I am

Eccles:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to all
those who took part and to the Minister for his reply. At the risk of
repeating myself, you can strengthen a mandate, but that is not the
same as strengthening the organisation which has to carry
the mandate out. If I remember rightly, John Dunford joined in the
disappointment with the way that the Children’s Commissioner
operated until 2010. I think that disappointment, if it is shared, will
continue because the Government’s answers are that business will
continue as usual. I make no negative or positive comment on that. I
just wish I knew whether that was the correct interpretation in the
view of the Government. In particular, the relationship of the
Children’s Commissioner with the Equality and Human Rights
Commission is very important. If they are going to co-operate, work
together and do things jointly, there is a strong case for leaving the
Children’s Commissioner pretty open, pretty freewheeling and
able to look at whatever the commissioner thinks should be looked at
and to make recommendations as a result of that work, which is what has
been happening and, in my view, has happened 
<?notus-xml column=364?>rather successfully. I do not want to stand in criticism; I just wish I
knew what the Government really expect so that we could understand what
they expect and out there the public could understand what they could
really expect. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

topic of children in cars where people are smoking has been around for
some time. The amendment puts the onus of responsibility on the person
in charge—that is, the driver of the vehicle. Children who are
strapped into a car—as they have to be by law, for their
protection—have little or no control over the smoking behaviour
of adults in their presence. The British Lung Foundation did a survey
of 1,000 children aged eight to 15: 51% had been exposed to cigarette
smoke in the car. Of those who had been exposed, 31% reported having
asked the people smoking to stop, but 34% were too frightened or
embarrassed to ask even though they wanted the person not to
smoke.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000150">Smoking
in a car is a particular concern because it is a confined space. We all
know the hazards of passive smoking. Indeed, we have legislated against
it. What we are now doing, however, is leaving children at higher risk
than adults were exposed to before. Research has
shown that a single cigarette smoked in a moving 
<?notus-xml column=366?>car with a window half open exposes a child in the
centre of the back seat to around two-thirds as much second-hand smoke
as in an average smoke-filled pub, in the bad old days when people
smoked in pubs. Importantly, however, if someone is smoking in a
stationary car with the windows closed, the level increases to 11 times
that of a smoky
pub.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000151">There
is clear evidence that cigarette smoke damages children’s lungs.
They have smaller, more fragile lungs; they breathe more quickly and
their immune system is less developed. It has been estimated that there
are more than 165 new episodes of diseases of all types in children
caused by passive smoking, which they are exposed to in such high
concentrations primarily in cars, although they may also be exposed at
home. This has been estimated to culminate, tragically, in about
40 sudden infant deaths a year, quite apart from about
300,000 primary care consultations and almost 10,000 hospital
admissions. It costs us £23 million a year in primary care
visits and hospital treatment, particularly asthma treatment. There is
a catalogue of case reports about children who have had such severe
asthma that they have suffered respiratory arrest. When the parent has
stopped smoking in the car—the environment in which the child
was exposed—their asthma has improved enough to be controlled.
The Department of Health ran a two-month marketing campaign to try to
raise awareness but I suggest that the next step has to be
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111833000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111833000152">Children
are a protected party in law. Seatbelt-wearing rates increased in the
UK from 25% to 91% after legislation was introduced
alongside awareness campaigns. Children want this legislation: in the
British Lung Foundation survey in 2011, 86% of children aged eight to
15 said they wanted the Government to introduce a law to protect them
from cigarette smoke in a car. That is almost nine in 10 children. In
another survey, done on Mumsnet, 86% of respondents supported a ban,
including 83% of those who were themselves smokers. An ASH-YouGov
survey of public opinion showed 78% out of more than 10,000 respondents
saying they would support a ban in cars carrying children under 18,
even though over 60% of those respondents were themselves
smokers.</hs_para>

the Committee’s notice that Amendments 263 and 264
are cross-party and Cross-Bench amendments and follow the precedent set
by the introduction of smoke-free legislation in 2006, which your
Lordships will remember was passed overwhelmingly on a free vote in
both Houses of Parliament. Tobacco control should not be a
party-political matter but the common concern of everyone who cares
about the health and well-being of the public. To prove that point, the
House of Commons held an excellent Back-Bench debate on the very issue
of standard packaging the week before last, initiated by the
Conservative MP for Harrow East, Bob Blackman. The <I>Hansard</I>

packaging was widely supported by speakers in all parties.</hs_para>

aware that earlier this year it appeared that the Government would
themselves legislate for standard packaging, as both the then Secretary
of State for Health and the Minister for Public Health were convinced
of its value as a means of discouraging children and young people from
taking up this lethal habit. For reasons which I still do not fully
understand, no government Bill has been forthcoming. However,
fortunately, with the help of the Public Bill Office—to whom I
am most grateful—it proved possible to propose a new clause for
the Bill on the basis that this is a measure that will improve the
health of children and
families.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111836000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000024">Let

smokers start when they are teenagers. Two-thirds of existing smokers
report that they started before their 18th birthday, and about two in
five before they were 16. That is despite the fact that the direct sale
of cigarettes to minors is now unlawful. Using official data, Cancer
Research UK statisticians have calculated that, in 2011, more than
200,000 young people under the age of 16 started to smoke. Secondly,
the younger the age at which smokers start, the greater the harm is
likely to be, because early uptake of the habit is associated with
subsequent heavier smoking, higher levels of dependency, a lower chance
of quitting and a higher chance of death from smoking-related diseases.
Thirdly, smoking rates are higher among poor communities and vulnerable
groups.</hs_para>

Bill, among the most vulnerable groups are children in care. For
example, a 2002 study for the Office for National Statistics of 1,000
looked-after children showed that almost one-third were current
smokers. This rose to more than two-thirds for those in residential
care, reflecting the greater proportion of older children in these
placements. I know that the Minister will agree with me that these
figures are shockingly high and that it should be a high priority for
the Department of Health to try to reduce them drastically. It is our
view and the view, I think, of most experts in the field, all the
charities, the BMA and other medical bodies that the introduction of
standard packaging for tobacco products will make a real difference and
will address the issue of young people
smoking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111836000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000026">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T19:49:37"></hs_TimeCode>

arguments in favour of standardised packaging for tobacco are now 
<?notus-xml column=368?>self-evident and hardly need to be rehearsed.
Similarly, there are no credible arguments against implementing
standard packages for cigarettes that are not just plain but which, as
we have seen in some of the briefings, are such that they may deter
take-up of smoking and convey in stark terms the dangers of doing

are well known. It is the largest preventable cause of cancer, causes
100,000 deaths a year and is a big factor in heart disease,
cardiovascular illnesses, strokes and so on. Despite progress in
reducing smoking, one in five adults still smokes. My noble friend Lord
Faulkner has just reminded us of the fact that it is often in childhood
and teenage years that people take up smoking; a significant number of
youngsters aged between 11 and 15—an estimated 200,000, as he
said—take up smoking. It is therefore a significant issue, and
the more young people we can deter from taking up smoking in the first
place and becoming lifelong addicts the better. We have to take
seriously anything that makes smoking less
attractive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T19:51:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

advertising ban, cigarette packaging is the most important opportunity
for tobacco companies to do exactly the opposite: namely, promote
smoking as a cool, attractive and grown-up thing to do. That is why
they spend millions on developing their packaging by testing its
attractiveness to potential new customers and adding novel or gimmicky
features that will attract interest. It is patently obvious that the
companies believe that packaging is crucial to promoting their products
and giving themselves a market edge. Indeed, research among young
people by Cancer Research UK and other charities confirms the positive
impressions conveyed by packaging in the minds of young people. One
view was, for example, “It looks too colourful to be
harmful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T19:52:20"></hs_TimeCode>”.
We therefore have to use any means possible to protect young people
from tobacco and deter them from taking up smoking. That is of course
why the industry is resisting standardised
packaging<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T19:52:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

could say more but I will not do so. This is essentially an issue of
child protection. The public support standardised packaging. Children
and young people find standardised packaging less attractive, more of a
deterrent and more effective in conveying health warnings. Health
professionals across the disciplines support standardised packaging.
Other Administrations in the UK, and other countries abroad, are moving
in this direction.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-18T19:53:04"></hs_TimeCode> very much
support Amendment 264, which sets out very well the detail that
regulations on standard packaging should include, and I congratulate my

I see smoking in cars primarily as a child protection issue. As we have
heard, children’s lungs are smaller and they have faster
breathing rates. That makes them particularly vulnerable to second-hand
smoke, especially within the confines of a car. 
<?notus-xml column=369?>As we have heard, very often children are not able to stop
adults smoking in their presence. Adult members of the public are
protected by smoke-free legislation on public transport and in the
workplace, but large numbers of children remain exposed to high
concentrations of second-hand smoke when confined in family cars. I
just do not think that is right.</hs_para>

we simply cannot afford to wait any longer. We know that roughly one in
five children reports being regularly exposed to second-hand smoke in
cars. It has catastrophic health consequences. Finally, we know that
there is very strong public support for this. In a recent survey, 80%
of the public and 86% of children supported a ban, as do many health
organisations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111836000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000035">Turning
very briefly to standardised packaging, there is a very clear reason
why people in the tobacco industry are always so opposed to amendments
such as this. It is very straightforward. They know that the designer
cigarette packet is a very effective advertising tool. Most worryingly,
it is particularly effective on young people. I had many examples I was
going to give; I shall reserve them for
Report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111836000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000036">The
other argument I would like to address is the one about the nanny state
poking its nose into the lives of individuals. We are told that people
know the risk and make an informed choice regarding whether or not to
smoke. Of course, the problem is that the choices made by young people
are not always informed. I am sure that we know from our personal
experience how impressionable young people can be. I
certainly
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111836000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000037">I remember
going into a sweet shop aged about 14 or 15. There was a
pack of cigarettes there. I will not give the name because I do not
want to advertise it. I thought it was terribly elegant and glamorous
and that if I bought that pack—which I did—I would be
very elegant and glamorous. I do not think either of those held up, but
really strong messages are coming across in that packaging. I have
looked at the most up-to-date evidence. It is absolutely clear that
standardised packs are less attractive to young people and improve the
effectiveness of health
warnings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111836000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-gc0002.htm#13111836000038">We

Ministry of Defence, is today publishing the third and final Annual
Review of the UK Government National Action Plan (NAP) on UN Security
Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (“UNSCR
1325”). The National Action Plan is intended to strengthen our
ability to reduce the impact of conflict on women and girls, and to
promote their inclusion in conflict resolution. It provides a framework
for incorporating the provisions of UN Security Council Resolutions on
Women, Peace and Security into the Government’s work on conflict
prevention.</hs_para>

years (2010-2013), the UK Government has made progress on the

and through multilateral organisations and fora.</hs_para>

play in decision-making, in the aftermath of violent conflict. It is
essential that peace negotiations provide for the active participation,
perspectives and needs of both men and women. Promoting and supporting
women’s active and meaningful participation in all peace
processes, as well as their representation in formal and informal
decision-making at all levels, is vital to international peace and
security. 
<?notus-xml column=47?>In this context, we welcome the adoption of UN Security Council
Resolution 2122 on 18 October, which reaffirms the integral role women
play in peace processes. Incorporating gender perspectives into our
conflict prevention efforts has been an increasingly important focus of
our efforts. The UK recognises that long-term conflict prevention
requires investment in all perspectives. Women’s participation
can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the causes of and
alternative solutions to violent conflict. In Afghanistan, the
UK’s support to the Tawanmandi programme, aimed at building the
capacity of Afghan civil society, has as a main element support for
women’s contribution to communities, including the empowerment
of women through local Peace Councils in 16 projects across the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311183000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118-wms0001.htm#1311183000029">Securing
the physical safety, mental and economic wellbeing of women and girls
is essential to the UK’s Women, Peace and Security efforts.
Investing in women’s empowerment helps build gender equality,
eradicate poverty and promote inclusive economic growth. Women make
enormous contributions to economies, whether in businesses, or as
entrepreneurs or employees. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
the UK is providing £60 million between 2010 and 2014 for the
Sector and Police Action Programme, which works to build political will
and institutional capacity to prevent and respond to violence against
women and girls in the security and justice

girls are met, and that special attention is paid to the most
vulnerable, including displaced women and girls as well as survivors of
gender-based violence. We support women’s activities in relief

livelihoods activities. For example, in Nepal, the UK has contributed
to a United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) programme which has helped
build a rehabilitation programme for women and girls linked with

campaign has sought to challenge the culture of impunity that exists
for sexual violence in conflict. In April this year, G8 Foreign
Ministers agreed a historic Declaration on Sexual Violence in Conflict
which contained a number of key political, practical and legal
commitments. In June, under the UK’s Presidency of the UN
Security Council, the Foreign Secretary hosted an open debate on
tackling sexual violence in conflict, which focused on the need to
challenge the culture of impunity that exists and to hold perpetrators
to account. A new UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR 2106) was

factors set out in the agreement with the underwriters. These include
the relevant underwriters’ contribution to the efficient
preparation of the IPO (Initial Public Offering) and its overall
success. We will also look at their success in generating demand for
the IPO alongside the quality and success of roadshow meetings and
resulting investor feedback. In addition, we will consider the final

in this sector is almost exclusively conducted outside the European

foreign manufacturers would bear the costs of achieving GMP. The IA

makes the assumption that it is likely that manufacturers, EU marketing
authorisation holders, and all other participants in the supply chain
would seek to pass their incremental costs onto their buyers, and
ultimately to consumers. The extent to which United Kingdom consumers
would bear the incremental costs is unclear. Pricing of NCPs seems to
be constrained at the upper bound by the pricing of tobacco products.
The IA suggests that NCP consumers would be unlikely to suffer from
substantial price increases if these products were regulated as
medicines.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311186001322" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131118w0002.htm#1311186001322">The
intention of regulating NCPs under the medicines framework is to ensure
that products which meet appropriate standards of safety, quality and
efficacy are available to support reducing the harms of smoking to
smokers and those around them. The value of the health gains associated
with a single successful quit attempt is very substantial — the
Department estimates it to be £74,000. The orders of magnitude
of estimated compliance costs suggests that a policy of licensing
e-cigarettes would have to create very few additional successful quit
attempts for the benefits to justify its costs. It is estimated that
implementing policies to reduce smoking prevalence by 1% per year for
10 years in the UK would prevent over 57,000 deaths in that
period.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question">

that they do so. We publish guidance on our website for applicants to
help them choose the evidence to submit, including suggested
supporting documents that they could submit.

(Con):</Member> Since privatisation in 1989, the
stable regulatory framework for the water sector has enabled companies
to attract over £111 billion in low cost investment to upgrade
water and sewerage infrastructure, and improve customer service and
environmental standards. The Water Bill, which was introduced in June
this year, will increase competition in the retail market by allowing
all business, charity and public sector customers to switch their water
and sewerage supplier. It will also make it much easier for new
businesses to enter the water market to provide new sources of water or
sewerage treatment services, known as "upstream" services. These
reforms will drive efficiency, better services and benefit the
