no plans to follow the advice of the Northern Ireland Attorney-General.

The sad fact is that the threat of terrorism from dissident republicans
continues to be severe; it has been set at that level since 2009. That
is why the Government remain absolutely vigilant and completely
supportive of the PSNI and the extra visibility mechanisms that it is
deploying in Belfast. We have deployed an extra £200 million in

worklessness in Northern Ireland, will the Minister have immediate
discussions with his ministerial colleagues in the Treasury to address
the issue of the closure, in March 2015, of Her Majesty’s

colleagues. We should be clear that any redundancies in HMRC in Newry
are voluntary. Nobody likes to see people lose their jobs be it
voluntarily or otherwise. However, I say gently to her that the way in
which people do business with HMRC and other Government agencies is
changing, with much more being done online. I think she would agree
that the most important thing is that customers of HMRC—the
taxpayers—get a decent service. It might be the case that by
doing business online there is less need for the current number of
employees.</hs_Para>

Robathan:</Member></B> First, I do not recognise the figure that the
hon. Lady has used, although I am sure that it has been put out by
Labour party headquarters. As I have said in answer to previous
questions, the way in which we can help people to prosper in Northern
Ireland, as we all want, is to improve the economy and to get people
into well-paid work. That is what we are doing. We are rebalancing the
economy away from the disproportionate number of public sector
employees in Northern Ireland. Currently, 30% of people in Northern
Ireland are employed in the public sector whereas in the rest of the
United Kingdom the figure is only 20%.</hs_Para>

Lazarowicz:</Member></B> Some 32,000 households in Northern Ireland are
affected by the bedroom tax. Although existing tenants are exempt, new
tenants will be hit by the fact that the vast majority of social
housing in Northern Ireland has three bedrooms or more. Is that not
just another example of how the bedroom tax is unworkable? It is
costing more money than it saves and should be abolished in Northern
Ireland and in the rest of the UK.</hs_Para>

who cannot afford their own housing, which I welcome. However, I am
sure that the hon. Gentleman would like to discuss with his
constituents and, indeed, the people of Northern Ireland whether the
general taxpayer should pay for unnecessary housing for people who do
not use it. That is why we are ending the spare room subsidy and that,
I think, is supported by the people of Northern Ireland as well as the

for the work that she put in? Clearly, it was a blow when Pfizer made
its announcement and its decision. I think that many people thought
that that would be end for the site in terms of jobs and investment,
but because of the hard work that she has put in—my right hon.
Friends the Business Secretary and the Science Minister have also put
in a huge amount of work—the enterprise zone is working well and
it has attracted over 20 high-tech companies. Pfizer is now staying,
with 700 jobs as well. It has been a success and it shows

spare rooms, whereas people in council houses do get a subsidy for

There is no one single thing we have to do: the research budget needs
to go up—and it is—but we also need to work within the
health and social care sectors to improve standards. Frankly, we also
need to make our communities more dementia-friendly. Something we can
all do is become a dementia friend, which involves a simple, relatively
short test and a bit of learning about how to help people with dementia
in our communities. It is not just about the health and social care
sectors, but about when people are trying to go on a bus, access their
bank account or go down to the post office. How they actually live
their lives is something we can all make a difference

response. As he said, the serious incident last Friday goes against the
1961 Vienna convention on

simply not be tampered with. Last time anything such as this happened
was 13 years ago with the Zimbabwean regime of Robert Mugabe—not
the best company to be associated with. This is the first time that an
EU state or NATO ally has opened a UK diplomatic bag, violating the
1961 Vienna convention. That enormously serious breach comes on top of
tedious and spiteful delays at the Gibraltar-Spanish border, and the
incursion of a Spanish vessel into waters off Gibraltar. The

therefore set out the details of that explanation and say whether they
came in writing? Will he agree to lay them before the House by placing
them in the House of Commons Library? Will he also set out how long it
took to receive the explanation from the Spanish Government once he had
become aware of the incident? Will he be clear for the House on whether
the British Government have a taken a view that the explanation was
sufficient? If it was not sufficient, will he set out what further
assurances the Government will seek from Spain on the matter, and how
such incidents can be prevented from happening in future?</hs_Para>

weekend’s events, would be a matter of the utmost seriousness.
The right hon. Gentleman decries the Government’s approach, but
last week we had evidence that it worked in the case of the Spanish
oceanographic survey vessel, which mounted an incursion into Gibraltar
waters and sought to carry out survey work. Following the
Government’s vigorous protests, including summoning the Spanish
ambassador, and the strong views expressed in this House, notably in
questions put to the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness
(Mark Simmonds) following his oral statement last week, the Spanish
vessel pursued its survey work but did not mount any further incursion
into British Gibraltar waters. The vessel carried out its survey work
within Spanish waters. That shows that we should not write off the

Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mrs Theresa
May):</Member></B> In June 2005, the previous Government signed
accession treaties with Romania and Bulgaria, and in doing so they
granted all Romanians and Bulgarians the right to come to Britain. The
treaties came into effect in 2007, and as a result the seven-year
transitional controls relating to free movement will end on 1 January
2014. From that date, Romanians and Bulgarians will have the right to
largely unrestricted free movement across
Europe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000219">Unlike
the previous Government, who chose not to apply the transitional
controls for countries such as Poland and Hungary in 2004, this
Government are doing everything we can to ensure that we are prepared
for this latest extension in EU free movement rights. First, we are
making use of the full seven years available to us to impose
transitional controls, something the Labour party failed to do in 2004,
which meant that Britain was the only major economy in Europe to grant
full access to its labour market to millions of Poles, Hungarians and
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000220">Secondly,
we are tightening the European immigration regulations to ensure that
we do not gold-plate EU free movement rules. We are therefore amending
the regulations to create a statutory presumption that a
European’s right to reside here ends after six months unless
they can prove that they are actively seeking work and stand a real
chance of finding
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000221">Thirdly,
we are taking action to limit the pull factors that attract people to
come to Britain. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions is introducing a three-month delay before a European
jobseeker can claim benefits and a new minimum earnings threshold to
ensure that EU nationals are genuinely working in the UK before they
can access benefits. He is also developing a tougher six-month test to
assess whether benefit claimants have a genuine chance of finding work.
That will apply to all EU nationals who come here to look for work and
those who have already worked here. Those changes will come into effect
as soon as possible in the new year. My right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State for Health is ensuring that, wherever possible, the NHS claims
back the cost of treating Europeans from their home country. My right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government
will issue new statutory guidance to ensure that local authorities set
a residency requirement, or a minimum period of residence in a
community, before a person qualifies for social
housing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000222">Fourthly,
we are ensuring that there is a full and proper operational response to
the challenges brought by that extension in free movement. We are
working with the police, local authorities and other agencies to
identify Europeans who are rough-sleeping and not exercising their
treaty right to be in the UK. Where appropriate, those people will be
removed. We are also changing the European immigration regulations to 
<?notus-xml column=268?>introduce a 12-month bar on their return to Britain, unless they can
prove that they have a proper reason to be
here.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000223">Fifthly,
I have lobbied other member states in the Council of Ministers about
the abuse of free movement, and there is a growing coalition of support
for change. In April this year, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands,
along with Britain, wrote to the European presidency and the Commission
to make the case for change. Although I am pleased that the European
Commission has at long last admitted that there is a problem, it is
still refusing to do anything meaningful about it.</hs_Para>

measures we are taking to prepare us for the extension of free movement
in January, but in the long term there is much more we need to do. The
Prime Minister made it clear at the beginning of the year that any
future Government he leads will seek to renegotiate Britain’s
relationship with the EU before we hold a referendum, and that
referendum will ask the people whether we should be in or out. As I
have made clear in the past and reiterate today, that renegotiation
must address the problems caused by free movement. Now, in her reply,
the shadow Home Secretary needs to tell the House whether she agrees
with that renegotiation and referendum and whether she agrees that the
renegotiation must address the problems caused by free
movement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000225"><B><Member ContinuationText="Yvette Cooper" PimsId="2709" UID="13112751001073" xid="132" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751001073">Yvette
Cooper:</Member></B> For generations, people have come to this country
and worked hard to contribute to Britain, building some of our biggest
businesses and even becoming Olympic medal winners, but the principle
of contribution is an important one, and the controls on immigration
must be fair to those who live here. That is why we called for stronger
restrictions on benefits for new arrivals from the EU, including
proposals eight months ago to strengthen the habitual residence test to
make it clear that people should not be able to claim benefits when
they first arrive. We also said that the framework for the free
movement of labour should be looked at again.</hs_Para>

the Government dismissed those proposals, but eight months later they
have changed their minds. That is welcome, but will the Home Secretary
say why she did not bring those proposals forward at the time? It is
now the end of November, and accession for Romania and Bulgaria will
occur in a month’s time, so will she tell the House which of
these measures will be in place by the beginning of January, when the
transitional controls for Romania and Bulgaria end? Will the
restrictions on jobseeker’s allowance be in by January? Will the
housing benefit restrictions be in by January? Will the minimum wage
fines be in place by January? If not, why not? We called for these
proposals eight months ago, so why the
delay?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000227">We
all agree that transitional arrangements should have been in place for
the A8 countries. At the time, the Conservative party voted for A8
accession even without transitional arrangements. The Home
Secretary’s party also supported the Romanian and Bulgarian
accession agreement. The Prime Minister has today claimed that the
rules on transitional controls should have been changed at that time,
but he did not argue for changing transitional controls then and failed
to do anything about changing transitional controls when this
Government endorsed Croatian accession in 2011 with exactly the 
<?notus-xml column=269?>same transitional control rules in place. Will she explain why the Prime
Minister failed to act in 2011, given what he has said
today?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000228">Neither
are the Government doing anything about the impact of accession on the
workplace. Most people from Europe come to Britain to work, not to
claim benefits, and 1 million British citizens live and work elsewhere
in Europe too, yet there is a serious problem of low-skilled migrant
workers being exploited, undercutting local workers and responsible
businesses too. That is bad for everyone, yet she is doing nothing
about it. We have urged her to take action, against recruitment
agencies that target only foreign workers; against factories that
segregate shifts by nationality; against the loophole in the minimum
wage that means migrant workers are put into overcrowded tied
accommodation to get round the rules; and against employers in the care
sector, for example, who have recruited heavily from abroad but failed
to train or to pay the minimum wage. Each time she has refused, so what
is she or the Prime Minister doing to address those problems for wages
and jobs?
Nothing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000229">All
parties should take a responsible approach to immigration. We will not
enter an arms race of rhetoric. Instead, we need practical measures to
address people’s concerns. We are glad that the Prime Minister
has adopted our proposals on benefit restrictions, but the Government
should not have delayed them for eight months so that they will not be
in place for January. It is not enough, either. They need to take
action over jobs and wages
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000230"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs May" PimsId="1758" UID="13112751001074" xid="420" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751001074">Mrs

The right hon. Lady talks about doing something 
<?notus-xml column=270?>about wages and jobs. In the five years following Labour’s
failure to impose transitional controls, more than 90% of
the increase in employment in Britain was accounted for by foreign

immigration and reform welfare, two thirds of the increase in

levels of immigration, were Labour to come back into power. Certainly
this Government have been tightening up not just on the work permit

have introduced a cap on non-EU economic migration into the UK. We have

Bulgarian Governments to find out the reasons and causes of
this migration. Romania has not as yet accessed 87% of the funds it was
given on accession. We need to work with the Romanians so that they can
build on their infrastructure and their citizens are able to remain

Gentleman’s question was, I think, support for the concept that

transitional controls. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made

immigration has been good for the United Kingdom overall. The problem

contributing to the NHS, for example, that other people coming here
should be required to contribute as well, while those who come here
legitimately think it only fair that those who are here illegitimately

decide what makes sense, and what is fair to our citizens. We must have

the Commission is very simple: if it thinks this is simply an issue
about the position being taken by the United Kingdom, it is wrong.
Other member states, such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, are
also concerned about this issue of free movement and the problems that
now arise with free movement. The European Commission is beginning to
find that it is on the wrong side of the argument. It makes statements
such as that one, but we will continue to impress on it that this issue

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills (Jo Swinson):</Member></B> Today I am pleased to announce that
the Government are committing a further £640 million in funding
to the post office network for the three years 2015-16 to 2017-18. That
enables the Post Office to complete its network transformation
programme, and to protect and invest in those branches which provide
vital services to their communities but are not commercially viable in
their own right. In 2010 the Government committed £1.34 billion
to maintain a national post office network, modernise branches and
safeguard the future of post offices that play a vital role in urban
deprived and rural areas. Since then, the post office network has been
at its most stable for more than 20 years, which is in stark contrast
to the 7,000 closures that took place under the previous
Government.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112751000298" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000298">This
Government remain fully committed to maintaining a network of at least
11,500 post offices, fully compliant with our access criteria and with
a sustainable long-term future. To achieve that, the post office
network must meet the changing needs of customers through longer
opening hours and more modern premises which are easier and faster to
use. Already more than 1,400 communities have benefited from Government
investment into their post offices, with a total of 34,000 extra
opening hours per week across the network. A further 830 post offices
are also signed up to change to the new main or local operating models.
In total, that represents nearly one in five of our post offices, and
most hon. Members have one or more modernised branch in their
constituencies. More than 200 hon. Members, including me, have
personally opened a new-look post office in their
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000299" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000299">The
Post Office is drawing on the experience from the first year of the
network transformation programme to introduce changes that will see the
programme completed by 2018. These changes, developed by the Post
Office in conjunction with the National Federation of
SubPostmasters, were endorsed yesterday by sub-postmasters at a special
conference. We will deliver the benefits of longer opening hours and
more modern premises to customers at a swifter pace, while making more
investment available and providing greater clarity and certainty for
sub-postmasters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000300" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000300">The
Government do not underestimate the challenges facing the network, the
Post Office centrally and, in particular, individual sub-postmasters.
In recent years, the retail environment on the high street, and more
widely, has been far from easy for sub-postmasters. This new investment
recognises that reality. The network needs to build on its core
strengths of unparalleled national reach, and the trust and high regard
in which it is rightly held by customers. It must focus on meeting
customers’ needs and expectations in a rapidly changing, highly
competitive retail market. Ease of access, longer opening hours,
shorter queues and modern premises are key to winning new clients and
attracting and retaining customers. With more than 1,400 branches
modernised to date, independent research is showing customer
satisfaction levels with the new models averaging more than 95%.
Satisfaction levels among sub-postmasters operating the new models are
similarly impressive, at about 80%.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=282?><hs_Para UID="13112751000301" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000301">In many
locations, new operating models are enabling post offices to be
re-established after a significant break in service. At Balnamore in
north Antrim, a new local branch opened in August, re-establishing post
office services some five years after the closure of the
previous branch. The new branch opens seven days a week, for a total of
92 hours. At Oxenhope in west Yorkshire, which had had no post office
since June 2011, a new local branch opened in the Co-op, and it now
offers post office services from 7 am to 10 pm, seven days a
week.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112751000302" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000302">However, this
is not just about new post office operating models. The post office
network is incredibly diverse, and it is just as important to customers
in remote rural areas that their post office stays open as it is for
busy town centre branches to be open for longer. There are about 3,000
post offices for which the new main or local models are not suitable.
Those branches predominantly serve small, often remote, communities and
they may be the last shop in the village. They are hugely valuable to
their communities. The updated network transformation programme
provides, for the first time in Post Office history, a £20
million investment fund allocated specifically to that part of the
network. The fund will enable the improvement and modernisation of
those branches to strengthen their long-term sustainability.</hs_Para>

investments being made by the Post Office are already creating a strong
platform from which it can compete for new work from government and the
private sector. Some customers and sub-postmasters have expressed
understandable concerns about continued access to Post Office card
accounts beyond 2015, when the current contract is due to expire. The
Department for Work and Pensions and Post Office are in discussions
about a long-term successor to the Post Office card account, and I can
confirm today that all options under consideration conclude that access
to pensions and benefits will continue beyond March 2015 across the
whole post office network of at least 11,500
branches.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000304" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000304">The
Post Office is also doing much more for government. Over the past two
years, the Post Office has won every single government contract it has
bid for. It is winning this work competitively, and winning it because
it is such a strong partner for government. There is even more that the
Post Office can do for government in the future. For example, under the
existing contract with the passport office, the Post Office is
discussing the introduction of new in-branch services
which would allow the majority of customers to apply for their
passports digitally, without the need for any supporting paper forms.
The intention is to introduce those services from the middle of
2014. The Department of Energy and Climate Change recently announced
that it will work with the Post Office to signpost elderly and
vulnerable people to the 500 volunteers being trained by the big energy
saving network to help people to find ways to cut their
bills.</hs_Para>

innovations demonstrate a forward-thinking Post Office, which is
introducing new services, growing new revenue streams and bringing new
customers into post office branches. With the additional funding in
place, we have the basis for building a thriving and sustainable Post
Office. I believe that in the next few years we will see the Post
Office continuing to grow its business, and its network flourish and
potentially expand in due
course.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000306" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#13112751000306">Creating
a financially sustainable network will be key to delivering a Post
Office that can be mutualised. 
<?notus-xml column=283?>Significant progress has been made by the Post Office and its
stakeholders already, and that will be boosted by the

Murray</B> (Edinburgh South) (Lab):</Member> I thank the Minister for
her statement and for advance sight of it. Let me start by paying
tribute to our sub-postmasters up and down the country. They are
integral to all our local communities across our constituencies, and
are indeed the social fabric of this country. However, the job of a
sub-postmaster has become much more difficult in recent years. Research
from the National Federation of SubPostmasters shows that incomes have
fallen and many sub-postmasters work very hard, over very long hours,
for very little return. That situation has not been assisted by the
Government, who in 2010 announced plans to use post offices as the
“front office for government”. The Government have failed
to deliver on their pledge. No new major government services have been
awarded to post offices since May 2010. The Minister says that the Post
Office has won all that it has bid for, but these were contracts that
it already had, and, according to the National Federation of
SubPostmasters, many services do not make the Post Office any money at
all.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112751000309" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751000309">The situation
resulted in the NFSP removing its support for the Postal Services Act
2011, because the Government promised £466 million of government
work but the Post Office is currently gaining only £130 million
from government business—that is 7% less than last year. That
failure has resulted in the post office network being under more
pressure than ever before. In addition to that is the abject failure of
the network transformation programme to do what the Government planned.
Consumer Futures wrote to the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee
last month saying that of the 6,000 branches that were predicted by the
Government to convert to the new model, only 1,100 have done so. That
shows that the programme is not working, which is why a degree of
compulsion has been introduced, with additional funding to deliver
it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112751000310" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751000310">The Minister
dresses up this statement as good news, but today’s announcement
of an additional £200 million on top of the £440 million
already trailed beyond 2015 means that we can firmly say that this is a
vote of no confidence in what the Government are doing to the post
office network. In effect, the Government are increasing the
compensation for people to leave and providing more money to convert.
Of that, £23 million alone is for completing a retail survey to
determine who should be converted or removed from the network on a
compulsory basis. If the Government had delivered on their front office
for government work that they promised back in 2010, the £640
million would not be required. It is a payment for abject failure and
for yet another broken Government promise.</hs_Para>

Federation of SubPostmasters voted to approve the package yesterday,
because most operators 
<?notus-xml column=284?>feel that the traditional post office model under this Government is not
working. Sub-postmasters know that they face a degree of compulsion,
but they will take the package as they are struggling on their incomes.
The fact that members of the National Federation of SubPostmasters
voted so wholeheartedly to support this package shows that they want
out. It is the epitome of taking the money and running. Crucially, the
money will be used to subsidise exit from the network rather than to go
into the network to make it sustainable in the long
term.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112751000312" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751000312">I welcome the
last shop in the village and community post office funding and support
the fact that there will be no compulsion in that area. The £20
million will assist in modernisation and help these critical community
assets. Rural communities in particular need their post office services
to survive.</hs_Para>

the process, the Government will have spent £2 billion on
network transformation, and there is a concern that we still do not
have a model that is sufficiently attractive to current or future
operators. If the model were attractive, it would not require
additional funding, as the current programme would not be failing.
Given that the National Federation of SubPostmasters has called the
privatisation of Royal Mail a “reckless gamble” for the
post office network, is it not the case that although the Minister is
throwing as many sub-postmasters as she can into lifeboats, those
lifeboats could already be sinking as retailers will not take on the
local model? The Government are content not just with selling off the
Royal Mail for a song but with hastening the demise of yet another
cherished national institution.</hs_Para>

me ask the Minister a series of questions. First, will the current
criteria be used for compulsion, or will it be updated? Secondly, will
the new announcement require new state aid applications to the European
Union? Thirdly, if a sub-postmaster stays and converts to a new model,
they will have their salary subsidised until 2015, but what happens
beyond that? Despite the fact that more than 1,000 sub-postmasters have
said that they wish to leave the network voluntarily, only
94 retailers have been found to replace them in the past two
years. What happens to the post office if other retailers are not
prepared to take it on after a postmaster leaves the network on a

Swinson:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Member for Edinburgh South (Ian
Murray) for his contribution. I agreed with some parts of it. Of course
we all join him in paying  
<?notus-xml column=285?>tribute to the sub-postmasters who do such a fantastic job in all our
constituencies up and down the country. I also agree that it has been a
very difficult environment for sub-postmasters. However, small
businesses and retailers have also found the past few years difficult.
We could go over the argument that takes place in this House on a
regular basis about where blame for that lies, but suffice it to say
that we have seen a challenging set of economic times, and that has had
an impact on the post offices, as it has on other businesses in the
high street. However, the Post Office is a key partner of the front
office for government, and it has won all the contracts that have come
forward. Potential streams of income are coming down the track in the
form of assisted digital services and identity verification. A whole
range of different models are being explored, including those with
local government. Indeed, a number of contracts have been won with
various local government services, and there is probably more that can
be done there, too. However, it is about not only the front office for
government or mail, but having a diverse range of income streams for
the post office. Financial services is one on which we have focused.
For example, the roll out of the current account, which was piloted
earlier this year in East Anglia, will be welcomed by many
sub-postmasters, as it will provide regular transactions and regular
footfall into post offices to give them the customer input they need to
run thriving
businesses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000319" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751000319">I
do not recognise the hon. Gentleman’s comments on network
transformation. We are talking about a process in which more than 2,000
post offices are already signed up to convert to network
transformation. I am sure that Members will report that customers have
been positive about it, and the customer satisfaction statistics speak
for themselves. Indeed, retailers in some of the new models, with the
brighter and more modern environments, have experienced a 10% uplift in
sales. This is about building a sustainable future. The hon. Gentleman
tries to talk down the network transformation, but we should be talking
it up.</hs_Para>

apologies for providing welcome funding to sub-postmasters for
participating in important surveys, which will also help to gather
valuable management data across the network. We are dealing with a
diverse and dispersed network of nearly 12,000 branches across the
country. It is important to have that management data for the Post
Office to work out how best to plan the network for the future.
Ensuring that sub-postmasters are properly remunerated for undertaking
those surveys is particularly helpful.</hs_Para>

Gentleman asked a few questions about whether new state aid
applications will be required. The answer is yes, but as the package
runs from 2015, there is plenty of time to ensure that we get through
that necessary process. On the payments that sub-postmasters will
receive, he is right that there will be an enhanced package up until
2015 because we recognise that in making a change and a transition, new
customer bases and income streams will have to be built up. It is
important that sub-postmasters are helped and encouraged to do
so.</hs_Para>

Gentleman was wrong to say that we were subsidising the exit of
sub-postmasters and leaving communities stranded without post offices.
That would be taking a leaf out of the previous Government’s
book. Under this plan and under this Government, that 
<?notus-xml column=286?>cannot happen. There cannot be a subsidised exit if there is not already
alternative provision in that community. Importantly, communities have
to be happy with the changes that are being made, and provision has to
continue. In those circumstances, if some sub-postmasters want to leave
the network and retire or perhaps take on a new challenge, then we will
compensate them for doing so, as long as the service continues. That is
the key difference between what the hon. Gentleman’s party did
in government and what this coalition Government are doing. Labour
closed 7,000 post offices. That was its answer to these particular
challenges. We are creating a sustainable future for the post office
network at a stable level. That is the difference between what they
would have done and what we are
doing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000323" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751000323"><B><Member PimsId="-1" UID="13112751001136" xid="-1" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751001136">Several

welcome the Minister’s announcement, which reflects the
difficulties successive Governments have had in sustaining the sort of
post office network we all want. The future of the network will depend,

welcome from the Chair of the Select Committee. He is right that this
Government and previous Governments have faced the challenge of how a
much-loved institution reforms and modernises for a very different
retail environment from that of some decades ago. That is not
necessarily always an easy process. He asks about the perception of the
future viability of the network. The range of different services for
which the Post Office can bid—not just Government services but
the huge opportunities in the parcels market and financial
services—are very significant. We must bear in mind the 10-year 
<?notus-xml column=287?>intra-business agreement between Royal Mail and the Post Office. The
chief executive of the Royal Mail, Moya Greene, has said that it would
be unthinkable for there not to be that commercial relationship between
the two companies, so I hope that hon. Members will also respect that

Post Office must win work on its merits, and the environment is
competitive. Whether we are talking about the mail market, the retail
market or bidding for Government work, a range of competitors would be
more than happy to take some of the contracts. It is a testament to the
strength of the Post Office that, despite that strong competition, it
has continued to win contract after contract, but I am in no doubt that
bidding for that work on a more competitive basis creates significant
pressures, particularly for some

unsustainable to have 370 post offices out of a network of nearly

year for which we have figures. We need to take action to get that
Crown network to break even, given that these are offices, in city
centre and town centre locations, that are busy places and should be
able to at least break even, if not provide a profit to go back into
the network. That is why we are looking at franchising proposals. We do
need to get them right and they are the subject of consultation. I am
not sure of the exact timetable of the hon. Gentleman’s

be paid at post offices. Those all have an impact on the services that
post offices offer. That is why we need to diversify into a range of
new services, and why the new models are often based on co-locating a
post office with a thriving retail business, where they can mutually
benefit, the post office driving footfall to help the retail business
drive sales. In the new models, sales of the other retail businesses
have increased. That is how we can build a sustainable future. We

to many people, putting a barrier between the customer service
assistant and the customer. It also added a huge amount of cost to the
way in which the network was run. It is important that retailers and

Swinson:</Member></B> We have to recognise that across a network of
nearly 12,000 branches some post offices are not commercially
sustainable by themselves, but none the less they play a huge social
and economic role in their community. I believe that there will always
be a role for continued Government subsidy for those branches. That
said, we are using taxpayers’ money, which must be spent
judiciously. It is about making sure that those branches that can
become viable without subsidy proceed without subsidy, but branches
that require ongoing subsidy should have the certainty that that is the
situation. At the moment, that is not the case, because those post
offices do not know whether they are designated as community branches
or whether they can access subsidies.</hs_Para>

certainty will help, but as for the question whether we can increase
the money for those branches on an ongoing revenue basis, that is not
something which, in the current economic circumstances, I can promise
to deliver for the hon. Gentleman. That said, investment in those
branches is sometimes needed to ensure that they can become more
sustainable, perhaps by improving the layout or structure of the office
so that it can do more parcels work, for example. There could be ways
to enhance income streams by using a bit of capital
investment.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_27_PT_1/3BC808FB1CD2396A59999CF6C7998C5580C1BE9A" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="27 November 2013">Wednesday

May I seek your advice on a reply given by the Prime Minister in Prime
Minister’s questions, as he may inadvertently have misled the
House? When asked about the impact of the bedroom tax on disabled
people, he told the House: “Obviously, what we have done is to
exempt disabled people who need an extra room.” Leading
charities claim in a letter to the Secretary of State for Work and

contrary.</hs_Para>

Order Paper—future business item 40 on changes to Standing Order
No. 33, as tabled by the Leader of the House and the Deputy Leader of
the House. The Procedure Committee, which I chair, has been in
discussion with the office of the Leader of the House, and we thought
we had been in a fruitful discussion. The Leader of the House is
promoting the proposal that there may be three amendments to the motion
on the Queen’s Speech, and the Procedure Committee has advised
that it should be four amendments, so there seems to be a point of
disagreement on the matter. I seek your advice: is it not the

other contexts by Ministers when they have thought it convenient to
deploy that line of argument. I would always hope that Ministers would
treat Committees of the House with courtesy. However, nothing
disorderly within the rules of the House appears to have occurred and I
do not think there is a point of order for the Chair. Those on the

all forms of energy, the price of home fuel oil has rocketed in recent
years, but there is clear evidence that the price of home fuel oil
rises in the early autumn and stays high over the winter period. This
year it has been somewhat skewed by the long cold spring, with prices
staying stubbornly high over the spring before falling in the summer,
but they are now rising again. The rise in prices affects all areas of
the United Kingdom over the winter months. It is important to note that
this is as much an issue for the rural areas of England, Wales and
particularly Northern Ireland as it is for the rural areas of
Scotland.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000392" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751000392">The

figures may now have changed but the general point stands: the cost of
heating an average home with propane or home fuel oil is higher than
heating with mains gas. Not only that, but the costs are also rising

LPG and home fuel oil is for heating, so although those homes generally

costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000394" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751000394">Traditionally
the Government have called for an extension of the mains gas grid as
one way of tackling the problem, but realistically such schemes will
help only 
<?notus-xml column=299?>those homes where there is a gas mains nearby, although even then the
costs can be very substantial. I have had cases in my constituency in
urban areas where the quoted cost of connecting to the grid is
thousands of pounds, even when the mains are relatively close by. In
many rural and island areas, where the cost of connection would be
enormous, there is absolutely no chance of that being

Government’s advice to switch does not work in a market where

course, these households will receive the same winter fuel allowances
as pensioners on the gas grid, but the crucial difference is how the
energy is delivered. Those who are on the gas grid will receive their
winter fuel bill around the time that the winter fuel allowance is
generally paid, and it therefore works well for them. Indeed, in the
explanatory notes to the regulations that last amended the benefit, the
previous Government said
specifically:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13112751000857" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751000857">“They

is clearly not the case for those off the gas grid. They face the
difficulty that they have to pay for their LPG or home fuel oil up
front at the beginning of winter, well before they have the benefit of
the winter fuel allowance. Many find it difficult to do so and may not
fill up the tank completely, leaving them having to do so, if they can
afford it, in the depths of winter, which brings problems of its own in
getting a supply through in bad weather. That has been a serious
problem in many rural areas in past
winters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000398" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751000398">The
price of fuel is rising substantially as winter approaches, and even
those suppliers who offer a fixed winter price will do so at a price
higher than the summer price. My Bill suggests how we might tackle this
problem. The current winter fuel allowances are paid as a result of
regulations which specify a date by which pensioners must apply. It is
worth noting that once they are on the system, they do not have to
apply every year. Clause 1 seeks to vary the regulation to bring
forward for those off the gas grid the qualifying date from late
September to late July. Clause 2 seeks to bring forward the payment
date for those off-gas grid to no later that 30 September to allow them
to buy a complete tank of gas prior to the
winter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000399" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751000399">These
proposals would ensure that money is available when fuel bills arrive,
as the regulations put it. I have debated this with the Minister of
State, Department for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Thornbury
and Yate (Steve Webb) previously and, with the greatest respect to the
hon. Gentleman, it seems to me that the 
<?notus-xml column=300?>objections to the proposal are bureaucratic excuses. The first objection
is that the payment would have to be paid to everyone earlier or other
claimants may feel aggrieved at being denied early access. The whole
point, however, is to tackle the problem of having to pay for energy up
front. Other claimants will have access to the allowance when their
quarterly bills become due. I reiterate the point made in the memo to
the regulations that the payment was meant to be available when the
bill arrives: for those who pay up front, the most appropriate way to
achieve parity would be to make payment as close as possible to the
time of the outlay, which is precisely what I am attempting to
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000400" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751000400">The
second objection is that the Department would need to create a separate
category of people who are off-grid, and that the situation of
individuals could change from year to year. I recall the Minister
giving us a rundown of his own situation—by buying a house, he
subsequently became connected to the grid. That objection seems
ludicrous, as the number of new connections would be low, and unlikely
to be a major problem. As Members know, it is not unheard of for the
Department to insist on claimants of other benefits notifying a change
in circumstances, so I do not see the problem. A low number of
claimants are likely to be affected in any
event.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000401" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751000401">Moving
the date forward could result in some people losing out on the payment
in the initial year. I accept that that could be a problem, but it is
hardly insurmountable. As I said, it would be a problem only in the
first year of each claim, since once applicants are on the system they
do not have to apply each year but receive an allowance automatically.
It would be possible, for example, to allow off-grid consumers who miss
the earlier date to apply at the later date but be transferred to the
earlier date for year 2, so avoiding any difficulties. If, on the other
hand, the Government have real problems with an earlier date, we could
keep the September date and simply allow payment to off-grid consumers
at an earlier date from year
2.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000402" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0002.htm#13112751000402">There

an energy bill and on to the taxes of all our constituents will not

Fovargue</B> (Makerfield) (Lab):</Member> No subject impacts more on my
constituents than the cost of living. Wages are dropping—in the
north-west by 7.8%, a loss in 
<?notus-xml column=323?>spending power of nearly £1,700 a year—while more people
are being given part-time hours or zero-hours contracts. That is not
their choice, yet food and fuel prices continue to rise.</hs_Para>

Makerfield constituency are “doing the right thing”: they
are working or looking for work. For those looking for work, a quick
glance at the universal jobmatch site will superficially show that many
jobs are available after searching for retail jobs in Wigan. Let us
look a bit deeper at these “jobs”, however. In the three
pages I checked at random, 67 of the 75 jobs available were for
self-employed catalogue distributors—jobs that the site stated
it had been assured “may” enable people to earn a wage
equivalent to the national minimum wage. Really? How many people have
tried these jobs, paid up front for their catalogues—about
£150—and found that they consistently earned the national
minimum wage after paying all their contributions? It certainly does
not include the people who have been to my surgeries after trying these
non-jobs and finding that they could make very little—not even
enough to heat and
eat.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000631" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112751000631">Domestic
energy bills have risen by an eye-watering average of 37% over the last
three years. In 2012-13, citizens advice bureaux received 92,000
inquiries about fuel debt alone, while Which? estimates that flaws in
the market have left consumers paying £3.9 billion over the odds
since 2010. We intend to stand up for consumers in this failing market
and break the stranglehold of the big six. What have this Government
proposed? Nothing. It is no wonder that citizens advice bureaux saw a
78% increase in the number of people having to use food
banks last year. Many of those people were in work, yet were unable to
pay their bills and could not afford to
eat.</hs_Para>

that you cannot feed your family is not easy or comfortable. For many

be doing justice to my constituency postbag, or to the people who
attend my surgeries, if I did not mention the economically unsound
bedroom tax. As I have often said before, in Wigan we have a shortage
of one and two-bedroom properties and a surplus of three-bedroom
properties. People are being forced either to move to the more
expensive private rented sector, uprooting their families and incurring
further expense, or to pay the difference. Given that 4,200 people in
my constituency are affected by reductions 
<?notus-xml column=324?>in housing benefit ranging from £517 to £1,273, it is no
surprise that in October, 2,500 people contacted Wigan and Leigh
Housing about rent arrears and debt. That represents an increase of 50%

bedroom tax means yet another cut in the available income of many of my
constituents, forcing them to make stark choices about how they spend
their money. Far from being a case of what luxury item they must do
without, it is a case of “Can we afford to have the heating on,
or should we shiver and buy food—and what about that new pair of
school shoes? Heaven forbid that the washing machine or the fridge
should break down!” There is certainly no money to save for a
rainy day. In fact, many of my constituents are already swamped and
drowning in
debt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000637" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112751000637">No
wonder the payday lenders, the home credit providers, the log book loan
companies and the rest are proliferating. According to a recent report,
48% of people who go to payday lenders are female, and the majority of
females have borrowed for everyday necessities. They have borrowed to
buy food for the family, or to pay the heating bills. Capping the cost
of credit constitutes a welcome recognition that these companies are
making profit from despair, but there is much more to be done. The root
cause of rising prices and low incomes needs to be addressed if people
are to be saved from being dragged into a spiral of
debt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000638" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112751000638">The
people whom I represent are hard-working people who want the best for
their families and who are doing the right thing, but they are being
let down by this Tory-led Government in so many ways. Every time they
go to the supermarket, every time they receive a fuel bill, and every
time they turn on the television or walk down the high street and see
more advertisements for payday lenders, they are reminded of the
Government’s failure to address the issue that is most important
to them: the cost of living.</hs_Para>

am delighted that the Labour party has initiated this debate. I say to
Labour Members “Bring it on!” I am glad that they have at
last woken up to the cost-of-living crisis. While many of us were going
on about it for a number of years, they were talking about
predistributions or other “chattering classes” subjects
that no one understood. While we were cutting and freezing fuel duty,
cutting taxes and raising thresholds for lower earners, and increasing
taxes for the rich by, for instance, increasing capital gains tax, they
were voting against all those measures. They created a handout society,
whereas we want to create a “hand back” society, and to
give people back their own money through lower taxes. They created a
society of dependency: a society of high tax, high debt and high
borrowing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000641" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112751000641"><B><Member ContinuationText="David Rutley" PimsId="5634" UID="13112751001379" xid="1121" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112751001379">David

Friend the Financial Secretary made an outstanding speech, what was

Halfon:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is
another example of why we are the party of small business. Labour
showed during its years in office that it was, as Peter Mandelson said,
the party of the filthy rich and of big business, sucking up to bankers
in the City—Fred the Shred, Flowers and all those kinds of
people.</hs_Para>

elements of the cost of living are jobs, pay and energy. Let us look at
the Labour Government’s record. They scrapped the 10p rate of
tax under Gordon Brown in 2008. They talk about wages, but median wages
stopped rising in 2003, in times of plenty, and hourly pay rose at only
a quarter of the rate of economic growth. They increased fuel duty 12
times while in office, and the cost of bus travel increased by 59%.
Council tax increased by 67%, and energy bills doubled. That is the
record of the Labour party, which says that it wants to help with the
cost of living. Sadly, it has nothing to show for it at all.</hs_Para>

fuel prices are among the key indicators of the cost of living. As we
have heard from the Minister, this Government have cut fuel duty and
said that they will freeze it for the lifetime of this
Parliament—an historic move. Of course, I would like the
Government to do more and to cut fuel duty further, and I hope that
when economic conditions allow, that will be the No. 1 tax cut. We need
to continue to help hard-pressed motorists.</hs_Para>

let us remember that there were about 17 energy companies
under Labour; now, there are only six. Labour decreased competition,
but we are doing things to increase it. I believe that the Government
should do more on VAT, particularly through renegotiating our VAT rates
with the European Union. They should also consider imposing windfall
taxes—de facto fines—on some of the energy companies and
passing the money back to the consumer. They should also cut
Labour’s green taxes, which make up 17% of the average energy
bill.</hs_Para>

Ellwood:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is making a powerful speech. I
understand that Labour intends to make energy its focus in the
forthcoming EU elections. I intervened on the hon. Member for
Nottingham East (Chris Leslie), but he declined to answer my question.
Does my hon. Friend agree that we should look not only at the six
energy companies but at how we make energy in this country? We now need
to import it, and we are over-reliant on expensive energy imports
because the previous Government failed to replace the nuclear fleet in
time. They did nothing during their 13 years, and that energy offering
went down from 25% to 15%. That is why we now have to pay more for
expensive oil and gas from abroad.</hs_Para>

2.5 million people, including 1 million young people, unemployed when
Labour left office. That did not happen over 18 months solely as a
result of 
<?notus-xml column=326?>the recession; it was happening even in times of plenty. Under this
Government, youth unemployment in my constituency has gone down by
7.6%, long-term unemployment by 4.3% and overall unemployment by 4.4%
over the past 12 months. This is the Government who are helping with
the cost of living and helping people to get back into work. I met a
chap who was helping me with my car at Halfords, and he told me that he
was going to vote Conservative for the first time in his life. When I
asked him why, he said it was because the Conservatives helped people
who work. That is what this party is all about. We are the party of

are another indicator of the cost of living. There are 3,749 people in
my constituency who have been taken out of tax altogether. They are on
low earnings. A total of 36,861 lower earners have had a tax cut. I
want the Government to do more, however. I want them to raise the
threshold at which people pay national insurance, because that would
make a huge difference. Let us take people on low earnings out of all
tax altogether, not just out of income tax. Nevertheless, the
Government have made huge progress, which has been opposed massively
and has been voted against by the Labour party. We have to remind our
constituents that Labour voted against people on lower earnings getting
lower taxes. As I said, median wages stopped rising in 2003, so the
previous Government’s record on wages is nothing to shout about.
We need to improve the minimum wage; we should have a regional minimum
wage top-up, on top of the national minimum wage. We need to reform
national insurance as I have described, but at least this Government
have started doing the things that are helping to address the cost of
living most; we have taken action on energy, jobs and national
insurance.</hs_Para>

gets my goat is that the Labour party claims to have the monopoly on
compassion. As my constituents found out, the reality is that Labour
had a monopoly on failure—on the cost of living, on taxes and on
the economy. Through our history, the Conservative party has always
been on the side of hard-working people; we have always helped lower
earners. Despite the very difficult economic conditions that the Labour
party left us, this Government have done everything possible. The
Conservatives do not have a monopoly on compassion, but we are the
party of aspiration. We give people ladders of opportunity; we give
them skills and apprenticeships, the number of which has increased by
more than 80% in my constituency. We are giving people jobs, and we are
creating a new nation of property owners through the right to buy and
the Help to Buy scheme. We recognise that the best way to help the poor
and lower earners is not through the dependency culture and welfare
society so beloved of Labour Members, but by cutting taxes, cutting
fuel duty, freezing council tax, restoring the link between pensions
and earnings, and helping hard-working
people.</hs_Para>

calls for action  
<?notus-xml column=327?>to mitigate the cost of living crisis. Although the Scottish National
party does not agree with the Labour party on the precise mechanism of

start by discussing tax, because that clearly has as much of a bearing
on people’s ability to cope with rising prices as do earnings or
the prices themselves. The Government are right to try to take as many
people on low and modest wages out of tax as possible. The saving of
£595 a year for basic rate taxpayers through the change in the
basic allowance from £6,500 in 2010 to £9,440 this year
makes sense. However, a saving of £595 for basic rate taxpayers
makes rather less sense when the same Government are embarked on a
£40,000 tax give-away for millionaires.</hs_Para>

really want to talk about are those in the middle, who are paying some
of the heaviest price for the mistakes this Government have made. These
people have seen the tax relief before they pay the 40% band fall from
£37,500 in 2010 to £34,700 last year and to
£32,000 this year. So for every £595 saved as a result of
changes to the basic rate, they have had to shell out an extra
£2,000 at 40p in the pound. That does not make people better
off; it exacerbates the crisis faced by people, particularly
hard-working people on middle incomes. I am not talking about the very
poorest and I am certainly not talking about the very wealthy; I am
discussing those on genuinely middle incomes. It means that this
Government have taken the number of people paying 40% tax to a whopping
4.3 million; whereas barely 5% of taxpayers did so 25 years ago, the
figure has rocketed and 16% of all taxpayers now pay a 40%
tax rate—even a quarter of a century ago this was a band only
for the rich. They are not paying that because they are wealthier or
even because the economy has come out of the austerity period. Indeed,
people feel poorer because they are poorer.</hs_Para>

promised that national debt would peak at 85% of GDP on the treaty

share of GDP by the end of that period—it is not. Both
objectives, were, and remain, highly dependent on GDP growth, which, as
we have noted in previous Budgets, is massively dependent, at least
according to the OBR, on extraordinary unmet and unmeetable levels of
business investment. Let us remember that in 2010 the Government
suggested, with a straight face, that business investment would have to
grow between 8% and 11% a year between 2011 and 2015. By the time of
the OBR fiscal outlook in November 2011, growth in business investment
had turned negative again and the forecast had to be changed to show

priorities lie: not with jobs, not with growth, not with recovery and
not with lifting the burden of the cost of living crisis off the backs

sector create 1.4 million new jobs, offsetting any jobs lost in the
public sector by 3:1. The Government have ensured that borrowing costs
have fallen to record lows, saving money for taxpayers, businesses and
families alike. The Government have helped bring inflation down to 2.2%
as of October 2013. That is important because of the damaging effect
that rising prices can have on the cost of living. The Government have
helped bring back growth to the UK economy, with growth now projected
to be 2.9% by year end 2014. The Government have ensured that the UK
has more men and more women in work than ever before. The Government
have seen the number of people claiming unemployment benefit fall at

both unemployment and youth unemployment are down 20% in the past year

the Government froze council tax in 2013-14 for the third year in a
row. The combined effect of the Government’s actions means that
council tax bills, which doubled under the previous Government, have
fallen by 9.5% since 2010, thereby again reducing the cost of living.
The Government have increased child care support for low-income working
families on universal credit, thereby reducing the cost of living. In
2011, child tax credit increased by £225—the largest
increase ever—and in April this year, it went up by 5.2%, a
further increase of £135, thereby reducing the cost of living.
The Government introduced the triple lock, which means that pensions
increase every year by price inflation, earnings growth or 2.5%,
whichever is highest. Over the  
<?notus-xml column=332?>course of their retirement, the average pensioner will be about
£12,000 better off under the triple lock, which helps with the

conclusion, the Government have much to be proud of. The Chancellor
made some difficult decisions in 2010 to ensure that the country could
have a long-term sustainable economic recovery. As the Governor of the
Bank of England reiterated in the Treasury Committee yesterday, the
economic recovery has finally taken hold. We should not jeopardise all
this by returning to Labour’s tax and spend policies, which
created the financial mess that we have finally begun to clear up. The

growing. I have never heard of an economy growing at 3% while running a

something from the Leader of the Opposition, whose latest stunt is to
announce an energy price freeze. We should beware geeks bearing gifts,
because that announcement is pretty hollow for three reasons. First, if
a price freeze is imposed, companies will simply hike their prices
before the freeze and afterwards, and people will be paying
artificially high energy prices. That is what Professor Dieter Helm
says, as well as Adam Scorer from Consumer Focus. Even the hon. 
<?notus-xml column=340?>Member for Southampton, Test (Dr Whitehead) has raised that concern. He
is a Labour member of the Energy and Climate Change Committee and says
that Labour’s plans for an energy freeze are somewhat
sketchy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000755" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112751000755">The
second reason a freeze will not work is that rather than break up the
big six oligopoly, it will entrench it. Stephen Fitzpatrick of Ovo and
the First Utility company—the company of choice for the Leader
of the Opposition—say that a price freeze will make it more
difficult for them to break into the market and operate, and that it
will entrench the position of the big six, rather than break it up. The
third reason the freeze will not work is that it will jeopardise
£125 billion-worth of investment that we must make in short
order in our energy infrastructure—£25 billion of that in
the pipes and pylons that keep our lights switched
on.</hs_Para>

people on the lowest tariff available. That could save people
£158. If we also roll back those green levies and do not impose
the £125 carbon tax that Labour tried to impose
through the Energy Bill in the other place just two weeks ago, that

walking towards it? I put it to the House that he is knowingly doing
so. He is 
<?notus-xml column=341?>inflating the housing market when he knows that people cannot afford
higher interest rates. He is willing to take those risks in the
knowledge that, if and when the Labour party takes office, there will
be a sub-prime debt disaster, and he will be able to say, “It is
old Labour messing things up.” He is willing to pay that price,
because he believes that the feel-good factor from inflated house
prices in London and the south-east—his core area—where
he is investing 80% of Britain’s new infrastructure to buoy his
vote, will be enough, alongside the media spin, to get him back into
power. I put it to the House that it will not be enough, and that we

about
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000762" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112751000762">The
Minister loosely referred to the funding for lending scheme used by our
banks, but he would not take an intervention from me. The scheme
provides easy lending, underpinned by the Bank of England. Lending to
households for mortgages is now at the 2008 level, but lending to
business is 32% lower than it was in 2008. What does that mean? It
means that British money is not investing in productivity and growth
for jobs, which means that wages are not growing and will not be strong
enough to sustain the cost of higher house prices when interest rates
go
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000763" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112751000763">Interest
rates will go up. Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, has
clearly said that, when unemployment goes down to 7%, interest rates
can be let free. That is great, is it not? Obviously, unemployment
going down must be good—I can see Government Members nodding
their heads—but, if overall production has not grown, average
productivity will have gone down. Since 2010, productivity, in the
main, has been flatlining and there is no growth in the economy. There
is growth in the number of people in work because we are sharing the
production around, which is why real wages are falling. We do not have
the investment in training and in research and development. On
investment as a proportion of GDP, we are 159th in the world. On R and
D investment, we are at the bottom of the developed world. We are a

(Mr Brown) and President Obama stepped in with a fiscal stimulus to get
us back to growth by 2010. Hey presto, the Tories arrived and announced
that half a million people were going to be sacked, and people in the
public sector stopped spending because they did not know when they were
going to be sacked. So the Tories deflated consumer demand and growth

borrowed more in three and a half years than the Labour Government
borrowed in 13 years. The clowns spin the story again and
again in this Chamber and in the media, and the marketing campaign is

Government, and any future Labour Government, should, through the Bank
of England, change the funding for lending scheme so that it focuses on
business investment, not mortgage investment. Prior to the onset of the
funding for lending scheme in July 2012, the mortgage market had
already recovered, so we do not need the money that is going in. The
scheme means that if you, Madam Deputy Speaker, were a bank, for every
pound you lent to SMEs, you would have another £10 to lend
elsewhere. At the moment that is going to mortgages, not SMEs. That
will be changed to a ratio of 5:1. If that were to be rebalanced, the
Bank of England and the Government could finance business
loans—existing loans, as well as future loans—and give
more money to SMEs. The financial markets are already servicing the
rest of it. In addition, we have the Help to Buy scheme. All the money
is therefore being channelled into a fixed stock of houses and prices
will go through the roof. Would it not be better to invest in business

the police authority has sold the site of a former police station that
could be built on perfectly properly. For 20 years,
taxpayers—that includes the hon. Gentleman and me—paid
more than £1 million to keep the former Stannington hospital

sites being built on and providing homes, but of course that is not

economic policy and, on the cost of living crisis, to ask the obvious
question: was it all necessary? The Government’s answer, as
provided by the Financial Secretary in a rather frivolous and
distinctly provocative knockabout, was, predictably, yes. He simply
repeated the well-worn Tory mantra that we all know: Labour left behind
a huge economic mess; there was no other way to deal with it other than
through massive cuts in public expenditure; we were “all in it

did not leave an economic mess. The budget deficit in 2007-08, just
before the crash, was 2.6% of gross domestic product—one of the
lowest in the OECD and about the same as Germany’s. It rose to
11.6% in 2010 only as a result of the bankers’ bail-out. I noted

there was another and much better way to deal with the budget deficit
than through semi-permanent austerity. It is costing the country
£19 billion a year to keep 2.5 million people unemployed. I
simply say that it would have been far better to get these people off
benefit and into work through public investment, so that they could
earn and contribute to the Exchequer through taxes and national
insurance contributions. I well know that the question will come,
“How do we pay for that?”, so I shall answer it. This can
still be done—and it could have been done three years
ago—without any increase in public borrowing at all, despite the
Chancellor’s continuous jibes to the contrary, by a further
tranche of quantitative easing targeted not on the banks but directly
on industry, or by instructing the publicly owned banks RBS and Lloyds

this debate, and I am prepared to recognise that the problems did not
start with the present Government. I agree that we should have taken a
much tougher line with the banks before 2010, but let us concentrate on
where we are now, because the country is in a very serious

me to the third point. We never were “all in it

In <I>The Sunday Times</I> rich list, the richest 1,000 of the
UK’s citizens—a tiny 0.003% of the
population—increased their wealth in the five years since the
crash by a staggering £190 billion, while 90% of the population
over exactly the same period have had to take a real-terms cut of about
9%, and their wages are still falling. So much for social solidarity!
If that £190 billion were charged to capital gains tax, it could
technically raise £53 billion. I do not think it would for a
moment, but it could realistically raise roughly £30 billion to
£35 billion—quite enough to generate 1 million to 1.5
million jobs within two or three years. That would be a far quicker way
of reducing the budget deficit—which is supposed to be the aim
of the exercise—than spending cuts could ever
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000801" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112751000801">The
Government’s fourth point is that we have a recovery. Well, we
do have a recovery of sorts, but one that has been generated in exactly
the wrong way. It has been generated by consumer borrowing and an
incipient bubble, and it is not—I repeat, not—a real,
sustainable recovery. As my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea West
(Geraint Davies) pointed out, such a recovery can come about only as a
result of rising investment, increasing productivity, growing wages and
healthy exports, and none of those is present now.</hs_Para>

five years, Britain’s business investment has dropped in real
terms by a devastating 25%, well below the global average. UK
productivity is now almost the lowest among the OECD countries. As we
were told by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East (Chris
Leslie), UK wages are undergoing the biggest fall since the 1870s, and
are still falling. As for exports, Britain’s deficit on traded
goods is still running at a 
<?notus-xml column=347?>mountainous rate of over £100 billion a year. If that is a
recovery, then God help us if we ever experience a
downturn.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112751000803" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112751000803">So
has the Government’s economic policy failed? Not necessarily. It
all depends on what we think the Government’s objectives really
were. If the objective was to cut the budget deficit, as they claim,
then yes: I think that the last three years of unending misery and
austerity have involved a momentous waste of resources in return for
almost nothing. According to the Government’s own figures, the
budget deficit was £118 billion in 2011 and £115 billion
in 2012. Like those who engaged in trench warfare during the first
world war, we have advanced a few dozen yards, and have taken enormous
casualties in order to do so. No sane person would continue with such a
policy at such expense in blood and treasure, yet here we have a
Government who are determined to slog on with exactly the same
policies, and—as with the generals in the first world
war—the cost is not to them, but only to the poor squaddies who

We interfere in industry at our peril, however. The Opposition motion
mentions an “energy price freeze”. I worked at senior
level in business, finance and industry for more than 25 years, five of
which were spent working as an accountant in the electricity industry.
I could scarcely believe Labour’s proposal for a price freeze.

obvious from the start that any business faced with having its prices
fixed but its costs varying dramatically, as they do in the electricity
industry, would have real problems. Prices would increase before the
freeze and after it. Prices that had been frozen could not decrease if
the costs reduced. Above all, less investment will take place,
especially from new players. So what has happened since Labour’s
announcement? We have seen huge price hikes, which I am sure include
hedging just in case the public are stupid enough to elect a Labour

Energy Secretary, the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline

six by challenging the policy, but that is not true. In my
constituency, three new energy investors want to invest—two in
fossil fuels and one in renewables. There are US, Japanese and Korean
investors behind these projects, but the projects are now in danger
because their bankers are wondering what on earth is going to happen to
this country’s electricity industry. So this irresponsible
announcement by Labour threatens investment and security of supply,
and, above all, it will raise prices, both in the short term and the
long term. So I urge the Opposition to withdraw the policy as soon as

staggering drop of £1,669, or 8%, since the general election,
when this Government came to power. They see this Government as out of
touch, patronising and complacent; they see a Government on the side of
the rich, of millionaires and of banking and energy bosses, as we heard
aptly demonstrated by the hon. Member for Redcar (Ian Swales). It is
Labour Members who are on the side of the British people, with
solutions such as capping the cost of credit and payday loans, and
freezing energy prices. These real measures would help the real lives

Shelbrooke</B> (Elmet and Rothwell) (Con):</Member> This is indeed a
very important debate. We can hear stories from any part of the House
about the struggles that our constituents are going through. Indeed,
constituents who one might deem to be on very good salaries are
struggling, too. Whether someone is on a good salary or unemployed, if
they are on a fixed income—including even those on good salaries
who have had them frozen—a rise in the cost of living has a
direct impact on their lives.</hs_Para>

recognise the things we have to try to do to change the situation for
the long term. Unemployment in my constituency has reduced by 32% since
the Government came to power. We should welcome not only that reduction
but the transfer of jobs from the public to the private sector, as
quite a few small industrial bases in my constituency are supplying
those jobs. As the economy is now turning a corner, growth in the
economy and in the productivity of companies will allow wages to go up
in line. What I do not support is a false rise in wages.</hs_Para>

wage is very important; it ensures that people are not exploited, and
as the Prime Minister outlined earlier today, if companies are found to
have broken the minimum wage legislation, they will be fined a huge
amount of money. We hope that will crack down on some of the more
ruthless employers. We talk about a living wage—we would all
hope to achieve a living wage—but it should not be specified in
statute. By increasing wages falsely—in London, by 40%—we
ensure that a living wage is always just out of
reach.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112767000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112767000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sheila Gilmore" PimsId="5534" UID="13112767000791" xid="1055" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112767000791">Sheila

that exactly the same arguments were advanced, mainly by members of his

exaggerating his
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112767000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112767000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Alec Shelbrooke" PimsId="5639" UID="13112767000792" xid="1087" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112767000792">Alec
Shelbrooke:</Member></B> I am most grateful for the hon. Lady’s
intervention because she makes the point that I wanted to make. I did
not say that the living wage would cost jobs; I said that it would
inflate wages. Many would argue that a lot of people already earn
the living wage, and that a statutory living wage
would benefit all those 
<?notus-xml column=354?>underneath. But we are all well aware how many people, especially our
friends in the unions, would demand a 40% pay rise if it was to go
through.</hs_Para>

there is nothing to be gained by inflating wages artificially, as we
did in the 1970s. I remember my parents telling me that when they were
teachers in the 1970s, they got a 25% pay rise when Harold Wilson came
to power in 1975 but it was worthless the following year. The goal is
always slightly out of reach. We must tackle the cost of living, and
ensure that people’s real wages and real net income can advance
to meet
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112767000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112767000014"><Member ContinuationText="Anas Sarwar" PimsId="5637" UID="13112767000793" xid="1071" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112767000793"><B>Anas

important. Does he not recognise that
point?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112767000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112767000015"><B><Member ContinuationText="Alec Shelbrooke" PimsId="5639" UID="13112767000794" xid="1087" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112767000794">Alec
Shelbrooke:</Member></B> I could not agree more. What I am saying is
that we need to grow an economy to ensure that we can get to a living

the cost of living.</hs_Para>

cost of living so high today? That is the fundamental question.
Fundamentally, the cost of living comes down to one very important
point—energy. We have had a lot of debate in the House this
afternoon about whether to have an energy freeze, but if we freeze
energy prices for a fixed period, prices will get ramped up before and
after the freeze, as happened with the beer price freeze in the 1960s.
We must take a more long-term
view.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112767000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112767000017">How
did we end up where we are? It is my personal view—I support
what was in our manifesto, and I wish we had moved further on
it—that we need to start replacing our power stations, and at
the moment nuclear power stations are by far the best way forward. It
has taken a lot of effort and lengthy negotiations to get to one
nuclear power station; we should be building five or six. But at the
same time the world oil price is rising, and will not go down despite
what anyone thinks. To put it in context, in 1998 a barrel of oil was
$5 a barrel, and yesterday Brent crude was $100 a barrel—I am
sure the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie) will correct me if
I am wrong. I believe that if oil reaches $140 a barrel, there is more
economically recoverable oil in the North sea than has already been
extracted. That is the reality of the
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112767000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112767000018">Energy
prices will not come down, so it is no good having a freeze for a
period, because energy prices permeate every aspect of the cost of
living—the price of food in the shops, the price of getting to
work. We always talk about the petrol price, which has a big impact on
getting to work, but we must do everything that we can to reduce the
cost of getting goods to the shops, because that hits people’s
wages. Since the start of this recession we have been on a wage freeze,
if not a wage reduction, to prevent the runaway unemployment that we
saw in the
past.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112767000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112767000019">What
frustrates me in debates such as that we are having today is not just
the barrage of criticism from the Opposition of the way in which the
Government have implemented their policies. That is fine; that is what
we are in the House for. We are here to say that we 
<?notus-xml column=355?>have a route, we are sticking to it, and we think that it is working,
and the Opposition are here to say, “We don’t
agree.” But I have not heard any real alternative in the Chamber
today. The closest we got—one of the more sensible speeches
today—was the contribution by the right hon. Member for Oldham
West and Royton (Mr Meacher), who is no longer in his seat.
He actually came up with some suggestions. I did not agree with
them—I thought they were pie-in-the-sky thinking—but at
least he stood there and put forward some
policies.</hs_Para>

proposals were completely lacking in the shadow Chief
Secretary’s speech. There was a constant barrage on what the
Government had, he thought, got wrong, but no recognition of the fact
that if we are going to tackle the cost of living crisis, we must
tackle its root causes. The cost of living is going up because energy
prices are high, and that has nothing to do with the six energy
companies—there were 14 when the Leader of the Opposition was
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, but there were only
six by the time he left that office, so it is a bit rich of him to come
across saying that it is terrible. The inescapable truth is that the
price of oil is not going to come down.</hs_Para>

Hosie:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting speech.
He talks about having more oil and it being economically extractable,
but he will accept that part of the equation is tax. Does he not regret
the massive hike in the North sea supplementary charge that resulted in
project after project being cancelled, and made certain fields less

Shelbrooke:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman will agree that the
hundreds of millions of pounds of tax credits that the Government have
made available to the oil and gas industry will help make that resource
more exploitable in future and keep the supplies on. It comes down to a
fundamental issue: what do we need to do to tackle the cost of living
crisis? What we do not need, and what my constituents do not want to
hear, is “It’s your fault for going down the austerity
route” or “The collapse of the banks is your
fault.” They want to say, “Look, we know all
that—we know what’s going on.” That is why in most
opinion polls, a majority of people still blame the Labour Government
for the economic mess we are in. <I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I>

tackle the core issue, and we have to do two things at the same time.
The Government are achieving the first one. We have put the economy on
the road to recovery following the deepest recession in the history of
the nation caused by lack of fiscal control of the banking
system—a tripartite system that allowed the banking industry to
run wild. Even today, as we see with the Co-op bank, the Labour party
is unwilling to take tough decisions with regard to banking. The only
public inquiry that the Leader of the Opposition does not want to call
for is into the Co-op—I wonder why, but we will find out when it
takes place.</hs_Para>

grow the economy, which will lead to wage rises, but we must also have
a much longer strategic look at how we supply energy in this country. I
agree with the Prime Minister—whether or not what was reported
in the newspapers was true, green taxes are regressive, and it is
amazing that the Labour party, which has always opposed regressive
taxation, says that we should keep a regressive tax and not push it
into a progressive tax. At the end of the day, energy prices have gone
up. <I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> These are luxuries from the
boom time that people can ill afford. It is a disgrace that, despite
the fact that we are doing everything that we can to grow the economy,
and create real jobs that will last and, I hope, be better proofed
against the ups and downs of Government spending in future, people are
struggling to deal with the cost of heating and the cost of food. The
fundamental cause is the high price of energy. It is absolutely vital
that the energy reforms and fiscal reforms introduced by the Government
carry on and should only be changed as we move forward with energy
policies for the long term, not short-term gimmicks. That is what
people need.</hs_Para>

flagship intervention policy one where he cannot be effective, and nor
does it make economic sense. As the hon. Member for Redcar (Ian Swales)
pointed out, the consequence of the Labour party’s position on
an energy price freeze has been to crater the willingness of energy
companies to invest in effective energy in the long term. It is very
sad that just a few weeks after the Chancellor had been to China to
secure investment in our energy sector—something that the Labour
Government sadly missed out on year after year—the Labour party
came up with another policy designed to make our energy more
inefficient, rather than efficient, in the long term. If we are going

bite-sized pieces so that he can keep up. It is important for a
Chancellor of the Exchequer to

we look at the United Kingdom’s debt in the mid-1990s and take
into consideration Government debt, household debt and corporate debt,
we will see that that total indebtedness was, like that of many other
OECD countries, two times the size of our national economy. Over the
intervening 15 years—which in this country were spent mostly
under a Labour Government—other OECD countries saw their total
debt go from about two times to about three times the size of their
economy, and that includes all of the impact of the financial crisis.
One country in the G8—and only one—increased its total
debt from two times to five times the size of its economy, and that was
the United Kingdom under the previous Labour Government. It is the
consequence of that pervasive debt in the economy that is the real cost
of living crisis in this

the past 10 years, the United Kingdom has created a massive level of
state intervention to support wages at the low end of the income
spectrum. In order to try to improve living standards for people at the
low end, we have to encourage employers to somehow pay higher wages.
References have been made to the living wage. One of the issues about
changing people’s income from the minimum wage to the living
wage is that the change to their take-home pay, including any benefits
they receive, becomes a very small change in their net income level,
because the tapering of benefits takes away nearly all the impact of
the increase in wage rates. A change to the living wage is therefore a
transaction involving additional cost to the employer and additional
benefit for the Exchequer; it does not result in additional pay to the
employee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112767000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#13112767000064">We

pay. What are we doing about their tax and their benefits? For people

it is about time that they educated themselves on how difficult this is

energy costs, which we know have risen by almost £300, thanks to
the inactivity of this Government. I was absolutely appalled to

household income on heating their homes. That is fuel

Prime Minister and his colleagues tell us that the answer is to switch
suppliers. Well, 34% of my respondents told me that they had switched,
but then found themselves paying more for their heating than they were
saving. Most of the 66% who had not switched suppliers told me that
that was not because they were happy with their current supplier, but
because, “They’re all the same. I would end up paying
more.” As for the Prime Minister’s advice on whether to
wear a jumper, the response of 97% of my constituents was, “Wow,
patronising or

people to thrive academically in that environment, or even simply get
the space to do their homework? I was told, “I don’t have
the heating on as long as I’d like to, to save money”,
and “We don’t heat our home until it’s nearly
freezing inside.” Premature winter deaths soar in cold weather
when people are not able to heat their homes. The most recent

an average of £135 more per month. Let us also put into the mix

Gilmore:</Member></B> That stagnation is why so many of our
constituents are suffering so much. I was astonished by some of the
comments made this afternoon. The hon. Member for Harlow (Robert
Halfon) managed to suggest that unemployment was not down to the
recession but down to the entire period of the Labour Government. In
fact, when the global financial crisis hit in 2008, unemployment was a
little over 5% at 1.6 million, but by the end of 2009 it had risen by 1
million to 2.5 million. The cause of that rising
unemployment, so suddenly and over such a short period, was the
economic recession, not the Labour Government. Such rewriting of
history is constantly going on. Recently, however, that rewriting seems
not just to be about what caused the recession, but tries to read back
to the Labour Government and put things into that period that were not
the case.</hs_Para>

answer from the Government on what they have done to help people in the
cost of living crisis is to talk about the increase in the tax
threshold. The problem with that policy is that it unduly helps those
who are already better off, and does not help those with the lowest
income levels in our communities. Two thirds of the billions
of pounds that have been spent on raising the tax threshold has gone to
people in the top half of the income scale, because the policy benefits
people on higher incomes as much—if not more—as those on
lower incomes.</hs_Para>

the quid pro quo? There have been cuts to benefit payments and tax
credits, which has cancelled out the rise in the tax threshold for
those at the lower end of the income scale. Not only have those paying
no tax not benefited, but those at the bottom end who have apparently
benefited a little have had that 
<?notus-xml column=364?>cancelled out. That is what we must all remember. Those with the lowest
earnings have not benefited from the policy. Both Government parties
constantly say that the tax threshold is being raised because they want
to help the lowest earners. In fact, that policy has not benefited the
lowest earners, because in order to pay for it—it is very
expensive—there have been constant cuts to people’s
benefits.</hs_Para>

extreme end, those who say there has been no change should look around
their towns and cities. I have never seen so many quick lenders, payday
lenders, and companies such as BrightHouse spring up in such a short
period. It was not happening before. Food banks are new in my
lifetime—they were something I read about in the history books
of the 1930s. One of the Prime Minister’s favourite statements
about food banks is, “But usage of food banks went up tenfold
under a Labour Government.” The problem with that arithmetic is
that 10 times a very small number is still a very small
number—from 4,000 in 2005 when the Trussell Trust started up, to
40,000 in 2010. Last year, that figure rose to 347,000, and in the
first six months of this year, it has risen to 350,000. That very big
number is down to the policies of this
Government.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_27_PT_1/ECD890D52F2C4FFC4BF8542A78B3A7048A23B546" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="27 November 2013">Wednesday

explored, often with a resultant effect on a local community or a

indication of what to do when it comes to banks, regulations, skills

company’s success at winning an increased order book
with Sainsbury’s, Trigon doubled its production, introducing new
shift patterns for the work force. That resulted in negotiations
between management and the union to reward staff with a pay rise, which
they had forgone for many years to secure the viability of the company.
Indeed, some of the loyal work force had given more than 30 years of
service to Trigon. Everything in the garden looked

meet the new targets, Trigon stepped up production but soon encountered
cash-flow problems, due to the purchase of extra plant, material, raw
stock and associated manufacturing costs. To meet that
short-term liquidity problem, Trigon approached the Royal Bank of
Scotland for a loan totalling approximately £1.2
million. Given the developments this week with RBS, this might be
another case that requires further scrutiny from the Secretary of State
as it is clear that, for whatever reason, the company, despite being
profitable, was not awarded the loan. When that loan could not be
guaranteed, the business was destined to fail. RBS’s decision
came in August and just a month later the business was put into
administration. It is also worth noting that at the time of entering
administration the company’s stock value alone was £2.7
million.</hs_Para>

64 members of staff were handed immediate redundancy notices without
prior warning, consultation with their trade union officers or even the
courtesy of the administrator’s writing to me as the local MP.
That still rankles with those who lost their jobs. Those employees had
given decades of service and yet they were called to the works
cafeteria for a routine meeting, had their names read out and were then
told not only that they were losing their jobs but that they had to go

Unite officials and staff at the factory immediately after the

should make it clear that I am not suggesting the administrators did
anything illegal, but I believe it was certainly unethical and I told
them so. It remains likely that Unite will seek
30 days’ pay for its members through protective awards, a cost
that is likely to be borne by the Exchequer. However, once Trigon was
in administration only two outcomes were likely. First, the
administrator could look to keep the business operational by selling it
as a going concern. Although that would not absolutely guarantee the
future of the business, it was hoped that those who bought the going
concern would maintain production at the site, look to restructure the
business, re-launch the brand and invest in improvements. There was
another option: it would result in the administrator accepting a bid
from a company 
<?notus-xml column=378?>that would close the factory, sell the stock, plant and machinery,
transfer production to another site and make the whole work force
redundant. In other words, the fear was that an asset
stripper would decimate the business for a quick
profit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112767000722" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0004.htm#13112767000722">In
the case of Trigon, despite my best efforts and those of Unite it

I think that the balance is all wrong. I know that the closure of any
factory is a tragedy for that particular business and work force, but
when it makes no economic sense it is even harder for those
facing redundancy to accept. When the result also
lands the Treasury with a hefty bill for workers’ redundancy
payments and increased benefit bills—not to mention the
devastation to the local jobs market, the loss of business rates and
the blight of a large empty factory—questions need to be asked.
I believe that the need to ensure that administrators take greater
control of the social impact of the bids they accept is now
even
greater.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112767000724" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0004.htm#13112767000724">The
cold reality is that none of those factors could, in law, be taken into
consideration by the administrators, and I believe that that is
fundamentally wrong and needs to change. Some people may argue that
administrators indirectly take all those factors into consideration as
they look to keep businesses alive as going concerns, but they do not
have a mandatory requirement to consider the social consequences. The
law only directs them to make the biggest return for creditors, no
matter what the consequences might be for communities.</hs_Para>

dismissed back on site. I know that many of them are facing a bleak
Christmas for the first time in 30 or 40 years, through absolutely no

deliberations, but there must be some reflection of the wider social
impacts of each bid. I am acutely aware that this will not always
ensure that asset-strippers are not awarded businesses. I am also aware
that it will not always ensure that British workers stay in work and
that their jobs will not just be exported overseas once the sale is

For instance, since the global financial crisis, the impact on the

249 medium and large-sized retail businesses have failed

those companies were profit-making enterprises in the way Trigon was,
but undoubtedly some businesses were wound up that produced a

social consequences for everyone affected by closure. In other words, I

relations break down and are negative, whereas the day-to-day
experience is often of a much more positive and constructive working
relationship, helping to create future success for a business that is
going through difficulty. Although clearly for the 64 individuals who
have lost their jobs there is a heavy price to pay, it is worth noting
the success of at least making sure that 110 of those 174 jobs have
been saved as a result of the business being sold as a going concern.

understand the hon. Gentleman’s concerns about some of the
practices surrounding administration, and I will try to set out what
the Government are doing to address some of them. He said that the

case, or sometimes the perception, that a company is asset-stripped and
sold off to the highest bidder without any apparent concern for the

to provide reassurance by going through the hierarchy of objectives for
administrators. The top priority that they have to bear in mind is
business rescue—to rescue a financially troubled company as a
going concern. That is well aligned with the wider social objectives
that the hon. Gentleman seeks to promote, including the interests of
employees and other stakeholders. Generally, the best way of making
sure that creditors can be paid and jobs can be saved is to ensure that
the business can continue as a going concern. If that is not possible,
the administrator is required to achieve a better result for the
creditors of the company as a whole than would be achieved in an
immediate winding-up. Only if neither of those things is possible is it
their duty to realise the property and the assets for the benefit of
the secured or preferential creditors. We have a system that places
priority on business rescue, which is incredibly important and
ultimately the best way to secure the jobs of the individuals who are
working for a company.</hs_Para>

to have a chance of rescuing a failed company, urgent and robust action

mean that it is the fault of the administration procedure per se; it
may be a reflection of the economic reality of a company that cannot
meet its obligations. Thankfully, the number of administrations and
liquidations has been on a downward trend in recent years. In the

prevent businesses from getting into this situation in the first place.
The hon. Gentleman outlined the scenario of Trigon Snacks, where so
much stemmed from the declining of a request for a loan. I am sure he
will understand that I cannot necessarily comment on the specifics of
that loan application, but this is an issue on which we share some
general concerns. In fact, this week the BIS entrepreneur-in-residence,
Lawrence Tomlinson, published a report in which my right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State has taken a great interest and has referred to
the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation
Authority, which looks at the role of banks particularly in relation to
the support they give to business. The report focuses on significant
concerns about the conduct of the Royal Bank of Scotland. We are
looking carefully at the evidence in the report to see whether further
issues need to be raised within the regulatory bodies regarding
insolvency practitioners and whether any legislative framework issues
need to be addressed in relation to the behaviour of
banks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112767000749" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0004.htm#13112767000749">Generally
speaking, our insolvency regime is highly regarded internationally. A
recent World Bank report rated it seventh—above those of the US,
Germany and France—on resolving insolvency. That is partly a
reflection of the flexibility of our regime for prioritising business
rescue, which helps to preserve value and jobs. That focus, rather than
any specific obligation to consider particular affected parties over
others, helps to balance everyone’s interests and to create a
better business environment, which improves the prospects for
preserving these jobs in the long term. However, I absolutely recognise
the concerns that the hon. Gentleman raises about this case and
others.</hs_Para>

briefly to some of the other issues raised about insolvency. On the
effectiveness of the regulatory regime, we believe that stronger
oversight powers would help to improve confidence in it. We will
therefore introduce proposals, when we can find time in the legislative

oversight
regulator.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112767000751" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0004.htm#13112767000751">Concerns
have been expressed about the pre-pack administration process,
particularly where there are sales back to connected parties. In the
light of these concerns, I announced in July that Teresa Graham had
been appointed to undertake an independent review of the pre-pack

There have also been changes to introduce a revised practice standard
for pre-packs, known as SIP16, which is now in place. The complaints

The Bradford &amp; Bingley 2007 accounts were published in April 2008.
The auditors passed Bradford &amp; Bingley as a going concern and a
dividend was paid. In August 2008, a rights issue was completed at a
price of 55p less than eight weeks before the nationalisation. The
auditors KPMG completed extensive audit work on the rights issue, and
the interim results announced on 29 August 2008 supported a solvent,
well capitalised bank. With net assets of £1 a share and a tier
1 capital ratio of 9.1%, shareholders were entitled to believe that
Bradford &amp; Bingley was a going concern when the reality was that it
was “going, going, gone” just one month
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112744000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112744000024">Within<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T09:38:40"></hs_TimeCode>
days of the nationalisation, the Government provided more than
£60 billion of support to the two Scottish banks. Bradford &amp;
Bingley had a far stronger balance sheet than those banks, as shown in
the banking crisis post mortem published by the Local Authority Pension
Fund Forum. Furthermore, the public statements of the board emphasised
the balance sheet strength of Bradford &amp; Bingley on 29 August and
25 September 2008, a day before the nationalisation decision. That
strength was again confirmed by Messrs Kent and Pym, the chairman and
chief executive respectively, at a Treasury Committee hearing on 18
November 2008. Their statements conflict directly with the
justification of the nationalisation decision by both the Government
and the tripartite regulatory authorities.

far too narrow and that the Labour Government concealed the fact that

their company. Many of them lost not only their jobs, but their
savings. The Government of the time were encouraging other financial
institutions to support the rights issue, only to ensure that they then
lost everything as a result of the way the banks were nationalised and

conclusion, an independent inquiry into the nationalisation of Bradford

bondholders and employees, and the local community, are entitled to
know the truth. The Prime Minister has claimed, many times, that he is
committed to open and transparent government, and he has opened an
inquiry into the Co-op bank failure. I believe it is not too late for
the Government to do the same—open an independent
inquiry—with respect to the Bradford &amp; Bingley
nationalisation. That was, arguably, the best example of what went
wrong in the banking crisis, particularly in relation to the flawed
accounting standards that are still in place. Justice and the British
sense of fair play demand such action, and I hope that the Minister,
who is a good man, will do the right thing and agree to it.</hs_Para>

issue has perplexed and bemused many of my constituents who bought
shares in the company in a rights issue in 2008, only eight weeks
before the Government of the day nationalised it. They bought shares
not because they were high rollers who invest in the stock market to
make a quick buck, but because many of them are shrewd pensioners who
thought they were making safe, long-term investments for their future
in retirement. One might say, “Well, if you invest in the stock
market, you should be aware of the risks. You should expect the peaks
and troughs and be prepared to take the rough with the smooth.”
Every one of my constituents who contacted me from Calder Valley has
highlighted that very point; but they have gone on to say that the
balance sheets of the bank were good,  and were definitely in a
stronger position than those of many banks that the Government of the
day decided  to bail

might also argue, as Lord King did a year ago, that it was
Britain’s faulty banking accounting rules that failed investors.
My constituents would argue that in that case, the same faulty rules
applied to all banks. Even so, the Bradford &amp; Bingley was still
showing a stronger balance sheet than many of the banks that were
bailed out. We know that from the banking crisis post mortem published

the Bradford &amp; Bingley’s. As

to some of the issues that have been raised. Hon. Members will no doubt
be disappointed that I was not in Parliament or a member of the
Government at the time of Bradford &amp; Bingley’s
nationalisation, and I am therefore not able to speak from personal
experience. The collapse of Bradford &amp; Bingley came about during
the worst global economic downturn since the great depression, and we
must remember the serious situation that the then Government were
facing, which, to be fair, hon. Members have recognised. It is also
worth remembering that we had seen just 12 months earlier
the first run on a bank for 80 years at Northern Rock. I recall queues
of people outside the bank’s branches seeking to withdraw their
money, with police having to be deployed in some instances. It was the
duty of the Government of the day not only to secure an agreement on
the future of Bradford &amp; Bingley but to steady the financial system
and to ensure that the country would get through those turbulent
times<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T10:01:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112744000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112744000057">We
should also remind ourselves of the surrounding circumstances at that
time. It was important to take account of the 2.5 million people who
had a total of £22.2 billion invested in Bradford &amp; Bingley.
A million people had a mortgage with the bank. It had also been
particularly exposed to the falling house market after specialising in
buy-to-let and self-certification mortgages. I am tempted to go off on
a slight tangent and discuss how housing bubbles are created, but that
would do a disservice to those concerned about this particular debate,
so I will not at this

&amp; Bingley had fallen £26.7 million into the red in the first
six months of 2008, so the circumstances were serious. Bad loans
increased by 86% between January and June 2008 compared with the same
period the previous year. Shares had fallen some 93% in the year before
nationalisation, dropping to just 20p the week before. In the first six
months of 2008, more than 9,000 customers had their homes repossessed
or were more than three months behind with their payments, which was
twice the average. Some 370 jobs had been lost, with a further 3,000 at
risk. At that time, following various plans to raise funds from
shareholders, the confidence of the City had been

the time of Bradford &amp; Bingley’s problems, the Government of

financial stability but to ensure that ordinary savers were protected.
My understanding is that they did that in good faith and believed it to
be the correct thing to do. I am sure that it was not an easy decision,
but following the Financial Services Authority declaring default on the
bank’s borrowings, the Government took decisive action. It is
also worth noting that it was not only the previous Government who
thought that that was the correct decision. People who were in

that it was right.

nationalisation of Bradford &amp; Bingley was one of the key outcomes
of the financial crisis. The crisis was the biggest failure of economic
management and banking regulation in this country’s history. Let
me remind hon. Members of the events preceding the crisis. Over the
decade before the crash, Britain experienced the biggest increase in
debt of any major economy in the world. The total of household,
corporate, financial and public sector debt reached a staggering 500%
of GDP. UK banks became the most leveraged in the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112744000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112744000083">None
of that, however, caused concern or invited intervention under the
failed tripartite system of regulation created 16 years ago. The Bank
of England was stripped of its historical responsibility for regulating
the banking system, which was given to a new Financial Services
Authority. Let me quote a warning from 16 years ago by the then shadow
Chancellor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden
(Mr Lilley). During the passage of the Bank of England Act 1998, which
created the failed tripartite system, he

fundamental reform of our system of financial regulation. We have
introduced domestic legislation to increase the resilience of financial

England clear responsibility for maintaining financial stability;
establishing the Financial Policy Committee within the Bank as a strong

nationalisation have been looked at by both the National Audit Office
and the Treasury Committee. But on the matter of information, I have to
agree with the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley,
and, in particular, with the request made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Chippenham (Duncan Hames), who asked the shadow spokeswoman to use
her good offices to speak to the former Prime Minister, the former
Chancellor and others who were Ministers under the previous Government

transfer of Bradford &amp; Bingley into public ownership,
the previous Government made the Bradford &amp; Bingley plc
Compensation Scheme Order 2008, which 
<?notus-xml column=91?>was debated and approved by each House. The order provided for a
mechanism through which compensation for former shareholders would be
assessed by an independent valuer. As we have heard, after conducting a

Friend the Member for Shipley asked whether it was right that the
valuer should have been asked to work on the basis that there was no

taxpayers themselves were
providing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112744000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112744000095">Following

there have also been investigations by the NAO and the Treasury

what I have seen I am not persuaded that there is a case for a
further investigation or

I conclude, I want to respond specifically to a number of my hon.
Friend’s questions. He talked about the rights issue that took
place just before nationalisation. From the information I have seen, I
can tell him that the Treasury had no involvement in that rights issue
at all; as we have heard, the rights issue was conducted in the summer
of 2008, prior to nationalisation, and was a matter solely for Bradford
&amp; Bingley’s board and senior management. Like many banks and
building societies at that time or thereabouts, Bradford &amp; Bingley
was required to meet FSA regulatory capital requirements in order to
continue with those regulated activities.</hs_Para>

Friend also raised the issue of accounting standards, and in particular
IAS 39, which he said was problematic and could perhaps take some blame
for the financial crisis. He is right to raise accounting standards and
the contribution they could have made to the crisis. The issue has been
looked at extensively by authorities around the world, including the
International Accounting Standards Board. The board has proposed a
series of changes to IAS 39 and other, similar accounting practices.
Those changes essentially mean that, in future, banks will have to hold
more capital or take losses earlier on problematic loans.</hs_Para>

also rightly expressed his concerns about the future of a number of his
constituents who were transferred to UKAR during nationalisation and
are currently UKAR employees. He was absolutely right to say that those
people have considerable expertise and experience in an important
sector. My understanding is that currently over 2,000 staff are still
employed in managing the closed mortgage books of both Bradford &amp;

Friend may take some comfort from knowing that those people’s
skills are such that it seems they will face growing demand for them:
the Council of Mortgage Lenders recently said that mortgage lending in
the third quarter of this year was at its highest level since 2007 and
is growing strongly thanks to the Government’s policies and the
economic growth we are experiencing. I am sure that the value of the

right direction. The number of apprenticeship starts in 2011-12 in the
north-east was 38,340, an increase of 11% since 2010-11. That, in turn,
was up from 18,510 in 2009-10 and 13,500 in 2005-06. In my
constituency, the number of apprenticeship programme starts rose from
430 in 2009-10 to 800 in 2011-12, which is the last fully assessed
year. There is not a single one of the 29 constituencies in the
north-east in which apprenticeship starts have not increased
dramatically since 2010.</hs_Para>

Michael Egger. He clearly sees his employees as the key to the future
prosperity of the business, and the academy is the latest phase in more

responsible not only for 550 local jobs, but for 1,500 other jobs that
are linked in through forestry and other businesses. I was lucky enough
to work on the factory floor as part of Children in Need. I was
not very good, but it was a great experience. I particularly liked
meeting the apprentices, who were, by and large, from Hexham. They had

college now the new building is up, running and, I understand, buzzing
with learners. That is just as well, because the number of over-19s in
further education in the north-east went up by 6% in the last year for
which figures are available. There is clearly an increasing demand for
education and skills at that level, among not only employers—we
heard a lot of stories that corroborate the evidence I have on the
demand from employers—but students as well.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=99?>the strongest groups in areas where new schools are needed most and
those that have rigorous education and recruitment
plans. I am sure he agrees that it is important to ensure that new
provision is rigorous and responds to the needs of local employers, not
least because UTCs provide the opportunity for employers and
universities to work together, and therefore drive up the standard of
technical education between 14 and 18. We are considering the south
Durham UTC application, with others we have recently received, and we
have interviewed the applicant group. Applicants will be notified of
the outcome in the new year. Lord Nash and the Secretary of State will

hon. Friend also talked about the need to improve standards and quality
in the skills system. I strongly endorse that point. Last
month’s report by the OECD, comparing skills levels across the
whole developed world, was a stark reminder of how much more we need to
do. We—England and Northern Ireland—were the only country
in which the skill level in maths and English of our 15 to
25-year-olds was no higher than that of our 55 to 65-year-olds. In the
long-running debate about whether more exam passes mean better
education, that is extremely strong independent evidence that we have
to stop that flatlining and start improving our standards, because
every other country in the developed world is doing that. That is
hugely motivating in the task of driving up standards, especially when
youth unemployment is far too high, although thankfully it is now
falling. At the same time, there are increasing skills shortages, some
of which my hon. Friend
mentioned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112745000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112745000040">We
have introduced faster and more robust intervention processes for
failing colleges and we driven up the quality of provision through a
new and more rigorous Ofsted inspection framework. We are reforming
qualifications so that we fund only those that employers sign off. I do
not know whether my hon. Friend has managed to read Nigel
Whitehead’s report, but its recommendations are sensible and are
about driving rigour and responsiveness through the adult
qualifications
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112745000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112745000041">That
brings me to the proposal by the north-east LEP. My hon. Friend
mentioned that it is one of three LEPs through which we are piloting a
new mechanism to ensure that there is local influence over the use
of the skills system. He said that he was thrilled that the
north-east LEP was chosen for the pilot. I would go further: the
north-east LEP invented the idea and brought it to us. We were
impressed by it, and two other LEPs came on board to ensure that the
mechanism was piloted in more than one area. The north-east LEP is not
only a leader on piloting; it is a thought leader on how we can ensure
that the skills system is responsive to local
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112745000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112745000042">My
hon. Friend asked for details on how the proposal will work. The
proposal is that 5% of funding for all adult provision outside
apprenticeships will be allocated if, and only if, the provision is in
line with LEP priorities. The LEP will have sign-off. Rather than
giving 5% of the funding to the LEP, we have instead said that the LEP
will have the final say over what is essentially a quality
payment—the final 5% of all adult skills funding outside
apprenticeships. That will ensure that the whole provision is targeted
at LEPs’ needs. There is good 
<?notus-xml column=100?>collaboration in the north-east between the LEP and colleges, and the
proposal will help to incentivise education providers to look to the
strategic needs of business—not only directly but through the
LEP—and ensure that the LEP focuses on that. Our job is
to ensure that there is enough flexibility in the
funding system to allow providers to switch provision according to the
needs of local private or public sector employers. That will ensure
that the system is filling skills
shortages.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112745000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112745000043">In
the past, when there have been shortages of training in one area,
people have come to the Minister and said, “There is a shortage
in this area. Can you fix it?” There is one thing I know for
sure, and that is that I do not and cannot know, through a central
bureaucracy, the skills needs of every area. It is far better to try to
make the system responsive to local need, instead of trying to direct
solutions to skills shortages from Whitehall. The proposal is about
making it easier for colleges to respond to the needs of
employers.</hs_Para>

is also about providing capital for skills provision. Capital funding
will follow LEP priorities from 2015-16. Very recently, the Secretary
of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, my right hon. Friend the
Member for Twickenham (Vince Cable), announced that we would be
financing a further £330 million of skills capital in 2016-17,
which provides the long planning horizons that many crave. Those
horizons have been too short-term in the past.</hs_Para>

to the work of all those involved in getting the pilot with the
north-east LEP up and running as a policy. It will hit the ground
running from September 2014. That policy is part of a broader attempt
at making the skills system more responsive to employers. I mentioned
that it does not cover apprenticeship funding, which is because we have
a broader set of reforms on how apprenticeships are funded to ensure
that funding is directly responsive to employers’ needs. We will
be working through employers. The taxpayer rightly pays a subsidy
towards apprenticeships, because if someone is in an apprenticeship,
they are not only doing the job but learning. Apprenticeships benefit
the employer, the apprentice and wider society. Recognising that, the
taxpayer subsidises apprenticeships. We are changing how they are
delivered so that the employer has more of a say over what training
happens within an apprenticeship. That will ensure that the training
fits the needs of the apprentices and the employer, which will drive up
standards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112745000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112745000046">My

on either side. Increasingly,  employers, whether private or

introducing an apprenticeship stream in addition to a graduate scheme.
The civil service has just brought in an apprenticeship fast stream to
match its graduate fast stream. This week, MI5 and MI6 announced that
they are introducing an apprenticeship scheme in addition to their more
traditional graduate recruitment. That is happening across different

have an ambition, but we will only be able to persuade people that it
is the right ambition so long as we continue to drive up the quality of

have to ensure that quality goes up across the board. We have brought
in some tough measures to increase quality by ensuring that all
apprenticeships last a minimum of a year, that the English and maths
requirements are stronger and that there is actually a job. In the
past, some apprenticeships happened without a job attached. Those
measures have meant that we have had to remove some low-quality

or tuberculosis, is a disease that many people believe belongs to the

the world today than any other infectious disease. Every day, 3,800
people die from it. Sunday is world AIDS day, so it is worth
remembering that TB is the leading killer of people living with HIV. At
least one third of the 35.3 million people living with HIV worldwide
are infected with latent TB. People co-infected with TB and HIV are
about 30 times more likely to develop active TB disease than people
without HIV. Given the devastating synergy that exists between the two
infections and the impact that they have on people living in the
developing world, it is absolutely vital that resources are stepped up
now so that we not only effectively tackle TB-HIV co-infection but

the UK, we can be tempted to believe that TB no longer poses a threat
to public health. There is a widespread belief that the BCG vaccine is
effective and that today TB only affects other countries. However, in a
connected world of global travel, TB is never far away. That came home
to me forcibly when an English student returned from foreign travel
with the disease and subsequently infected other students attending the
college of which I was principal. Students and staff found dealing with
the anti-TB drugs to be an ordeal. For a standard, non-drug-resistant
case, the treatment regime can require a six-month course of a cocktail
of four drugs. Those “front-line” drugs are more than 40
years old now and have unpleasant side-effects. It was a challenge for
me as college principal, working with the local NHS, to get people to
take the drugs they had to take. It must be an even bigger challenge to

I am free to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T14:40:48"></hs_TimeCode>. It is, quite
properly, a cross-party co-chairmanship, which reflects growing concern
in the House about what is often a “Cinderella”

the loss of thousands of lives and we are, properly, marking world AIDS

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T14:41:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Gentleman pointed out, between HIV and tuberculosis, which many still
believe is essentially a disease of the past. Indeed, before I became
involved in this movement, I thought so too. In the 19th century,
tuberculosis—consumption—was regarded sometimes even as a
romantic disease, as featured in many operas of that era, yet one in
four people in Europe were dying of
consumption<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T14:42:02"></hs_TimeCode> at
that time. It was only with the advent of modern
medicine—antibiotics—and the west’s attack on
poverty in the late 19th and early 20th century that the disease was
brought under
control.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112746000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112746000023">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T14:43:23"></hs_TimeCode>
are some sobering observations to make about the rate at which
TB—which, as the hon. Gentleman said, has now resurged here, as
a disease of the present—is being tackled, compared with the
rate at which the west dealt with it in that era. At the current level
of progress that the west in making in dealing with a disease that is
still claiming 1.3 million lives a year—unnecessarily, because
in the main it is easily and cheaply curable—we will have to
rapidly step up the efforts that are being made, because the incidence
of this disease is currently declining by 2% a year. If we continue at
this rate, it will take more than a whole lifetime—a whole
generation—and it will be more than 100 years before we tackle
this disease properly and get it under
control<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T14:43:13"></hs_TimeCode>. That
will mean that millions of lives will needlessly be
lost.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112746000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112746000024">On
top of that, there is a growing threat—one that now amounts to a
serious issue for this country as well—of drug-resistant TB, the
emergence of which is entirely a reflection of the ancient way in which
we treat this disease. Were it not for the fact that people with TB
require lengthy treatment with antibiotics, because the drug regimens
are old-fashioned and no new drugs have been developed, and were it not
for the prevalence of counterfeit drugs and the inadequacy of health
regimes, drug-resistant TB might not have developed with such ferocity.
However, it is now a serious matter of concern, and not just in
developing countries, where people unlucky enough to be diagnosed with
drug-resistant TB—and few are—almost always face a death
sentence. Acquiring drug-resistant TB in a developed country with an
advanced health system would still require an expensive and extremely
painful course of treatment over months and
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T14:44:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112746000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112746000025"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Gregory Campbell" PimsId="2448" UID="13112746000212" xid="95" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112746000212"><B>Mr

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T14:45:20"></hs_TimeCode> starting

us face up to the fact that if the resurgence of this disease had been
in the west, it would already have been tackled by now. The
pharmaceutical companies would have had a commercial interest in
developing better diagnostics and tools, better drugs and, indeed, a
vaccine. Another common misconception is that a vaccine is 
<?notus-xml column=106?>available to deal with TB, but only the BCG vaccine exists, and that is
generally ineffective for most forms of TB and works for children for a
limited time. Had this disease resurged in the west, by now we would
already have these things, but we do not, because the drug companies
did not have a commercial interest in developing them, essentially
because the disease was found in developing countries without the
economies or the wherewithal to pay for these new
tools<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T14:46:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112746000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112746000028">There
can be no better example of the necessity for intervention by wealthy
western Governments, who have the resources to ensure that such a
disease can be tackled, not just in the interests of ensuring that
lives can be saved—there is a profound moral reason to tackle
this anyway—but in the west’s interests in securing the
economic development of high-burden countries that are afflicted with
this disease, which is a tremendous brake on economic development. Of
course, TB is a disease that knows no borders, and with migration, and
so on, we face the prospect of it resurging in our country. We have
higher rates of TB in this country now—although they are low by
comparison with high-burden countries in the rest of the

Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T14:47:19"></hs_TimeCode>. We have

the Member for St Ives (Andrew George) said about the UK
Government’s recent commitment, which has not been sufficiently
noticed, to replenish the global health fund. That is a fantastic
commitment, not just because of the absolute sums pledged to the global
health fund—which is an effective means of tackling TB and is
responsible for 80% of the funding for TB programmes across the
world—but because it sends a powerful message, ahead of the
replenishment summit next Monday, to other potential donor countries
about the value of stepping up our efforts at this

that it is making, our efforts to tackle TB would go into

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T14:49:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend’s point, because TB control programmes rely on funding

final point is that although the Government’s support for the
global health fund is welcome, it is important to understand that that
is not the only thing we need to do if we are to get on top of TB
globally. Setting aside the action that needs to be taken
domestically—Health Ministers are making progress on what needs

have no chance of treating them or getting hold of the disease. The
power of TB REACH is that it funds innovative programmes on the ground
that are finding new ways to go out and identify the missing 3 million
cases. TB REACH has been robustly evaluated and shown to deliver value
for money. It is relatively cost-effective, but its funding is coming
to an end. TB REACH was largely set up with funding from the Canadian
Government and now does not have sufficient funding to identify all the
necessary cases. TB REACH has helped to identify some 500,000 cases in
the past year, and it needs to do

the annual general meeting of the all-party group on coalfield

by its very nature, mining will never be completely safe—it is
an extractive process—our mines were about as safe as they could
be, and the health, safety and well-being of miners was paramount.

costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112746000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112746000046">Today,
much of the world’s coal production has been offshored and
outsourced to countries where health and safety standards are minimal
and labour is cheap. There is still blood on the coal, but nowadays it
is more likely to be the blood of miners in Colombia, China or South
Africa. The price of the irresponsible pursuit  of profit and

of the biggest employers of men in South Africa. Tens of thousands of
those miners are migrant workers, from neighbouring countries such as
Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland, who work and live in crowded
townships in mining areas. As has been said, diseases such as malaria,
TB and HIV/AIDS are rife. South Africa’s mining industry has
been the subject of intense international and national media scrutiny
due to the recent industrial unrest. Members will be aware of the
appalling shooting of striking miners by armed police in scenes
reminiscent of the worst days of apartheid. Mining is one of the
driving forces of the South African economy; it contributes some 20% of
the country’s gross domestic product and is a major
employer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112746000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112746000048">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T14:59:04"></hs_TimeCode>
has not been subject to the same degree of media attention is the
devastation caused to miners and their families by TB. The disease
remains the leading cause of death in South Africa today. One third of
all cases in sub-Saharan Africa have a link to the mines. TB is an
airborne disease, spreading through the air when people who have it
cough or sneeze, and it is often fatal if left untreated. Rates of TB
among South African mineworkers are estimated to be as high as 7,000
per 100,000. That huge figure is 28 times the World Health
Organisation’s definition of a health emergency and is the
highest such figure in the
world<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T14:59:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112746000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112746000049">As
we have heard, TB is closely linked to HIV, which is also a challenge
in the mines. It is estimated that people with HIV are 21 to 34 times
more likely to develop active TB. As we approach world AIDS day, it is
important to reflect on that and on the interactions between the two.
Such high HIV infection rates, coupled with cramped living conditions
and exposure to silica dust, which damages miners’ lungs,
creates a perfect breeding ground for the disease. The effects are
devastating not only for the families of the many miners who die from
TB, but also for communities, companies and Governments.</hs_Para>

issues I am raising are relevant to the British mining companies

Along with the South African mining unions, I want to see the British

would like primarily to focus on the need to ensure the consistent
global provision of cheap, effective, high-quality drugs. I also want
briefly to reflect on the past in a slightly different way from other
hon. Members. More than 50 years ago, I actually caught TB, just while
I was waiting for my BCG vaccination. If the timing had been otherwise,
my life would obviously have been rather 
<?notus-xml column=111?>different. It is important to reflect on the fact that the BCG
vaccination is over 90 years old, and it seems incredible that we do

was in the sanatorium for seven months and can still remember the awful
drugs, which I think are exactly the same as those given today. Day
after day, I received injections and the most appalling tasting
medicine. To make things slightly better for us young teenagers, we

are still relying on the same drugs for standard TB. We need rapid
developments across the range of drugs. As has been mentioned,
drug-resistant TB and extreme drug resistant TB also exist, both of
which require a cocktail of drugs with horrendous side effects. The
duration and difficulty of treatment represents a major challenge to
patients completing treatment and therefore being fully cured. I was
fortunate enough to go on a trip with the organisation Results UK to a
village in Rwanda to meet patients who could not afford the transport

must also look at diagnosis. For the most part, just as when I had TB,
the diagnosis is through sputum smear microscopy, which can take
months, does not detect drug resistance and is ineffective at
diagnosing TB in children and among HIV-positive patients. A new
machine, GeneXpert, can detect some forms of drug resistance and can
provide an accurate result in two hours. It has been approved by the
WHO and rolled out across the world, but it is heavily dependent on
local infrastructure. A point-of-care, cheap, easy-to-use diagnostic
remains absolutely vital to achieving the quick diagnosis required to
reduce

person to person in the same way as TB that is not drug-resistant.
Clearly, early and rapid diagnosis and treatment completion are
essential to control TB. As many Members, including my hon. Friend the
Member for Scunthorpe, have said, TB is the leading killer of people
living with HIV/AIDS and accounts for one in five AIDS-related
deaths.</hs_Para>

TB develops primarily because it is treated with a number of drugs
taken over six to nine months. If medication is taken incorrectly or
stopped prematurely, the TB bacteria can re-emerge and become resistant
to the drugs used to treat TB. That sometimes happens because of the
provision of substandard drugs, because patients do not complete their
treatment or because the drugs are available only
intermittently.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112746000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112746000070">Multi-drug-resistant
TB is a form of TB that does not respond to the standard treatment
using first-line drugs and that is extremely difficult and expensive to
treat. As I suggested earlier, extensively drug-resistant TB occurs
when resistance to second-line drugs develops on top of multi-drug
resistance. Drug-resistant TB can take two years or more to treat with
drugs that are less potent, more toxic and much more expensive than
those used to treat a standard case of TB. The drugs are toxic and are
commonly associated with severe side effects, of which permanent
deafness is the most common. Almost all of them have limited
effectiveness, and most are more than 40 years old, as the hon. Member
for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) said. Fewer than 50% of
multi-drug-resistant TB cases are successfully treated and considered
cured.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112746000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112746000071">On
costs, multi-drug-resistant TB can be up to  450 times as
expensive to treat as a standard case of TB. In all 27 high-burden
multi-drug-resistant TB countries, the treatment cost is greater than
the annual average income. If multi-drug-resistant TB is not correctly
treated and develops into extensively drug-resistant TB, the chances of
someone being successfully cured are less than one in 10. The world
needs to recognise that. Extensively drug-resistant TB patients are
practically 
<?notus-xml column=113?>impossible to treat, but they often remain infectious and capable of
transmitting the disease to others. That scenario is often described as
a time
bomb.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112746000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112746000072"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jim Shannon" PimsId="650" UID="13112746000224" xid="1218" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0001.htm#13112746000224">Jim

the vice-president of Zambia, Guy Scott, visited another prison and
described it as hell on earth. I must say I have never been anywhere

prison was built by the colonial authorities in the 1920s to house
between 180 and 200 prisoners. Now it houses almost 2,000. We were
taken to cells no bigger than my bedroom at home. They were designed
to  sleep between six and 10 people, but now there are 80 to
100 prisoners locked in those rooms for up to 14 hours a day. I looked
at the room and wondered how they even fitted so many people in it.
Apparently the sleeping arrangement is to line up 12 people against the
wall, who crouch down with their backs to it. They sit down and open
their legs and the next 10 or 12 come and lie between their legs, and
so on, to cram them into all the available space. Mattresses and
blankets are completely
lacking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T15:21:26"></hs_TimeCode>. The
toilet facilities are completely inadequate for the number of
prisoners, and an open drain or sewer, containing a disgusting-looking
brown liquid, runs through the middle of the courtyard. Medical
facilities are lacking—the site has no health clinic and sick
prisoners lack medicine—and so is food. There is one basic meal
a day, which is completely lacking in protein. It is fair to say that
the conditions in the prison are not conducive to general

TB should not be part of someone’s prison sentence, but in that
prison it was. At one stage the TB infection rate was almost 100%. TB
is one of the fastest-growing epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa’s

the wider population, because the prisons act as a reservoir for TB. It
gets into the wider community through visiting, staff visits and the

commissioner of prison services, who was very open, and keen for us to
see the reality. Several hon. Members have mentioned TB REACH, and we
were shown a project that it had set up in the prison together with the
Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia. That programme
included TB and HIV screening, treatment, and the introduction of
isolation cells for prisoners with multiple drug-resistant TB. A
prisoners’ drama group had been organised to teach prisoners to
look for the signs of TB and understand how important it is for those
with the disease to make 
<?notus-xml column=115?>people aware of it and get the required treatment. The programme was
massively successful. The TB infection rate was down to 30%. That is

diagnosis and treatment are essential for the control of TB. As we saw
in Zambia, TB REACH runs pretty much the only mechanism designed to
target and treat the 3 million missing TB victims we have heard about.
One of its advantages is that it can react very quickly. It can provide
fast-track funding for projects, to get them up and running
quickly—often within six months. It is also willing to fund new
and innovative approaches. That is important, because organisations
such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria will
fund projects only if they have been proved successful. They will not

TB is an airborne, infectious disease, which is deemed incurable and is

families, partners and community when they have the disease, which
means they are much less likely to be treated. In the UK, stigma is a
barrier that prevents people from seeking treatment when they start to
feel ill. It also makes it difficult for health workers to identify
other people who might have been exposed, because patients are often
reluctant to admit to the possibility of their having infected
others.</hs_Para>

of the 1 million deaths from TB each year is the fact that it is a

Although I am responding to this debate as a shadow International
Development Minister, tackling TB demonstrates why we must never see

At the time, the Committee expressed real concerns about delays to DFID

as many as 8.7 million lives. I am pleased that Ministers took the
Committee’s concerns seriously and that next week the UK will be
part of the global health fund replenishment. 
<?notus-xml column=119?>If we are to eliminate TB globally, the fund

the global health fund is a vital player and the UK’s
contribution to it is extremely welcome, it remains the case that DFID
does not currently engage in bilateral funding of programmes related to
TB. That is despite the fact that, as has already been mentioned, the
UN high-level panel on the post-millennium development goals framework,
co-chaired by the Prime Minister himself, found that spending on TB
diagnosis, prevention and treatment returns £30 of benefits for
every pound spent; that surely satisfies the Government’s
demands for value for money. Will the Minister tell us more about how
DFID keeps under review its potential for funding TB-specific
programmes through bilateral
programmes?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112746000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0002.htm#13112746000112">Clearly,
Britain’s strategy for improving prevention, diagnosis and cure
of TB in the poorest countries has to go beyond specific
funds—here I develop the point made by the hon. Member for City
of Chester—in that it needs to be part of a holistic set of
policies to build up functioning, universal health services, the lack
of which holds back the fight against tuberculosis. Weak health care
systems are thought to be a key reason for the estimated 3 million
missed diagnoses of TB, increasing mortality rates from the disease. As
I mentioned, our own experience of the disease before the days of the
NHS should tell us that, if nothing else does.</hs_Para>

are right to be proud of the NHS, and we should not be shy about
promoting through our development work the benefits of universal health
care that is free at the point of use. Curbing a disease such as TB,
which is widespread and hits some of the world’s poorest people
disproportionately, is simply not going to happen if, when we attempt
to do so through health systems, user fees are levied. Put starkly, 27
nations are considered to have a high burden of TB drug resistance. In
each of those countries, the average cost of treatment exceeds the
annual GDP per capita. If the poorest people cannot afford treatment,
they will not receive it.</hs_Para>

good story to tell in this regard: in 2009, faced with concerns about
TB diagnosis at home, the then Government took the decision to remove
prescription charges for anyone attending a TB clinic. That should be
what we advocate and support in every developing nation we work with
that has a high TB incidence. Will the Minister put on the record
DFID’S position on providing bilateral support for health care
systems where user fees are currently charged? What specific work is
being done to ensure that TB treatments are available free of charge in
the nations with which DFID has a bilateral relationship? It is
important to set out that
principle.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112746000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0002.htm#13112746000115">Once

outlines the progress and challenges in reaching international TB

is wholly unacceptable, as it is wholly preventable. There are wider

Improving basic TB control is critical to prevent the further spread of

City of Chester (Stephen Mosley) effectively said, TB REACH funds
projects that the global health fund will not fund because they are
unproven. TB REACH allows innovation on the ground in such projects.
Will the Minister reflect on that and consider my request for a meeting

about its

antimicrobial resistance strategy, which sets out actions to
slow the development and spread of anti- microbial resistance,
including strengthened international collaboration. That is why DFID

controlling TB, with more than 56 million cases treated and 22 million

grounds for optimism, but we are not complacent about the significant
challenges ahead, in which the UK will continue to play its full

here under your chairmanship, Mr Dobbin. This is a short debate, which
I intend to use to put on the record the major reasons why the
Department for Transport should order a public inquiry under the
Inquiries Act 2005 into the offshore oil and gas helicopter transport
system.</hs_Para>

North sea oil and gas industry is crucial to the UK economy. The
industry and its supply chain claim 440,000 employees, around 30,000 of
whom work offshore. Its investment this year will be in excess of
£13 billion. It is an extremely important industry. Because of
the hostile environment of the North sea, the only reasonable method of
transport to and from offshore installations is by helicopter. Since
1976, there have been 13 helicopter-related incidents, in which 118
people have died. In addition to those, there were a further seven
fatalities in an incident in Morecambe bay in 2006.</hs_Para>

the past four years, we have had five separate incidents. In three of
those, the helicopter ditched in the North sea, thankfully without any
fatalities, but on 1 April 2009, 16 people died when a Super
Puma L2 aircraft crashed near Peterhead, and on 23 August this year,
four people died when a Super Puma AS332 crashed off Sumburgh. In all
five incidents, various models of the Super Puma aircraft were
involved. That aircraft is the workhorse of the North sea industry, and
it should be no surprise that those successive incidents have wrecked
the morale and confidence of offshore workers and their families, as
shown by a recent survey undertaken by Unite the
union.</hs_Para>

February 2009. The helicopter landed in the North sea in the most
dreadful conditions. Fortunately, all the people on the helicopter,

many reason<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T16:03:19"></hs_TimeCode>s why
an inquiry is necessary, but I will focus on three principal reasons.
First, the relationship between the oil industry and the helicopter
industry needs to be considered in some detail. The Competition
Commission carried out an inquiry into the industry in 2003 and
recognised at that time:</hs_Para>
<hs_brev UID="13112746000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0002.htm#13112746000190"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T15:29:21"></hs_TimeCode>“Oil
companies are much larger and commercially stronger organisations than
the helicopter
operators”,</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13112746000142" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0002.htm#13112746000142">and
that</hs_Para>
<hs_brev UID="13112746000191" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0002.htm#13112746000191">“oil companies
had become more determined to force down their supply
costs.”</hs_brev>
<hs_Para UID="13112746000143" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0002.htm#13112746000143">That statement is
accurate, but it is an understatement of the true position. The
contracts reached by the oil industry with helicopter and other service
companies are very one-sided. The contractor has obligations for a 
<?notus-xml column=125?>period. In the case of the helicopter operators, it is usually for five
years, whereas the oil majors can change the contract terms at any
time. When the oil price dips, oil companies look at their supply
contracts. In the late 1990s, when the oil price was consistently low,
many supply chain companies, including helicopter operators, had their
contracted prices cut severely. In one helicopter company with which I
had discussions, the cut was 20%. Something similar happened five or
six years ago when the oil price dropped again. The practice is common
in the North sea, but it is very difficult to see how a helicopter
company, when its prices are cut without notice to that extent, can
respond and at the same time maintain the maintenance and other costs
that are crucial to the safety of the service.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112746000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0002.htm#13112746000144">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T16:01:23"></hs_TimeCode>
do not know whether the Civil Aviation Authority is aware of that
practice. It should be, because significant cuts in income and
elsewhere could severely restrict an operator’s ability to
maintain safe standards. We should all know whether the CAA takes into
account the huge imbalance between the oil industry client and the
helicopter operators.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112746000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0002.htm#13112746000145"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T16:01:23"></hs_TimeCode>Given
the importance of the transport industry in the North sea, it does not
seem appropriate, at least to me, that the helicopter companies are
treated in exactly the same way as any other supplier. The service is
far too important. The huge imbalance between the oil and gas companies
and the helicopter contractors should not be allowed to prejudice
safety. The relationship should be subjected to the most intense
scrutiny. Given the recent international agreement with Iran, a drop in
the oil price is foreseeable when Iranian oil comes back into the
market. It is worth emphasising that as a good example of how volatile
the oil price can be.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112746000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0002.htm#13112746000146"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T16:06:00"></hs_TimeCode>The
second issue to consider is the significant disparity in how different
helicopter companies operate, particularly in how helicopters are
maintained, the training of engineers and other staff and company
cultures generally. I have spoken with a number of employees of
different companies, and it is clear that training regimes, the number
of flight hours and procedures vary considerably between companies.
This is not the place to go into that in detail, but the available
evidence suggests that the CAA should be taking a stricter line in its
scrutiny of individual companies, their practices and their safety
culture<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T16:06:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112746000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0002.htm#13112746000147"><Member ContinuationText="Dame Anne Begg" PimsId="3932" UID="13112746000238" xid="36" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/halltext/131127h0002.htm#13112746000238"><B>Dame

Is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T16:06:40"></hs_TimeCode> not the
reason that there has to be a much more wide-ranging inquiry into
helicopter safety, rather than the individual inquiries that go on when
something has gone wrong, that we should look to see what is the best

Doran:</Member></B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. There is a
huge issue about the advice and recommendations that the regulator

area of concern also relates to the companies, and it is about how the
CAA regulates the industry. Individual companies have different
practices for checks and maintenance during operating hours, which are
usually from 7 am to 7 pm. There should be a benchmark of best practice
that is rigorously enforced.</hs_Para>

one or more helicopter operators have attempted to develop a gold
standard in safety in all aspects of the operation, but those efforts
usually fail 
<?notus-xml column=126?>because of the fear of being undercut, or because of actually being
undercut, by a competitor. I understand, however, that all three of the
companies currently providing a service in the North sea are meeting at
the moment to see whether they can agree on improved practices that
they will all share. That is a move in the right direction, but it
prompts the question why the CAA did not take the initiative a long
time ago and insist on a gold standard across the board.</hs_Para>

the correspondence that I have had with the Department, the focus of
Minister’s responses has  been on the most recent
incident, which was the crash of 23 August 2013. Of course, that

history of transport in the North sea, and in particular the experience

According to the answer, the cost of the inquiry was estimated to
be—this was before the inquiry had completely
finished—about £3 million. That is a fairly cheap cost,
given the scope and length of the inquiry. The Library tells me that in
today’s money it is about £5.7 million. I checked the
cost of a Super Puma helicopter, which I thought would be of some
interest. It is $18 million, which is roughly £11 million, so
for the price of one Super Puma, we could have two Cullen

resume flights. The CAA would not have allowed the helicopter to resume

Ministers and those who manage the service. As a written answer to my

defence of the Minister, the last time I asked how many compulsory
redundancies we had seen on the Fylde specifically, the answer was
three. The headcount has reduced due to managed programmes of people
leaving the service. We have been fortunate on some levels that the
cuts on the Fylde coast have not been worse. We must recognise that
there will be ongoing challenges. We cannot assume that because we have
escaped lightly so far, we will continue to escape lightly in future.

purpose of today’s debate is not to rehearse statistics about
job losses or even to demand extra work for Fylde, but to look
specifically at how decisions are being taken about which sites are to
remain open, which are to close and, most importantly, where to move
the staff to from the three main sites. I may end up being arcane in a
moment—those who do not live on the Fylde might think,
“What is he talking about?”—but although the three
sites are only seven or eight miles apart, getting from Norcross to
Peel Park is a significant logistical challenge. It is not something
that many people who live on the Fylde would voluntarily choose
to do, but the decisions being made are forcing many people to make
difficult decisions about whether they can continue to work at the DWP,
given the caring responsibilities they have in their
families.</hs_Para>

Member for Stirling (Mrs McGuire), to visit the Fylde coast to look at
what was occurring there. We were fortunate in that she agreed to
appoint a “cluster lead” for the Fylde, who would have an
overall perspective on what was happening on the Fylde coast. Each of
the main sites would also have a site lead, who would feed into that
pyramid process. The key point I want to communicate to the Minister

not know what next week will bring, let alone what will happen in 2018.
Many at Warbreck house see 2018, when the transfer from the disability

2006, we have seen natural wastage, as we would in any organisation.
Cluster leads have retired or moved to other jobs, and the architecture
has broken down. The decision-making process that made for better
decisions has broken down. I shall take one, admittedly convoluted
example, which might demonstrate my point. The decision was taken to
wind down the most northerly site, Norcross, in September 2012. The
last date of occupation was to be 31 August 2013, but on 18 December
2012, it was announced that some 220 staff would remain on the Norcross
site at Tomlinson house, while the remaining staff would still transfer
to Warbreck and Peel Park. Peel Park is the most southerly of the
locations and Warbreck is squarely in the middle. Coping with the
changes caused problems for our constituents. We were grateful that
jobs were maintained on the Fylde, but the consequences of doing so
were difficult.</hs_Para>

recently, the DWP announced that the landlord at Marton Mere wanted the
DWP to leave the site, which meant that 265 people had to be rehoused,
but there was great confusion. Marton Mere is nearest to Peel Park, at
the southern end of the Fylde. There was uncertainty over whether the
staff would move to Warbreck or Peel Park. No one could decide; there
was oscillation between the two. In the end, the decision was made to
switch from Peel Park to Warbreck, specifically because Peel Park had
to accommodate those moving from Norcross. The most northerly staff had
to go to the most southerly site. A cluster lead might have said,
“Hang on a minute. Can’t we put the people nearest to
Norcross into the spaces at Warbreck and accommodate the people from
Marton Mere at Peel Park?” It might not have been possible, but
at least a cluster lead and a system of site leads would have allowed
such a debate to

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-27T16:39:31"></hs_TimeCode> do not mean to
be critical at all; I just observe that the best use of the DWP estate
must come from looking across the Fylde as a whole, from a Fylde
perspective, not just from looking at the distances on a map between

more effectively about how we best use Fylde recourses post-2018. Great

discussing the fate of civil servants on the Fylde, it seems eminently
sensible for both Departments to be part of that discussion. I recently
heard rumours—they are no more than rumours—that 50
people are being relocated to the SPVA from Liverpool to replace
50 casual staff taken on in the Blackpool area. Clearly
discussions

the Member for Lancaster and Fleetwood (Eric Ollerenshaw) mentioned,
there is a strong cross-party, non-partisan relationship with the PCS
on the Fylde coast. We always seek to do our best on behalf of those we
represent. That is because they are doing a superb job, often on low
wages and in difficult circumstances. Warbreck house does not have the
most heart-warming of HR departments, to put it mildly. I have heard
some appalling horror stories at times, but I want the civil servants
on the Fylde to have a strong and vibrant future. A key part of
achieving that will be to have a strategic cluster lead to enable the
Minister to be confident that decisions take into account the reality
of what is occurring on the Fylde, not just what a civil servant in
Sheffield has spotted on Google Maps that

have specific jobs to do. It is not the case that because closer desks

rightly said, we have excellent civil servants, who could operate it
brilliantly. It is therefore even more important that we do not have
just a civil servant, but a senior-grade civil servant like a camp
commandant, who can provide answers. Much of the work force feel
disjointed from the management in Sheffield and London, because they

England is aware of the challenges facing local authorities in the
current economic climate. Sport England is supporting over 80 local
authorities to develop a strategic approach to facility provision. This
includes Walsall, where they provided ongoing advice and support to
Walsall Borough Council. Use of Sport England’s strategic
planning tools enabled the Council to complete an evidence-based review
of leisure provision in the Borough, in order to identify what
provision is required, how it can be delivered and the need for
additional
investment.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13112753000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/petntext/131127p0001.htm#13112753000023">By
rationalising their swimming pools, local authorities can often deliver
cost savings through the replacement of older facilities with modern,
efficient, fit for purpose facilities which can run at no or greatly
reduced subsidy and still drive higher levels of participation. In
April this year, Sport England announced nearly £5 million of
lottery investment to upgrade pool changing provision at 19 pools
around England through the Improvement Fund. It is also managing the
relocation of nine Olympic legacy swimming pools around the country.
The total number of swimming pools in England has increased by 134
since 2011, and currently stands at
5116.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13112753000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/petntext/131127p0001.htm#13112753000024">While
decisions about the future of Walsall Gala Baths remain a matter for
the local authority, this Government welcome the news that the petition
prompted the Council to revisit their plans. In September, Walsall
Borough Council called for a further and more detailed report for
Cabinet and Council consideration, using a cost/benefit analysis
approach, as to how an investment cost (of around £1 million)
might ensure a further 10-year lease of life for this town centre

reports from our embassy and the media. Sadly, the recent attack on
Colonel Abdullah Al-Sayti's convoy on 18 November was not an isolated
event. On 11 October I condemned the assassination campaign in the east
of Libya, and during my recent visit to Libya, on 18 and 19 November, I
reassured the Libyan Prime Minister personally of our firm support for
the Libyan democratic transition, including in the area of security
assistance. We continue to stress the importance of all perpetrators of
serious crimes in Libya being brought to justice.</hs_Para>

attacks on African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur (UNAMID)

years of fighting. The increase in inter-tribal fighting, in addition

UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs assesses that
around 300,000 people have been newly displaced this year due to
fighting. All parties in Darfur need to ensure that humanitarian
organisations are given full and unfettered access to all areas. It is
vital that UNAMID has unrestricted access across Darfur, allowing them
to create the right security environment for humanitarian organisations
to operate. We regularly raise these issues in bilateral discussions
with the Government of Sudan, and with members of the Darfuri rebel
movements.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13112771000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/text/131127w0001.htm#13112771000213"><B><Member PimsId="5470" UID="13112771001991" xid="936" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/text/131127w0001.htm#13112771001991">Mr

quantify as there are scientific uncertainties in ecosystem service
changes in the marine environment and very little data that allow
valuation of these changes. Similarly, positive changes in economic
activity (e.g. tourism) are difficult to predict and attribute to
Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) due to the many factors that
contribute to economic growth in a particular sector. The consultation
Impact Assessment explained benefits qualitatively, while the final
Impact Assessment included some monetisation of benefits. However,
these are illustrative only due to uncertainty and do not capture the

Action Fraud is a reporting channel for crimes of this nature and is
not an investigatory body. It records crime and information reports on
behalf of the police and forwards all reports to the City of London
Police's National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB). The NFIB assess
reports it receives from Action Fraud and other organisations and makes
a decision on whether to disseminate crime packages to law enforcement

Gambling Act 2005, which include keeping crime out of gambling, the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport looks to the Gambling
Commission for advice. To ensure the licensing objectives are met the
Commission places obligations on gambling operators and works closely
with law enforcement agencies to tackle gambling-related crime such as
corrupt sports betting and money laundering. Evidence to the Culture,
Media and Sport Committee (as part of their 2012 report on the Gambling
Act 2005, “A Bet Worth Taking”) indicated that gambling
related crime is being controlled. The Committee concluded that the

A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted
patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs
are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not
represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more
than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in
different stays in the same
year.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">2.
Number of episodes with a main or secondary procedure. The number of
episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of
the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) procedure
fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. A record is only
included once in each count even if the procedure is recorded in more
than one procedure field of the record. Note that more procedures are
carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For
example; patients undergoing a "cataract operation' would tend to have
at least two procedures—removal of the faulty lens and the
fitting of a new one—counted in a single
episode.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><I>Source:</I></hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">Hospital

Ellison:</Member></B> The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency (MHRA) published an impact assessment (IA) on the regulation of
nicotine containing products (NCPs), including electronic cigarettes,
on 12 June 2013 which provided estimates of the costs
associated with medicinal regulation of NCP. A copy of the IA has been
placed in the Library and is available on the MHRA website
at:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13112771001945" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/text/131127w0002.htm#13112771001945">www.mhra.gov.uk/home/groups/comms-ic/documents/websiteresources/con286834.pdf</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13112771001326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/text/131127w0002.htm#13112771001326">The
IA estimates that there are several hundred companies offering
e-cigarettes for sale in the United Kingdom. One company in the UK is
known to be developing UK manufacturing capability and there is growing
interest amongst other companies. Regulating these products as
medicines would likely result in short term transitional losses for
some stakeholders, not least any current importers of unlicensed
products unwilling to invest in gaining the necessary authorisations
and licenses. In the long term, however, we would not expect owners of
the capital invested in the manufacture and supply of NCPs to suffer
losses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112771001327" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/text/131127w0002.htm#13112771001327">The
IA makes the assumption that it is likely that manufacturers, European
Union marketing authorisation holders, and all other participants in
the supply chain would seek to pass their incremental costs onto their
buyers, and ultimately to consumers. The extent to which UK consumers
would bear the incremental costs is unclear. Pricing of NCPs seems to
be constrained at the upper bound by the pricing of tobacco products.
The IA suggests that NCP consumers would be unlikely to suffer from
substantial price increases if these products were regulated as
medicines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112771001328" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/text/131127w0002.htm#13112771001328">The

available evidence is that electronic cigarettes are likely to be
substantially less harmful than smoking tobacco cigarettes, however,
there remains a paucity of scientific evidence on the long term health
effects of using these products. The value of the health gains
associated with a single successful quit attempt is very
substantial—the Department estimates it to be £74,000.
The orders of magnitude of estimated compliance costs suggests that a
policy of licensing e-cigarettes would have to create very few
additional successful quit attempts for the benefits to justify its
costs. It is estimated that implementing policies to reduce smoking
prevalence by 1% per year for 10 years in the UK would prevent over
57,000 deaths in that
period.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13112771000145" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/text/131127w0002.htm#13112771000145">Health

Lamb:</Member></B> Mefloquine (brand name Lariam) is one of several
drugs licensed for the prevention (chemoprophylaxis) or treatment of
malaria. As with any medicine, mefloquine may cause side effects in
some people and the potential risks should be balanced against the
expected benefits of therapy. Information on possible side effects is
available to the medical profession via the Summary of Product
Characteristics (SmPC), and to patients via the Patient Information
Leaflet.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112771001457" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/text/131127w0003.htm#13112771001457">The
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has recently
strengthened the warnings in the mefloquine SmPC, particularly
regarding the well-established risk of neuropsychiatric side effects.
The licence holder also issued a letter to health care professionals at
the end of October 2013 to increase awareness of these possible risks,
alongside a prescriber checklist and patient alert card to aid
compliance with the warnings. In November 2013, the MHRA issued a
further communication to health care professionals on

national guidance on the appropriate use of anti-malarial medicines
also summarises possible risks, and such guidance should be considered
when prescribing mefloquine. This includes guidance from the Advisory
Committee on Malaria Prevention (ACMP), which includes experts from the
medical profession. The ACMP approach to chemoprophylaxis is firmly
based on risk assessment taking into account the risk of exposure to
the potentially fatal malaria parasite, a person's medical history, and
the known side-effects of the various anti-malarial drugs. These
factors must all be taken into consideration by those prescribing
anti-malarials.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112771001459" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/text/131127w0003.htm#13112771001459">As

Agency (MHRA) continuously monitors the safety of all medicines on the

review of the benefits and risks of modafinil-containing medicines,
expert advice was sought from the Commission on Human Medicines
together with additional medical experts in the use of modafinil. As a
result of this review, the authorised use of modafinil was restricted

Truss:</Member></B> The Government knows that evidence based early
intervention is key to securing the best outcomes for some of the most
vulnerable children and families within our communities. The National
Evaluation of Sure Start concluded that children's centres need to
focus more directly on support shown to have a direct positive impact
on children's learning, for example on 
<?notus-xml column=358?>language development, but confirmed that they are well placed to support
the most vulnerable families. The Department for Education published
revised statutory guidance for children's centres in April 2013 to
ensure they were focused on the families most in need of
