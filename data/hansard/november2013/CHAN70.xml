lot of predictions from the Opposition Dispatch Box. They said that
there would be a decade of lost growth, but the economy is now growing
and  we have had the fastest growth in the G7 this year. They
predicted that 1 million jobs would be lost, but 1.4 million
jobs have been created in the private sector and unemployment is down.
Above all, they advocated—indeed, they continue to advocate,
because it was in the speech that the shadow Chancellor made
yesterday—increased borrowing, which would lead to higher taxes
and higher interest rates. The biggest threat to the British recovery
is sitting right opposite

Gentleman’s commitment to brevity but, unfortunately, his
attempted point of order was not as brief as I would wish, especially
as it was an attempted point of order rather than a genuine point of
order. I would say to him, in so far as he is alerting me and the House
to statements that he believes to have been in any way incorrect,
erroneous or partial, that Ministers and all Members are responsible
for the accuracy of their remarks in the Chamber. What we cannot have
is the continuation of debate by the ruse of a bogus point of order. If
I did not know the hon. Gentleman better, I would think that that was
his game plan, but as I know him as well as I do, and know him to be a

continued  to be paid until 1 August, causing an overpayment of
£1,431. Having approached me for help in early September, Mrs N
was left with the option of appealing the appeal without any income
during that time or of making a new claim for ESA from 16 September,
which she did—it was once again granted. My constituent was left
without income for almost six weeks, from 8 August to 16 September, and
was not advised to apply for an alternative benefit at any point
between March and September. She managed to keep debt collectors at bay

benefit entitlement was stopped in July, she did not receive a decision

entitlement to claim jobseeker’s allowance. She has not received
any income since July. She, too, has been stuck in benefit limbo. Her
doctor advised her that she is not fit for work and provided documents
to that effect, but the Government say she is fit for work, and,
because of an error in the system, she was not informed what she should
do. Had she been automatically enrolled on to jobseeker’s
allowance at the moment her previous entitlement ended, she would not
have been left without income. She would have been entered into the
system to either find work or be enrolled anew on appropriate state
support. What is important about this case is that I have previously
asked the Department for Work and Pensions what it does when ESA
entitlement ceases, and was told that it tells people to claim JSA.

unnecessary. The Department could simply start them on the new benefit,

that time, in order to avoid taxation, all but one of our major online
betting companies has moved offshore and they justified that by
claiming that that is necessary to remain competitive. The consequence
has been that these operators are outside UK regulation, which is one

prevalence survey, which last took place in 2010, has been abolished,

difficult path between our wish to promote an industry from which

addiction without leaving their homes, and hence to suffer alone while
running up debts that they cannot hope to pay. It is our duty as

so far to act to protect the consumer, we must insist on some
indication from them of what they are prepared to tolerate before they

for extra resources? What if it needs extra powers with which to tackle
the problems presented by the opening of our market to companies that
are currently excluded? The Minister must explain what benchmarks the

public that the company is a registered, licensed operator that is
overseen by the Gambling Commission. We need to see some evidence that
the Government have thought that through. Does the commission have
enough scope within its powers to take action to protect consumers?
What does it mean when it says that the provision of a kitemark will

power to request financial blocking? Will it be able to request an
internet service provider to block an IP address? We should be
expecting matters to move on considerably as a consequence of the Bill.

is surprising that the Bill contains no measures to ensure that spread
betting is licensed in the same way as other forms of betting. It
rightly requires all betting operators, wherever they are based, to
comply with Gambling Commission licence condition 15.1, which means
that betting operators will have to share irregular betting patterns
with the commission and with sports bodies. The licence condition will
then be integrated across the industry, with one notable exception.
Spread betting is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, but it
currently has no licence condition 15.1, although compliance with that
code is cited—rightly—as one of the main justifications
for the Bill. Just today I looked at the Sporting Index site. It offers
a range of sporting spread bets, including on shirt supremacy. The
specific example I looked at involved the Tonga versus Cook Islands
match in the rugby league world cup. For anyone who is unclear, I
should explain that shirt supremacy bets are about the difference
between the totals of the numbers on the shirts of the try scorers of
each team. Unlike traditional bets where people can win or lose a set
amount, spread betting allows potentially unlimited 
<?notus-xml column=134?>losses. If I place a bet on Tonga and it loses on shirt supremacy by 23
points, I will be liable for 23 times my stake
money.</hs_Para>

is seen as a financial transaction and commitment, rather than
straightforward betting, it was felt it was better regulated by the
FCA. However, there are requirements on those companies that are
licensed to report any suspicious betting activity they
identify—that is covered by licence code 15.1—and the
anomaly created by this current situation is that every online gambling
operator who wishes to advertise for custom within the UK will be
licensed by the Gambling Commission, except for spread betting
companies. The intention of this Bill is that everybody will be brought

previous attempts to regulate for a betting levy that includes online

I believe that all parties would like betting operators to pay a levy
on all bets, as the 1963 Act says they should. We now have a rare
legislative slot and we cannot afford not to get this Bill right. I am
talking about a policy that the Minister’s colleagues, the hon.
Members for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh) and for West Suffolk

to pass into law, and I hope she will listen to them. There is a
considerable legal view that the Bill will require levy payments
automatically, as it will bring betting operators back into the
regulatory environment and, de facto, within the scope of the 1963 Act.
There is much concern in the industry that this should not be left to
the courts to judge, as it inevitably will

interpret the primary purpose rule to require over-the-counter betting

are concerns about single manning in betting shops, it is unacceptable
that gambling organisations are seeking to remove the necessity to have

make it clear that my Select Committee supports the Bill’s
general provisions, as do I. The Committee has spent some time
examining gambling. We carried out post-legislative scrutiny in 2011-12
of the entire Gambling Act 2005. Although we examined online gaming,
which is obviously the most rapidly increasing form of gambling,
inevitably the main focus on the 2005 Act related to casinos, the
previous Government’s abortive attempt to introduce regional
casinos—super-casinos—in the UK and the provisions
relating to fixed odds betting terminals in betting shops. I do not
propose to explore the latter issue at great length today, although it

may recall that when that Gambling Bill became an Act, the then
Secretary of State declared that one of its purposes was to make the UK
the world centre for online gaming and that that would be of great
benefit to the UK economy. Unfortunately, the then Chancellor of the
Exchequer holed the then Secretary of State amidships by setting the
tax rate at a level that led to almost every operator moving offshore.
There is a single exception, which I am sure the hon. Member for
Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly), my friend from the Select
Committee, will mention: bet365 remains the last operator headquartered
in the UK. Almost all the others have moved to offshore jurisdictions

states.</hs_Para>

that existed at that time of operating a white list to recognise the
regulatory authorities of different jurisdictions appears, in the main,
to have worked reasonably well. The Government, in putting forward the
arguments for this Bill, have raised one or two concerns about how the
current regime works. In particular, they have said that there is some
confusion about the different regimes in different jurisdictions, 
<?notus-xml column=139?>and that consumers may sometimes be confused as to where responsibility
lies and where they should go with their complaints.</hs_Para>

undoubtedly some differences between the rules applied in different
jurisdictions. I agree with  the Remote Gambling Association
that, in general, the industry is reasonably well regulated in the
white list countries. As CARE—Christian Action Research and
Education—has pointed out, one or two jurisdictions,
particularly Gibraltar, operate slightly stronger regulatory conditions
than those in the UK. In particular, the Gibraltar rules governing the
reporting of suspicion that individuals might have a problem with their
gambling habits are slightly stronger. The UK Gambling Commission might
want to consider whether it can tighten its licensing conditions,
particularly on problem gambling, which is rightly a great concern to
everybody who considers gambling and the policies governing
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000071"><B><Member ContinuationText="Philip Davies" PimsId="4767" UID="13110567000520" xid="887" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000520">Philip

words on my notes, which read “Full Tilt”. He is, of
course, correct. Something went badly wrong with Full Tilt Poker, which
was regulated by the Alderney gambling control commission. It is right
that there should be a review into how that happened and I understand
that lessons will be learned. There have certainly been concerns about
some incidents in white list countries, and for that reason there might
be some advantages to consumer protection of bringing the entire remote
gambling industry under the licensing rules of the UK Gambling
Commission.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000075">The
hon. Member for Eltham (Clive Efford) spent some time on match fixing
and licence condition 15.1. He is quite right that the Select Committee
received evidence on that and there is no doubt that all the major
sporting bodies support the Bill, because they have expressed concern
that some of the other regulatory authorities outside the UK have not
always been particularly good at reporting suspicious activities.
Indeed, if we consider the statistics, we can see that there have been
far more reports of potential suspicious gaming activity from
UK-licensed operators than from offshore operators. If licence
condition 15.1 is applied to all those offering online gambling
facilities to UK customers, I hope that that will result in more
attention being given to the issue.</hs_Para>

me return to the issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley.
The Government have made it very clear that the purpose of the Bill is
to strengthen consumer protection and, of course, the Committee
accepted the evidence given to us by the Minister on that point. It is
important that that is its purpose, because if it had other purposes
the Government might, as has been pointed out, be vulnerable to legal
challenge. However, it seems entirely acceptable to argue that those
people who sell gambling services to UK consumers should be required to
pay UK tax. Although that might not be the purpose behind the Bill, if
the consequence is that they come within the tax net, that would
benefit the Exchequer and create a level playing field, which it is
important we should have.</hs_Para>

operators might even choose to return to the UK once the new licensing
regime comes in. I realise that the level at which the tax is set is
not an issue for my hon. Friend the Minister, but that is what will
determine whether they return. Many of the remote gambling operators in
Gibraltar and other jurisdictions have expressed concern that there is
a danger that the tax will be set too high, which will have an impact
on their operations and create an incentive for consumers to look
elsewhere—to go outside the licensed operators to the black
market. That is a serious threat, which I want to talk
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000081"><B><Member ContinuationText="Philip Davies" PimsId="4767" UID="13110567000526" xid="887" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000526">Philip
Davies:</Member></B> Is my hon. Friend aware that the Treasury has
already given some estimates of the amount of money it expects from
this measure? It believes that if the tax is imposed at a 15% rate, 20%

That will mean that a higher proportion of people will be playing on
unregulated
sites.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000082"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Whittingdale" PimsId="4590" UID="13110567000527" xid="629" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000527">Mr
Whittingdale:</Member></B> That is a matter for the Treasury, but I
agree with my hon. Friend that a 15% rate would have a damaging impact.
The Remote Gambling Association has suggested 5% as a reasonable level,
but the Treasury will obviously have to examine that and strike a
balance. The Treasury will need to bear in mind the risk not only that
its revenues might suffer if consumers were driven from the licensed
market to the black market but that consumers would suffer, as they
would 
<?notus-xml column=141?>have none of the protections that would result from the new licensing
requirements in the Bill. That seems to be at the heart of the issue,
so although it is important that we should debate all the provisions in
the Bill, the critical question will be determined not by the Minister

or two other concerns have been raised, particularly about the fact
that this is an enormous new responsibility for the UK Gambling
Commission, which will have to issue licences to a huge number of
operators based in all parts of the world. The Select Committee had
some concerns about the commission’s ability to do that and
about the resource implications. The Gibraltar betting and gaming
association has raised the concern that the change could result in
brass plating, with the Gambling Commission merely giving an operator a
tick because it does not have the resources to go to the other
jurisdictions to question the regulating authorities. The UK Gambling
Commission will have to rely on other regulators in a way not
dissimilar from its reliance on those on the white list, so if it is to
accept the regulatory approval of other regulators in different
countries it is important that it satisfies itself that those
regulators are doing a good job. That might require additional
resources, and we expressed some concerns about the degree of the extra
responsibilities that will be placed on the
commission.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000084">Let
me return to the question of the consequence of consumers being driven

they also do so for other reasons. They form friendships and it becomes
a social environment. None of that exists in online gambling; it is

remember that when witnesses from bet365 gave evidence to the Committee
they said that it was 
<?notus-xml column=142?>becoming increasingly difficult for them to remain in the UK, and unless
something was done soon, they might very reluctantly have to follow the
exodus. Happily, I hope the Bill will address that, but as I said
earlier, it all comes back to the rate of tax that is levied. We want a
rate of tax that is attractive to online operators, so that they
license themselves in the UK, and does not drive people into the black

other measures are also required, and one or two of those who have made
representations on the Bill have said that the Government must consider
taking other measures to prevent illegal gambling online. There are

certainly worth exploring. In the third, search engines have a role. I
expect that my hon. Friend the Minister will be aware of the vigorous
debates that have taken place with Google about the extent to which it
is willing to take responsibility to ensure that illegal websites, or
websites offering illegal products, do not appear at the top of their
search engine results. That too is an area where more work could be
done to make it harder for consumers to be tempted by illegal online

shall flag up one more issue. An anomaly was identified to the Select
Committee, about which we had considerable sympathy. Casinos are among
the safest places to gamble. They have strong measures in place to
prevent money laundering, to identify those at risk of problem gambling

experienced, well trained staff on the premises. For all those reasons,
a casino is one of the safer places to gamble—certainly
considerably safer than in a bedroom alone, where people are able to

Friend’s suggestion runs straight into the problem—the
anomaly that the Select Committee received evidence about—that
it still will not be possible for casinos to offer their own remote
gambling facilities within their buildings. I could go into a casino
and place a bet using my own iPad or iPhone or other online device, but
when the Bill is passed, the casino will not be able to offer that
facility through remote terminals, or by giving out their own devices.
That seems an extraordinary anomaly, so the Select Committee suggested
that the Bill should be 
<?notus-xml column=143?>amended to remove it, and to allow casinos to offer a remote gambling
facility as well. I was disappointed that the Government appeared not
to accept our argument, and I hope they will still think about that and

something dodgy—something associated with crime. It was illegal
to advertise it. Betting shops were behind closed doors and frosted
glass windows, and it was a

area where I am today making substantial changes is gambling duties. .
. The current duty regime for remote gambling introduced by the last
Government was levied on a ‘place of supply’ basis. This
allowed overseas operators largely to avoid it, and much of the
industry has, as a result, moved offshore. Ninety per cent. of online
gambling consumed by our citizens is now supplied from outside the UK,
and the remaining UK operations are under pressure to leave. This is
clearly not fair—and not a sensible way to support jobs in
Britain. So we intend to introduce a tax regime based on the place of
consumption—where the customer is based, not the
company—and, from this April, we will also introduce double
taxation relief for remote gambling. These changes will create a more
level playing field, and protect jobs here.”

problem is that the Chancellor made no reference in his Budget speech

Select Committee enjoyed hearing from the chief executive of the
Gambling Commission and from the permanent secretary, struggling to
think of any reasons why the current regime needed improving from a
player protection perspective. I was slightly embarrassed for them.
They were in a difficult position. They had come to argue the
indefensible—that the Bill was all about regulation. When they
were pressed to identify the issues that had caused all the problems
and require new legislation, we did not get anything from them. The
hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) made the point
about Full Tilt. If anybody can give an extensive list of all the

understanding—I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I

is what is needed to satisfy the

admit that it is all about taxation, the European Union would be all
over it like a rash and would rule that it is illegal because it
interferes with tax competition and will upset other parts of the EU.
That is why the Government have been desperately trying to pretend that
the Bill is all about regulation, even though we know that it is
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000120">I
am sure we all agree with what the Chancellor said in his Budget
statement—I certainly do—but I am not entirely sure that
it was particularly helpful to the Government more widely or to the
Minister in this instance. The Chancellor talked about protecting jobs
here, and I am sure that he had in mind the company that the hon.
Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme represents, bet365. It should be
commended not only for ensuring that it protects all the jobs in his
area, but for the commitment it gives to the area more generally,
because it sponsors the local football club and is involved in the
local community. We should all congratulate bet365 on what it has

as my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon made clear, bet365’s
representatives told the Select Committee in evidence that the company
would be under pressure to leave if the current situation continued for
much longer. Furthermore, they said that it was only really here
because it was a privately owned company. They conceded that it would
almost certainly have had to go offshore if it was a public limited
company. The fact that it is a private company is what has allowed it
to stay. Therefore, I do not necessary think that we should criticise
those that have gone offshore, because it was an inevitable consequence
of the tax system and it would be naive to think
otherwise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000122">I
would prefer to try to allow bet365 to stay here, which of course we
want, but it would be nice if our ambitions were a little grander. I
would like to see some of the companies that are already offshore
return to the UK, which is why the tax rate is so important. If we
introduce a 15% tax rate, there is no chance of any of those firms
returning. I encourage the Minister to encourage her Treasury
colleagues to indulge in some negotiations with the betting companies
to see what agreement can be reached, because I would much prefer us to
set a tax rate that enabled them to come back or to bring back some of
their operations. That would also mean an awful lot of jobs coming back
here. That would be a much more sensible way forward, rather than
seeing it as an immediate cash
cow.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000123"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Syms" PimsId="4197" UID="13110567000538" xid="578" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000538">Mr

want to touch on the levy, because a number of Members have suggested
that we should be compelling companies that are currently offshore to
pay it, just as onshore companies have to. I think that argument is a
bit of a red herring. There is a perfectly clear and respectable
argument for those offshore to pay the same as those onshore, including
the levy, but I do not think that it would make a fat lot of difference
to the money raised from the levy going from bookmakers to racing. 
<?notus-xml column=148?>I am delighted that an agreement has been reached between
racing and bookmakers, but in my view, and that of others, including
the hon. Member for Bradford South, who are better
qualified than me to decide whether what I am
saying is right, it seems that Ministers decide at the start how much
the gambling industry should contribute towards racing—perhaps
arriving at a figure of around £75 million—and then come
up with a mechanism on the levy to deliver that.</hs_Para>

companies are included in the levy, my suspicion is that exactly the
same thing will take place. The Minister will think that £75
million is about right and will then change the mechanism so that it
delivers that amount. Those people in racing who think that that is a
way to get an awful lot more money from the betting industry are simply
misguided, although I can see why they think it. It would not generate
any more money; it would just change the formula by which these things

calculated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000127"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Evans" PimsId="5718" UID="13110567000540" xid="1128" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000540">Chris

If the Gambling Commission wants to supply us with information

gambling takes place with people who are properly licensed and
registered. The Government seem to have got themselves into a bit of a
muddle. As I said in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Chairman of
the Select Committee, the Government have not made it clear what they
think is currently bet with illegal sites, but they have made a very
good stab at guessing what will be bet with illegal sites after this
Bill has come to fruition. The Treasury, which obviously has pound
signs in its eyes as it sees the Bill progressing through Parliament,
has already made its forecasts for the revenue it expects to get from
it. The assessment of remote gambling taxation in its 2012 Budget
policy costings suggests that if a place-of-consumption tax is imposed
at a 15% rate, about 20% of the UK market will be unlicensed,
unregulated and therefore not paying

Davies:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. As an
occasional punter myself, I can speak with some authority in saying
that I am very interested in which bookmaker is offering the best
odds—naturally; that is what punters do. In many respects,
online horse racing punters have never had it so good in terms of the
competitiveness of the odds and offers such as “best odds
guaranteed”, which means that if someone backs a horse at a
particular price and its starting price is bigger than the price they
backed it at, they will get the bigger price—a fantastic offer
for punters. All those offers will probably cease once this Bill comes
to fruition, when the cost base of bookmakers will go up. That will be
a bad thing for punters, who will lose out on the returns they get from
their gambling. That is an inevitable consequence of the Bill; it is no
good pretending that it is not, and we should be open and honest with
people about it. If they still think it is a good Bill anyway, that is
fair enough, but at least we should be honest about its implications.
There are no painless panaceas whereby everybody will get more money
out of it; somebody has to lose, and the loser is undoubtedly going to
be the punter.</hs_Para>

the competitive nature of the market and the fact that many punters
have become used to betting with concessions such as “best odds
guaranteed”, some online betting sites will obviously see an
advantage in going somewhere else—in being unregulated, not
applying for a licence, and hoping that the fact they are not
advertising on Sky TV, or wherever it might be, will be overcome by
their offering concessions that punters have come to love and that give
them much greater value. That is clearly what the Treasury has factored
into its predicted revenues. Because it has built its prediction on a
tax rate of 15%, it is crucial for everybody concerned that the tax
rate introduced when the Bill comes into being is not 15%, because the
lower the tax rate, the less the chance of people using unregulated
sites and of companies that are currently licensed and regulated
becoming unlicensed and unregulated. I support the Bill in principle,
but the key part of it is not this Minister’s responsibility but
the relevant Treasury Minister’s. I hope she will keep his feet
to the fire to make sure that what she intends is not undermined by the
Treasury.</hs_Para>

me. When the Select Committee took evidence on gambling during a visit
to Brussels, where we met European Union regulators and others 
in Europe, it was clear that levels of illegal gambling in countries
with much greater restrictions than ours were far higher. We can
predict what happens if the restrictions imposed are too onerous,
because we have seen it in other countries. People go on to illegal
sites. As my hon. Friend the Chairman of the Select Committee
explained, 
<?notus-xml column=151?>the efforts made to try to stop people doing that are not particularly
successful, as they can be got round. If the focus is on closing down
internet sites, they will immediately reopen elsewhere. If it is on
blocking credit card payments, people will use PayPal and other methods
to get round those restrictions too. It is a pointless exercise. People
who want to get round these restrictions will do so. Other countries
have proved that, because they have tried them all and they have all
spectacularly failed. Nothing will change in this regard, because the
Bill is not really about regulation but
taxation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000148">I

which, like all quangos and bureaucracies, likes nothing more than a
bit of empire building. I suspect that it has seen the Bill and
thought, “My goodness me, all our Christmases have come at
once!” Whereas before it has had to accept the licensing and
regulation from the white list countries, and accept the companies that
are considered to be good enough, it can now get its teeth into every
single one of them. It can go jetting around the world checking out
whether all these individual companies should be a given a licence.
Lord knows how many extra people it will need in order to satisfy
itself that those companies are fit and proper to advertise their wares
in the UK and get themselves an appropriate licence. This Bill is a
bureaucrat’s dream. I would be interested to hear what steps are
being taken to stop any empire building by the Gambling Commission,

what the great problem was with the white list. During our Select
Committee hearings, I was scrabbling around trying to think of examples
of problems. Only one sprang to mind, which was a notorious case where
the legendary gambler, Barney Curley, pulled off a huge coup one day
when he had four horses running at different meetings around the
country; I think that one was somebody else’s that he used to
train. The first three won and the last one, fortunately for the
bookmakers, lost, but with three out of four winners he still
reportedly ended up making a profit on his bets of some
£10 million. He was paid out by all the British
bookmakers, but the regulator in Gibraltar, I think, allowed the
bookmakers based there not to pay him out, which led to a huge dispute
over a long period. I think I am right in saying that the situation was

final point on which I want to concentrate relates to taxation and what
people may wrongly associate with this Bill. There is too much focus on
the big gambling companies, such as William Hill, Ladbrokes and Coral.
To be perfectly honest, I do not worry too much about the effect the
Bill will have on them. They are big, successful and innovative
companies and I am sure they have the wherewithal to cope with the
Bill’s taxation regime. I am sure it will create some pain for
them, but I do not have a problem with that. The reason why I support
the Bill is that there is an awful lot to be said for companies
offshore having to pay taxation in the same way as small, independent
betting shops in this country. I do not worry about those big
companies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000159">What
I am worried about—I hope the Minister will consider this
carefully—is the Bill’s likely impact on much smaller
internet companies in the gambling industry, such as innovative
start-up companies. If we look at the history of the gambling industry,
we see that it is often the smaller companies that have driven much of
the innovation and change that have been part of improving standards in
a number of areas. My concern about the Bill’s new licensing
system and the Treasury’s proposed taxation rates is that those
companies will be priced out of the market before they can even reach a
scale that would allow them to flourish. In effect, they will be
strangled at birth and that would wipe out lots of innovation in the
gambling
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000160">That
could easily be avoided, without altering the principles behind the
Bill, through the introduction of thresholds or a tiered taxation
system when the tax rates are announced. Both those alternatives would
mirror the current income tax system, which has tiered rates depending
on the size of a person’s income, a tax-exempt threshold at the
lower end and graded percentage rates. The Government should look
closely at introducing a tax regime that does not involve a simple,
across-the-board 15% rate, but that takes into consideration the size
of the companies concerned, their ability to pay and innovate, and the
investment needed for that innovation, because lots of jobs—an
underestimated number—are dependent on these small technology
companies in the UK.</hs_Para>

whether the Minister will be receptive to redrafting the Bill in order
to make clear the extent to which software providers need to go down
their supply chain to require suppliers to apply for a Gambling
Commission licence. Italy, Denmark and France do not need software
suppliers to be licensed. My understanding is that only Spain does, and

that basis I support the Bill, but only if the Government set the
taxation at a sensible and affordable rate. Before we get to Third
Reading, I hope the Treasury will indicate the likely taxation rates
and whether it will consider tiered rates or a much lower rate. If the

broadly welcome the Bill. As my Select Committee colleague has said at
length, it is clearly at the regulatory end of the welcome moves
towards a major reform of the taxation system—to a
point-of-consumption basis—so that companies pay tax on profits
made from bets placed in the UK. The Bill is not about the appropriate
level of that taxation. It focuses on other crucial aspects of the
regime, namely, as it says on the tin, licensing and advertising of
gambling. It is a crucial part of reforms to an industry that has
hugely relocated, not only online, but offshore, principally to
Gibraltar for most UK operators, and largely for tax reasons. I use the

gambling, both on and offline, is treated differently from general

this Parliament. The experience of the UK since the passing of the

of a DCMS consultation that started in 2009, before the last election,
which recommended the current course. The Select Committee endorsed
that approach in the report that we issued in July 2012. This April,
the Committee published another report welcoming unanimously and on a
cross-party basis—although perhaps for different
reasons—the main thrust of the draft Bill following extensive
pre-legislative scrutiny. In January, the House staged a precursor to
this debate on the private Member’s Bill promoted by the hon.

re-emphasising the extent of the flight of most online gambling

Festival Park was the site of Britain’s second national garden
festival. The first was in Liverpool and the successive ones were in
Glasgow, Gateshead and Ebbw Vale. They were a sort of biennial
Olympics, or biennale as Boris would describe them, for
Britain’s most deprived areas during the pain of the Thatcher

is a world-beating break from that legacy. It is one of the most
phenomenal success stories in British business in the new millennium,
having been started in 2000. With more than 2,000 highly skilled staff,
it is now the largest private sector employer in north Staffordshire.
It has led the local regeneration without a hand up or a handout from
Government. In the last year, in a highly competitive industry, it has
increased its pre-tax profits from online gaming by more than 50% to
about £180 million. It has done that in just 13
years. As I have said before, £20 billion was wagered with
bet365 in 2012-13, which is a 57% rise. That has happened because it is

its online competitors in the UK, bet365 paid £31 million in
corporation tax to the Exchequer last year. With betting duties and
VAT, over the years it has paid hundreds of millions of pounds more. It
also pumps a fortune into the local premiership football team, Stoke

here and not offshore. If it is so successful while paying taxation,

sympathise with some of the arguments that have been made by
bet365’s competitors and by the RGA during the gestation of the
Bill, which we have heard about today from the hon. Member for Shipley.

Committee and in the subsequent stages of the Bill’s passage, we
must have the best possible scrutiny to get the legislation right. The
success of the regime will depend on British consumers choosing to
gamble with licensees who have chosen to go with the Gambling
Commission. There will have to be effective enforcement to deter
non-licensed companies from muddying the waters with a grey or black
market. There are outstanding licensing issues on which the industry is
being consulted. We must remember that this is an international
industry in which operators hold licences overseas in reputable
jurisdictions. As the RGA says, it is in everyone’s interests
that the regulators work
together.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000184">As
we have heard, it is crucial that we get the level of taxation right.
It is also important to get the definition of what is to be taxed
right. I hope that the Treasury is listening to the arguments from the
industry for a gross profits tax, rather than a wider gross gaming
revenue definition, which rather moves the goalposts from what the
operators were
expecting.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000185">In
listening to the industry, we must recognise that other jurisdictions,
notably in Europe, have successfully introduced similar licensing
systems and taxation on a point-of-consumption basis. That is reaping
revenue for their Exchequers. One of the most recent countries to do so
was Denmark. The duty there is 20%, which is higher than the 15% gross
profits tax in this country. None of the major operators—all
responsible members of the RGA—have seriously suggested to the
Select Committee or to anyone else that they would not apply for a
licence under the new regime established by the Bill, but instead join
an unlicensed or grey market. They have not done so in Denmark,
Germany, Greece or Spain. Frankly, the UK is too important a market and
their reputations are too important for them to do so here. I repeat:
if bet365 can be so successful and supportive of these changes, that
also shows what the competition is capable of doing.</hs_Para>

once we implement this new system—by the close of 2014, I hope,
and following parallel moves by other European countries—UK
operators, including bet365, will not only have a greater degree of
certainty for their future investment and growth, but in co-operating
with, rather than resisting, the new British system, all 
<?notus-xml column=157?>those who claim to be a reputable UK company will be better placed to
argue, particularly at European level, for fairer access to other major
markets such as France and Italy, and to ask the UK Government to help

although I am a little disappointed that it is so narrowly drawn as I
think that major issues need considering. Gambling is very much part of
modern life in Britain. We all cheered the Olympians in 2012, and a lot
of that success was built on the national lottery. One needs only to
look at the various books produced at Budget time to see how much the
industry generates in taxation to pay for the things we want in this

that many people come to visit. We need only look at casinos in London
to see that a high percentage of people in them are visitors to this
country who have come to take advantage of the facilities and what we
have to offer. Progress was clearly made in the Gambling Act 2005, but
given the way the internet is developing, it is difficult without a
crystal ball to work out what the future will bring. It is clear that
we have lost a large slice of the industry to abroad because of the tax
system, and it is therefore perfectly sensible for the Government to

bigger

Gambling Commission because it might then load higher fees on to
domestically based businesses. Many of those businesses found that the
size of the commission compared with the old gambling board, and the
number of people it employs, has put their fees up substantially over
several years. Many issues must be considered and this Bill is part of
the solution. I suspect that the other part of the solution, as we

important issues have been raised, include how we tempt offshore
companies to come back. Do we tempt them back by setting a competitive
rate? My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) made a
strong argument for that, but there are a number of competing concerns.
The domestic industry is clearly upset that people offshore can set
better odds and therefore take customers, but we must also consider the
rate we set, as that could ensure many more illegal sites in the UK,

have a responsible domestically based industry that, as I said,
generates a lot of tax. It has codes and practices that it sticks to,
and it is part of our offer as a country. It also expects a degree of
fairness. When we talk about a level playing field, we must take into
account the millions of pounds of investment, the thousands of people
who are employed, and the tax they generate. The rate we set for remote
gambling operations will be important, but the Gambling Commission and
Treasury must also consider whether 
<?notus-xml column=158?>sufficient assets are deposited in the UK, or whether any entity subject
to action by UK regulators or the authorities has assets in the UK that
can be picked up. They must also consider whether people from remote

ought to be sanctions against individuals or businesses that provide
facilities for offshore remote gambling companies. That is a difficult
area and an absolute minefield, and there are tricky issues for the
Government to consider, which means setting out a balance. In reality,
however, because we are not getting tax from the remote industry, the
UK has probably lost £1 billion or £2 billion in revenue

other issues have been raised, including why we have to wait until
December 2014 before we bring in a new rate. By some estimates, the UK

also important. Someone can gamble remotely on an iPad in the street,
but when they go into a casino, which is safe, regulated, taxed, and
where people have a duty to look after their general welfare, they are

other aspects of the whole industry need considering and modernising.
When the hon. Gentleman spoke earlier he mentioned the <I>Daily Mail

talking about the gambling and casino industries and all those other
industries. In reality, however, if the Government cannot amend the

interested in comments by the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme
about how bet365 had provided regeneration for Stoke. We should not
underestimate the fact that the gambling industry is a factor in
regeneration. It certainly was in Atlantic City, and one needs only to
look at what is happening in the United States to see that many local
governments and other 
<?notus-xml column=159?>areas have deliberately attracted and promoted that industry because it
can help local areas. A Government who want certain areas of our
country to prosper and regenerate could do a lot worse than looking at
the gambling industry as a potential source of regeneration for some
areas that are struggling in the modern world. I broadly support the
Bill. I am a little disappointed with its scope because there is
unfinished business in  the broader gambling industry, but I
look forward to the passage of the Bill. I hope that the

streets. Betting shops are tarred with the same brush as the pawnbroker
and the money shop. Rather than bash the betting industry, it is time
to talk about our betting firms as a great British success story. The
industry contributes £3.2 billion to UK gross domestic product
each year and provides £1 billion in taxes. Betting shops
directly employ 55,000 full and part-time jobs, which is the equivalent
of 10% of the entire leisure industry. The work force are mainly women,
some of whom have re-entered the workplace after having children, or

which sadly we have seen names such as Woolworths and HMV disappear
from the high street, the gambling industry has been at the forefront
of innovation and technology. I want to focus my remarks on that. When
I left the industry over 12 years ago, online gambling was in its
infancy. If people walked into a shop at that time, they would think
the industry was in decline. The punters were mainly either coming up
to retirement or retiring. The only thing in the shops that kept them
going was the amusement prizes machines, the forerunners of fixed odds
betting
terminals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000203">In
reality, the trade was changing. It is important to realise that the
industry has been forced to be innovative and adaptable. More than a
quarter of William Hill online customers place bets on their mobile,
smartphone or iPad. The industry is continually changing. People who
bet online would probably not have taken a trip to their local bookie
to bet on a horse. If anybody turns on the television tonight to watch
the football, the last things they will see before kick-off are adverts
for odds on the first goal scorers. The people watching the adverts are
not going to run off to their local bookies to put  £5
on a match result. They will instead get out their smartphone or iPad
and bet from the comfort of their living
room.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000204">Frankly,
bookies have to be innovative. They must keep up in an ever-changing
industry, and have found ways to reach customers who previously would
not have looked at them at all. When we talk about businesses in this

the detail of the Bill, I do not think any hon. Member will disagree
that the priority must be to protect the consumer. We need to ensure
that we do not see sites operating illegally and offering bets to UK
consumers. We need an assurance from the Government that the Gambling
Commission has the appropriate powers to deal with illegal operators.
As somebody who has worked in the industry, I know that the one thing
we do not want in the betting trade are black market operators. I am
sure the hon. Member for Shipley agrees that when we worked in the
betting trade we were constantly competing with illegal betting
operators, whether they operated out of the pub, the side street or
their houses. We—the people who played by the rules and paid
their taxes, and who had betting licences—were constantly
undercut. I fear that the same thing could happen as a result of the
Bill.</hs_Para>

ensure that strong licensing conditions are in place but, at the same
time, we must ensure that licensing conditions are imposed in a timely,
effective and fair way. Black market operators should be run out of
business as quickly as possible. I know that the Government have
already rejected the idea of internet protocol address blocking and
financial transaction blocking, but if we are serious about ensuring
proper enforcement, we need to look at that again. I have some sympathy

brand loyalty. As I said in an intervention on the hon. Member
for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale), the Chairman of the
Committee, online gamblers are far more promiscuous. They will shop
around for the best price. They will not worry. There are two sets of
customers: the customer who wants to bet heavily online and shop around
for the best price, and the customer who has been going to his local
shop for years. The latter likes the atmosphere of the bell ringing
before the dogs go off. He likes running up to the counter quickly to
place his bet. That is what he lives for. He also likes the
staff—he likes sitting down for a cup of tea with them. He will

Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) mentioned the growth of bet365
over 13 years, which was down to the innovation it has shown online.
However, if that tax is too high, I believe we will open a new market
for, as I have said, unlicensed, illegal operators, which will not
comply with the new regime and which can offer better odds than
licensed operators such as Ladbrokes, William Hill, Betfred and

of business would move to the illegal market. I would hate to see how
many people would go to the illegal market if we set the rate too high
at, for example, 15%. I mentioned Woolworths and HMV going out of

undertake. We need to be extremely careful that we do not stifle a
forward-thinking and forward-moving industry. The fact is that gambling
is a growth industry. I do not want the Bill to do anything to change
that. Ultimately, I believe we can learn something from the sector. It

arrived in Southend more than 10 years ago, there was a beautiful but
derelict 19th-century hotel, the Palace hotel. The Government used it
to house asylum seekers on a temporary basis, before they could be
found more suitable accommodation. That made the area, to a degree, a
no-go zone. It is now a four-star hotel, and the company will be

advertise in the UK. The fact that companies not subject to proper

gambling is a desperately destructive social phenomenon that brings
real suffering and economic cost. According to the Gambling Commission,
450,000 people in the UK suffer from problem gambling, the effects of
which should not be underestimated: it can take families to breaking
point and beyond and sometimes lead to suicide. As a modern society, it
is incumbent on us to ensure that the regulatory framework for gambling
provides the greatest possible protections for vulnerable and problem
gamblers, and it is certainly wrong that hitherto we have adopted such
a laid-back attitude to gambling websites that we deem not to be

scrutinising the Bill, however, some questions arise. All online
gambling providers seeking to access the UK market will be required to
get a licence from the Gambling 
<?notus-xml column=165?>Commission before they can advertise their services, but there is no
clarity on enforcement, and the claim that the Bill protects the
vulnerable will completely disintegrate if companies without a licence
are not prevented from accessing the UK market. If licensing is not
backed up with an enforcement mechanism, the Bill will simply result in
an increase in online gambling advertising. Some online providers that
currently have access to the UK market but which cannot advertise here
would be able to advertise, while those that cannot advertise would be
able to access the UK market on the same basis as today. That is not
the right step forward.</hs_Para>

Bill gives the Secretary of State regulation-making powers, which could
be used for enforcement purposes, but if we are serious, as I believe
the Government are, about creating a progressive legislative framework
that shows proper regard to the vulnerable, why not put enforcement
mechanisms in the Bill to make it clear from day one that if an online
gambling provider from outside the UK market wishes to access that
market, it must have a licence? It would be perfectly possible to make
that plain by amending the Bill to prevent such companies from
accessing the UK by using financial transaction blocking measures,
which have proved successful in other countries that have gone down the
same road. I seek an assurance from the Minister, therefore, that the
licensing regime will be backed up with a clear enforcement mechanism
that makes it absolutely clear, in the Bill, that if a company outside
a white-listed jurisdiction does not have a licence, it will be
prevented from accessing the UK market by a financial transaction
blocking measure or similar mechanism. I look forward to her

do not end there. Our current regulatory framework incentivises online

gambling providers have left the UK for nearby white-listed
jurisdictions, such as Alderney and Gibraltar, which are subject to a
different regulatory regime and one that has often exhibited greater
regard for problem gamblers than the UK regulatory framework. My
concern, therefore, is that if we remove the incentive for gambling
providers to locate outside the UK, problem gamblers in the UK will
find many key providers less responsive to their needs—unless,
while removing the incentive, we also make our regulatory framework for
problem gamblers at least as robust as the best white-listed
jurisdictions.</hs_Para>

might be tempted to say that licensing is a matter for the Gambling
Commission, and of course it is, but it is also a matter for the House,
which created the commission when the current legal regime was
introduced. We cannot, therefore, pretend that a significant change in
that regime does not require us, the legislature, to review the
capacity of the commission to deal with the new challenges emanating
from the Bill. I would like a strong assurance that she will review the
regulatory regimes of white-listed jurisdictions—the regimes
from which British consumers of many online gambling services have
benefited in recent years—and the regard they show for problem
gamblers and the vulnerable, and ensure that when the Bill takes effect
our regulatory regime will be made as sensitive to the needs of problem
gamblers as the regulatory regimes of the very best 
<?notus-xml column=166?>white-listed jurisdictions. If we do not do that, the unintended
consequence of the Bill will be that British customers accessing the
many providers currently based in white-listed jurisdictions might
actually enjoy fewer protections than they do
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000233">Finally,
even if the Bill is accompanied by proper enforcement mechanisms
preventing providers from beyond the white list accessing the UK
market, and even if we ensure that the return of online gambling
providers to the UK does not erode protections by enhancing our
regulatory regime with respect to care for problem gamblers, the Bill
will still result in an increase in advertising for online gambling in
the UK. Although online gambling is not associated with the highest
problem gambling prevalence figures, it does have one of the higher
figures for problem gambling. Unlike other gambling opportunities, it
is available 24/7; one can access hundreds, if not thousands, of
gambling websites without leaving one’s house or
bedroom.</hs_Para>

constituency office are often confronted by people with addictions, be
it drink, drugs or gambling, and I am aware of the illusion of the
gambler when they make the gamble, their depression when it is not
successful and their guilt when they realise they have spent money they
could not afford to spend. We cannot ignore the vulnerable or problem
gamblers. As online gambling providers not on the white list access
advertising opportunities for the first time, the Bill will make people
in the United Kingdom, including problem gamblers, more aware of
opportunities to gamble online. If the House is to vote for measures
designed to result in an increase in online gambling in the UK, which
is effectively what the advertising provisions propose, we should
complement it with enhanced assistance for problem gamblers, who will
face additional advertising challenges as a result of the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000235">One
mechanism developed to help problem gamblers is self-exclusion, which
empowers a problem gambler on “a strong day”—even
on their strongest days, some of those I have met are still not
strong—to exclude themselves from the services of a gambling
provider for a fixed period. Although in principle this is a good
thing, in the context of online gambling it is useless: there are so
many online gambling providers—hundreds if not
thousands—that it would be impossible to self-exclude from them
all. One answer to that dilemma has been proposed by academics,
including Dr Sally Gainsbury, author of “Internet Gambling:
Current Research Findings and Implications”, published in 2012,
in which she states that “a significant limitation” of
self
exclusion</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13110567000455" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000455">“is

the Minister indicate how we can address that issue? Again, she might
say it is a matter for the Gambling Commission, but again I would say:
yes, but it is also a matter for the House, which created the
commission and established the legislative framework that the Bill
significantly amends. I believe that it would be appropriate for us to
put in place a system that provides problem gamblers with a credible,
meaningful, one-stop-shop self-exclusion mechanism. I should like to

if the concerns that I have outlined are not addressed, the effect of
the Bill will simply be to allow some people who cannot currently

protection afforded to problem gamblers on the many sites accessed by
the UK market. We must seize the day and ensure that those things do
not happen. We must ensure that providers from beyond the white list
who do not have a Gambling Commission licence are prevented from
accessing the UK market, and that the UK licensing regime is made at
least as robust as those in the best white list jurisdictions, so that
problem gamblers and vulnerable people can be protected in the context

a result of the Bill, remote gambling will be regulated at the point of

2005, removing the offence of advertising foreign gambling and
consequently the distinction between white-list and EEA countries and

the Chairman of the Select Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for
Maldon (Mr Whittingdale), pointed out, the Committee carried out
pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill. It is perhaps not surprising that
its provisions have not been well received by either the remote
gambling operators or the overseas regulators. The Remote Gambling
Association has questioned whether 
<?notus-xml column=168?>the legislation might fall foul of European Union law by creating a
restriction on trade between EU states, but the Department’s
response has been fairly robust, arguing that the Bill is necessary and
proportionate for enhancing consumer protection for British citizens.

question of compatibility, and we accepted their confidence that any
legal action would be
unsuccessful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000244">The
Remote Gambling Association has argued that the change in legislation
will send punters to unregulated sites on the black market where there
is no regulatory regime. That view has been backed up by the Gibraltar
Betting and Gaming Association, which has claimed that online gaming
customers will migrate to unregulated and non-compliant operators who
have a significant market advantage over the regulated and compliant
operators, resulting in completely the opposite of what the Government
are trying to achieve. That point was raised by the hon. Member for
Shipley (Philip Davies).</hs_Para>

believe that that will be the case, however. Jenny Williams, the chief
executive of the Gambling Commission, has made it clear that there will
be little scope for significant expansion of the black market when
there are already few restrictions on the type of gambling available

are not, but that would certainly be a welcome
consequence—unintended or otherwise—of the Bill. Critics
of the offshore remote gambling industry, and supporters of the Bill,
legitimately point out that in many cases operators ended up as
offshore remote gambling sites to avoid paying tax in the first place.
The RGA told our Committee that about 7,000 people were working in the
UK for remote gambling companies based offshore, but it could not
answer my direct question about how many are working offshore. It
effectively admitted, however, that it was only a fraction of that
number. Let us be honest: these companies are effectively UK-based,
barring certain technicalities, and they are based abroad only to avoid

the all-party group on racing and bloodstock, and the Cheltenham race

from bookmakers and from sponsorships that also come from bookmakers.
Another non-declarable interest is that through the all-party group, I
organise charity dinners in this place, which are heavily supported by
bookmaking companies. The last one took place just a few months ago,
and we raised £48,000 for charity. Over the last five
years—not entirely under my joint chairmanship, as my
predecessors should be included— we have raised
£234,000 for charities, and it has come largely from bookmakers.

pressures on betting shops and bookmakers have increased. As was
mentioned earlier, the amount of money that certain individual shops
make is very small, and the number of independent bookmakers has been
reduced. Creating a level playing field should not mean heaping more
tax on bookmakers. We should view the

field, but the level could be a great deal lower than it is at

imposing a 15% tax on bookmakers who are based offshore, should we not
try to attract them back onshore by reducing the overall burden of
taxation, not just for those based abroad but for those in this
country? It would be rather perverse to impose a 5% tax on those based
in Gibraltar, for example, and a 15% tax on those based here. The

has conducted inquiries into gambling, horse racing and betting. I was
grateful for his comments on licence condition 15.1 and the issues

in opposition. He is extremely well-informed and passionate about these
issues, and I commend his commitment to education and treatment for
people with gambling problems. He talked about the problems created by
some aspects of the 2005 Act which were dealt with in the wash-up, and
rightly said they need to be addressed. He also raised the issue of the
definition of spread betting, and I hope the Minister takes that on

points eloquently. He described himself as modest and of course, that

expressed his concerns about taxation levels and his desire that online
operators locate back in the UK. I was struck by his passionate appeal
for recognition of the contribution that small companies
make—particularly in innovation and the number of people they
employ in this country—and the effect that overtaxing them will
have, particularly when they are developing in their early stages of
trading. That is an important point and the Government should take it
on board. He also showed a healthy scepticism for civil servants who
are empire building, which we all share. It is not fair to accuse the
Gambling Commission of that in this case, given that there is such

pointed out that it has made a significant contribution to regeneration
in his area, employing more than 2,000 people. It is the
largest employer in north Staffordshire, and I believe he said that it
achieved a profit of £180 million. He also called for
sanctions to deal with those providing facilities for those who are
avoiding the licensing system. Effective enforcement is something we

Members did, about people criticising the proliferation of betting
shops. I wish to put on the record that I have never criticised such
proliferation. There are not more betting shops following the 2005 Act,
but there is concern about the locating of betting

The suggested change in the Government’s position that has been
mooted would undermine existing regulatory controls on gaming machine
provisions. It would also allow casinos to offer an unlimited number of
gaming machines with unlimited stakes and prizes within their premises.
The Government see no reason why such machines should be offered on an
unlimited basis in casinos, when all other categories of gaming machine
remain subject to control. That would risk fundamentally changing the
character of casinos and, very sadly, turning them 
<?notus-xml column=175?>into something that looks like a machine shed. There may be a case to
consider greater flexibility in casino regulation, as I mentioned in my

relatively low rates of problem gambling, there are obviously very high
participation rates for gambling, at around 73%. The Gambling
Commission 2010 prevalence survey showed that fewer than 1% of the
adult population are problem gamblers, but the Government acknowledge
that while only a very small fraction of gamblers develop problems,
that can of course result in significant problems, not just for those
people but for those close to them. That is why protecting children and
vulnerable adults from harm is a key component of our remote gambling
policy. The Bill would require operators to have effective policies and
procedures in place in relation to socially responsible gambling, and
to contribute to research, education and treatment in relation to
problem gambling, as part of complying with the Gambling Commission

that the Gambling Commission will take action and has capacity to stop
illegal betting effectively, and secondly, that the tax rate is not set
too high. On the first issue, the commission will fully implement its
regulatory responsibilities in line with the requirements of the Bill,
and I will continue to discuss with the commission its needs to ensure
that it has the necessary capacity, resources and expertise. On the

the Government that we develop a much better understanding of the
impact of these machines, and further work is already under way. The

will turn to the pressures that hard-working families are facing as we
come out of a very difficult economic time for our country. The fact is
that most people do not particularly care about politics. They vote us
in every few years and decide the Government of the day, but they do
not consider politics on a daily basis; they consider how they are
going to keep the wolf from the door. They consider how they are going
to get through the day, provide for themselves, their families and
loved ones, raise their children, manage to pay their bills and get a
better paid job. The Government have been very effective in ensuring
that there is more employment and a return to economic growth, from
rescue to recovery and onward to greater economic strength for our
country.</hs_Para>

keeping the wolf from the door is dealing with the utility bills that
cost all our constituents so much money. That is why water reform
matters. People do not really have a choice, because there is not much
competition. It is a natural monopoly and people have to pay their
water bills. There is an opportunity to foster more competition and
ensure that the industry is more effectively regulated than it has
been. For many years nothing was done to keep on top of the water
industry, particularly before this Government were elected. Now we have
an opportunity to make further changes and look more closely at what
the issues are and what might be done.</hs_Para>

Government were elected, there was a settlement with Ofwat and the
water industry that was to last for five years. The assumptions on
which the settlement was made have since altered. Retail prices index
inflation has risen more quickly than it was expected that construction
inflation would rise, and interest rates have been lower than expected.
The result has been excess profits for the industry. Ofwat figures
highlight a return on regulated equity in excess of 20% in some cases.
Investment was allowed to fall in real terms after 2007, while customer
bills have risen by 
<?notus-xml column=179?>more than inflation. Dividend payments are often greater than the
profits made, which some would say is particularly
unattractive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000315" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000315"><Member ContinuationText="Rehman Chishti" PimsId="5607" UID="13110567000590" xid="1077" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0002.htm#13110567000590"><B>Rehman

Indeed, the last major reservoir in the south-east—the Queen

leaking out of the water companies’ pipes. According to my

proudly proclaim that they are dealing with the leaks. They have got
the figure down to the apparently minuscule 2,910 million litres per
day. Once they had to admit they were getting it wrong, we could see
that it was a farcical record. Frankly, they simply deserve—I do

recent period water companies have increased charges; under the Labour
Government charges went down at first then gradually crept up again.
One thing that has not gone down, of course, is the huge dividends that
the water companies have been paying. Since privatisation, they have
paid out £37 billion in dividends. As the hon. Member for Dover

£6.2 billion in dividends; Thames Water has paid out £6.3

are, but let us consider Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, for

capital allowances. If our water company were not exercising its rights
under capital allowances, either investment would fall or our bills
would rise, or both. There is sometimes a lack of basic economic
understanding: tax deferred is not tax not paid; it has to be paid. In
one respect, however, I entirely agree, and I am deeply uncomfortable
with some practices in aspects of corporate Britain. Work needs to be
done—and in fairness to the Government much has been
done—to close
loopholes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110567000390" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110567000390">We

by Chinese companies and sovereign wealth funds and investors from all
parts of the world investing in our regulated

industry and one that we need to encourage. We need more investment if
we are to deal with some of the Victorian—at least
Edwardian—infrastructure we are trying to replace. Under a
nationalised industry, directors of water boards would sit outside the
Treasury saying, “Please can we have some more money for
investment?” Down the ages, Chancellors have said,
“Certainly. Just get in the queue behind the NHS, pensioners and
the welfare state, and if there are any scraps left, we will give them

households an average of £1 a day, although I accept that there
are wide discrepancies in price. As a percentage of our household
expenditure, that might be quite small compared with energy costs and
other items, but it is still a significant amount, and those in the
lowest income decile in this country are, broadly speaking, in water

are right to deal with the connection to private sewers, where many
leakages have occurred. They, and the water companies, are also taking
action in other areas to ensure that they are playing their part. 
<?notus-xml column=189?>Sometimes just a small investment can make a big difference to the flood
risk in an entire street, for example. It is vital to ensure that the

Bill will play a key part in addressing the challenges. The question of
building new infrastructure and new reservoirs was raised earlier. The
key reform to ensure that that happens, to secure the long-term
sustainability of the industry and long-term benefits for our

industry and provide new competition. The competition that will exist
in the non-household sector must, in time, be introduced in the
household sector as well, and I hope that that will be the long-term
ambition in a forward-thinking political agenda. That would result in
the kind of benefits for households that businesses will soon be able
to achieve by switching supplier. The Bill should be seen only as work

document, but it set out some important provisions. It demonstrated
that the Government were getting a grip on water policy. In the past,
water policy had been created by all kinds of different organisations
and bodies, not least the water companies themselves. In the White
Paper, we demonstrated our determination that the Government should own
the policy and that the regulators should regulate. We stated that, in
a regulated sector, if the water companies functioned within meaningful
regulation by the three regulators, we would have an industry of which
we could be proud. The water White Paper was welcomed by
customers’ groups, the industry, investors, green NGOs and all
parts of the House, although I do not know whether that makes it a

to delivering the ambitions of the water White

impossible to bring that forward as part of the Water Bill because
there are tens of thousands of abstraction licences, on which many of
our constituents and the businesses that employ them depend for their
water supply. Trying to create a new abstraction regime from the one
created back in the 1960s is a Herculean task that will require
thoughtful legislation to make sure that the taps still flow and that
we do not suck dry aquifers like the Kennet, which provides a very
important water supply to the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member
for South Swindon (Mr Buckland). That, however, has been the
cheapest place from which to suck water, and it is only through the
construction of good infrastructure and investment that we can do this
in a sustainable way that keeps bills down, keeps water flowing and
supports our economy. Further legislation, then, is needed.</hs_Para>

further point about investment before I reach my final point. If we
want to see continued investment from pension funds—whether they
be British or from overseas—sovereign wealth funds and other
investors, we need to recognise that this is a relatively fragile and
competitive market. I shall give the House an anecdote about the
frequent visits I made to speak to the investor community to make sure
that it saw that our ambitions in the water White Paper and the Water

investment.</hs_Para>

ago, there was a hiatus concerning a rather technical issue that might
well have gone over the heads of most people in this country. It
related to the licence modifications that Ofwat wanted to create. This
brought me in touch with a new breed in my life—City analysts,
many of whom, in the words of my children, were “wusses”.
They took an instant view that the regulated sector was not the place
in which to invest, so the water sector saw quite a high risk of
much-needed investment being reduced. It took a Herculean
effort—by me at the bottom echelons of the Government, right up
to the higher levels—to make sure, first, that what Ofwat was
trying to achieve was understood. In my opinion, it might have had a
virtuous reason for what it did, but perhaps went about it in the wrong
way. It reminded me that if we want to see continued levels of
investment, we have to make sure that we explain what we are doing.
Ultimately, the need to deal with infrastructure problems needs to feed
through to bills, and we need to explain that we want to see a vibrant
regulated sector in this

about his argument is that it treats one part of household expenditure,
albeit an important part, as the sole issue of the moment. Rather than
doing that, the Government must view water bills and energy costs in
the context of overall household expenditure. They must keep bearing
down on council tax, and preferably freeze it. They must continue to
protect the most vulnerable by providing winter fuel payments, and to
ensure that more of our constituents on low incomes do not pay any tax.

bills are, of course, important. It is vital for us not only to
understand but to reflect the concerns of our constituents, and to take
advantage of every opportunity to protect those on low incomes. We can,
for instance, provide social tariffs. We can also work on the problem
of bad debt, which, as we know, adds an average of £15 to every
household’s bills—although when that is broken down by
company, it is clear that some companies are outperforming others
dramatically, and that their bad debt is a fraction of the average.
Some are doing magnificently, and others appallingly badly. We must
learn from best practice. We must ensure that companies deal with bad
debt, but we must also ensure that we address their relationships with
their customers in general. We must bear in mind the win-wins that can
help those who are having trouble paying their bills to deal with the

follow my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon), who
spoke with passion and real understanding about what is a complex
issue. The water industry was privatised nearly a quarter of a century
ago now, and it is reaching a crossroads. While I agree with my hon.
Friend about the levels of investment that privatisation has
delivered—which is well in excess of £100 billion in the
last 25 years—we are reaching a stage where we now need to look
for different solutions. My hon. Friend touched on a number of them in
his remarks, and I was very impressed by his description of City
analysts and their attitude to the regulated sector, and the challenge
of gearing. As he said, the high level of gearing is causing
inflexibility. That is leading to unimaginative solutions to the

United Kingdom, not always all at the same time, not always in the same
quantities, but this island is not cursed with a shortage of rain for
most of the time, and we collect very little of it. It is also not true
to say that water is some precious resource that has to be husbanded
because it will run out. Water is the ultimate renewable resource. It
falls as rain; it mainly runs out to the sea; it is picked up by the
winds and goes back into the clouds; and it comes back again as rain.
Nature or God, depending on one’s beliefs, does most of the job
for us, producing an endless supply of water to this country. All that
we have to do is provide business people who can raise the capital to
make sure that we capture enough of that water in a form that we can
then put into pipes, and that we clean it up to an appropriate standard
for the
use.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000007">We
did not introduce competition into the industry when we privatised it,
so many of the evils of monopoly are still with us. We have less
rationing, but we can still have rationing. We have quite dear prices,
although perhaps they do not go up quite as quickly as they did when
they were part of a Treasury exercise. We certainly get more capital
into the industry, but at the expense of quite substantial gearing, as
some hon. Gentlemen have mentioned. However, many of the bad features
of the nationalised industry are perpetuated and it is very difficult
being a challenger to the industry, so I pay tribute to the former
Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon), who
produced a White Paper which is becoming a piece of legislation, which

to the modest steps taken in Scotland, where it was discovered that far
from the taps running dry or the water prices going through the roof if
the authorities dared to have more than one provider of business water,
the opposite has happened: the prices went down—a little bit,
because there was not a great deal of competition coming in—and
above all the quality of service rose. I have talked to some of the
Scottish businesses that have to deal with the water industry. They say
that the great breakthrough in Scotland as  a result of
competition was the fact that they could get  
<?notus-xml column=198?>a much better service. They could get the water supply when they wanted
it and where they wanted it, and pipes and so on mended and
repaired.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000009">Businesses
in Scotland can also negotiate with their water industry about what
sort of water they want. At present, under a nationalised monopoly or a
privatised monopoly, only one type of water is available. It is cleaned
to a certain standard and it then has additives put in it. An industry
wanting to make drinks may need to take the additives out before it can
make its drinks, so there is a double cost and a nuisance, because it
cannot get the type of water it wants. A firm that wants to carry out a
fairly rudimentary washing business does not need water of a quality
that we can drink, but it has to pay the extra price to buy the very
high-quality water literally to tip it down the
drain.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000010">Therefore,
we are not seeing experimentation, innovation or customer service
because of a lack of competition. The industry is determined to supply
only one grade of water and only the amount it can be bothered to
supply, and then it blames the customer, should we dare to say that we
want a bit more. We are now bombarded with messages from the industry
suggesting that water is a natural monopoly and not the ultimate
renewable resource. We are told that good people take only one bath a
week in order to save water, that they do not use so much water for
cleaning and that they ensure that they husband their use of water in
their sinks and whatever machines they have at home that require
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000011">I

water is the ultimate renewable resource, that it ought to be made

living standards, which is what we are all here to try to help create,
is that people can then use more water because they have more things to
clean, or because they wish to enjoy themselves in their bathroom. We
need to ensure that they have access to the right quantities of cheaper
water, and competition is the way to do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Julian Smith" PimsId="5642" UID="13110575000223" xid="1205" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000223">Julian

the problem is. If water is a natural monopoly, as some people argue,
no harm will be done by breaking the formal monopoly; it is just that
nothing will happen. But of course it is not a natural monopoly, which
is why the industry is fighting so hard to keep a legal monopoly. It

face
competition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000014">We
would have to give the market some help to get  it going,
because the monopolists are in a very strong position. We would need to
tell them to use their pipe network as a common carrier, because other
people would need access to it. However, the challengers might soon
find, as was the case with those sorts of arrangements in the telecoms
industry, that the existing assets are not so great and that they want
to put in their own pipes. The challengers in telecoms did that with
wires, and then of course the radio links became a cheaper and 
<?notus-xml column=199?>better way of doing it. Who knows what technical breakthroughs there
might be or how much challengers would want to use the common carrier
network? However, to get competition going we would need to start with
a common carrier network, so a system would need to be put in place to

As has been pointed out, however, we let huge quantities of water go to

thing that I think the water industry needs to pay attention to, along
with other utilities in this country, is the huge disruption they cause
to our road network. Our road network is a nationalised monopoly and
therefore has rationing and, looking at the tax bill, is extremely
expensive. It has all the characteristics of monopoly provision that I
dislike. One of the things that make our totally inadequate road
network even worse is the fact that it is regularly disrupted by
businesses digging up great chunks of tarmac and subsoil with pneumatic
drills in order to lay new water pipes, other utility pipes and wires.
Why on earth have we not learnt that it is not a great idea to put
these things right down the middle of the road and then hard-pack soil,
subsoil, tarmac and stones on top, which means huge delay, disruption
and cost every time we want to change it? In modern buildings all the
services run in ducts under the floors so that we do not have to rip
out the plaster, half demolishing the place, every time we want to
change the wiring.</hs_Para>

could have a system to provide easy access along the side of our roads
to pipes, wires and anything else we want to put down without having to
dig up the road every time. We could at least start doing that when we
build new estates, shopping centres or whatever. We should do it
intelligently by putting in ducts to save all that money and time. I
find utility companies very sympathetic to that idea when I invite them
in to talk about it. They say, “It’s a very good idea,
but it won’t work in this case, Mr Redwood.” We have to
make it work, because many other countries are well ahead of us on all
this. They think we are completely potty to go in for this idea that
the water company digs up the road and puts in a new pipe, then six
months later the gas people come along and do exactly the same thing in
a slightly different position, and then the following year the
electricity people turn up and do it again. It is mad, costly and

solution to bring about water affordability and to stop the rising tide
of householders who are finding themselves in water poverty or unable
to pay their water bills. The approach of the Water Bill is entirely
the wrong way around. It is interesting to hear Government Members say
that the only answer is greater competition. I accept that retail
business competition could be a good way of reducing water usage. That
has made a profound difference north of the border. That is why we have
supported it continually. The idea came out of the Cave

at a time when many parts of the UK are much more water-scarce than
other parts of the continent and even parts of Africa, it is
short-sighted to think that that idea will work without considering
abstraction reform as well. The Government have chosen to punt that
issue into the 2020s—until 2025—for the next Government
to look at. If we do not deal with scarcity in many parts of the
country, there will be a major problem. Instead, the Government have
looked for a  
<?notus-xml column=203?>number of measures that will shake up the industry and make them look

abstraction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000042">There

idea of a national water grid is stillborn, purely on the basis that
the carbon costs make it too difficult. If we accept the premise for
that idea, surely what we need is a similar level of investment in
water efficiency. We must have a similar amount of foresight on how we

there is proper leadership on that issue, things will become very
difficult. Big concrete, in-the-ground solutions are not the right

area where the Government have been caught napping is the structure of
the industry. After privatisation, a number of companies emerged that
were listed on the UK stock market. There was then a shift in the
industry towards foreign ownership. Today, the majority of the industry
is owned by private equity firms. At the same time, dividends and water
bills have continued to rise. Unison has done some fantastic research
that has tracked the nature of the industry. However, it is not just
Unison that has raised concerns. Jonson Cox, the chair of Ofwat, has
said that there needs to be greater clarity in many of the difficult
accounting explanations. I hope that Ofwat will continue to pursue that
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000047">One
issue on which the Government could take action is Eurobonds, and the
practice whereby water companies effectively borrow from arm’s
length bodies of themselves at greater levels of interest, which is
obviously favourable on their balance sheet. The Government consulted
on that issue and decided to do nothing, yet it is a major reason why
the water industry has skewed the way it has. If we want to drill down
and ensure that the benefit of the reforms goes not only to
shareholders but to customers and households, the Government must
consider that issue again.</hs_Para>

want to mention social responsibility for water companies. In January
2012 I went to a fantastic research facility at the university of Leeds
called Water at Leeds. I gave a speech in which I laid out
Labour’s response to the water White Paper and the forthcoming
legislation. I also talked about the consensus that exists on water.
Both parties in government, the industry  and customers have
bought into the idea of a largely monopolised, yet privately owned,
privately run and privately debt-financed water industry, but that
consensus could break down if action is not taken.</hs_Para>

people believe that water would be better off nationalised. That is a
massive flashing red light to the water industry that it needs to take
action, and to the Government if they believe that that should not be
the policy that passes through. I believe one way of doing that would
be to have a social responsibility clause in the Water Bill that lays
out clearly and benchmarks what each water company is doing in terms of
social responsibility. That would include the companies saying how they
manage their tax affairs in a way that is easy to understand and has
clarity, rather than things being hidden away in the balance sheet.
They would also mention their responsibility to their broader
constituencies, and whether they employ apprentices and are investing
in R and D, as Cave mentioned in his report. Let us look at the water
companies and instead of saying that some have a good story to tell,
let us try to raise them all up to the level of the very
best.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000050">Those
five areas—bad debt, social tariff, abstraction reform,
Eurobonds and social responsibility—would in themselves create a
coherent basis for tackling water affordability and water scarcity. I

in the eye and dodged each one.</hs_Para>

means passes the public by that their water bills go up, yet now and
again we have hosepipe bans and so on because—let us be
honest—of the mismanagement of our water resources. It does not
help, however, when developers take no notice whatsoever of reports

recently had discussions with some people from Yorkshire Water about a
small village in my constituency called Walton. It has a couple of
houses that are badly affected by heavy rainfall and flooding.
Yorkshire Water effectively said that a scheme to save two houses would
cost £1.8 million—not in the region of something it could
afford do—but that the problem came about in the first place
because the original barn should never have been converted into a
house. Messages to that effect were put forth at the time, but the
conversion went ahead. The house was sold on in good faith and no
matter what the situation in trying to alleviate the problem, Yorkshire
Water is fairly certain that the water will always end up in that
place. No one particularly noticed when it was full of cows, but when
it is someone’s house, they tend to notice. That is a prime

Figures from Leeds city council state that 12,500 houses could be built

area of Kippax called Sandgate drive. Some 260 houses are to
be built at the back of some houses—by that  I actually
mean built on a hill behind those houses. Yorkshire Water has said that
the water that will run

water courses to deal with that run-off of water—something the

pumping facilities to get the water to the top. That has been resolved,
but only last week a resident told me that, last summer, on a very warm
day, the water pressure dropped off when everybody in the area used the
water. The developers have taken no notice of that, which means that
Yorkshire Water must spend more of its resources dealing with the

amount of water. Nobody can do anything about such one-off events, but
we can avoid exacerbating the situation. There is a live planning
application for a development on the floodplain in the village that was

should have the ability to turn around and say, “No. That area

encouraging to hear the Environment Secretary this week tell water
companies to be mindful that price increases should be imposed only
where necessary, and remind them to introduce special tariffs for
hard-pressed households. That takes me back to debates at the end of
the previous Parliament when my hon. Friends the Members for Brecon and
Radnorshire (Roger Williams) and for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) tabled
an amendment to the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 to allow for
social tariffs, which had never before existed in the water industry.
There had been social tariffs in the energy industry, but not in the
water industry. The Act became law on 8 April 2010—probably the
last piece of legislation to sneak over the line before the general
election. Since then, the Government have been positive about
encouraging individuals to consider how they can get help with their
water bills and ensuring that water companies introduce social tariffs.
Since the Liberal Democrats have been in the Government, guidance on
social tariffs was issued in June 2012 and water companies have been
able to introduce their own social tariffs since 2013. I credit Thames
Water with welcoming and responding to that opportunity.</hs_Para>

the benefit of those who follow our debates, I should add that there
are two other schemes that provide help. The first is the WaterSure
scheme, funded by water customers, which provides financial help to
householders with three or more children under the age of 19, if on a
water meter and in receipt of certain benefits—people should
check which benefits and whether they qualify—and for those
without children but in receipt of benefits and with a medical
condition requiring excessive water use. That is important. Not
everybody knows about it, but they should, particularly those
struggling who might qualify. The other scheme, Water Direct, run by
the Department for Work and Pensions, helps householders in receipt of
certain benefits to manage debt with water companies. Under that
scheme, the DWP acts as a broker to help make
arrangements.</hs_Para>

The latest date for written representations was yesterday, which was

London but in the whole Thames Water region, it remains a live issue
whether Thames Water’s current plans for the tunnel are the
right ones, given the alternative ways of dealing with sewage in
London, and the question whether the route is the right one. Obviously,
the route will impact significantly on constituencies such as mine. For
example, a big site  on Chambers wharf is proposed for the
drive shaft, but I and my constituents argue that it should be used for
the reception shaft—if it is to be used at all—and that
the drive shaft should be

solution that appears to condone allowing water companies in England to
run down their assets and then try to get Government support to bail
them out. That would not send the right message. The water companies
must understand that, if they make choices resulting in their profits
going not to the consumer but to their shareholders in the form of
dividends, they really cannot expect the Government to come to the

I pray in aid a useful pamphlet, which I am happy to promote, that was
recently published by CentreForum, a Liberal think-tank. It was written
by George Turner, who used to run my office here. He became interested

is one of the essential industries. We literally cannot live without
it…There are allegations of widespread tax avoidance. The level
of corporate borrowing is becoming unsustainable. The ownership
structure means that there is very little public accountability. Most
of our largest companies are owned by private equity funds and there
are no public meetings where management can be held to account. The
ownership structures are murky to say the least with strings of
companies dotted around the world’s island secrecy jurisdictions

problem has come to a head in relation to Thames Water, which has got
itself into this position over the proposed tunnel. I suggest that some
of the ideas in the pamphlet should be picked up by the Government,
Parliament, Ofwat and the Select Committee. First, we could introduce a
water levy on highly geared water companies, which would take away the
incentive to introduce risk by increasing gearing and removing
financial flexibility. This was mentioned by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood) and my hon. Friend the Member for

could ask the Government to look at—I ask them to do so

consider economies and systems such as the German ones, where there are
earnings-stripping rules that prevent companies from taking out
excessive loans with the intention of avoiding tax.</hs_Para>

could legislate—I hope the Minister will be sympathetic when the
Water Bill goes through its stages—to make sure that water
companies make the interests of the consumer much more central in their

<?notus-xml column=210?>organisations, either through a consumer representative on the board or
by placing a duty on the non-executive directors to report on how best
to serve the consumer interest, or both.</hs_Para>

importantly, we should amend the Bill to introduce mandatory annual
customer meetings, where customers can hold management to account in
companies that do not currently have annual general meetings in the UK.
I would also hope to change the law through the Bill, so that, when
restructuring companies which have gone into special administration,
the regulator must always first consider non-profit companies, rather
than putting them straight back into the private sector, as we saw in a
recent example in the railway industry. I hope that the Government will
also look at how different models of corporate ownership have impacted
on the water industry, as they have not all been
satisfactory.</hs_Para>

Ofwat will also do four things—and soon. First, I hope it will
report on all the companies in England, not just Thames Water, to
establish whether more modest dividend and financial policies would
have allowed them to have enough money to spend and to reduce bills.
Secondly, it should look at how price cuts could be implemented at the
next price review. Thirdly, it should change the licence conditions of
companies to impose London stock exchange disclosure requirements on
non-stock market-listed companies. Lastly, picking up the point made by
the right hon. Member for Holborn and St Pancras, Ofwat should change
the licence conditions to require public disclosure of all intermediate
holding companies, ultimate controlling companies and all the
beneficiaries of those companies, so that we know exactly where the
benefits that go in dividends to shareholders end up in those many
companies behind many of this country’s water
companies.</hs_Para>

that require treatment, but power was going off, and there was still no

it had been clear

major assets that were meant to protect us were not fit for purpose.
Yorkshire Water has tried very hard since then, and I feel very
positive about what it has done, but we should not have been put in
that position, particularly in view of Yorkshire Water’s
dividends. There has been an improvement since 2010—the
company’s dividend is now significantly lower in relation to its
post-tax profits—but the statistics for 2005, 2006 and 2008-9

bills were rising in my constituency. The Yorkshire Water household
bill, which I pay every year along with other residents, was
£264 in 2005. By 2009-10 and 2010-11, when we were under many
feet of water owing to that lack of investment and an inability to
maintain assets properly, it had risen to £330. Profit for
utility companies is something that is established, and I have nothing
against it as long as it is accompanied by investment, but the
compelling statistics and data presented by my hon. Friend the Member

that all is not well. We need either beefed-up powers for Ofwat, or the

Government and the water industry. I hope the Minister will consider
introducing new powers to allow companies making excess profits to be
ordered to cut bills and to beef up the powers allowing Ofwat to
require investment in our infrastructure when these profits are too
high. The Government must stand up for consumers.</hs_Para>

quadrupling of the dividend payment, from £62.3 million to
£256 million in the past year. The thing that really sticks in
the craw of my constituents is the fact that despite those massive
dividends and huge opportunities for its shareholders, Yorkshire Water
paid zero tax in the last financial year, and with a highly leveraged
balance sheet. When we compare that behaviour with the behaviour of my

It is regrettable that, having by general consensus inherited a

reform the water industry, the coalition has frittered away so much of
the past 40 months. I am at a loss to understand what, if
anything, was done in the first year and a half of this Government.
When they came to office in 2010, the new ministerial team inherited
not one but two reports on the water industry from Anna Walker and
Martin Cave. Both reports had been favourably received by consumer
groups, customers, regulators, industry commentators and Parliament.
The reports, which complemented each other, provided a clear framework
for reform. In fact, the only organisations that did not welcome their
recommendations were some of the water
companies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000120">It
is not surprising that those who were found to have let down their
customers—whether domestic, in the public sector or in private
business—were the ones who were less than enamoured with the
possibility of reform. The stories of poor customer service are
legendary—we have heard many such cases today—as are the
dividend returns paid out by many of the water companies. The arrogance
of the companies has been astonishing. The tax avoidance measures,
coupled with a refusal to plough excess profits back into either
infrastructure improvements or a lowering of bills, are simply
unacceptable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000121">Even
now, when household budgets are continuously squeezed by

operating profits 
<?notus-xml column=216?>of approximately 9% whereas water companies make

their dividends increase, families across the country have suffered.
Last year, regional water companies made a pre-tax profit of
£1.9 billion, paying out dividends totalling £1.8 billion
to shareholders, yet they have not seen the need to pay their fair
share in taxes. As <I>The Sunday Times </I>revealed, in 2012-13 Thames

companies have been able to reduce their tax liabilities to such tiny
levels by substantially increasing their levels of debt. Some water
companies have reduced their tax bills by offsetting the interest
payments on debt, often inter-company and involving tax havens, while
claiming allowances for spending on infrastructure. Shareholders and
bosses, as we have heard, have benefited from that aggressive tax
avoidance, with eye-watering salaries going to those at the top. Peter
Simpson, chief executive of Anglian Water, received a package worth
£1.27 million in the last year, up from a mere

congratulate the hon. Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke) on leading
the charge to secure the debate. He wanted to send a clear message to
Ofwat and particularly to the water companies that consumers expect
more now. They want a fairer deal to cope with the cost of living and
to reflect the fact that the water companies have had some good years.
They have had much lower borrowing costs in recent years than was
predicted when those prices were set. The hon. Gentleman is looking for
some flexibility during the current price review period for those
issues to be taken on board.</hs_Para>

is a matter for the regulator. Ofwat is being far more assertive in the
message that it is sending to the water companies. It has the power to
revisit the current price settlement, but in particular circumstances.
Ofwat’s discussions with water companies are obviously focused
on the coming price review period. It will want to see whether water
companies come forward with any suggestions. As my right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State pointed out in his letter to the water
companies, they are in far better circumstances than were predicted at
the beginning of the current period. As a Government, we are supporting
Ofwat and providing political cover. If Ofwat is looking for a deal
from water companies that more accurately reflects current
circumstances, it has the political back-up to do that. I welcome the
signs that Ofwat is indeed doing
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000140">The
issues surrounding investment are crucial. The right hon. Member for
Holborn and St Pancras spoke about the simple business of a couple of
pipes in the ground catching the rain water and sending it on. That was
the case once upon a time. There are also the issues of what
happens—how can I put this delicately?—after the water
has been consumed by the consumer. What used to happen is that a pipe
would be installed, as I know all too well, representing a coastal
constituency, and the waste would drift out into the Atlantic ocean.
That is not acceptable now and we expect a far better standard of
treatment for sewage and better solutions to deal with the problems.

have.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000141"><B><Member ContinuationText="Frank Dobson" PimsId="2981" UID="13110575000266" xid="170" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0003.htm#13110575000266">Frank

office, other than reviews. Her Majesty’s Opposition seem to
stake their reputation on a number of reviews, but they did nothing on
the back of them. This Government will look at that work and the
evidence provided and do something, such as dealing with the inequality

supply of water for everybody to enjoy in all sorts of ways and when we
will not have such nasty things as metering and restrictions. There are
other reasons for metering which relate to energy use and environmental
concerns, because whatever we do to reform the retail side will not
suddenly and hugely increase the amount of water. We will work on
abstraction reform and encouraging new people into supply, but that

continue. I know that Ofwat is listening to that carefully. One of the
things it is keen to do with water companies is look at how it
regulates to encourage transparency and overcome opaqueness, which
relates to what Jonson Cox has said. The companies that take a more
responsible attitude to engaging with consumers, feeding back their
information and being open about what they do can be regulated in a way
that reflects that, and those that refuse to engage with that progress
will be the ones that Ofwat will want to investigate much more closely
and have close conversations with in future. That is the sort of
approach that I very much welcome. Having mentioned Ofwat a number of

Knee-jerk reactions that undermine the strengths of the regulatory

Brooke</B> (Mid Dorset and North Poole) (LD):</Member> On 12 December
2006, 11-year-old Ben took his own life after being persistently
bullied on a dedicated school bus in Sussex. The bullying incidents
were reported on a number of occasions, but still the end result was
this dreadful tragedy. Had it just been his peers he may well have
withstood the bullying, but the bus driver decided to join in and, in
his parents’ view, this took the situation to another level. As
Ben saw it, here was an adult—someone to look up to and who
represented authority—taking part in his denigration.
Ben’s parents have since moved to my constituency and I have met
his father on many occasions. Over the years, Mr Paul Vodden has spent
an enormous amount of time working with charities associated with
protecting children from bullying and he met a children’s
Minister with me during the previous Government’s time in
office.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000168">In
2010, a year after the publication of Government guidance on tackling
bullying on journeys to and from school, a survey carried out by
4Children and me showed that the majority of local authorities did not
have a safer travel policy in place. The survey found that out of 67
local authorities, 60% did not have a safer travel policy and 52% did
not have a safer travel team. Of those local authorities that did have
a safer travel policy, only 50% said it covered all forms of bullying
and only 38% said it covered all forms of
journey.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000169">The

anti-bullying policies outside the school gates has been slow, with
many local agencies still not working together as well as they could.

my opinion, this incident represents a small tip to a very large
iceberg of misery for many children who have a hard time on their way
to and from school on dedicated school buses. In what other situation
would we expect an untrained and unqualified adult to be in sole charge
of 50 or more children and to do another complex task at the same
time”?</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13110575000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000170">This
August, Mr Vodden completed his report on his own online survey to
assess bullying on dedicated school buses. The aim of his survey is to
attempt to determine the extent of bullying on those buses and the
involvement, if any, of drivers. The report demonstrates that a number
of problems still exist and they need to be urgently addressed. I have
sent the Minister details of the methodology used by Mr Vodden and
today I want to look at his
conclusions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000171">The
situation on the dedicated school bus is, by its nature, potentially
problematic as far as bullying is concerned. Children are placed on a
school bus in a group, the composition of which they have no choice
over. There is no formal supervision and virtually no opportunity of
avoiding conflict situations. In other social situations, such as
during playground play, there is at least the potential of formal
supervision by a teacher, access to supportive peers and the
opportunity of escaping unpleasant situations. However, as we know,
even in the playground, bullying is not easily
avoided.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000172">Mr
Vodden’s survey aims to be a realistic snapshot  of what
is happening on dedicated school buses and a general indication of the
effects and consequences of 
<?notus-xml column=224?>bullying in general. Although the intention of the survey was to focus
on the dedicated school bus, anecdotal evidence suggests that the
situation is not much better on public service
buses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000173">To
put the level of responses in context, it should be noted that bullied
children feel that making an issue of bullying could make matters
worse. Although the children ought to feel safe because they are
anonymous for the purposes of the survey, the responses indicate that
they still feel vulnerable. It is also common for such children to have
low self-esteem, which makes them feel that the bullying is their fault
and that no one will think that they are worth bothering
with.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000174">The
responses to the survey indicate that there is a significant problem
with bullying on dedicated school buses. That has had serious
consequences for many of the bullied children. Thirty respondents
reported self-harming, 24 considered suicide and 97 just wanted to hide
away. Fear, anger and embarrassment were also significant reactions,
which adds to the
concerns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000175">The
survey indicates that most bullying on the school bus starts when the
student commences secondary school in year 7. One hundred and two
respondents said that the bullying started in that year, which is 40%
of the respondents. Children in the top year of primary school are
confident of where they fit within the school and of their peer group.
Moving to secondary school puts them at the bottom of the pile, with
all the pressures and insecurities that that engenders. The move from
year 6 in primary school to year 7 in secondary school should therefore
be recognised as a time of particular vulnerability. That vulnerability
is compounded by the fact that children are often moving from a small
primary school where they know most of their fellow students to a much
larger secondary school with many more pupils, perhaps from a greater
variety of social groups. That is a particularly interesting finding
and something that could easily be cross-referenced with other
research. I wonder whether the Minister has further evidence on that
point. We know that school transition can be difficult in many other
respects.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000176">Mr
Vodden concludes that it is clear that the role of the driver is
significant. Only four drivers were recorded as taking action to
alleviate bullying, whereas 41 were reported as taking no action, even
when many of them were reported as knowing what was going on. A
worrying 17 drivers were reported as joining
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000177">Only
six respondents knew about the safer travel policy. Although 69
respondents knew that their school had an anti-bullying policy, it is
worrying that an almost equal number did not. A significant number of
respondents did not know who to turn to in the event of bullying or
whether the school had any systems in place to deal with bullying. That
might indicate that the school did not have an effective system in
place, if any. Although a few respondents reported that support was
forthcoming from the school and that practical, effective action was
taken, a large majority reported that they received little help from
school staff. When help was provided, it was generally found to be
ineffectual.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000178">That
part of the analysis shows how patchy anti-bullying policies are across
schools. I have seen some excellent examples of good practice in
schools in my constituency. It is clearly necessary to ensure that good
practice is spread. There is also a question over how much leadership
there is from the local authority and over what is 
<?notus-xml column=225?>happening in academies and free schools. ChildLine and other helplines
are important because they allow children to discuss bullying, but
children are still highly likely to need practical support from their
school. Good mentoring from older pupils can be particularly useful in
helping children to overcome their reluctance to talk to
adults.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000179">My
husband recently led a working party on anti-bullying policies across
Poole. He concluded that the local authority needs to promote wider
discussions with schools to help them understand bullying and must give
schools greater assistance in dealing with individual cases. He found
that governors need to develop a more proactive role and challenge or
encourage their schools to develop and implement anti-bullying
policies. He said that partnership working must be developed in
conjunction with the expansion of an anti-bullying programme, which
could provide for the greater inclusion of parents. It is interesting
that that separate piece of work came up with the same areas where more
needs to be
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000180">Mr
Vodden’s survey shows that bullying takes place on dedicated
school buses and that it involves both verbal and physical abuse such
as spitting, punching, slapping and pushing. He concludes that, apart
from some notable exceptions, bullying on school buses is clearly an
area of child vulnerability that has received insufficient attention.
In what other situation are as many as 50 or more children forcibly
restricted in a confined space for up to an hour, with a single,
untrained adult present, who is undertaking a separate task that
requires their full attention? When students are taken on school
outings, the ratio of adults to students is strictly controlled and
there are always a number of helpers.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110575000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000181">Drivers of
school buses, whether public service routes or dedicated school
services, are recruited on account of their training, qualifications
and ability to drive a bus. I make a plea for a requirement for some
training for people who drive a bus with those vulnerable pupils. As a
minimum safeguard, most local education authorities of course require
drivers of dedicated school buses to undergo a Criminal Records Bureau
check, but additional training and assessment is needed to ensure that
such drivers are able to relate to children and equipped to deal with
the childish behaviour that is bound to happen. The findings of the
survey indicate that there is a risk of school bus drivers reacting
inappropriately towards the young people in their charge. At best they
may fail to notice or to report peer bullying, thus leaving vulnerable
children without a responsible adult to turn to. At worst, either
through ignorance or wilful intent, they may themselves take part in
acts of bullying.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110575000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000182">Mr Vodden
asks whether the driver of a bus can reasonably and safely be expected
to monitor children’s behaviour while giving their full
attention to the serious undertaking of driving. If not the driver,
however, where is the “responsible adult” who can
intervene to safeguard children from bullying during their daily
journey to and from school? That question requires an urgent and
unequivocal answer.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110575000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000183">The
psychological effects of bullying on children are potentially long term
and significant even in the short term. It seems from the responses
given in this survey by victims of bullying that a number of schools do
not 
<?notus-xml column=226?>adequately understand the complex nature of bullying, and appear unclear
how to deal with it. The responses indicate a lack of joined-up
thinking between the relevant agencies when dealing with bullying, and
an absence of a coherent strategy or clear procedures. Schools are
required to enforce measures that will encourage good behaviour and
prevent all forms of bullying, including the provision of an
anti-bullying policy, but the results of the survey indicate that in
many cases that is not properly implemented. Even when systems are in
place to deal with bullying, they may be
ineffective.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000184">Owing
to the complex nature of bullying and the varying needs of both the
victims and the bullies, it is essential that any procedure for
identifying or dealing with bullying should be flexible and applied
specifically to the individuals involved. It is self-evident that
children—like the rest of us—are individuals and must be
dealt with as such. Any procedure must be efficient and effective to
alleviate the bullying without delay. It is important to assess
accurately what is taking place, but it is potentially risky to
undertake a painstaking investigation before taking speedy
action.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000185">Mr
Vodden’s conclusions and recommendations include a properly
trained adult or “chaperone” other than the bus driver to
be provided for all dedicated school buses, particularly on longer
journeys, and that all dedicated school bus drivers be given
appropriate training in how to behave when dealing with children, how
to respond in the event of bullying, and how to avoid becoming involved
in the bullying itself—I have asked the previous Schools
Minister about that issue on a number of occasions. Mr Vodden
recommends that all dedicated school bus drivers should be assessed as
suitable and safe to transport children; that it should be made clear
to all which agencies and individuals are directly responsible for
resolving incidents on the school bus; and that those individuals must
be properly trained. In Ben’s case, the parents went to the
school repeatedly, but nothing happened as far as the bus journey was
concerned. It is so easy to separate school departments from transport
departments at local authority level.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110575000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000186">Mr Vodden
also recommends that a professional body of experts and practitioners
in child behaviour should be created to set up and frequently monitor a
national procedure for assessing and dealing with bullying. That should
be flexible and take into account individual requirements. Every school
should have in place an efficient, effective and up-to-date procedure
for dealing with bullying, ideally including peer mentoring schemes
with proper pastoral care for
students.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000187">Clearly,
this survey has been carried out in response to a heartbreaking tragedy
and a father’s passion to try to ensure that better support is
given to children like Ben who suffered so much. Seven years on, many
improvements could still be made. I commend the whole piece of
work—the survey—to the Minister. There is scope to
cross-reference with other pieces of research to come up with further
ideas to build on the good work that the Department for Education
already supports. I should like to request a meeting with the Minister
and Mr Vodden to discuss that
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000188">A
number of charities do excellent work for bullied children, and I thank
all of them. Mr Vodden specifically mentions the anti-bullying
ambassadors scheme operated by the Diana Award—a cheap and
highly effective system for implementing peer mentoring in
schools—and 
<?notus-xml column=227?>the counselling work undertaken by Kidscape, and says they are of
particular value in dealing with children in extreme cases of bullying.
However, all hon. Members know that bullying happens and will continue
to happen. The worst situation is when a school suggests that no
bullying takes place, because it is most likely to be happening
somewhere. We must face up to the problem and not believe that school
transport, as something that happens outside the school, is nothing to
do with the teacher in charge of bullying policy, and the governors,
who must support the school’s anti-bullying policy. Let us
ensure that everybody pulls together so we can do our very best to
avoid tragedies such as
Ben’s.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_05_PT_1/57BCF0348E20D75958C56D959A86B81DD02902F6" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="5 November 2013">Tuesday

children boards, the police, schools and parents all have a role to

Authorities can develop their own approaches to tackling bullying,
including by employing dedicated staff such as anti-bullying
co-ordinators, or by commissioning support from the voluntary and

recognise that the majority of pupils travel by public transport that
is provided by private companies. It is for those companies to
determine the training of their staff. Responsible providers of any
service, whether a private company, a charity or the state, should take
into account its interactions with young people and other vulnerable
groups when developing safety policies, and they should act when they
encounter bullying. Members of the public not directly involved with
schools or services for children have a responsibility to play their
part in keeping children safe and reporting poor behaviour, in the
wider interests of the community. It is important that we all take

The Home Office’s Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing
Bill, which is currently working its way through Parliament, contains
provisions allowing a range of bodies—including the police,
local councils and other agencies—to apply for an injunction to
prevent nuisance and annoyance in order to tackle antisocial behaviour.
The injunction is designed to stop or prevent behaviour whereby someone
has engaged, or threatens to engage, in conduct capable of causing
nuisance or annoyance to any person. Bullying is a behaviour that could
fall into that category. The injunction could be used to stop emerging
antisocial behaviour before it escalates, and to protect victims from
bullying in and around schools and colleges and in the community, and
from cyber-bullying. For example, the injunction could stop a
perpetrator associating with the victim outside of school or college,
or from entering named areas in the

the Ofsted inspections framework has been reduced from 27 to four. Of

requirement to give parents 24 hours’ written notice of
after-school detentions, and a clarification of teachers’ power
to use reasonable force. Schools that excel at tackling bullying have
created an ethos of good behaviour where pupils treat one another, and
school 
<?notus-xml column=229?>staff, with respect, because they know it is the right way to behave.
The best schools develop a more sophisticated approach whereby school
staff proactively gather intelligence on issues between pupils before
they become a problem: they prevent bullying from occurring in the
first place. That might involve talking to pupils about issues of
perceived difference in lessons, in dedicated events or projects, and
in
assemblies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000199">My
hon. Friend made a very good point about the transition from primary
school to secondary school, not just with regard to academic
attainment, but to confidence and how pupils fit into a new school.
That needs to be explored. In general, we are concerned about that
transition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000200">Successful
schools involve parents to ensure that they are clear that the school
does not tolerate bullying and that they are aware of the procedures to
follow if they believe their child is being bullied. They involve
pupils, so that pupils understand the school’s approach. They
regularly evaluate and update their approach to take into account
developments in technology—for example, the role of computers
and social media. They implement disciplinary sanctions, so that the
consequences of bullying reflect the serious nature of the incident,
and they have open discussions about perceived differences before they
become problematic. It is important that schools work with the wider
community, including the police and children’s
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000201">We
acknowledge that tackling bullying outside school is challenging, but
we have been clear that teachers have the power to discipline pupils
for poor behaviour, including bullying outside the school gates. Where
bullying outside school is reported to school staff, it should be
investigated and acted upon. If the misbehaviour could be criminal or
poses a serious threat to a child or another member of the public, the
police should be informed. The Department has issued advice to help
schools prevent and tackle bulling, making it clear that teachers have
the power to discipline pupils for bullying incidents on school and
public transport and on the journey to and from school, when it is
brought to their attention.</hs_Para>

completely with my hon. Friend about the excellent organisations
working in this area, some of which the Department funds. We are
providing four organisations with £4 million over two years from
spring 2013. First, we are giving £800,000 to The Diana Award to
identify and train 10,000 pupils as anti-bullying 
<?notus-xml column=230?>ambassadors. I recently met representatives from The Diana Award and
year-11 student Henry Doran, an anti-bullying ambassador at the Magna
Carta school in Surrey. I was incredibly impressed by what Henry told
me about how they had created a much more positive culture within the
school and how he enjoyed his role helping the other children. At a
recent reception in Downing street celebrating that impressive
programme, I was told about the smile and compliment days—I
said I thought it would be good for us to have them in
Westminster sometimes. It is a really good project. What is nice is
that it accentuates the positive—it is the opposite of a
bullying culture—creating a positive culture in which people
compliment each other and focus on their similarities and strengths,
rather than the issues dividing them. So that is very
good.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110575000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/debtext/131105-0004.htm#13110575000203">Secondly,
we are giving just over £250,000 to Kidscape to work in nine of
London’s most economically deprived boroughs to train primary
school professionals to deliver preventive and remedial strategies.
Thirdly, we are giving £1.5 million to Beatbullying to train
3,500 11 to 17-year-olds over two years. Fourthly, we are giving
£1.5 million to the National Children’s Bureau consortium
to focus on bullied children and young people with special educational
needs and/or disabilities, working with 900 schools and with parents,
carers and school staff to reduce the bullying of these children and
the impact when it

we have heard, bullying can blight the lives of young people and result
in tragic consequences. We do not want other children and their
families to suffer as Ben Vodden and his family have suffered. We all
have a part to play in helping to prevent and tackle bullying wherever
it occurs—whether in the school, the wider community or on
school transport—to ensure that no children have to suffer
mistreatment. My hon. Friend asked if I would meet with her and Mr
Vodden. I would be happy to do so in order better to understand the
issues at a local authority level: what prevents local authorities from
using their powers to make changes—she mentioned the
survey—and how we can ensure that good programmes, such as the
anti-bullying ambassador programme, become more widespread in our
schools. That will help us to change the culture in our schools and
create a positive environment where learning can take place.</hs_Para>

Bruce:</Member></B> That is absolutely right. Barnabas Aid reports that
until 2011, Syria was one of the freest places to be a Christian in the
middle east. It was a place of sanctuary for Christians escaping
persecution in Iraq. Suddenly, all of that has changed. Christians made
up a sizable minority—around 10% of the population—and
were allowed to live out their faith without much hostility from
Muslims around them. The Patriarch of Antioch, Gregorios III, said that
it was often Christians who provided a bridge between disparate Muslim
groups in the region. They had a collegiate approach towards living
there. However, as clashes between Government forces and opposition
fighters escalated into the brutal civil war that the country has
experienced, Christians emerged as particular targets for rebels who
assumed at times that Christians were Government
supporters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T09:46:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110555000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0001.htm#13110555000043">As
Islamist bands have become some of the most prominent groups among
rebel fighters, Christians are increasingly being targeted. We hear,
for example, of one village where the parish priest has to collect
$35,000 a month to pay rebel groups to protect the Christians from
armed attacks. That is outrageous, but that is what is happening

estimates put the number of Christians who have fled Syria at between
450,000 and 600,000—about a third of the Christian population
before the atrocities began. Barnabas Aid estimates that about 600 have
been martyred for their faith. For those who stay, the picture is
bleak. The report that I mentioned states that entire populations of
predominantly Christian villagers around Homs fled for their lives in
2012. In February this year, rebel fighters invaded al-Thawrah, seized
Christian homes, confiscated possessions and threatened people with
death because they did not comply with sharia law. On 27 May this year,
rebel fighters massacred almost 40 men, women and children

during a spate of violence against Christians, nearly 80 churches and
other centres were attacked in less than 48 hours. Fear of attack means
that thousands of Christians are now too afraid to leave their homes.

He is absolutely right that the massive influx into Lebanon is putting
enormous pressure on medical services and institutions. One problem is
that Christian refugees in many places in Syria are frightened to use
official UN camps, because of fear of persecution and attacks even
within the camps, and therefore have to seek aid elsewhere. In this
debate, I want to call on the UN to look at what can be done to ensure
that official places of refuge, such as UN camps, are secure and safe

particular. More than one person has commented to me that addressing
the issue could be seen as promoting colonial or neo-colonial
attitudes. I respectfully say that 
<?notus-xml column=8?>we really must get over that and find a way round it. It must not
inhibit us from acting; millions of people’s lives and

the Secretary of State for International Development. I have the utmost
respect for the Secretary of State, and I genuinely mean that. She is
doing a remarkable job with a very wide brief. On reading the document,
I saw that it was written some years ago, and that it focuses more on
the impact that faith groups have on delivering aid, and working with
the Government to do that, than on addressing the persecution of
Christians and other religious minorities as a human rights issue. As

was pleased to meet Baroness Warsi and other Members last week and to
read the interesting report prepared by the APPG on international
religious freedom. Of great interest was the fact that 75% of the
world’s population live in countries with high levels of
Government restriction on freedom of belief, and that became evident
during the so-called Arab spring. Some 100,000 Christians will be
killed in a year—one every hour—and 2 million will be
persecuted. Such statistics put the matter into perspective. With our
current economic issues, it is clear that many people are concerned
with their own difficulties. None the less, I have been overwhelmed by

very much feel that members of their family—brothers and

<?notus-xml column=12?>speak up about it, but they are members of all our family who are
suffering, and anyone who is concerned about freedom of religion feels
that; it is not the exclusive preserve of Christians but is felt by
anyone who cares about a good society and wants to stand up for common
freedoms, and the desire for freedom of religion is very much a common
concern. We will hear today from other Members who do not share the
Christian faith with us but very much share that same passion and
desire for freedom of religion. It is quite right that we are all

term “Christian persecution” is sometimes bandied about
carelessly. In this country, we can talk about Christian persecution,

in this country then at worst its victim is likely to be sued, but in
the middle east the victim will be killed. That is the stark reality

Christians in Iran, even in the time that he has been President. What

principle has been overridden by sharia law, which has taken precedence
on this issue. However, the basic constitutional work in Iran, and
indeed the pre-revolution heritage of Iran, was about having sympathy
with religious minorities and the Iranian people here in Britain hang
their head in shame at what is happening in their country now in the
name of Iran and its current regime, and that has continued under the
watch of Rouhani; the situation in Iran for all religious minorities,
but particularly for Christians, has continued to
deteriorate.</hs_Para>

all-party group’s report on Iran particularly highlighted the
concerns that exist for the house church movement, the members of which
have suffered appalling persecution. In addition, there is now visible
persecution of people in churches, including of people in Orthodox
churches. Also, the Catholic Church in Tehran has been 
<?notus-xml column=13?>pressured by the Iranian authorities into barring Persian-speaking
Iranians. Why is that? No doubt, it is because the regime presumes that
such people are from a Muslim background and it wants to suppress any
profession of Christian faith by
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T10:13:59"></hs_TimeCode>.

have had the September session at the UN General Assembly, and perhaps
we are seeing a thawing of relations with Iran. Eighty prisoners of
conscience were released from Iranian prisons. So can we sit down and
say, “All is good now in Iran.”? We have to recognise
that two of the Christian women released were near the end of their
sentence. Also, when Iran says that it is trying to be good and says,
“Yes, we are going to release all prisoners of
conscience,” we must look at the individuals concerned. Mr
Williams, I hope that you and the <I>Hansard</I> writers will forgive
me, but I need to put on record the names of the 16 Christians who are
serving time in jail in Iran whom we know of and who can be named. They
are Maryam Zagaran, Farshid Fathi, who has already been mentioned,
Farhad Sabokrooh, Shahnaz Jaynaz, Nasser Zamen-Dezfuli, Davoud Alijani,
Mostafa Bordbar, Mojtaba Hossein, Mohammad-Beza Partoei, Homayoun
Shokouhi, Vahid Hakkani, Ebrahim Firouzi, Saeed Abedini, Shahin

of their names, but the point is that these people need to be released

Iran is increasing, perhaps quite quickly. Some estimates put the
number as high as 1.5 million, or 2% of the population. The regime in
Iran has certainly retaliated against the growth of Christianity with a
concerted propaganda campaign. It is strictly forbidden for Christians
to talk with others about what they believe in, and Churches that reach
out to non-members have had leaders executed and members imprisoned and
tortured. Congregations live under the constant threat of arrest and

situation has not always been like that, though. We were told that,
after the Islamic revolution in 1979, the regime was, on the whole,
tolerant of Christianity and of other minority religions—those
religions are protected under the Iranian constitution—but
things changed rapidly for the worse, as the evidence gathered for last

recognised Churches. We were told that, with few exceptions, churches

the official day off. That means that going to church is likely to
involve taking time off work and possibly giving up half a day’s

submit lists of members, with their identity card numbers, so that

we have heard about is in a privileged position, and such visits to
religious minorities in those countries are a source of huge
encouragement for groups that are being persecuted. At the same time,
they can help to draw much-needed attention to the injustice that so
many people are

there are more than 2 million Syrian followers of Christ whose lineage

times. The unspeakable truth is that a sizeable Christian community in

cleansed from its ancestral home than it has been for generations. That
threat is often posed by self-styled freedom fighters who have been

fighters—increasingly rent-a-mob jihadists with no real stake in
the affairs of Damascus—do not see those in the enclaves of
Christians as genial neighbours whom they have lived beside for
centuries. I am afraid that the sad truth is that religious minorities
often find their most assured protection under dictatorships, and often
it pays not to rock the status

be that their children are barred from school, or that they have no
hope of securing a job for which they are eminently qualified, simply
because they have a faith that they refuse to renounce—which may
mean unlawful imprisonment, torture or even death. We have experienced

think democracy is the answer. As we have  seen in Egypt,
democracy may be a necessary condition for the long-term maintenance of
human rights, but it is in no way a sufficient condition. Democracy
without the rule of law becomes but the tyranny of the majority, and
democracy without the rule of law based on universal human rights can
be even worse. When we urge countries to embrace democracy and then
question why it  all goes wrong and many minorities find
themselves  in a worse position than under an autocrat, let us
remember that the rule of law, underpinned by the universal rights and
responsibilities of individuals and their enforcement, is a
precondition for democracy. We must never forget that in the rush for
universal suffrage and majority
rule.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110556000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0001.htm#13110556000033">The
Governments of middle-eastern countries that deliberately persecute
Christians and those of other non-Islamic faiths are, by keeping down
or driving out Christians, doing their countries a great disservice.
Just look at the example of the UK. When my Huguenot ancestors were
driven out of France after the revocation of the edict of Nantes, they
fled to the low countries, to Germany and to England, and they took
their skills with them. Courtauld brought textile manufacturing to this
country, and hence, eventually, the industrial revolution. Some
estimate that the expulsion of the Protestant Huguenots from France set
that country back 100 years, and advanced those countries
that welcomed them by a generation or
two.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110556000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0001.htm#13110556000034">Each<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T10:34:19"></hs_TimeCode>
wave of immigrants welcomed by our country has brought enterprise and
skills as they integrated. Where Christian citizens are driven away or
kept down, it is a huge loss to that country, its people and its
future, and the same is true for the UK. Let us recognise one of the
reasons why Christians are persecuted. They are seen as representative
of something alien—a western culture based on individualism and
materialism, rather than the collective good of love for one’s
neighbour. That, of course, is a travesty of the gospel, but it is
understandable that outsiders think that when they see some of the

his body was abandoned by a railway near Bandar Abbas, in August simply

comments to two specific issues. First, we have heard a lot about the
persecution of Christians in Syria. On Friday three Syrians, who have
been given leave to remain in the United Kingdom, visited my surgery.
It was moving to see three Syrians—a Christian, a Druze and a
Sunni—sitting together and expressing bafflement about the way
in which the religiously tolerant country they had known now posed a
risk to their
families<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T10:39:07"></hs_TimeCode>. The
three of them were grateful for the way in which the British Government
dealt with their applications for leave to remain, but their key
concern was for their families. Two of them still have significant
close family members in Syria, and the third has seen family members
killed in attacks. The question that they asked, which I am asking the
Minister today, is whether we can have clarity on the
Government’s willingness or otherwise to support Syrians who
have moved to this country and whose families are still at great risk
in Syria. We need an acknowledgement of that issue. The investment and
contribution we are making, in terms of humanitarian aid, is most
welcome, but it is important that we remain an open door for people
fleeing for their lives.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110556000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0001.htm#13110556000044"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T10:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>The
other issue I want to touch on was raised by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T10:39:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy), who shares a Huguenot ancestry
with me. He said that it was to a country’s detriment to
persecute its religious minorities. The example I would give, which
numerous Members have mentioned, is Israel—a country in the
middle east that is often vilified, not least in this place. When it
comes to religious freedom, however, it is important to highlight the
difference between the way in which Israel and neighbouring countries
behave towards their religious minorities.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110556000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0001.htm#13110556000045"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T10:40:34"></hs_TimeCode>The
key point is that the Christian population in Israel has increased a
thousandfold since the country was established. Christians serve in the
Supreme Court, the Knesset and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and
they are contributing to a stronger country. The situation of
Christians in Israel can be contrasted with that of Christians in the
west bank, where the Christian population has fallen quite
dramatically. In 1948, about 15% of Palestinians identified themselves
as Christian; today, that figure has fallen to about 2%. In many ways,
the strongest, most economically prosperous country in  the
middle east is also the most welcoming of religious minorities. When we
discuss this issue, it is important  to place on record the
fact that there is, in the middle east, a country that shows us how
things can be done differently, and that is leading to a more
prosperous situation for all the citizens of that country, regardless
of their
religion.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_05_PT_1/36F138BE018300CD971CE9867CCDF6B122A5D8E9" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="5 November 2013">Tuesday

Member  for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry) said, it has, if
anything,

the past three years, since the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in
Tunisia, the Arab uprisings have occurred. The stability that
existed—in a sense, it was the stability of the graveyard or the
stability of oppression—under the various dictators in the
region has ended. That has led to an extraordinary period of
uncertainty, with many in the middle east pursuing the noble and
difficult cause of establishing constitutions. In Tunisia, President
Marzouki is involved in the process, in alliance with an Islamic party,
which is in government. Fundamental constitutions are being put
together right across the region. We must not, in any sense,
underestimate the scale of that political task.</hs_Para>

have heard reference to the universal declaration of human rights,
which is central to our debate. This discussion is not just about
Christianity—that is one aspect—but we are also talking
about individual rights and freedom of religion. The irony is that many
of the countries that we have referred to—Egypt, Iran and
Syria—were signatories to the universal declaration of human
rights in 1948. I would like the Minister to confirm that he will
remind the Governments of those countries that they voluntarily
undertook to commit to the obligations under the declaration, and we
want them to adhere to them at this important
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T10:44:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110556000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0001.htm#13110556000050">The
Government have done much positive work in the past two to three years
in the febrile, complex political situation that has followed the Arab
uprising. We commend them on the work they have done on the Arab
Partnership, and I have visited countries across the region—from
Egypt to Tunisia to Iraq—where difficult political situations
are being helped by DFID’s excellent work on the ground to build
support for the difficult process of constitution and politics
building. That is a long-term process, and I can tell the Minister that
the Labour party are certainly committed to it over a long period. This
country has a long constitutional history, and we know from what
happened in 17th-century England that the process following a
revolution and a change of Government is difficult. In the historical
context, it is early days indeed in the middle east.</hs_Para>

know from our postbags, and I certainly know from faith groups and
churches in Wrexham, that there is profound concern about the position
of Christians in the middle east. We have heard from a number of
speakers about the position of Christians across the world generally,
but the difficult political situation in the middle east means that
Christians’ position as a minority, albeit a long-standing and
long-established minority, is a particular threat. At this time, we
must hold fast to the principles that underpin the United Nations and
democracy.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) mentioned Israel, and it is no
coincidence that that country, with its tolerance for religious
minorities, is a democracy. For that reason, we need to commit to
supporting the progress of democracy in the region, even though, as
recent events in Egypt, for example, have shown, that is a difficult
course, which often leads us to take one step forward and two steps
back, making the political situation difficult to
manage.</hs_Para>

this time, through our contact with the middle east, we need to provide
a consistent voice against the oppression of minorities. I stress that
it should be consistent, because it is easy in some respects to
criticise countries with which we do not have strong political
relations—for example, Iran. The criticism of Iran that we have
heard in the debate is fully justified, because individual rights there
must be respected—it one of the signatories to the UN
declaration.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T10:48:45"></hs_TimeCode>, we must
also criticise countries in the region with which we have good
relations and strong commercial bonds. We need to ensure that our voice
is heard loud and clear on individual rights and the oppression of
Christian minorities in those countries.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T10:40:00"></hs_TimeCode> we are not
consistent in our approach with Governments, our voice is diminished.
One criticism that I hear in the middle east is that our
Government—I do not particularly mean this Government, because
this approach has been consistent across Governments over many
years—are quick to criticise our enemies, but slow to criticise
our friends when they
misbehave<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T10:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110556000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0001.htm#13110556000055">We
need a consistent and principled approach, working from the principles
set out in the declaration of human rights, which so many of the
countries in question have signed. I assure the Minister that the
Opposition will support the Government position, if they speak candidly
with a clear voice to countries that oppress religious or political
minorities in the middle east. We see our role as supporting the
Government when they speak candidly for the idea that Governments
should respect human rights. For as long as that is their approach,

of communities that are suffering are Christian. It is right to
continue to highlight that, but also to be concerned with all
persecuted minorities. We want freedom of religion or belief for all: a

effects of the crisis in Syria are particularly on our minds. Life in
Syria for Christians and other minorities continues to be extremely
difficult. We have serious concerns about rising sectarian tension and
believe that President Assad is deliberately attempting to stir up such
tensions in his efforts to hold on to power. Non-Alawite minorities,
including Christian communities, are in a vulnerable position, not only
because of the relatively small size of their communities and their
geographic dispersal, but because they are neither Sunni, like the
majority of the opposition, nor Alawite, like the core of the regime.
The largest Christian communities in the country were in Aleppo and
Homs, where some of the most intense clashes between the regime and the
opposition have happened. We are working hard, with the moderate Syrian
National Coalition, to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict and
to support the building of a Syria that respects the rights of all its
citizens, whatever their race, religion or lack of religion.</hs_Para>

have sought to give them a voice and to pose important questions about
democracy, accountability and integrity, and about the use of
taxpayers’ money. After all, if we cannot challenge those in

why bother serving in Parliament? My challenge to Peterborough city

however, let me say that I am a fan of solar, and that I am a champion
of the technology. As my hon. Friend said, I am strongly committed to
rolling out solar across the UK and to driving down its cost, not only
to eliminate the need for subsidy, but to make it cheaper. In the past
three years, the cost of a set of solar panels on a household roof has
typically fallen from something like £15,000 to
£5,000—that, I think, is how much IKEA are selling them
for—making them much more accessible for a lot of people, and
making them a sensible solution for, potentially, millions of people
who are struggling with high energy bills and are likely to do so in

for many businesses, solar makes a huge amount of sense. I am not only
talking about small arrays. I was in Crewe last month at the Bentley
factory, which was built in the 1930s and helped to build the Spitfires
that fought the battle of Britain. On the roof of that building, there
is a 5 MW array of solar panels, which was fantastic to see. It was
absolutely in the right place, and it was pumping out electricity and
helping that important British manufacturer, just as solar panels are
helping about half a million homes that have them on their roofs. We
want to see a really exciting, ambitious roll-out as the costs come
down, so that it becomes more affordable. This is not only about solar
panels on rooftops and in commercial and industrial spaces; there are
occasions when they make sense on brownfield sites. In Cornwall, there
is an excellent tin mine where a fairly large array has been set up.
That works, and is working well with the community. In Leicestershire,
at Wymeswold, a former air base, another large array works well and has
local support.</hs_Para>

to my hon. Friend that when I hear of monster projects that could turn
a popular, intuitive and increasingly affordable technology into
something that is unpopular and inappropriate, I become very worried
indeed. I am aware that when other renewable technologies have been

inappropriate scale, the tide of public opinion has, in certain areas,
turned away from renewables and the wider environmental question.

bedroom tax was introduced on 1 April this year. The policy was
designed to make more efficient use of our country’s social
housing stock by identifying people who were under-occupying their
homes. Social sector tenants with one spare room face a deduction of
14% in their housing benefit. Those who are under-occupying by two
rooms face a 25%
deduction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110565000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0001.htm#13110565000006">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T14:30:49"></hs_TimeCode>

some of the poorest and most vulnerable groups in our society, while
failing to achieve any of its
aims<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T14:31:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Instead,

irony, of course, is that new homes are exactly what is needed to
tackle overcrowding and create a working housing market; but under this
Government, we have seen the lowest number of housing completions since
the 1920s. That situation will not change as long as the bedroom tax is
in place, rent arrears continue to pile up and local authorities are
constrained in building new

scale of the injustice resulting from the bedroom tax is appalling. The
tax affects an estimated 600,000 people, 96% of whom have no smaller
home to go to, and as a result the average family is losing £720
a year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T14:32:24"></hs_TimeCode>. In my
constituency of South Shields, 1,440 households are affected, with only
387 properties becoming available for them to move into between April
and September this year. Some of those properties are only for people
qualifying for sheltered accommodation, so the reality is that many
households have fewer homes to bid for. The average amount that will be
charged is just under £9 a week for a household deemed to be
under-occupying by one bedroom and just under £15 a week for
those under-occupying by two, yet South Tyneside Homes estimates that
the true value of a spare room is just under £5, as reflected in
the differences in the rents that tenants would
pay<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T14:33:12"></hs_TimeCode>. The bedroom
tax, then, grossly overvalues the price of a spare room and is
overcharging tenants. This is at the same time as we have a
cost-of-living crisis, with food, energy and water prices
surging.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110565000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0001.htm#13110565000009">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T14:33:24"></hs_TimeCode>

South Shields (Mrs Lewell-Buck), who secured this important debate. The
bedroom tax was primarily a savings measure. It was then dressed up, in
some debates, as a way of tackling affordable housing shortages by
making better use of property. However, as my hon. Friend clearly

understanding local housing markets and developing policies appropriate

city, where more than 900 households have been given the second-highest
priority banding because they need two extra 
<?notus-xml column=41?>bedrooms, and about 350 households have the same priority level because
they are homeless and need three-bedroom housing. More than 1,200

intervention on
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T14:57:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for South Shields, I mentioned a DWP Minister’s
suggestion that if councils were struggling with three-bedroom houses
that they could not let, they should have anticipated the problem and
taken steps to divide those houses. I was fantasising slightly about
how that would work. Let us take a typical three up, two down property
in England; in Scotland, we are more likely to be talking about a
tenement flat. What exactly would be involved in dividing it? First,
either the tenants would somehow have to use the same door and stairs,
or the council would have to create a separate entrance, which would
cost money. One of the upstairs rooms would have to be converted into
some form of kitchen, which would cost money. That leaves the
downstairs, which would have a kitchen, but not a bathroom. Where would
the bathroom go, or at least a toilet? A bathroom extension? Remember
there are only two rooms and a kitchen downstairs, so building a
bathroom would not be easy, unless it were built outside, and an
extension costs money. Then I thought, “I know what the Minister
must have had in mind: a portaloo in the back garden.” That
would take us right back to the days when people had outside toilets,
but it might help get the house divided up. It would involve not only
huge additional cost but a style 
<?notus-xml column=42?>of living that I hope most of us would think inappropriate. That shows
how little thought was given in practical reality.</hs_Para>

Many people would find the concept of taking in a lodger extremely
difficult, particularly given the nature of many properties. I visited
a constituent whose kitchen was off the living room, and whose bedrooms
were not particularly big. When someone has a lodger, they are sharing
a house. They are not taking in a lodger who has a self-contained
annexe of the house; they are taking someone into the bosom of their
household. The 60-year-old woman in question felt that that was not
somewhere she needed to be in her

Gilmore:</Member></B> The reality is that people are not taking on
lodgers. The rhetoric on lodgers has quietened down, presumably because
the impracticality of that idea has revealed itself. If the measure was
about making better use of property, it was not the best way of going
about that. It would be far better to encourage people to move in some
circumstances, but that is neither a quick nor an easy process. It has
to be planned for, and that comes back to looking at the nature of the
local housing market and how those moves can be dealt with.</hs_Para>

in larger homes might want to downsize—if they are over
retirement age, they will not be affected by the bedroom tax—but
the bedroom tax will not whip them into wanting to move. Over the
years, I have had many constituents say to me, “Yes, I would
move. The stairs are getting too much for me. The garden is getting too
much for me”, but they want control over where they go, and want
to keep some of the things they like about their present home. Often
that means the area, and that does not necessarily only go for those
who live in what is perceived as a “good area”. Their
area is where they have their social circle, and their family might not
be too far away. There will be many reciprocal family arrangements,
whether that is daughters helping mothers, or mothers helping their
grown-up children with child care and picking kids up from school. All
those sorts of things cannot be done if they are moved to the other end
of town. Okay, they are fussy, but they are fussy because they want the

only in England and Wales, which the Minister is concerned with, but in
Scotland, too. In the whole of Scotland, new starts have dropped from

Gilmore:</Member></B> Indeed. I have some figures, although they take
us only to 2010-11. In 2000-01, the spend on private rented sector
housing benefit was £3.6 billion. By 2010-11, that had risen to
£8.9 billion, and it has risen again since then. The number of
recipients of housing benefit rose under this Government by 326,597
people or households between May 2010 and February 2013. More than
twice as many of those—some 218,209—were in the private
rented sector than were in council and housing association housing. All
the time that the Government have been in power, wringing their hands
about the rising housing benefit bill and saying that measures such as
the bedroom tax are the way to tackle it, the number of recipients has
gone up, and the amount of money we are spending has gone up.</hs_Para>

are not tackling the issue from the right end. If we had a proper
housing investment programme for affordable housing, that would bring
down the housing benefit bill. That is what we should be aiming to do.
It would give many individuals a real incentive and help in getting

a disincentive to employment.</hs_Para>

still had to pay half of that rent from his earnings. In the end, he
gave up his job, partly because of the financial pressures that he was
then under. If he had a council or housing association rented property,
he could have afforded much more easily to get back into work. There
are all sorts of reasons why housing investment is a win-win-win. It is
a win because we would get the houses; because we would begin to reduce

need to look at the fact that the bedroom tax has done the opposite of
that. It has created a situation where both councils and housing
associations are anxious about the loss of income. It matters to all
tenants, because all tenants are being impacted on, not just those
affected by the bedroom tax. I made that point to a Government Minister
recently, and pointed out that even pensioners and tenants who are not
on housing benefit are being affected by the bedroom tax. The response
I got—they had half-heard the question—was, “But
pensioners are not affected.” That was not my point. My point
was that if the landlord, be it the council or the housing association,
has less income coming in, that will affect all the other tenants,
because that organisation will have only a few choices. It could cut
back on its modernisation programme, and that would affect pensioners
who have been waiting for many years, as many of my constituents have,
for their kitchens and bathrooms to be modernised. They would have to
wait even more

stated aim of the under-occupancy penalty, to give it the
Government’s preferred name, was to free up larger
accommodation, and to cut the housing benefit bill by moving people
into smaller properties. Well, the policy has not released larger
accommodation; nor will it save the housing benefit it set out to save.
Instead it will, as we have heard, drive people into the private rented
sector and add to costs.
Just<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T15:16:58"></hs_TimeCode> where are
local authorities and housing associations to find the smaller
accommodation? The truth is that it could take years to place people in
smaller homes, and that is assuming that no one’s circumstances
change.</hs_Para>

Scotland, the UK Government’s changes to housing benefit have
had a significant impact on claimants. The people affected by the
changes are those with specially adapted homes to reflect their health
conditions; separated parents, who potentially face losing access to
their children; and tenants who are struggling to find alternative
smaller accommodation, despite being willing to
move<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T15:17:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110565000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0002.htm#13110565000095">All
the under-occupancy charge has done in my constituency is bring people
to the verge of crisis. Many are building up arrears, trying somehow to
cope using discretionary housing payments, while others are desperately
trying to find smaller accommodation. All that worry and panic is
despite the best efforts of the housing associations and the council in
Inverclyde. Advice agencies are also working together to reassure and
help<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T15:17:58"></hs_TimeCode> people. I
recognise the assistance given by the Scottish Government to alleviate
the cost of this penalty, although more could always be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T15:18:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110565000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0002.htm#13110565000096">The
panic and fear instilled in our most vulnerable people is evidenced by
Citizens Advice Scotland, which advised on almost 20,000 new housing
benefit issues in 2012-13. That is about 75 per working day—an
11% increase on the previous year. However, there was a 40% increase in
April 2013 compared with April 2012. Those increases can all be
explained by the introduction of the new under-occupancy rules. In the
first week after the start of the bedroom tax, 700 affected tenants
approached Citizens Advice Scotland for advice. That is not to mention
the numbers of worried, concerned and frightened people who visited my
surgeries—and yes, I concede that many were
exempt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T15:19:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

concern about the housing supply relates to adapted homes. If people
who have adapted their homes to cater for their disability by
installing step-in showers or wet rooms decide to move rather than
incur the penalty, they will need to reinstall these adaptations in
their new home, at significant cost. Surely it cannot be seen as an
effective way of spending time and resources to move people out of
homes that meet their needs into new homes that do not, and that must
subsequently be adapted. It is a crazy situation, and the cost is
getting out of control. It is short-sighted, and an unbelievable waste,
as it costs the taxpayer more money, never mind the upheaval for the
individuals
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T15:19:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110565000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0002.htm#13110565000098">The
vast majority of those affected in my constituency will be moving from
two-bedroom to one-bedroom accommodation, if they can. That is being
replicated throughout Scotland and the rest of the UK. Of the 105,000
households in Scotland affected by the under-occupancy penalty, an
estimated 83,000 include an adult with a recognised disability. The
proposed changes will therefore have a disproportionate impact on
people with disabilities. Many of those tenants have severe health
conditions and face reductions in income that could affect their
health. Adapted housing will be affected. Estimates show that some
16,000 households have some form of aid or adaptation already in place.
I acknowledge that the UK Government have increased the fund for
discretionary housing payments, but the funding is still far below the
level of payments that will be lost by
claimants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T15:20:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110565000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0002.htm#13110565000099"><Member ContinuationText="Dr Eilidh Whiteford" PimsId="5544" UID="13110565000313" xid="1003" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0002.htm#13110565000313"><B>Dr

by the National Housing Federation found that if the additional funding
were to be distributed equally among every affected claimant of
disability living allowance, they would each receive just £2.51
per week, compared with the average £11-a-week loss in housing
benefit in Scotland. The pressure to find smaller homes and flats has
become immense. In Inverclyde, there is a huge lack of one-bedroom
accommodation. I ask the Minister: what are my constituents to do? Many
will fall into arrears. Housing associations warned the Government from
the start that the under-occupancy penalty would not work, and that
families would face financial hardship and struggle to make ends
meet.</hs_Para>

is certainly true not only in Scotland but across the country. People
cannot move to smaller homes to avoid the bedroom tax because there are
not enough smaller properties. In Inverclyde, I could count on one hand
the streets, outwith the private sector, that offer single-bedroom
accommodation.</hs_Para>

used to be. By the way, I was brought up on a council house estate. It
was a 
<?notus-xml column=50?>stable area, with a mix of people from working-class and upper
working-class backgrounds and those who were almost middle class, who
had been there for a long time. They were the sort of people who had
seen their children move on, but still lived in three-bedroom houses,
and who provide for such estates the anchor and stability that we think
are so important; yet the Government want them to move on. I understand
that the technical term is “forced decanting”, which is
very

the short time available to me, I want to point out that we might be

studying for their GCSEs to share their bedroom with a crying toddler,

exacerbating the housing crisis that we face. The Government are in

chronic housing shortage is clear for all to see and the Government are

soon as they took office, they cut the affordable homes budget by 60%.
Home ownership is falling and private rents are soaring. Five million
people are on the waiting list for social housing, and homelessness and
rough sleeping have both risen by more than a third since the general

about making the best use of the social housing stock; it is about
saving money, and it is questionable whether it will do that. Indeed,
it is making the poorest people across our country even poorer and
costing an average family £720 a year. On the same day that the
tax came into force, every millionaire in the country got an average
tax cut of more than a hundred

for housing associations. A survey by the National Housing Federation
found that a quarter of households affected have fallen behind in their
rent for the first time ever. Such arrears have major consequences for
house building, too, and they are jeopardising the ability of housing
associations to borrow, plan for the future and, ultimately, build more

rent arrears for councils and housing associations and of the impact

homes that we so desperately need? How many homes are standing empty
across the country because of this failed policy, and how many councils
have received permission from the Minister’s Department to draw
money from the housing revenue account to protect the most vulnerable?
I understand why they want to protect the most vulnerable from the
impact of the policy, but, as several of my hon. Friends have said,
that is having an impact on the money that they are able to spend on

Labour party proposes to build. I presume that the money will come out
of bankers’ bonuses at some point. I realise that after some 13
years in government and the many decades since Macmillan was in power,
we have never actually hit the figure of 240,000 houses. I am not sure
how Labour will pay for them. Perhaps we have a common aspiration to

no crisis. Just to provide some clarification and so that this myth
does not continue, I will say that I was asked about a housing bubble
in London and whether or not there was a crisis, and there is not. I
actually used the backing of the Governor of the Bank of England, who
says there is no housing bubble, and that was what I was specifically
referring to. Also, the Chancellor has put in place the means to
intervene on any of the measures that we have in place, through the

issue that has come out in the debate is the comparison between,

There is a need to save money. We inherited a bill that had doubled to
some £24 billion by the time we came to power, and it was
important that we addressed it because we ended up with a deficit where
we were spending—in fact,

topics<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:00:10"></hs_TimeCode> this
afternoon. The first is the funding provided by central Government to
the region’s accident and emergency departments, particularly in
the south Tees area. The second is the funding of the North East
Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, and the rising use and cost of
private ambulances. The third is the ongoing Monitor investigations
into the two foundation trusts—the South Tees Hospitals NHS
Foundation Trust and the Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation
Trust—that serve my constituents. Finally, I will seek
reassurance from the Minister on future funding allocations to
north-east clinical commissioning
groups<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:00:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110565000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0002.htm#13110565000187">Over
the past 18 months, the accident and emergency department at James Cook
university hospital, which serves my constituency, has come under
particular pressure. In the run-up to winter last year, there were
problems with handover times; ambulances and paramedics waited up to
two and a half hours to admit patients, despite the national target
time being 15 minutes. I raised that last year with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:00:55"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of
State for Health, who agreed that the situation was completely
unacceptable, and I raised it with the
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:01:06"></hs_TimeCode> on 13
February 2013 in a Westminster Hall debate on A and E provision in the
north-east. In addition to the issues that I raised with the Secretary
of State, it has become evident that the James Cook hospital’s A
and E department struggled to manage with the pressure caused by
winter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:01:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110565000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/halltext/131105h0002.htm#13110565000188">In
January and February 2013, the South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation
Trust failed to meet its target of seeing 95% of A and E patients
within four hours. With James Cook hospital so clearly overstretched, I
admit that I was surprised to discover in September 2013 that the
Secretary of State decided not to award it, or any hospital trust in
the north-east, funding to alleviate the pressure on A and E
departments. It is beyond belief that, of the £250 million
awarded by the Secretary of State between 53 trusts, not a penny will
reach the north-east, particularly as we live in a region that suffers
from some of England’s harshest winter weather and has some of
the harshest local government cuts in the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:02:04"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope
that the Minister reconsiders that allocation, or at the very least

letter shows that there will be more cuts, more private ambulances and
possibly a less responsive service. It is not me saying that, but the
chief operating officer of the North East Ambulance
Service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:04:11"></hs_TimeCode>. The
figures are stark. In 2008-09, 865 call-outs were attended by private
ambulances in our region, costing £86,000. In 2009-10, some
1,816 call-outs were attended by private ambulances, costing
£151,000. In 2010-11, however, 6,429 call-outs were attended by
private ambulances, costing £477,000, which is a huge jump. In
2011-12, there were 9,000 call-outs attended by private ambulances,
costing £639,000. In 2012-13, 13,524 call-outs were attended by
private ambulances, costing
£754,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:04:54"></hs_TimeCode>.
So since 2010, there has been a fivefold increase in private ambulance
costs in the north-east, with the funds going to private contract
firms. It is obvious that from 2010 onwards, there has been an
explosion of private ambulance usage by the trust, costing a huge
amount of taxpayers’ funds. The chief executive

third issue of particular concern to my constituents is that both the
NHS trusts that serve them—the South Tees Hospitals NHS

the past 12 months. Since May 2010, the South Tees trust has failed on
seven occasions to meet its referral-to-treatment target, most recently
between March and August. That has resulted in the Monitor
investigation, because the trust has failed to ensure that 90% of
patients commence treatment within 18 weeks of referral. Furthermore,
there has been an increase in reported “never” events at
the trust, and an increase in the incidence of clostridium

for deprivation as a factor in health care funding, but the decision is

The original single bore Victorian tunnels were replaced in 1953 by a
new tunnel when the line was electrified. In the 1960s, National Grid
bought the Victorian tunnels and installed high voltage cables to
transmit electricity. When the line finally closed in 1981, National
Grid purchased the modern tunnel with a view of installing new cables
in the modern tunnel and abandoning the Victorian tunnels when cables
needed renewing some  30 years
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110571000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/wmstext/131105m0001.htm#13110571000137">In

2007-08 Ministers received many representations urging them to protect
the Woodhead tunnels so that the Woodhead route could be reopened to
rail traffic in the future. There was no case then for taking any steps
to halt National Grid’s plan but Ministers did agree  to
consider, at the appropriate time, whether or not to instigate an
inspection and maintenance regime on the Victorian tunnels This would
leave open the option to 
<?notus-xml column=12?>move cables back into the Victorian tunnels and reuse the modern tunnel

Government have committed funding to the northern hub programme. This
includes schemes to increase capacity and line speeds on the Hope
valley route. A study recently carried out by Network Rail indicates
that demand for travel between Manchester and Sheffield could more than
double in  30 years. With the planned investment, the Hope
valley line and its trains could accommodate this growth. If freight
grows, schemes have also been identified which could enable more
freight trains to

Robertson:</Member></B> We are deeply concerned at the treatment of
minority religious groups in Egypt. On 20 October four
Coptic Christians were killed, and many injured at a Coptic Christian
wedding in Cairo. This was the latest incident in a trend of violence
against religious minorities across Egypt. On 21 October our ambassador
to Egypt wrote to the Coptic Pope to offer his condolences and a senior
Foreign and Commonwealth Office official contacted the head of the
Coptic Church in the UK to express our sympathy. The Secretary of State
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member
for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague), has publicly condemned all
acts of violence. We recently encouraged the committee tasked with
drafting Egypt's new constitution to ensure stronger protection under
the rule of law for all citizens.</hs_Para>

source of concern. On 23 October during the UN General Assembly the UK

This includes an estimate that the annual productivity benefits to the

matter for the independent economic and safety regulator, the Office of
Rail Regulation (ORR). ORR assumes an efficient level of expenditure
for each of Network Rail's regulated activities to deliver the outputs
required by the Government and to maintain and improve the safety and
reliability of the railway. It is then for Network Rail to decide how
it manages its business within the overall framework specified by ORR
and to determine the staff it needs to carry out its work effectively.
ORR holds Network Rail to account and can take enforcement action if
the company fails to deliver its regulated outputs.</hs_Para>

National Crime Agency (NCA) is accountable to the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State has a legal duty under the Crime and Courts Act
2013 (“the Act”) to determine the ‘strategic
priorities’ for the National Crime Agency, in consultation with
the Director General of the NCA and with the NCA's strategic partners
(as set out in the Act). The Director General of the NCA determines the
operational priorities for the agency. These are determined in
consultation with the NCA's strategic partners. Both the strategic and
operational 
<?notus-xml column=117?>priorities for the NCA are published in the NCA Annual Plan, which is
available on the NCA
website:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13110584001154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/text/131105w0001.htm#13110584001154">http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news-media/publications/33-nca-annual-plan-2013-14/file</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13110584000363" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/text/131105w0001.htm#13110584000363">The

flexibly to meet priorities as and when they
arise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110584000364" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131105/text/131105w0001.htm#13110584000364">The
first and highest strategic priority for the NCA set by the Secretary
of State is the identification and disruption of serious and organised
crime, including by investigating and enabling the prosecution of those
responsible for child sexual exploitation. NCA officers have a legal

their welfare, and all NCA officers will be trained in child

£463 million, £422 million is provided directly from the
Home Office and the rest comprises funding for specific work (for
example on cyber crime and overseas capacity building). Within this,

have increased capacity to deal with complex cases, drawing on the

CEOP's frontline operational services will also have more resilience as

Eustice:</Member></B> No. As the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
Select Committee concluded in their recent pre-legislative scrutiny of
the draft Wild Animals in Circuses Bill, extending the scope of the
Bill, to include areas such as transportation, would introduce greater
restrictions on ownership than are intended. The Bill is focused on the
use of the animals not their ownership. The Government agrees that, in
the absence of any welfare issues, which can already be dealt with by
existing welfare legislation, further restrictions on wild animals in
circuses could amount to a <I>de facto</I> restriction on

Government's commitment to the annual retail prices index cap means
that there has been no real terms increase in business rates since
1990. We have also taken a number of steps on business rates. We have:
temporarily doubled the level of small business rate relief for a
further year—making three and a half years in total—so
that the higher level of relief will apply throughout 2013-14;
announced a new measure which will mean that empty new builds will be
exempt from empty property rates for up to 18 months up to state aid
limits between 1 October 2013 and 31 October 2016; simplified the
process for claiming small business rate relief by removing red tape;
introduced business rate relief in the Enterprise Zones; waived
£175 million of backdated business rates demands levied on
businesses, including some in ports; and given local authorities wide
ranging, discretionary powers to grant business rates

funding transferred to English local authorities and the Scottish and

allowance and jobseeker's allowance at the same time. Where a claimant
has been found fit for work following a Work Capability Assessment, the
decision is binding on the decision maker for all benefits, including
jobseeker's allowance. Where such decisions are made, the Department
advises the claimant and the GP that medical evidence is no longer
required, as benefit entitlement is based on a functional assessment
carried out by a health care professional, rather than on the basis of
a fit note from the doctor. Consequently a person with a fit note could
be eligible for jobseeker's allowance if the conditions of entitlement
are met.</hs_Para>

availability of needs assessments and support for parent-carers of
disabled children, working with other Government Departments. The
Department is satisfied that there is a strong framework of support in
place. There already exists legislation to assess parent-carers' needs
within the Children Act 1989 in so far as it meets the needs of
individual children in need. Local authorities can provide services to
the family members of a child in need with a view to safeguarding or
promoting the child's

disabled children. This includes committing over £800 million
for local authorities to invest in short breaks for both the disabled
children and their carers between April 2011 and March 2015 through
unringfenced grants, backed by new duties introduced in 2011. The
reforms outlined in the Children and Families Bill, along with wider
reforms in education and health, will strengthen the current system
further for children and young people with special educational needs

on supporting disabled children and their families lies clearly with
the Department for Education. This includes policy in relation to
parent carers of disabled children. A key principle of the Children Act
1989 is that children are best looked after within their families.
Under the Act, local authorities are required to provide services for
children in need for the purposes of safeguarding and promoting their
welfare. Statutory guidance makes it clear that in assessments, local
authorities should also look at the parent or carer's capacity to meet
the needs of the disabled child.</hs_Para>

from 21 July 2010 the Health and Social Care Information Centre has
published provisional monthly NHS workforce data. As expected with
provisional statistics, some figures may be revised from month to month
as issues are uncovered and resolved. The monthly workforce data is not
directly comparable with the annual workforce census; it only includes
those staff on the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) (i.e. it does not
include Primary care staff or Bank staff). There are also new methods
of presenting data (headcount methodology is different and there is now
a role count). This information is available from September 2009
onwards at the following

unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed.
