deal first with my noble friend’s final point. Of course we
share those sentiments; the children have suffered greatly. One million
children have been displaced in this conflict. We are hoping that the
transitional governing body established by the 2012 Geneva
communiqué, which is to be agreed by mutual consent, would have
full executive powers, including over security, military and
intelligence structures. In terms of the actual format for the
conference, another meeting is scheduled on 20 December and will be UN
mediated. After that, the actual meeting, which takes place in January,
will include the UN as the key mediator and single delegations from
both the existing Syrian regime and the Syrian
opposition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Bach" PimsId="3838" UID="13112849000165" xid="1063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000165">Lord
Bach (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the Secretary-General’s
announcement this week is good news, and the involvement of all
relevant parties, including the Syrian national coalition, is obviously
essential. However,  22 January is still eight weeks away and
action on the humanitarian front is, as the Government agree, needed
now. Will the Government renew their public support 
<?notus-xml column=1506?>for our colleague and noble friend Lady Amos’s plea this week to
all sides to agree to an immediate pause in
hostilities in Muadhamiya and other suburbs of Damascus, so that

have been under siege for many months now and where snipers are
reported to be deliberately targeting pregnant women?</hs_para>

support the quest of the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, to ask all sides in
the conflict, the existing regime and the opposition, to open all
corridors, as they have previously agreed to do. We and all members of
the P5—including the Russians, with the existing
regime—keep imploring all sides that UN humanitarian relief must
be taken in. As the noble Lord and the House will be aware, the UK is
leading the way in humanitarian relief. Indeed, we have committed
almost half a billion pounds to relieve the plight of refugees in the
Syrian
conflict<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T11:10:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Williams of Crosby" PimsId="4612" UID="13112849000167" xid="1846" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000167">Baroness

raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bach, would the Government consider
approaching those who will be attending the Geneva conference with the
specific request that there should be a demand for a peace truce
between now and the conference taking place, in an appropriate period
over Christmas? Further, can the Minister say anything about the
neighbouring countries of the Middle East? For example, will the Saudi
Arabians be represented at this conference, and will
Iran?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon" PimsId="5907" UID="13112849000168" xid="2117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000168">Lord
Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> On the first part of my noble
friend’s question, as I have said, at every point in time the
British Government, the UN and everyone working on the ground and
through political dialogue have been encouraging the opening up of
humanitarian corridors and that peace and ceasefire prevail. We will
continue to do that in the intervening period. On her point about who
will be attending this conference, as I said, a meeting is scheduled on
20 December at which the agreement on the format of the meeting and who
will be attending will be made. On her final point about Iran, of
course we welcomed the decision made earlier this week. However, before
any step forward, Iran must commit itself to the Geneva
communiqué—which, as my noble friend knows, calls for a
negotiated political settlement between the Assad regime and the
opposition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T11:11:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Anderson of Swansea" PimsId="4901" UID="13112849000169" xid="1895" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000169">Lord

in respect of participation, but is it also the Government’s

would be inappropriate for me to commit. I have already indicated that
there is a meeting on 20 December at which the agenda for
the 22 January talks will be determined. As for whether Bashar Assad
will still be in office at the end of this process, I merely remind
noble Lords that the Geneva communiqué 
<?notus-xml column=1507?>calls for agreement to be reached by mutual consent. Our view is
that, from their perspective on mutual consent, the
opposition do not perceive that Bashar Assad will be part of that

reassurance that this was born not out of an understandable desperation
and frustration, but that there is a real and clear diplomatic plan for
progress. Am I right in assuming that the Free Syrian Army, which is

the date for Geneva II was set, and I am the sure that the whole House

Dobbs (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, sometimes in diplomacy we have to
do things that we find unpalatable. While we wish the Geneva II talks
well, they face formidable obstacles; they may not even take place. If
they do, they will certainly not give us everything that we want. There
has to be a plan B. Can my noble friend assure us that, as much as we
find the Assad regime repulsive and reprehensible, there may be
elements of it to which we need to continue to talk? The slaughter of
tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children is a shame on our
world and we should leave no door permanently locked in our attempt to
bring it to an
end.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000014"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon" PimsId="5907" UID="13112849000174" xid="2117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000174">Lord
Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, on my noble friend’s
final point, I am sure that the whole House shares that sentiment.
There are 6.5 million internally displaced people. The UN estimates
that by the end of this year there will be 3 million refugees. We
should also look at the neighbouring countries. I visited the Zaatari
camp in Jordan, which is now the fourth-largest city in Jordan. There
is a desperate humanitarian crisis. We should all welcome the Geneva
talks, as we all do. On my noble friend’s first point, Geneva II
is the start of a process, not a single event. As he will appreciate,
an agreement will take considerable time and effort. That is why it is
important to have both the Syrian opposition and a delegation from the
existing regime present. That, indeed, is going to
happen.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_28_PT_1/F10608BB1550D67425DC52711BE923A0D955FDCB" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 November 2013">Thursday,

barriers to prosecuting cases of female

and pressure from family and the wider community, lead to many cases

welcome news that there is very likely to be a prosecution, but we have
to put this in the context that this practice has been illegal for more
than a decade, an estimated 60,000 women in this country have suffered
this barbaric practice and 30,000 young children may be at risk of it.
I fear that we may be dealing with a cultural tradition. I know that
this is a very difficult and sensitive subject, but there is no
supporting medical or religious evidence for this practice. Therefore,
we have to assume that we have perhaps been afraid of offending at the
temple of cultural diversity. If at this very moment, for that reason,
a woman is descending on some young girl with a razor blade to slice
off her external genitalia, we have to ask ourselves: is this a price
worth paying for cultural
diversity?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000017"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13112849000178" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000178"><B>Lord

This is essentially a hearts and minds issue. The noble Lord identified
that correctly. However, there is no lack of determination as far as
the Government are concerned. My colleague in the Home Office, Norman
Baker, is having a meeting on 5 December with the Crown Prosecution
Service. The Health Minister, Jane Ellison, is having a meeting on

my attention from Kuria East, where a law against FGM has been passed
only recently, and yet eight people are awaiting trial. A girl of 13
called Esther was mutilated by a circumciser at the request of her
parents. She haemorrhaged so badly that her parents took her to
hospital. They were arrested, charged and prosecuted. They were both
sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. The circumciser now

agree with the noble Baroness that it would be one way of impressing on

Ignoring for today, at least, the big issues of the currency and NATO
membership, and drilling down on to this issue of EU membership, will
my noble and learned friend consider the topical and very recent
comments of the Spanish Prime Minister on Scotland’s EU

dance to the tune of the president of Scotland—that was his

follows.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000063">“In
accordance with the notice I gave to the House yesterday afternoon, I
have this morning made a Written Statement to this House announcing
that Sir Cyril Chantler will carry out an independent review of the
evidence for the impact of standardised tobacco packaging on health.
Tobacco use, especially among children, remains one of our most
significant public health challenges. Each year in England more than
300,000 children under the age of 16 try smoking for the
first time. Most adults who smoke started before 18 years of age. As a
result, we must do all we can to stop young people taking up smoking in
the first place if we are to reduce smoking
rates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000064">We
have listened to the strong views expressed on all sides of this House,
including when we debated standardised packaging in the Back-Bench
business debate earlier this month. Many Members have told me that the
evidence base for standardised packaging continues to grow and have
urged the Government to take action. As a result, I believe that the
time is right to seek an independent view on whether the introduction
of standardised packaging is likely to have an effect on public health.
In particular, I want to know about the likely impact on young
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000065">I
have asked Sir Cyril to undertake a focused review, reporting in March
next year. It will be entirely independent, with an independent
secretariat. He is free to draw evidence from whatever source he
considers necessary and appropriate. It will be up to Sir Cyril to
determine how he undertakes the review, and he will set this out in
more detail in due course. As this House will know, Sir Cyril has
confirmed that he has no links with the tobacco industry. The review is
not a public consultation. The Government ran a full public
consultation in 2012, and these responses will be available for the
review. To maximise transparency, the department will also publish the
substantive responses received as soon as possible. The Government will
also take advantage of the opportunity offered by the Children and
Families Bill and will table a government amendment to provide a

We said in July that we would keep the policy under active review,
which is exactly what we have done. I cannot answer for any cynical
attitudes on the Benches opposite, but that is the truth. More
crucially, since then, the academics, led by the University of
Stirling, who carried out the systematic review of the evidence on
standardised packaging that was published alongside the 2012
consultation have updated their work. Their original report covered 37

broadcast media have been around in one form or another since the
creation of the British Broadcasting Company in 1922. Since then there
have been many forks in the road, all of which were initially met with
portents of gloom and predictions of doom. That will not be the nature
of my speech today. It is proving to be a remarkably agile and
resilient industry. First, there was the BBC. Next came the creation of
Independent Television in 1955, and that first introduction of
competition had a profound impact on broadcasting. Not only did the
British public lose Grace Archer—the fact that “The
Archers” still exists shows the resilience of the
genre—the BBC lost its captive audience and large numbers of
viewers deserted it. It had to learn to connect and it did. It did not

the Independent Broadcasting Authority decided that independent TV
companies—in those days raking in the money—should spend
a proportion on public service broadcasting, so that was enhanced. BBC2
was increased and Channel 4, with its mission to speak for minorities
and minority tastes, in parallel with the independent production
sector, was created—such a successful part of our creative
industries and now worth £2.5 billion a year. At that point, we
entered a wonderful world of plurality and diversity. Of course, the
window of competition that the BBC now has means that 25% of its
programmes have to be commissioned from independent production
companies. This purely terrestrial world was further enhanced by the
advent of subscription channels such as Sky, and then came the internet

I said earlier, many of those innovations seemed to suggest the end of

channels were doomed, the viewing of live telly was over and that the
future was all catch-up and on demand. Last Saturday—I have to
admit I was one of them—an average of 10.2 million people
watched “Doctor Who” on the BBC, and 7.7 million tuned
into “The X Factor” on ITV. New media—the social
networks—have led to a return to live viewing and people watch
and interact with each other at the same time. There is a premium on

and indirectly. They invest in home-grown content—£3.3
billion-worth last year—and while non-PSBs have increased their

for high-end TV and animation has enhanced the potential for economic
growth in these sectors. Indeed, Aardman, the creators of Wallace and

However, for this to happen, it needs the right support. One of the
most important things is that we continue to create the creators. In
this area, we face not a jobs problem but a skills problem. In a recent

35%. These are not only efficiency savings but a deep cut. It will

Those of us who know the business, know that freelancers are the
life-blood of the broadcasting industry. It is also a bad signal to
other television companies. I fear the response will be: “The

there is no sign of a retreat. Perhaps it would not be too bold to

global, sets something of an example to the rest.

difficult competitive market in the USA and in the UK, where the two
big beasts—the BBC and Sky—exercise such a powerful

long-term future. I certainly hope so and intend to 
<?notus-xml column=1524?>support it in seeking a secure future. It is not easy to fit the BBC
into the framework suggested by the title of this Motion. Profit and

my own experience, I will mention the initiatives that Sky Arts is
energetically pursuing on its two channels. It is remarkably ambitious
to set up channels devoted solely to the arts, and in a country such as
ours the prospects look good. This public service incentive continues
in the building of skills studios in four UK cities for young people in
our schools; in scholarship schemes to provide mentoring and
substantial financial support for young talent in the arts as well as
sport; and on television itself. The Sky Academy for sport and the
arts, mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter, is now
powering into literally thousands of schools, which benefit greatly
from this direct contact with practitioners in the field, especially as
it is happening in areas that are increasingly underresourced by

short, broadcasting is one of the most serious, successful and
ebullient businesses that we have. But behind all this, to make it
happen, we have to nurture our start-up talent. At the moment we do: in
many sports, as proved in the Olympics; in the sciences, where in the
list of original contributions to world scientific papers we come
second only to America and are comfortably ahead of China, which is
third; and in the arts, where London vies with any other capital for
the crown of the cultural cauldron of the world; and in the rest of the

all these examples and more, we prove that we can act with intelligence

opportunities and guidance. I would also suggest that the quality of
many of the television and radio programmes that  we make feeds

<?notus-xml column=1525?>films, musicals, literature and all the other arts. There is at present
a flourishing virtuous circle. It is tempting to think that this is
because we have some God-given gift of creativity
in the British genes. Not so, I am afraid. What we have had, and still
just have, are exceptionally good traditional learning colleges,
designated schools and teachers, and several ways of training young
people to a high level so that, once well nurtured, their own nature

this, but it is a change in the cast of thought of the Government that
is most needed. Only by enabling imagination to be ready for take-off
can the creative economy, in which the broadcasting economy plays such
a major part, maintain the strong surge that has made it so successful
over the past few decades. This has to be done quickly and with vigour.
Without the teaching of fundamental techniques, this vibrant part of
our economic, cultural and personal life will begin to deteriorate. We
must not let that happen—we must not see another great British
industry be allowed, for lack of fundamental attention, to sink into
decline.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_28_PT_1/18CC1932B0622722000F358E008184D0FFF74200" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 November 2013">Thursday,

Holmes of Richmond (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is an incredible
privilege for me to stand here today, not least to follow the noble
Lord, Lord Bragg, who is without question a broadcasting colossus. It
is incredible for someone of my background to arrive in your
Lordships’ House but the warmth of the welcome and the advice
and wisdom I have had since even before my introduction have been quite
extraordinary. As well as the warmth of the welcome from Black Rod and
his staff, from the Clerk of the Parliaments—a broadcasting
“Mastermind” in his own right and a mine of tremendous
information—and all staff, police and everybody around the
House, there has been such advice and support, and more than just a
little adoration of the
Labrador.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000123">I
feel moved to speak on this area having been involved in broadcasting
for many years through my involvement with the British swimming team,
which started when I was still a young man. Having said that, my guide

sincerely my supporters, my noble friends Lord Baker and Lord Deighton,
the former always an education, and the latter my boss at LOCOG who so
supremely steered us to such a success at last summer’s Olympic
and Paralympic Games. I also thank noble friends for their wisdom. A
couple of weeks ago, I spoke to a noble friend and said, “It
seems like we are in for a number of votes this evening”. He
said, “No, don’t worry: I poked my head into the Chamber
and do not think there will be any votes tonight”. I was left
thinking, “How long will it take me to gain that wisdom and
expertise, to just be able to poke my head in and know that there would
be no votes?”. Minutes later, the ringing of the Division Bell
gave me my
answer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000125">As I
said, when I was a young man I joined the Great Britain Paralympic
swimming team and started my connection with UK broadcasters as an
interviewee, interviewer and, later, as a presenter and sometime
pundit. That started slowly. In Seoul in 1988, when I was 16, there was
very little coverage by the broadcasters of the Paralympic Games. Four
years later, in Barcelona, there was not much more: just a couple of
highlights programmes long after we had come back to these shores. I
remember a radio interview in Barcelona after my final race. I got out
of the pool; the radio interviewer was in the studio in London so I put
the headphones on and could hear him talking. He said, “We are
going to Barcelona now to join Chris Holmes. So Chris, tell me what it
is like competing in a wheelchair”. I had no time to think at
all. I said, “Well, as I can’t see very much, pretty
dangerous”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000126">Fortunately,
in the intervening 20 years the expertise and broadcast coverage of the
Paralympics has increased exponentially, culminating in last
summer’s coverage by Channel 4, to which the noble Baroness has
already alluded. That was quite sensational: 150 hours of coverage at
Games time, pretty much all day, every day, and much of it live. What a
difference that made. As a 16 year-old in Seoul, I could not have
possibly imagined that all the UK broadcasters would vie to cover the
Paralympic Games in London. It was a superb tender process to be
involved with, alongside my noble friends Lord Coe and Lord Deighton.
All of them would have done a great job. The reason Channel 4 got
across the line was its commitment to promoting Paralympic values,
Paralympic sport and the Paralympians, right from the moment it signed
the contract. It was sensational, with the largest marketing campaign
it had ever engaged in, larger than for More4 or the launch of Film4,
and mainstreaming Paralympic coverage through all its flagship
programmes, not least Jon Snow’s fantastic championing of the
Games on “Channel 4
News”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000127">Then
there was the 90-second film we made with Channel 4, “Meet the
Superhumans”. It was absolutely sensational. It aired on 17 July
last year simultaneously at 9 pm on 76 UK TV channels. I have to
confess that I had no idea that there were 76 UK TV channels;
apparently there are, and more; but what a moment for the broadcaster
to blast into people’s consciousness. It did such a great job at
Games time not just by coverage, but by enabling more people fully to
experience  
<?notus-xml column=1527?>the Games through innovations such as audio description, and by half of
the on-screen talent being disabled people—ground-breaking
stuff.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112849000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112849000128">I knew
that we had to sell all the tickets and get large broadcast deals right
around the world if we were to put the Games on a new level. Although
it would be lovely to have a ticket to sport, people  largely
consume it through the broadcasters. There were 15,000 lucky
ticket-holders on Centre Court for Murray’s final at the All
England Club earlier this year; there were 17 million of us on the edge
of our sofas roaring him home to victory. The same goes for the Olympic
and Paralympic Games: the number consuming sport by the broadcasters
was 40 million on Channel 4, 51 million for the Olympic Games on the
Beeb. That is the key. Sport has such potential. When it is put through
the lens of sports broadcasts, that potential is multiplied by the
millions. Take the World Cup in 1966, Wimbledon 2013 and the Olympic
Games 2012. What magical moments as sporting memories brought to us by
the broadcasters, with the power to inspire, excite, delight and
sometimes, just sometimes, with the power—Jesse Owens in 1936,
the Paralympic Games 2012—to change us as individuals, as

Addington (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great privilege and
honour to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Holmes, on his maiden
speech. When I heard that he was coming here, I was not surprised, not
only because of his great prowess as a Paralympian and international
sportsman but because of his work as a commissioner for the Disability
Rights Commission, where I first met him. I recognised then that he was
somebody capable of taking issues and driving something

for his sporting triumphs, if he wore all his medals, he would sink in
a pool, he has been so successful. It is quite remarkable. However, I
will set a new precedent: I will tell him off slightly while paying
tribute to him. Where was he when the Lords were against the Commons
swimming last night? My noble friend Lord Paddick won, but he might not
have had the noble Lord been there. The noble Lord made a wonderful
maiden speech and will make a great contribution in future. He has a
grounding in many of the fields that we need in this Chamber. We can
look forward to many great contributions from him. I am glad to say
that he is my noble friend—certainly at the moment—and I
look forward to many of his other speeches. We have a good’un

I turn to the subject of the importance of the broadcasting media to
our economy, I have one problem. What part of life in our society is
not affected by  the broadcast media? None. It is difficult to
remove the broadcast media from other parts of our economy. The way we
market, the way we access, the way we 
<?notus-xml column=1528?>inform and the way we discuss comes through the media. It is now almost
impossible in our society to remove yourself from the broadcast media.
Increasingly, they take over virtually all the roles that the
newspapers used to have. Indeed, the newspapers are also rapidly
becoming part of the broadcast media. How do we define or separate
those media in themselves? I come to the conclusion that we
cannot.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112850000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000004">When
we talk about the media, what do we expect to get from them? What
contribution do we expect them to make? Once again, those questions run
into each other because the entertainment world, which they represent,
and the information world are so integrated in everything else. How do
we maintain that? As other noble Lords have pointed out—the
noble Lord, Lord Bragg, made a great point of this— we must look
to the investment in the fundamentals, such as people and technology.
The Government clearly have a role here, if only in providing the right
training and skills base to be able to invest. If you do not have
that  skills base and training at all levels, how will we get
the technician level—the graduates and trainees—in place
to be used? We have another debate on apprenticeships later and we
could actually discuss this then. The BBC has been mentioned, and
probably will be mentioned again a lot in this debate. How do we have
the infrastructure in which there is, for example, that great driving
engine to ensure that we have a standard up to which our media have to
come?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112850000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000005">I
cannot see any way in which we could describe the BBC other than as the
setter of standards for the broadcast media in this country. It is the
control— the thing which we are balanced by. We find
ourselves saying, “Yes, this is something which you must aspire
at least to match in terms of quality”. If the BBC is to take on
that work, how are we going to encourage the other public service
broadcasters, and those pay-per-view broadcasters, to continue to match
the investment there and not to live at the sides of it?</hs_para>

threat. It seems quite fashionable to have a go at it. I would say that
it is quite a compliment to the BBC that it has found itself being
criticised by Governments of all colours for as long as I have been old
enough to remember. Indeed, it is probably the function of the BBC to
annoy all Governments. After a period of time, I am sure that it will
start to have a go at my own party with even greater vigour. It is
primarily a body dealing with news and current affairs. The Government
generate, or at least are a key part of, the news and current affairs.
If you have 18 years in power, or 13 years in power, you will get
criticism from this body. This unique thing that we have created with
public money, effectively as a public activity, is going to criticise
the Government. We should accept and embrace this. It is a form of
self-chastisement that we should be encouraging because it is
undoubtedly something that sets us up as a nation and defines us. It
allows our economy and our whole society to operate in the way it does,
and is a key part of what we do.</hs_para>

things to say for this debate, I thought, “Maybe I will be able
to comment on what other people have said and should do some
preparation for myself”. I did not realise, coming in at number 
<?notus-xml column=1529?>four, that the three speakers in front of me would strip away so much of
what I had prepared to say. I was going to mention sport but the noble
Lord, Lord Holmes, has managed to arrive in grand style and take away
much of what I was going to say about the Paralympics and Channel 4.
However, I say this about the broadcast media and sport: when we talk
about sport and the economy, it is a huge part of the entertainment
economy. It also has a huge effect on the rest of our economy,
potentially, in terms of health. There is, for instance, the role of
sport in encouraging and embracing participation in sport, both by
example—that is, via those who achieve and are the great gods of
sport, by getting the medals and the praise in public—and by
making it accessible.</hs_para>

have a challenge to try to take all the bits of our sporting culture
more seriously. The current battleground seems to be drawn around
women’s football, in which the BBC must both take credit for
doing stuff and a little blame for being slow. Football is a universal
game. As a devotee of rugby union, my having to say that association
football is the “universal game” smarts slightly, but it
is the truth. If the universal game does not reach that other half of
our population we shall always have a bit of a problem in encouraging
people to be healthy and
active.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000009">Unless
we can report women’s football in a manner that gives equal
kudos and status and encourages people to get out there, we will not
get the investment in the sport that will allow elite performance. This
investment would allow athletes to come forward and be at their
absolute best in public. We must make sure that comments that they are
not taking it seriously enough, that they are not doing this or that,
that they are not good enough yet, or that this investment cannot be
made, are not taken on board. These athletes are at the top of their
game. The media and particularly the public service broadcast media
must get in there and encourage others too to make sure that there is
no excuse for not allowing that investment. If we make sure that this
goes forward, we will start to address that factor in our society and
encourage all parts of the media to take this
seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000010">The
public service broadcasters have the greatest duty. When my noble
friend replies, I hope that he will have something to say on this.
Women’s football is just the first main example. Other sports
will hit other bits of our society. Unless we encourage universal
coverage of all aspects of sport, we are not going to get the full
benefits from a healthy society. This is one part of the jigsaw and I
hope that we will embrace bringing this
forward.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_28_PT_1/1A335DF9E7F372EBC884C601A50F79003BD84439" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 November 2013">Thursday,

the things that I wish to go over. I am sure that most of your

the future of broadcasting, I wish to visit what
has occurred in the past 30 years. In May 1987 I took a phone call from
Rupert Murdoch. That phone call resulted in one of the biggest
shake-ups in the history of British TV broadcasting. In February 1988,
between my then company and News Corporation, the Sky satellite
television service was launched. Prior to that, my company was invited
to join a satellite consortium known as BSB. I decided against it
because I felt that its technical solution of the
“squarial” was doomed. After millions were injected into
BSB by shareholders, it had to concede defeat. Reluctantly, it
amalgamated with Sky, winning one concession only: the new company
going forward would be named
BSkyB.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000013">From
then on, decisions by Murdoch continued  to upset the industry
applecart by not conforming  to established business models.
Matters appeared quite alien to the then cosy status of the three main
broadcasters. Not the least of these matters was the purchase of the
Premier League rights in 1992. Again, it is on the historical record
that I played a significant role in BSkyB getting those rights. Since
those days we have witnessed the transition of terrestrial broadcasting
to digital. We have also seen the failure of ONdigital, an initiative
of ITV. We have seen the introduction of digital video reorders that
allow consumers effectively to make up their own TV channels and view
programmes when they want
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000014">I
apologise if my speech is starting to sound like a potted history of my
past involvement, but knowing the background will help noble Lords
understand why in 2010 the then director-general of the BBC contacted
me to draw down on my experience to salvage the renamed Project
Canvas—YouView—a system to deliver live TV via the
internet. This company is made up of seven shareholders: the BBC, ITV,
Channel 4, Channel 5, BT, TalkTalk and Arqiva. To make a
long story short, this important and futuristic venture was a
rudderless ship, technically and commercially. After banging a few
heads together and managing the expectations of high-profile
shareholders, YouView was finally launched in May 2012. Had commercial
rationale and realistic technical thought not been applied to YouView,
it would have joined the scrap heap of BSB, ONdigital and other failed
initiatives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000015">The
BBC, of course, has the technical capability to keep up with
technology, but I fear it is unable to compete with the ruthlessness of
the commercial market and its competitors, particularly those in the
general pay-TV market. It seems hamstrung by external critics
constantly referring to the £3.65 billion of licence fee
payers’ funds being spent correctly so that consumers get fair
value for money. Some of the management and the BBC Trust are fixated
on cost cutting to try to appease the critics. In adopting this
posture, they will fall behind by taking their eye off the ball and
forgetting what their remit is: to provide high-quality, innovative
content and entertainment for the British public. The BBC needs to be
there at the forefront, competing for content instead of being
complacent in accepting that its hands are financially
tied.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000016">BT, a

sweet-shop, watching the big boys buy the sweets. We are all currently
paying approximately £12 per month for our TV licence: 40 pence
a day. It will be news to the Deputy Prime Minister that I do pay for
my TV licence. By comparison, one can pay up to £55 per month
for a BSkyB or Virgin subscription, £25 a month for a
mobile-phone subscription, or £20 a month for an internet
service. We should look at what we get: 10 brilliant channels of TV,
quality news coverage all over the country, a brilliant iPlayer service
that delivers three billion downloads per year, a magnificent array of
radio stations, and what I consider is the best-in-class informative
website. This is exceptional value for money. Incidentally, for every
£1 of licence fee income the BBC receives, it generates
£2 for the wider

Mr Murdoch once complained during his wooing of the coalition
Government that the BBC website was, if you can believe it, “too
good” and that it was unfairly affecting his business by using
public funds. In other words, the BBC was doing a much better job than
his organisation. This resulted in the right honourable Jeremy Hunt,
who was then the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport,
foolishly making noises that the BBC should consider making its website
less informative and not spend too much licence fee payers’
money on it. This is one example of the oppression coming from outside
influences that has created an organisation whose managers are
constantly looking over their shoulders and defending themselves
against in some cases ridiculous criticism. For example, the <I>Daily

households in its global footprint. It annually generates approximately
£700 million of overseas revenue and has created great indirect
economic return by enhancing the UK’s reputation overseas, which
can stimulate trade and inward investment. We should all be very proud
of it, but—I say this very respectfully—it is heavily
overstaffed and there are too many jobsworths. The noble Baroness, Lady
Bonham-Carter, has already mentioned those who used to reside on the
sixth floor. I think they are now in the new glass palace in Portman
Place. The organisation is not run in a manner in which a commercial
organisation should be
run.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000019">The BBC
Trust is a complete and utter waste of time and should be disbanded,
and there is a need for a more commercial approach with an experienced
board of directors who are ready to stand up and be counted—and,
of course, some independent non-executive directors. Senior management
should get bonuses if they perform, and should be fired if they do not.
More importantly, government must not be allowed to interfere or to try
to influence management. Layers of jobsworths need removing, and the
money saved must be thrown into R&amp;D, programming and the ability to
bid in a

not be used to reduce the annual licence fee because, as I have already
stated, that is great value for money. All viewing devices in homes are
now digital. It is now possible for the BBC to encrypt pay-per-view

world’s leading comet watchers. As we sat waiting for the first
glimpse of the comet Ison, we got talking. The comet watcher said,
“It’s great to have you Brits here filming this great

the extraordinary creativity of our television industries, but I
suggest to your Lordships that this success is also based on the trust
in our products that we have built up across the world. That trust is
worth its weight in gold—literally. It applies not just to the
BBC but to all the main broadcast media in this country, including ITN

our programmes can be broadcast across the world, carrying with them a

broadcast media is something that I, as a broadcast journalist, have
always taken for granted—I feel it is in my working
DNA—but this impartiality mandate is under threat both from
technology and from those who say that in the interests of the free
market, it is important to end the mandate and allow editorial freedom
for our broadcast media. America used to have the fairness doctrine
regulating it broadcasters. It required the holders of broadcast
licences to present controversial issues of public importance in a
manner that was honest, equitable and balanced. That doctrine was
abandoned in 1987, apparently overwhelmed by the proliferation of cable
television. The chairman of the Federal Communication Commission,
Julius Genachowski, said, “The fairness doctrine holds the
potential to chill free speech and the free flow of ideas and was
properly abandoned over two decades
ago”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000025">Since
then, as anybody who goes to America will know, news information on the
broadcast media has become increasingly polarised. Shock jocks from
both sides of the political spectrum blast out extreme political bile
on the radio airwaves, and Fox News gives a right-wing slant to its
journalism, while left-wing talk shows, such as “The Daily Show
with Jon Stewart”, make endless fun of the right-wing agenda and
its advocates. The internet allows a plethora of free opinion and
voices that are fuelled by this polarised editorial news
agenda.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000026">What
is the result? America is a land of conspiracy and distrust in any kind
of broadcast information. You just have to look at the horrendous and
widely believed conspiracy theories about what happened to flight UA93
on September 11, 2001, which claim that the United States Air Force
shot down the plane, even though it has been proved repeatedly that the
brave passengers overpowered the hijackers to prevent the plane being
crashed into the White House. In my view, the polarisation of the media
has exacerbated political divisions in that country, so it was no
wonder that my comet-watching friend in Arizona paid the higher tariff
on his cable package to ensure that he could watch BBC America and
British

must be a crucial cornerstone of our broadcast economy. It fuels our
international reputation for excellence. The internet and cable
television have allowed an extraordinary range of voices to be heard on
numerous platforms. This technology has allowed China Central
Television, Russian television and even Iran’s Press TV to be
heard across our country. Critics of the impartiality mandate of our
broadcast media say that in a new media landscape that allows these
numerous other voices to be heard, our mainstream broadcast media
should be unyoked from the impartiality constraints imposed on

at a very interesting seminar last week, attended by a number of noble
Lords, discussing plurality in the media. Stephen Hornsby, who is one
of this country’s leading experts on media mergers, raised the
difficulty of assessing and imposing impartiality in the international
broadcast climate of cable TV and access to TV on the internet. Our
broadcast media are under attack from politicians, as has been
mentioned, particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, and from
free market advocates who claim that they are not impartial and 
<?notus-xml column=1534?>should be open to free market forces. Of course, all journalism has a
subjective element—after all, it is witnessed and written by
human beings, all of whom have opinions—but the power of an
impartiality mandate ensures that other views are heard and that
broadcasters have to bear their views in mind when reporting. In a
multichannel world, where opinion is easy and facts are hard to come
by, never has this emphasis on impartiality and balance in our
mainstream media been more important.</hs_para>

department has a consultation paper out at the moment to canvass views
on plurality in the media, and one of the questions being investigated
is whether the impartiality mandate on our broadcast media should be
maintained. Many voices will call for it to be scrapped, but I urge the
Minister to realise that in the new world of broadcast media, it has
never been more important to maintain impartiality in mainstream
broadcasting. It must be a gold standard against which others can be
judged. Failing to do so will mean that the economic power of
Britain’s broadcast media across the world will be greatly

But our UK broadcast media deserve that spotlight. They are unique in

My noble friend Lady Bonham-Carter’s timing for this debate is
perfect, following the amazing weekend marking the 50th anniversary of

first Time Lord would have believed it. Even the changes since this
sector was last regulated 10 years ago have been
revolutionary and the need to update that regulation, but with
flexibility, must be coming soon. Thanks in part to that revolution, we

innovation and investment are growing. With a publisher/broadcaster
such as Channel 4 there to create and innovate, the UK’s
independent production sector has 
<?notus-xml column=1536?>grown from strength to strength. Where else in the world would there be

competing needs of different broadcasters from different platforms are
all urgent challenges in this area. Fifty years from  now, when

different creative fields. Heston is a global kitemark for cutting-edge

launching their new venture this week with the characteristically
cheeky slogan, “One down, five to go”. Tracey Emin,
Damien Hirst and Francis Bacon are collected the world over. James Bond

Wheatcroft (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to follow my
noble friend Lord Purvis of Tweed and his admirable maiden speech. He
listed the qualities 
<?notus-xml column=1540?>that John Buchan admired, and we saw exhibited in his speech exactly
those same qualities. In my noble friend Lord Purvis we have a
formidable political talent in our midst. He started out his career in
the office of my noble friend Lord Steel of Aikwood and went on to
become the youngest Member of the Scottish Parliament. It is a tribute
to this House that he no longer has such a claim to fame, which shows
how things are changing. He worked tirelessly for the campaign to keep
Scotland beautiful, clean and green and is now a campaigner for
devo-max, although that should perhaps be a subject for another day.
Given the speech that we have just heard, and the other maiden speeches
we have heard, with one more to come, we can look forward to some very
talented new Members of this House keeping us entertained and
broadcasting well to the

wish to concentrate my remarks on soft power, as mentioned by the noble
Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter, particularly the soft power exercised by
the BBC World Service. The World Service reaches 192 million people
weekly and broadcasts in 28 languages. It is the most phenomenal asset
for any country to have, wins friends not just for the BBC but for
Britain and is truly an example of soft power at its best. When Aung
San Suu Kyi was here last year, she referred to the difference that the
BBC World Service had made to her life in captivity. Her unfortunate
obsession with Dave Lee Travis—as some might say—did
perhaps engender more attention than it should have done, but it was
the World Service which kept her
going<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:19:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000062">We
should make the most of what the World Service has to offer. I am
particularly keen that we should listen to a point of view put by
Claire Bolderson, who spent 26 years working for the World Service and
the BBC. She has come up with what I think is a brilliant idea. She
wants to know why we do not take all those language services and put
them on digital radio in this country. Why can we not reach out to
those people who are not first-language English speakers and let them
hear the news in their own languages? Not only would we endear them to
the BBC but perhaps we might make them feel part of the UK. Perhaps we
could infiltrate those communities rather more than we are doing now
through the good offices of the BBC World Service. The content is
there—it would not need to be altered very much. I would love to
see some moves made in that direction. One BBC insider said,
“The Swahili service will have to take its chances against
‘Strictly Come Dancing’”. I have to say that I do
not think that the World Service should have to take its chances
against “Strictly Come Dancing”. I would not perhaps put
my views in entirely the same 
<?notus-xml column=1541?>language as the noble Lord, Lord Sugar, but I think that public
service broadcasting might do better by doing
less<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:19:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000063">We
have so many different broadcast channels now. I am not convinced that
the BBC needs to be deeply involved in reality TV any longer as plenty
of others are more than capable of doing that. However, that is not at
all to undermine the success of our programmers. We are very lucky to
have some of the best programme makers in the country making their work
here and enticing others to do so and, of course, that generates huge
sales abroad. I gather that “Titanic”—the series
made by my noble friend Lord Fellowes, who gave us the wonderful
“Downton Abbey”—was sold to 86 countries before it
had been broadcast anywhere. That tells you a lot about what reputation
can do for you, and in particular the reputation of the programming
that goes on here. Our TV exports now reach sales of £1.25
billion a year—a phenomenal contribution to the
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:17:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000064">However,
beyond that, broadcasting is now bringing us a very local economy, too.
It is marvellous that another 56—I think—local TV
channels are coming along. These will reinvigorate local democracy and
will take over where local papers, in many cases, have failed to do
what they used to do—that is, keep people up to date with what
is going on in their locality. In London we are very lucky to be served
by a daily paper that is a genuine newspaper, but in many parts of the
country that is no longer the case, not even on a weekly basis. It is a
danger to local democracy if local politics is not being covered
properly. We should look to these new local television stations to fill
that gap and I have every confidence that they
will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:18:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000065">Broadcasting
now covers such a vast range of  media. YouTube did not exist a
decade ago and yet today 100 hours of video are uploaded every minute.
It is hard to envisage what that really means. It is a part of the
broadcasting media that no one could have imagined 10 years ago. As we
have already heard, BT Sport has scooped the pool when it comes to
football rights, yet a couple of years ago BT Sport meant nothing to
anybody. I do not know whether the price that it paid for the relevant
rights is the right one, but it will certainly shake up the world of
sports viewing. However, I do know that in what used to be the
International Media Centre down at the Olympic park, BT Sport now has
the most phenomenal set of state-of-the-art studios with the best
technology. It is in there working at least two years ahead of the
schedule that the owners of the park thought would be possible.

is one aspect of broadcasting which, however, has not yet featured in
this debate. Taking a deep breath, I shall mention advertising. There
are some who view the advertising as an opportunity to nip to the
kitchen and put on the kettle. However not everybody shares that view.
The attention that has been paid to the Christmas advertising from
Marks &amp; Spencer and John Lewis is an indication of the fact that
advertising is an art form. In Britain, we have some of the best
creative work in advertising anywhere in the world. Anybody who has

Bakewell (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to join this
debate and thank the noble Baroness for introducing it. She and I have
spoken in broadcasting debates before and I did therefore wonder where
we were going with this one and why. It did not take long for me to
appreciate how important and timely such a debate is, because the
broadcasting landscape is changing so fast and so significantly in a
world obsessed, indeed saturated, with images and sounds. You cannot
get away from the plethora of broadcasting. There is almost no arena of
human activity that is not now available to be seen, recorded,
distributed and repeated on a multitude of platforms, now including
Netflix, which is transmitting on the internet. We shall be facing far
more of that in the future. It is also interesting that the noble
Baroness, Lady Grender, referred to my conducting “Question
Time” on a train. Having been marooned in the Midlands by a fire
on the track, I was unable to be present in the BBC studio and so,
along with another colleague who was absent from the programme, we
began tweeting our own “Question Time”. Broadcasting is

shall confine my observations to reports from particular corners of a
broadcasting life—my own life—and allow other people to
make broader deductions and generalisations. I am involved in
programmes made by the independent sector, specifically Sky
and Classic FM, and I am involved in television and radio programmes
made by the BBC. At close range I can smell the difference, I can sense
the mood and I can sense the panic, so I offer a few
personal observations. Last night the Commercial Broadcasters
Association, CoBA, published its report <I>Building a Global TV
Hub</I>. This was an enormously buoyant, upbeat picture of commercial
broadcasters’ achievements and gave some indication of the
future of a more mixed global economy. The non-PSB sector now accounts
for 18% of all investment in UK television commissions. It has doubled
its  UK employment offer over the past decade. It has increased
commissioning of independent producers by nearly 50% in the past year,
and this sector is now worth £5 billion in turnover
per year. It now invests £623 million
pounds a year in UK television content, up nearly 30% over the past
three years. I draw noble Lords’ attention to the direction of
travel. This is an enormously thrusting and confident sector, striking
success after success, at least in its public records, in what it is
aiming to achieve and has already achieved so swiftly in such a short
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:24:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000070">My
own experience is at Sky, where I find a company committed to its
burgeoning channel, Sky Arts. I cite the statistics mentioned by my
noble friend Lord Bragg, because again it is the direction of travel
that is so impressive. Sky makes a growing contribution to 
<?notus-xml column=1543?>the country’s GDP, a total of £5.9 billion in 2012-13. It
has 24,000 employees, 3,700 of whom are working in creative and
production roles. That is the bedrock of the creative talent of which
so many people have spoken. These enormously buoyant and confident
statistics were, I think, compiled before the recent sport contract
fell to BT, but there, in BT, is another eager and ambitious newcomer
to the broadcasting scene. Sky invests £2.5 billion each year in
programming news, sport, entertainment and movies. It is moving towards
a target of spending £600 million annually on UK commissioning
and production by the end of 2014, an increase of more than 50% since
2011. Again, we should notice the direction of
travel<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:29:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000071">This

audiences for Sky remain comparatively small—tiny by any BBC
standard. Its most popular channel, Sky Sports, has or had an audience
share of just 2%. Compare that to the audience share of the

£1.5 billion from BBC Worldwide, an institution that, to many of
us, seemed to take a long time to get going, but which is now, as a
wholly owned commercial subsidiary, doing incredible things around the
world. However the BBC is suffering the eighth consecutive year of
cuts. By the end of the current BBC charter, a further 20% will have

the public’s eye, the BBC has been seriously damaged by three
things: the wasted digital money, the Savile scandal and those
excessive retirement payments. However, those are moving into the past.
Not only has the BBC extended its own reach virtually to breaking point
with the Salford experiment, BBC Three, BBC Four and many enterprises
where the creative people

2010, it took on an extra £340 million of spending commitments,
including the move to digital, the funding of the World Service, BBC
Monitoring and the Welsh channel S4C. In creative circles within the
BBC, budgets are being squeezed and squeezed. Researchers now find
their time doled out in half days, working on one programme and then
another. Producers draw from their own pockets to provide minimal
hospitality, which, as we know, once used to be very generous in the
BBC, although that is no longer so. First-class travel is over;
chauffeur-driven cars hardly exist. That is fine, but the BBC faces
huge decisions about its funding crisis and it needs friends. It has
enemies, and those enemies are voluble. James Murdoch, in his
MacTaggart lecture, called for the BBC to be dismantled. According to
research carried out on behalf of BECTU and the NUJ, it is estimated
that the cuts will reduce the BBC’s GVA—gross value
added—by around £1.1 billion by 2016. The cuts are
damaging.</hs_para>

London and investing in creating centres of excellence in other parts

a little less well known. Programmes such as “Doctor
Who”, “Merlin” and “Sherlock” and
many others have been produced in Cardiff over a number of years but
they are now produced in the BBC’s new drama facility in the
recently built drama village at Roath Lock in the Porth Teigr, or Tiger

have heard other very good maiden speeches, which is important, but I
shall mention one speaker in this debate who is far from being a maiden
speaker—the noble Lord, Lord Bragg. He is a consummate
broadcaster. I was listening to him dealing with a slightly difficult
topic on Radio 4 this morning: the evolution of the microscope. He had
a number of scientists in the studio with him and one of them insisted
on conducting an experiment during the programme. It consisted largely
of handing round a metal bar which people tried to twist in different
directions. I could see the noble Lord dealing with the inherent
challenge of this event—this was radio, not television. He
fastened upon the most perfect phrase when he said to the scientist
involved, “Hold it up to the microphone”, which was a
wonderful combination of radio and
television<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:42:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000092">Like
a number of Members of this House, I have had some difficulty in
deciding what interests I should declare. Suffice to say that in one
form or another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:42:28"></hs_TimeCode>
I have been involved in broadcasting virtually from university to the
present time—first, as a broadcaster myself. Given the subject
of this debate, I recall my first programme on BBC television, which
was the “Money Programme”. I was on it from its second
edition and was taken aside and told that there was a problem with
“money”—not the money that I would receive but the
programme’s name the fear of the governors that it was somehow
unseemly to spend too much time discussing money. Other titles were
suggested by the governors—one was the “Industry
Programme” and the other was the “Export
Programme”. Fortunately, neither was adopted and we settled for
the “Money Programme”. Broadcasting certainly makes a
huge amount of money for
Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:43:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000093">My
other involvements illustrate some of the diversity of this debate. I
worked in the European Commission for five years, in charge of media,
particularly broadcast media. I currently chair a digital television
production company called CTN and Havas Media in the UK, 
<?notus-xml column=1547?>where online advertising is now by far our fastest-growing sector. That
demonstrates a central feature of our subject, and
maybe a problem with it. Broadcasting is no longer a phrase which in
itself adequately describes the diversity and creativity of the
communications revolution. The most dramatic growth, for example, in
the BBC’s global news audiences this year was in the number of
young people around the world using mobile phones to receive
programmes, and 1 billion page views of the BBC’s international
website were achieved in one month. Looking at the overall picture,
British consumers spend one in every 12 working hours online, and
advertising on mobile phones exceeds £1 billion. That is just a
part of the
terrain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:44:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000094">I
had a classic illustration of that last week. Archbishop Tutu of South
Africa was in our CTN studios. It was not a broadcast in the formal
sense of the word, but it was instantly transmitted to a conference
audience of 10,000 in the United States and to several other
conferences. It also immediately went on YouTube, where it has access
to a potential audience of millions of people. How would we describe
this? Of course, it is broadcasting, narrowcasting, webcasting and
social media. We are at the start of a major revolution—only at
the very start. I can see no real limitations on the way in which it
will go. As we are having this debate, just down the road in Millbank,
an interesting announcement was made by the Government about setting up
a creative media sector task force, looking particularly at the role of
SMEs in the creative industries. The figures given at that conference
for the value of the creative industries as a whole are profound. Will
the Minister comment on what the task force might achieve in the areas
that we have been debating

will make two final points, one about opportunity and the other about
responsibility. First, on opportunity, I have spent a number of years
involved with the cause of the English language abroad, particularly as
chairman of the English-Speaking Union. To an astonishing extent our
first language has become the world’s second language, which
gives us a huge advantage. The BBC broadcasts in 27 languages, but by
far its most powerful instrument is the English language itself, and
the accessibility of the world to it. It is a great
opportunity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000096">My
second point is about responsibility. The BBC, as we all know, does not
only sell programmes or indeed, services around the world; it stands
for certain values, which have been referred to in the debate. They
include impartiality, accuracy, credibility and freedom from government
control. These are fundamental characteristics. When I joined the BBC
in the early 1960s, in a very dilapidated office in what was Lime Grove
Studios, I knew that I could pick up my telephone and ring virtually
anyone I wanted around the world and get an interview with them simply
because I represented the BBC. The power of the brand was immense.
Today, that brand has been jeopardised, and the tragedy is that it is
effectively an own goal. The jeopardy has come from scandal and, as
other noble Lords have commented, from quite grotesque executive
settlements and
payouts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:48:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0001.htm#13112850000097">A
line has been drawn under that, and we all wish the noble Lord, Lord

importance which used the power of television to bring it to a wider

number of times this year—three in the Albert Hall and all the

“Philomena”, a quite excellent film, and the credits on
the film informed me that BBC Films had had an involvement in its
financing. I went in August twice to the Edinburgh Festival and saw and
heard many things—but I saw and heard more on BBC radio and
television than I could in Edinburgh. My point is that the broadcast
media can fill schedules with content from such a festival; the

to the National Theatre, while I was watching the 50th anniversary

commercial reasons why that should not be the case and that delay might
be necessary. I attend the theatre a great deal but I have been to the

people across the UK are. Obviously I am limited by time and cost as
well, which is why I have been much encouraged by the success of
National Theatre Live cinema broadcasts. These performances, not only
by the National Theatre, are still limited in number and occasion. For
example, although I would have liked to have seen the Royal Shakespeare
Company’s production of “Richard II” recently at
the cinema, I have not been able to, but at least the RSC has other
productions planned for 2014. The advantage of this system is that
cinema seats are filled, audiences are created and audiences share the

Newcastle upon Tyne I often look at the programming in other parts of

broadcasting is. It is a key part of our economy—130,000 jobs,
£12 billion in revenue and 3% of our GVA. The trouble is that
the GVA created by broadcasting is markedly different by UK nation or
region. Let us take as an example BBC expenditure in 2011-12. According
to the latest figures provided by the House of Lords Library, London
has 
<?notus-xml column=1550?>expenditure of £3 billion out of a total UK spending of
£4.3 billion. We should note that Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland have £425 million, and all of England outside London
only £656 million. English regions are, in truth, the poor
relations in comparison to London. For example, the whole of the
north—including Yorkshire, the north-east and the
north-west—has expenditure of only £203 million. If we
add to this the fact that Arts Council England spends most of its money
in London, whichever way one looks at the figures, the truth is that
there is an enormous imbalance in spending between London and the rest
of England, be it Arts Council direct funding, the lottery, DCMS or
private
sponsorship<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T13:57:17"></hs_TimeCode>.

to spending more in the regions and has asked to be judged on outcomes
in two years’ time. I welcome that commitment but I hope, too,

impact of the arts more generally, the creative economy and
broadcasting from the noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter; and the noble
Lord, Lord Shipley, described the other end of the spectrum and how
these plans and ideas that we have for organising and constructing our
creative industries impact when you are living outside London or are

the political spectrum involved in this debate, probably more joins us
together on the issues being discussed than separates us. We should be

there are few areas of public life within which you could have a
discussion of this nature, which involves not only those who have
practical experience—journalists, performers, executives and
producers—but consumers as well. We will learn from the words

today, namely the need to stress the impartiality and balance that
currently exists in our broadcast media, particularly in our news
output; and added to some of the thoughts about value, which also came
up from the noble Lord, Lord Holmes of Richmond. There is an important
sense—that we sometimes ignore at our peril—about the

belt and to leave it for the greater pastures of England. It is

have had a very good history lesson on how broadcasting in this country
has evolved. I thought it was very helpful to have that context. The
interesting thing for me about the early days of television was
how—possibly more by accident than by design—we ended up
in the first phases with a series of channels that were all financed in
different ways so that the competition that existed was a competition
for quality, not for sources of funding. That, of course, has 
changed slightly, but it is still redolent in some areas,
particularly—as mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady
Wheatcroft—that of advertising. It is so important 
<?notus-xml column=1552?>that ITV and, to some extent, other channels are free not because they
are provided for by any state funding but because advertising pays for
them. We ignore that at our

historical link is that broadcasting broadly is in good shape. The
noble Lord, Lord Bragg, made an important point about this. I recall
that there were voices of gloom and doom every time anything happened,
saying that any new initiative was going to be a disaster, but we are
still here and still consuming huge amounts of television. The
extraordinary thing is the strength of the terrestrial channels, which
underpins much of what we enjoy
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:03:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

for policymakers because it is both art and culture. Obviously, the
ability to create fantastic art forms within a broadcast medium is
valuable in itself, but it only comes about because of the
extraordinarily large economic apparatus that has to be there to
surround it. Again, that is something to remember when one thinks about
the creativity and investment required. Our ex-colleague—soon to
be our colleague again, I hope—the current director-general of
the BBC, the noble Lord, Lord Hall, put his finger on it when he said
that we were ignoring, when looking at broadcasting, the very wide
impact it has, not just because of the broadcast material of the
programmes, but because of the buildings in Salford and in other
places, the training, the innovation and the ability of those who have
control of the commissioning buttons to introduce new work and new
writing that results in activity that would not otherwise take
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:04:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112850000124">It
has been said, and I think it is right, that if the BBC sneezes, it is
the arts world that catches flu. It is important to recognise that
contribution, which is often underrecognised and not reflected in what

creating activity—local activity and jobs—we would not
have what we have and enjoy in this country.</hs_para>

soft power was mentioned—and it is important—as were the
points of the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, about the need to
recognise that, in some senses, although we are not the major player,
what happens in broadcasting in Britain, and by implication in the
wider context of our arts, is a standard that would be the one that
people would most reflect and most enjoy. Those of us who travel abroad
and talk to others obviously understand that that
happens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:05:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112850000126">With
all that context, what are the remaining questions that we need to ask
about these things? First—noble Lords have touched on this and I
think it is very important to recognise—broadcasting, although a
net contributor to our economy, also draws from the seed beds in our
arts and culture. That largely depends on Arts Council and other
spending, such as that from the BFI and other arts bodies. Will the
Minister, when he comes to respond, reflect on whether he feels it is
in the best interests of the sectors that have been raised today to
have experienced yet another round of cuts in our arts world? I mention
in particular the BFI, with an additional cut this year, its heritage
changing significantly away from its previous model to one which is
more about being privately supported; and, as 
<?notus-xml column=1553?>has been mentioned, the incredible cuts in local authority support of
the arts. There is a report in one of today’s papers that there
may not be any cultural spending in a few years. Perhaps the Minister
could comment on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:06:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112850000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112850000127">We
have also been reminded—and it is important—that
broadcasting to a single television in a household that is watched in a
group is not now the way we consume what is produced. The noble Lord,
Lord Shipley, mentioned that there was a great deal of interface across
and between the various art forms now being reproduced and picked up.
Indeed, one of the roles of television is to reflect that which is
happening, not necessarily within broadcasting’s direct ambit,
to a wider population. Where are we with the broadband rollout and
where are we going to be for the people who need to pick up these
things? What about the rural broadband scheme? Perhaps we could have a
comment from the Minister on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:07:20"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T14:07:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

which I referred earlier also has implications for training, for the
work of Skillset, which has been mentioned, and the need to think again
about the contributions made across the whole of the broadcasting
industry and more widely. Is it time to revisit the question of whether
this should be an obligation? Broadcasting, and the creative world more
generally, also impacts on the diversity that we see and seek to have
in our society, and I would be grateful for a comment on whether he

in finding the right contracts to support in moving image and creative
industries wishing to have export finance in order to get their work

that in the next few years the BBC will have to undergo its regular
examination by those who support it, in terms of government, but also
by those who fund it through the licence fee. Will the Minister perhaps

it has been wide-ranging and thought-provoking and it has displayed a

S4C of course has funding not only from the Exchequer but through the
BBC. As long as the funding timespan is agreed, the Exchequer funding
for S4C is confirmed at the current level into 2015-16 and there is, in
addition, BBC licence fee money up to 2017. I am sure that that will
all be part of the continuing discussions, but what a good job that
channel
does.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000021">My noble
friend Lord Purvis of Tweed gave us an insight into the broadcast media
in Scotland. His reflections on that glorious part of our nation, the

a number of your Lordships said, the UK television industry generated
£12.3 billion in revenue last year. The UK broadcasting industry
comprises a mixture of public service broadcasters—BBC, ITV,
Channel 4, Channel 5 and S4C—and commercial multichannel
broadcasters such as Sky and Discovery. Because of parliamentary duties

and I hope will have, on the health of our nation. That content also
includes arts and culture programmes such as the BBC’s
“Imagine” strand, digital radio stations such as Absolute

development and international sale of programming is remarkable. The UK
is second only to the United States of America in TV content sales,
which reached £1.7 billion last year. New markets in China,
India and Indonesia present extraordinary opportunities; exports to
China rose 90% last year. Sales to the United States of America were up
11% to £475 million, representing 39% of total sales. Digital

“Sherlock”, “Parade’s End” and
“Downton Abbey” have bolstered Britain’s
reputation and are attracting more international investment. Your
Lordships have already mentioned “Doctor Who”. Its 50th
anniversary special has just had a record-breaking global simultaneous

noble friend Lord Shipley referred to the trio of theatre, cinema and
television coming together and making all these great productions more
accessible across the land, which is an increasing part of the cultural

independent production sector, which a number of your Lordships
mentioned, is also a major export success story. Independent producers
are increasingly winning commissions direct from international
broadcasters, as well as selling a greater number of finished
programmes and formats to international buyers. 
<?notus-xml column=1556?>Channel 4 commissions all its content from the independent production
sector, supporting a wide range of SMEs across the United Kingdom.
These commissions are a key part of the UK’s international sale

talkSPORT broadcasts Premier League matches in eight
languages—English, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, Malay, Indonesian,
French and Vietnamese—from its base in London to 25 different
markets in Europe and the rest of the world. I hope very much that my
noble friend Lady Wheatcroft will approve of that. In response to the
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, I should say that UKTI-led
events and the GREAT campaign are very important in beating the drum
for the sector. I have looked before at the various tours that have
taken place and there are many examples of where the creative

economic contribution made by the sector is clear, but we should not
forget that it plays an equally vital educational, social and cultural
role. The noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, quite rightly
stressed this. The noble Lord also mentioned the settlement in this
sector. I think that it is fair to say, having looked at it again, that
in many respects the endurance of cuts, which in an ideal climate many
would regret, was a good settlement in the end for the sector compared
with many other sectors, although I understand the issues that a number
of your Lordships have mentioned.</hs_para>

mention the BBC World Service, which my noble friend Lady Wheatcroft
spoke so powerfully about. I agree with the noble Viscount, Lord
Colville of Culross, that it is an important aspect of our collective
identity. The BBC World Service has the largest audience of any
international broadcaster, with a weekly reach of 192 million people;

nurtured, as many of your Lordships said. I was interested that Channel

Academy, which has the ambition of creating new opportunities for up to
1 million young people by 2020. The BBC will be taking on an apprentice
in every BBC local radio station across England and 
in stations across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland by September
2014. ITV invested £50 million in enhancing facilities in Leeds
and at MediaCityUK in Salford, which my noble friend Lady Bonham-Carter
referred to as the hub of Salford, which is important across the 
<?notus-xml column=1557?>media area. Indeed, ITV’s investment in skills and development
training to help the next generation of talent across the UK should be
acknowledged. The noble Lord, Lord Bragg, mentioned ITV in

revenue last year was £1.2 billion. Some 65% of adults tune in
to commercial radio at least once a week. BBC Radio 2 is the most
popular radio station in the UK. BBC national and local radio,
commercial radio and community radio are all part of the vibrant mix.
Since 2010 there has been a further shift to digital listening, which

now turn to how the Government are playing and need to play a part in
supporting the growth of UK broadcasting. As part of the
Government’s wide-ranging review of the communications sector,
our discussions with industry, regulators and consumer groups indicated
that the present framework is broadly operating well, is generally
working for the consumer and supports economic growth and innovation.
However, where legislative changes are deemed necessary, the Government
will act. An example is the prominence of public service broadcasters.
We need to update electronic programme guide regulation, to keep pace
with recent developments in TV technology, to provide flexibility to
adapt to future technological changes and to preserve public service
broadcasters’ prominence. We all value high-quality content,
which the noble Lord, Lord Sugar, concentrated on, and we expect public
service broadcasters in particular to adhere to this. The public must
be able to continue to find and enjoy this in the future, so we expect
to consult on these issues in the near future.</hs_para>

Watson of Richmond mentioned the wider creative industries. Indeed, the
media broadcast sector cannot and does not function in isolation. I
acknowledge the work of the wider creative industries. Collectively,
the creative industries are worth more than £36 billion a year
to the UK. The creative industries supporting the broadcast media
include: craftsmen and craftswomen, fashion designers creating props
and costumes, production crews, make-up artists, composers and
musicians, and many more. My noble friend Lady Wheatcroft and others

the Government have an important role to fulfil. The Government helped
to set up the Creative Industries Council in 2011. Led by industry, the
council now works to ensure that barriers to growth can be removed. A
sub-group of that council will look at access to finance skills, export
markets, data collection and infrastructure. If I have more detailed
information, I will certainly write to my noble friend Lord Watson of
Richmond about these matters.</hs_para>

up a range of creative content-targeted tax reliefs, such as tax breaks
for British films. There are clearly strong links between the film
world, which benefits from these tax incentives, and broadcasting. For
example, Channel 4 is a major investor in UK film. Indeed, films
supported by Channel 4 have won 14 Oscars in the past seven years. My
noble friend Lady Bonham-Carter mentioned tax reliefs for animation and
high-end TV. These came into force in April this year, to support
innovation and the growth of the content for which the UK is renowned.
These initiatives are already bringing more productions to our shores;
for example, “Outlander” is being made in Cumbernauld and
“Game of Thrones” has had a significant impact on the
local economy and skills base in Northern
Ireland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000041">Furthermore,

broadcasting in the UK, with Grimsby channel Estuary TV leading
the way. Another 18 channels will be launched in the spring,
with a further wave of channels to come. This was raised by the noble
Lord, Lord Birt, my noble friend Lord Shipley and others. It is an
important feature and part of the direction of travel that the noble
Baroness, Lady Bakewell, referred to. I say to the noble Lord, Lord
Stevenson of Balmacara, that, as a countryman, I am passionately keen

importance of the broadcast media in the UK and the contribution that
they make has been outlined most eloquently by your Lordships today.
The Government’s role must be to ensure that the environment is
suitable for the sector to continue to flourish. There are undoubtedly
challenges and opportunities in this increasingly converged world. The
title of today’s debate specifically highlights the economic
contribution of broadcast media. That is not in doubt. What is
impossible to assess adequately or precisely is what this sector
contributes to the social and cultural well-being of our nation. As
noble Lords mentioned—particularly the noble Lord, Lord
Stevenson of Balmacara—it is a prime example of how soft power
operates across the globe in the British interest. The reputation of
our nation abroad is in no small measure enhanced by the UK’s
high standards for content—set by producers and regulators, and
by the expectations of those who listen and watch. That reputation is

lead this topical Question for Short Debate this afternoon. I reassure
all noble Lords present that I am conscious of the need for brevity
given that this is intended to be a short debate, and will accordingly

month’s employment figures were very encouraging, revealing that
employment is up 177,000 this quarter while unemployment is down 48,000
in the same period. All in all, there are now more than 1 million more
people in work since the general election. Significantly, this
month’s figures also revealed a considerable rise in the number
of young people in work—up more than 50,000 in the past three
months. Noble Lords from all Benches in this House would agree that
this is very welcome
news.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000047">Apprenticeships
have played a pivotal role in helping young people into—in many
cases back into—work. Since the Government came to power in
2010, a record 1.5 million apprenticeships have been created. To put
that into context, that figure is twice the number created by the
previous Labour Government during their final three years in office. A
record number have started apprenticeships—half a million in the
past year alone, with apprenticeship starts in IT and digital
frameworks proving especially popular. Of course, I would be remiss if
I failed to pay tribute to the continuing popularity of Armed Forces
apprenticeships, with around 10,000 completed every
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000048">Apprenticeships
are an invaluable means by which young people can fulfil their
individual potential. We must remember the simple truth that no single
means of learning will ever suit everyone. Like the National Citizen
Service, apprenticeships provide an opportunity for young people to
learn new skills, grow in confidence and develop a sense of self-worth
and purpose. Those undertaking apprenticeships gain an experience of
work that is truly invaluable. They have the opportunity 
<?notus-xml column=1560?>to work alongside experienced staff, gain vocational skills, earn a
recognised qualification and, above all, earn a wage. The Government
are to be commended for the strides they have taken in making
apprenticeships an attractive and viable option both for young people
and the businesses that take them
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000049">As noble
Lords are well aware, small and medium-sized business enterprises are
the lifeblood of our economy. To make hiring apprentices a more
attractive proposition for such companies, the Government must build
further on the steps already taken—such as the recently extended
apprenticeship grant for employers—to simplify the recruitment
process and remove unnecessary bureaucracy. I hope the Minister can
shed some light on what the Government are doing in that
regard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000050">It is
imperative that we make young people aware of their options at what is
a definitive crossroads in their lives. We must accept that for many
young people, university is neither an attractive nor viable option.
Yet I fear that a large number of teachers seem able only to advocate a
university career for their pupils and have little information or
enthusiasm for vocational training. That is not the way to find our
new-style engineers, technicians, craftsmen and craftswomen, and the
entrepreneurs of our future. With that in mind, I wonder whether the
Minister can update the House on how the new careers service appears to
be
performing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000051">I
encourage the Government to do more to restore the esteem in which
apprenticeships were once held. We need more role models—more
poster boys and poster girls—to bang the drum for
apprenticeships. My father was apprenticed. When he finished his
original seven years as an apprentice he was sent to be what was then
called a journeyman. You had to leave the place where you worked and
lived. You had to go off, ply your trade and see whether you could be
as good as you thought you were. Ultimately, he returned, recognised as
a cabinet maker and thereafter became a master craftsman. His
relationship with his mentor was undoubtedly one of the most formative
of his life and the platform for so many of the great things he
achieved over the rest of his life. As a result, he told me that with a

from the noble Lord, Lord Young of Norwood Green, for whom I have a
great deal of admiration having served on the Front Bench opposite him

Miliband’s recent foray into the issue of apprenticeships. His
pledge that a future Labour Government would require companies both
large and small to hire an apprentice for every foreign worker they
employ has been widely condemned by a range of business leaders, from
the CBI to the IoD, from the chambers of commerce to the small business
alliances. That compulsion would discourage more employment. Surely
that cannot be what is wanted.</hs_para>

never underestimate the challenge faced by many young people wishing to
enter the world of work in these difficult times. We should not be
complacent following the welcome news that youth unemployment is
falling and that the economy is showing signs of life. There is more
work to be done, because if we are to harness our potential as a nation
we must harness the potential of each and every one of our precious
young people. After all, they are our future. Apprenticeships are not
just an opportunity to do something for a few years. They are a chance
to stand by someone you can admire, and work with someone who can teach
you and give you the steering that may not have been possible in your
home life. You have someone to travel through life with. I am delighted
that this aspect of employment is growing in
popularity.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_28_PT_1/585730ACB2AA9585454A590793460706EF1CFFA3" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 November 2013">Thursday,

it had identified 48 schemes that could help an employer to take on or

pointing that out and for pointing out that those schemes are funded
through three government departments. The DWP funds employment

add to the confusion, the Government’s response to the Richard
review, published on 28 October, encouraged employers to describe
almost any training scheme or initiative as an apprenticeship. The
precision, the high standards demanded by employers and the National
Apprenticeship Service had been officially abandoned, so that the
Government can claim that 500,000 started training, as the noble

through the creation of a highly skilled workforce has been important
to us. Proper apprenticeships form an important part of that. Proper
apprenticeships, which combine a business need with a social need, with
a strong emphasis on assisting the business by developing skills in
particular to that business. That enables the business to develop, to
progress and to innovate. They are not a quick fix to get unemployed

economic recovery gets under way, there are two needs. One is to get

declare my interests 
<?notus-xml column=1564?>as a member of the Apprenticeships, the Further Education, Skills and
Lifelong Learning and the Skills and Employment All-Party Groups, and
until recently as a director of a small company that helps to prepare
disadvantaged young Londoners for employment, including via

first issue relates to the lack of awareness of young people in schools
of the apprenticeship opportunities available to them. I have met quite
a number of apprentices and can hardly recall any who had heard about
their apprenticeship, or been encouraged to take it up, through their
schools. Indeed, I have heard of survey results indicating that one in
five current apprentices were actively discouraged by their schools.
Sadly, there seems to be an ingrained view that going on to further or
higher education is better than going into a practical, job-related
training programme, even where that programme offers recognised,
high-quality qualifications. Yet for a substantial number of young
students, higher education may not offer the most appropriate pathway
to a successful career. Many of the apprentices I have met preferred to
get into the workplace sooner, and to start earning ahead of their
contemporaries, while gaining job-related skills and qualifications
and, in some cases, going on to do university degrees at a later
stage.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112855000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000071">How
can we tackle this problem? Of course we should put pressure on schools
and careers services to promote apprenticeships as an option where
appropriate. This should be included in Ofsted inspections. Schools
should be required not only to report destination data for all their
students but to achieve a sensible balance between students going on to
university and into jobs or apprenticeships, and inspected against
those criteria. There should also be much greater effort to make
parents aware of the range and value of apprenticeship opportunities.
Other noble Lords may have received a CIPD briefing, showing that only
9% of parents ranked an apprenticeship as the qualification that they
would most like their child to
attain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000072">When I
met a group of engineering sector apprentices from the Industry
Apprentice Council, set up by EAL, I was particularly struck by their
willingness, indeed eagerness, to act as ambassadors themselves, based
on the view that they are best placed to promote
apprenticeships to others of their generation. Many have been
articulate, enthusiastic, persuasive and impressive; surely we could
harness those talents to encourage others to follow their lead. Perhaps
the Government should look at ways of extending this concept of
industry apprentice councils into other
sectors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000073">My
second issue relates to encouraging and  enabling employers,
particularly smaller firms, to offer more apprenticeships. I shall base
this on a social enterprise called Building Lives set up by Steve
Rawlings, the founder and chief executive of Lakehouse—a
construction and contracting company based in Romford which now has an
annual turnover of more than  £300 million and some
1,300 staff. Building Lives 
<?notus-xml column=1565?>offers 18-month NVQ level 2 multi-trade construction-sector
apprenticeships, covering a range of skill areas including bricklaying,
carpentry, plumbing, painting and decorating, plastering and tiling. It
currently runs six Building Lives academies across London, each
training about 50 apprentices a year aged 16 to 64, although one of
them offers vocational training for much younger students, aged 14 to
16, in Southwark. The apprentices mostly come from deprived areas local
to the academies. Many are NEETs or suffer other forms of disadvantage,

complete their apprenticeships at Building Lives go on to be offered
jobs with local contractors. Many of these are small firms, so Building
Lives is set up as an apprenticeships training agency, or ATA, in order
to manage on their behalf the bureaucracy involved in employing these
young people. Already, after just a couple of years of operation, these
six centres are producing some 250 qualified apprentices a year, who

like to expand: Steve talks about reaching 20 academies within the next
few years, producing about 1,000 qualified apprentices a year to go
into the construction jobs market, with its expected growing skills
needs. The academies are financially self-sustaining, for example
through training fees, but they involve start-up costs—for
example, to fit out suitable premises and to acquire necessary
tools  and equipment. Funding these initial costs in the
current climate is proving extremely difficult yet it seems to me that
this is a model for enhancing  take-up of
apprenticeships—not necessarily restricted to
construction—that is proven and replicable, and could generate
both new apprenticeship openings and the young people to fill them in
significant numbers. What help can the Minister offer to enable
initiatives of this kind to attract the start-up funds that they

Addington (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I am afraid that when I talk
about apprenticeships, I bring with me rather a big moan. One of the
major problems that we have had with the apprenticeship system is that
the choice of wording, and the way in which the matter has been
approached, has ended up, almost by definition, by excluding anybody
who has even moderate dyslexia. We are currently dealing with this
problem in the Children and Families Bill and may come to a
satisfactory conclusion on it at Report. I will not rehearse those
arguments now, because nobody has annoyed me enough to go through it
all over again, but what it points out to me is that there is a problem
with the idea that we have got in front of us
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000078">In fact,
there are effectively two problems. The first is the perception that
apprenticeships are wonderful and should be left alone and nobody can
criticise them because they are to do with business. The other is the
perception that education happens somewhere else and is nothing to do
with training. We reached a point where I asked the then Minister, the
noble Lord, Lord Young of Norwood Green, whether we were going to 
<?notus-xml column=1566?>prevent dyslexics from getting their apprenticeships because of the
English test. He said, “No, we’ll sort that out”.
Somewhere in the slip between cup and lip, however, and with the change
of government, we developed a system where they were
being  stopped. Would that have happened in an educational
establishment? No, it would not. Educational establishments know that
you bring people on board and, with a long-term advantage, you can deal
with it. If we go after training, we could have a system where people
say, “Training and business? Business wants people who have
literacy skills. If you don’t have good literacy skills, we
cannot deal with you”. They do not know that in the modern world
there are dozens of ways of assisting people to gain literacy skills
through technology.</hs_para>

worrying that although the same department provided both the disabled
students allowance and the literacy package for
universities—which is particularly for dyslexics but also for
others with disabilities—the two parts were not talking to each
other: the silos had closed. And just to make the absurdity slightly
greater, guess what? Afterwards they could get help through Access to
Work, which helps dyslexics access the written word. We got ourselves
into a situation where a scheme was too precious to look outside
itself. If that can happen once it can happen twice. We have to try to
cross over that and ensure that the different parts talk to each
other.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000080">My
noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, talked about building
up this important aspect which should be valued by the education
system, this cross between training and education. The two worlds
currently regard themselves as separate. I agree with my noble friend
that schools should be better at directing people towards this area. In
this case, however, the people from the academic world have had a
better understanding of the support required for this
group—which is 10% of the population—than people in the
training world have had. Let us also face facts. If you put a dyslexic
through university, what sorts of entrance-level jobs will be available
for a university graduate? They will go into a white-collar office job.
With the best will in the world, and with all the technological support
in the world, they would probably be happier in a more practical
environment. By not thinking laterally, and by defending your own
little world, you are deliberately excluding people who would have been
happier in that place. Unless the people undertaking these schemes

Lord Bishop of Derby:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate the
noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, on securing this debate on this very
important theme. The 
<?notus-xml column=1567?>Richards review and the statement by the Minister of State for Skills
and Enterprise make clear that there are three areas that we need to
look at and hold
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000083">The
first is the big context about the importance of using education and
training, of which apprenticeship is part, to make good citizens and a
proper workforce for the 21st century. That is the theme of vocation:
developing people to have a sustainable working life. The second area
is the need for employers to be able to train and recruit the kind of
people they need for their particular industry. The third area is the
fact that there are a large number of young people who lack the
opportunity to engage with the world of work. Those three themes frame
this debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000084">I
will start with a comment on the bigger picture. I work in Derby, which
is a great centre for industry, technology and innovation. One of the
flagships is Rolls-Royce. The Rolls-Royce apprenticeship academy takes
between 150 and 200 people a year. It is a setter of high standards. As
part of their training, these apprentices are sent into the community
to work in schools, with the homeless and in other places of need. They
are developed in their vocation to be human beings and to handle
themselves in the world, alongside the particular skills of
engineering. It is very important to remember that in this debate. As
the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, said, that was perhaps part of the
energy that created her father—that wider hinterland of vocation
to move beyond technical
skills.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000085">The
second area is the needs of employers. With its long industrial
heritage, the city of Derby has an exciting partnership between local
businesses, Derby College and the University of Derby, to establish a
university technical college that will open in September 2014. This is
an engineering school for people between 14 and 18 years old, and a
partnership between business and education. It may have the kind of
potential to look at some of the learning issues that have been raised
today, because of the ingredients of the partnership. Employers know
what they are looking for, and are using professional educational and
training institutions to help deliver them in a joined-up
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000086">The third
strand is the fact that so many young people are denied access to the
world of work. Because of their vocational element, and their ability
to equip young people to be citizens and develop their skills in other
ways, apprenticeships are a key area for them to have the opportunity
to access. In my part of the world we have the JCB Academy; noble Lords
probably know about JCB diggers. I work with people who are involved in
that academy. They are helping young people to bridge the problem of
being out of the world of work and getting into
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000087">The story
of somebody I know illustrates this. This is a young person from a
dysfunctional home who was a bad attendee when the opportunity to train
through the JCB Academy was offered. Instead of telling this person
that they were not meeting our standards and were off the course, the
academy first worked with the mother; this was a single-parent family.
Then it provided a return-to-school plan for the young person. It
provided a mentor. When for other reasons the family was 
<?notus-xml column=1568?>relocated out of the catchment area, JCB took the initiative and found
temporary accommodation so that the young person could finish their
training. This person is now an almost fully qualified apprentice
engineer. That reaching out beyond immediate needs to get someone into
the workforce and build a bridge, is crucial for so many young people
who lack the
opportunity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000088">I
end by asking the Minister three questions. As the Government try to
ensure good standards, could they include standards about the formation
of citizens and a vocational element in apprenticeships? Besides
including small businesses in the apprenticeship model, could the
Government see how we could develop partnerships such as the one in the
university technical college in Derby, between education and training
specialists and elements of industry, that might help small businesses
especially? How can we encourage the development of apprenticeships to
build bridges to young people who need real encouragement and support
to step into the world of work with its
disciplines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:05:48"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Shipley (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness,
Lady Wilcox, for initiating this debate. I strongly support the
Government’s reforms to the apprenticeship system. The
employer-designed standards and assessment to be introduced are very
welcome, and in particular the English and maths requirements and the
minimum of 12 months for an apprenticeship. These provide a stronger
structure that more employers and more potential apprentices will want
to join. It is the job of everyone—not just the
Government—to make a success of
apprenticeships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000090"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:06:33"></hs_TimeCode>I
shall raise three strategic problems in relation to skills. The first
is the ageing workforce. Over the next three years, 200,000 people will
be retiring from manufacturing and engineering. They will have to be
replaced. Secondly, we have a skills gap. All over the UK, in
manufacturing, engineering and the process industries, there are
shortages at level 3 and above. I have lost count of the number of
times I have been told or have read of the difficulty that so many
employers have in recruiting. When we consider how much we spend on
skills, it is quite astonishing that this problem is so widespread and
so deep in so many
sectors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000091">The
third strategic problem is the lack of qualifications. Half of those
who leave school without five good GCSEs have no job. Youth
unemployment stands at 965,000: 21% of the under-24s. I have come to
the conclusion that such a high level of youth unemployment is in part
related to weaknesses in the provision of technical education, and to
too few youth apprenticeships.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112855000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000092">We still have a
shortage of quality apprenticeships, and we need to raise the status of
technical education to overcome that. We need opportunities throughout
the country, including in rural areas where schools, further education
and manufacturing businesses, in particular, need to be coherently
linked through an apprenticeship system. For apprenticeships to grow,
people have to offer apprenticeships, other people must take them up
and places and sectors must want to promote them. We have to build on
good practice. I draw attention to the city of Nottingham, which
launched 
<?notus-xml column=1569?>its apprenticeship hub in November 2012 and has in the past 12 months
seen a one-third increase in the number of
apprenticeships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000093">Secondly,
there is good practice when newspapers show leadership in supporting
the growth of apprenticeships. I draw particular attention to the
<I>Journal</I> in Newcastle upon Tyne, and congratulate it on its
leadership in driving up the number of apprenticeships in the
north-east of England through its Proud to Back Apprentices campaign,
which I am delighted to support. It is everybody’s
responsibility, and lots more companies are needed to
engage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112855000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000094">Opportunities
for girls and women are another aspect of this. I commend Hilary
French, the president of the Girls’ Schools Association, who in
a speech last week to its annual conference on Tyneside said that
higher-level apprenticeships were one way in which young women could
take up a career using science, maths or technology. There is a serious
shortage of women taking up careers who have studied these subjects.

hope, that the link between schools and employers will strengthen over
the coming years and that there will be an increasing focus on

them”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13112855000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112855000110">I

to see that the National Apprenticeship Service has had its role
extended to include supporting employer investment in traineeships,
which will be particularly helpful in addressing the imbalance in the
age of a company’s workforce. I hope that the
Government’s changes and the creation of the new trailblazers,
which will combine employers and professional bodies in new industries
such as aerospace, automotive, digital, electrotechnical, energy and
life sciences, in particular, will drive ahead to create
many more apprenticeship opportunities for our

opportunity, I will say to the Minister, in particular, that it is
desperately important that we remember the crucial significance of
craft apprenticeships. I say that in the light of the very perceptive
comments of my noble friend Lord Addington. Many young people who have
dyslexia can become superb craftsmen and craftswomen. The Heritage
Crafts Association and the William Morris Craft Fellowship have tried
to spread the gospel of true craftsmanship. It is very important that
employers, many of whom in the Heritage Crafts Association are one-man
or one-woman businesses, have help to take on apprentices.</hs_para>

Minister to allow me to bring to meet him a representative from both
those associations, so that we can discuss how best the Government can
help encourage, through the education system and elsewhere, young men
and women to embrace a career in the crafts. Not one of the churches
whose rescue we were rejoicing in this morning could have been rescued
had it not been for the skill of craftsmen and craftswomen. We need to
ensure that there is a steady and continuing supply. It is a wonderful
vocation. It is enormously fulfilling—but, sadly, it is too
often denigrated. May this brief debate help ensure a resurrection of
real interest in and encouragement of heritage
crafts.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_28_PT_1/993A357D5A528792181FC91F6F7B1313DEE625A4" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 November 2013">Thursday,

that is my claim to fame. A number of people have
talked about the status of apprenticeships. Not only among young people
but among teachers and parents it is not viewed in the same way as
academic progression. I was reminded forcefully of this on the Lords
outreach programme at a local high school. I scanned through all the
documentation and found not a single reference to apprenticeships. I
asked the group of 30 pupils I was talking to and, no, apprenticeships
were not registering with them at all. We have got a lot more to do in

an apprenticeship leads you through to getting a degree. As I have

university technical colleges, which are a good and welcome

the point of the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare. Also, we somehow need to
get through to young girls that there are careers apart from
hairdressing or nursing—not that I wish to denigrate either of
those because they are in themselves valuable jobs—and to open
up their horizons to the worlds of science, engineering and craft
skills as well. There are a lot of opportunities there. I certainly

actually that the demand, as a number of noble Lords have said, vastly
exceeds the supply. I do not wish to knock the Government’s
attempt, but they should stop just saying, “We have done
500,000”, when you know that when you examine those figures they
will not stand up to scrutiny. The challenge for us, as the noble Lord,
Lord Shipley, said, is that we have still got only 4% to 8% of
companies employing apprentices. It is still only a third of companies
in the FTSE 100. You can knock Ed Miliband and his view about
compulsion when hiring but it might be a salutary reminder to say that,

an apprenticeship. Of those who started apprenticeships in 2011, 71%

once a month every department came around and told me what it had
achieved or failed to achieve. Why on earth we are not saying to
companies which get public procurement contracts that they must declare

My Lords, I welcome the opportunity to set out what the Government are
doing to encourage young people to take an apprenticeship. I am most
grateful to my noble friend Lady Wilcox for tabling this debate and to
noble Lords who have raised some 
<?notus-xml column=1572?>important points. This also gives me particular pleasure because in
recent times my noble friend Lady Wilcox served as a BIS Minister in my
role.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000002">Apprenticeships
are at the heart of the Government’s drive to give people of all
ages the skills that employers need to compete in the expanding,
competitive global market. As several noble Lords have pointed out,
strong returns arise from apprenticeships. As my noble friend Lady
Wilcox has said, that is why we have seen a record 1.5
million people start an apprenticeship since 2010.</hs_para>

underlying principle of an apprenticeship is that it is a paid job that
incorporates on and off-the-job training that leads to nationally
recognised qualifications. After investing heavily in an apprentice, it
makes business sense for employers to keep employing individuals once
their apprenticeship ends. We need to do more to spread the word that
apprenticeships are good for the economy, good for business and good
for individuals. The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, raised the issue of the
Richard review and claimed that the implementation plan had given
permission to label any training an apprenticeship. With his other
comments, I take issue with him and with the points that the noble
Lord, Lord Young, made about the numbers. This is not just a numbers
game. Our aim in reforming apprenticeships is to make the programme the
new international benchmark for excellence. This is about quality, not
number-counting, and we are determined to raise all apprenticeships to
the standards of the best so that the programme is rigorous, responsive
and meets the changing needs of our economy in the decades to
come.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112867000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000004">I pay

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> The noble Lord, Lord Young, is
absolutely right, and I certainly pay tribute to Lord Dearing for the
work he did in this area. My overall point is that we need to combine
practical training and vocational training, as the right reverend
Prelate pointed out, and we very much focus on that, mixed, of course,
with the provision of academic study. I should also make the point that
there is a shortage of science and engineering skills in this country.
Again, the right reverend Prelate alluded to this, and it is very much
on our radar that we should look at this in respect of
apprenticeships.</hs_para>

high quality, rigorous and focused on what employers need. The reforms
we are making will put employers in the driving seat of developing
apprenticeships that are more rigorous, more responsive and deliver the
right skills. Additional rigour will come from a demand for higher
standards that will stretch apprentices by setting higher expectations
for achievement in English and maths, requiring more assessment at the
end of an apprenticeship, and recognising an apprentice’s
achievement through a grading system that ensures excellence that is
clearly seen and widely understood. These changes build on those
already introduced to raise quality, such as the minimum 12 months
duration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:24:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000008">My
noble friend Lady Wilcox raised a concern about over-bureaucracy. More
responsiveness will be possible from the sweeping away of lengthy,
convoluted, unnecessarily complex frameworks to bring in new, short,
clear standards that are written by employers, not bureaucrats.
Apprenticeships will then be able to focus on the skills and expertise
that employers want and need. Reviewing the standards every three years
will ensure that they remain relevant. The Government are also taking
specific steps to support access to apprenticeships for
young people as part of their work to deal with youth unemployment. We
want apprenticeships be held in the same high regard as university
degrees. My noble friend Lord Stoneham and the noble Lord, Lord Young
of Norwood Green, rightly alluded to this very important point. Young
people must be able to choose the right route to the skills and
knowledge they need for their career. Careers advice and guidance at
the right time have never been so important. It is crucial that
schools, colleges and universities play their part alongside the
National Careers Service in inspiring and helping young people to make
those choices. The noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, spoke about the
importance of schools taking responsibility for promoting
apprenticeships. If time permits, I should like to say more about the
careers advice questions that were asked during the
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000009">Apprenticeships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:25:35"></hs_TimeCode>
must also be open to all. Not all young people leave school ready for
the demands of an apprenticeship. I paid tribute earlier to the work
done by my noble friend Lord Baker and Lord Dearing on university
technical colleges. We have also introduced traineeships which enable
16 to 23 year-olds to develop the skills, experience and confidence
they need to compete for an apprenticeship. Higher apprenticeships
provide opportunities for able young people to undertake apprenticeship
training at a level equivalent to a degree. It is precisely because
apprenticeships must be open to all that the Government cannot create
an “entitlement”, or a guarantee, that an apprenticeship
will be available for every young person who would like one.
Recruitment decisions must rest with employers for apprenticeships as
much as for other jobs. Through the Education Act 2011, we
have prioritised apprenticeship funding for vulnerable young
people—those aged 16 to 18 and those aged 19 to 24 who have a
learning difficulty or disability, or who have been in local authority
care when they have found a place. This guarantee has priority over
funding for other places in line with our focus on supporting
vulnerable groups in all
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:26:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Addington, supported by my noble friend Lord Cormack, referred to
vulnerable groups—my noble friend Lord Addington focused
particularly on those with dyslexia—and exclusion in relation to
apprenticeships. I reassure them by saying that all apprenticeships
stretch and prepare individuals for sustained employment. Dyslexia
should not present an insuperable barrier to those candidates who
demonstrate competence and commitment in their chosen field. Access to
Work and Additional Learning Support are two possible sources of
funding to help provide equipment or other assistance for apprentices
with dyslexia. The Government certainly recognise that there is more to
be done to support apprentices with learning difficulties or
disabilities and we aim to improve the operation and delivery of
apprenticeships without jeopardising the standards that make them so
valuable to apprentices and employers. I would be delighted to meet my
noble friend Lord Cormack and the organisations that he mentioned,

fully fund apprenticeship training for 16 to 18 year-olds.
This reflects the fact that they are likely to need more supervision
and support initially and take longer to become fully productive in the
workplace. For all young people, the National Apprenticeship
Service—NAS for short—works with organisations that
provide careers advice to make sure the benefits and demands of an
apprenticeship, including what employers look for when recruiting, are
understood and can be fully explained to the young people with whom the
organisations work. NAS also provides an online apprenticeship
vacancies job site. Between 12,000 and 20,000 vacancies are on the site
at any time and can be accessed in a number of ways convenient to young

noble friend Lady Wilcox made a very valid point about the esteem of
apprenticeships. Apprenticeships are something to aspire to and
apprentices should be awarded recognition for their work just as
graduates are. As I have said, our goal is to see an apprenticeship
place valued equally to one at university. Celebrating success is so
important to this. National Apprenticeship Week 2014, on 3 to 7 March,
is an excellent opportunity to do just that. I know that all noble

predominantly unarmed and, by and large, the public work with them in
that they act as the eyes and ears of the police, they co-operate with
the police to enforce the law and maintain order, and they provide
information and give evidence in judicial proceedings. The police
should be “citizens in uniform” who act on behalf of,
with the approval of and with the collaboration of the public. Were
this not so, our police forces would have to be considerably larger and
they would undoubtedly have to be

flagrant disregard for the law, for the maintenance of order and for

people than of the white population is recruited into the police, that
there are even fewer black and minority-ethnic senior police officers
and that black and minority-ethnic police officers and police support
staff are more likely to face formal misconduct hearings does not help
black and other minority-ethnic communities to trust the police. Why
has the police service not tackled these race-related issues and why
have successive Governments not put pressure on the police service to
put its house in order?</hs_para>

deal with an issue, we have to admit that we have a problem. I believe
that the police fear that if they admit that they have a problem with
racism they will give their critics a field day, further undermine the
morale of front-line officers and allow the unjustified stereotyping of
all police officers as being racists. The statistics around stop and
search and those other issues in policing that I have just mentioned
continue to show that there is a problem that needs to be addressed.
Why have politicians shied away from the problem? When the police were
last accused of institutional racism, following the Macpherson inquiry
into the tragic death of Stephen Lawrence and the attempted murder of
his friend Duwayne Brooks, front-line officers disengaged from stop and
search for fear of being accused of racism. Street robbery increased to
such epidemic proportions that the then Prime Minister personally
pledged to bring down the number of street robbery offences. Neither
police officers nor politicians—or any of us—want to see
such an increase in crime again.</hs_para>

organisational failure and malpractice. The most alarming perhaps in
recent times is what has been discovered by the Hillsborough

to the reputation of the police service generally, not just to spare
the embarrassment of the senior officers responsible. This appears to
be an attempt to protect the reputation of the police ordered by some
senior police officers, not misconduct by the rank and file.</hs_para>

those who wish to think that attitudes have changed, I must disappoint
noble Lords. When I was the police commander in Lambeth in 2001 a small
riot took place in Brixton. In the subsequent investigation closed
circuit television was examined and revealed police officers apparently
beating an unarmed man on the ground with their batons. When that was
brought to my attention as the police borough commander, I called three
people—my immediate boss, the head of the internal investigation
and the chair of the local community police consultative group. A group
of trusted community leaders convened at the police station, where I
showed the CCTV footage and assured them that everything would be done
to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice. Apparently my
bosses were apoplectic that I had revealed such malpractice to members
of the community. I was told that next time I should not inform the
community unless and until we had identified the perpetrators and had
brought them to justice—presumably meaning that if we had not
identified the individuals we should have kept the public in the dark.
This is the understandable but unjustifiable mindset that still exists
among some senior police officers, which is unhelpful, unhealthy and
self-defeating. Openness at the time is far less damaging and can even
be reassuring to the public, rather than attempting to cover up and
being found out later. This culture of denial and cover-up, perpetuated
and encouraged by some of those at the very top of the police service,
inevitably impacts on those in the lower ranks, where there are
additional reinforcing
pressures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000033">Again
while I was at Brixton, a young police officer told me that he was
thinking of resigning from the police service. He said that the culture
in the military, from where he had come, was very different. He said
that in the military the most senior officer present when mistakes
occurred took responsibility and, if necessary, faced a court martial.
In the police, his experience was that mistakes were covered up, and if
they came to light responsibility was pushed down to the lowest
possible rank in order to protect senior officers. My 30 years of

Wasserman (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend
Lord Paddick on securing this debate. I was going to add, “on
this critically important and very timely subject”, but of
course this debate is really about two critically important and very
timely subjects—namely, public trust in the police and its role
in effective policing; and the system for investigating complaints into
police conduct. Although these are different subjects, 
<?notus-xml column=1580?>they are closely related. It is because public trust in the police is at
such a low ebb today that there is so much public concern about how
complaints against individual police officers are investigated. As we
all know, however, public opinion is notoriously fickle, and we must
guard against making fundamental changes to our institutions simply to
keep up with
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000041">I well
remember, as a young official in the Home Office many years ago, that
it was generally believed by the public—and reflected in the
policies of Ministers of both major parties—that the best way of
dealing with complaints against police officers was to allow chief
constables to deal with them. This was based on the equally firm belief
that those who had got themselves into trouble—that is, those
who had complaints filed against them—were a tiny minority of
police officers: the rotten apples at or near the bottom of the pile.
That is why we thought that their elders and betters—those of
ACPO rank—could be relied upon to sort them out in one way or
another.</hs_para>

this belief that most police officers were fundamentally honest and
that chief constables were the best people to deal with their own
“rotten apples” was undermined towards the end of the
last century by both the Scarman inquiry into the Brixton riots and the
Stephen Lawrence inquiry in 1999. As a result of what the public
learned from these inquiries, they were no longer prepared to trust
ordinary police officers to behave properly or to trust chief officers
to investigate complaints against their colleagues honestly and
fairly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:50:53"></hs_TimeCode>. This in
turn led to the demand for an independent element in the police
complaints procedure; it was in response to this demand that an

as I have already said, public opinion is something of a fashion
industry. As recently as two years ago, when your Lordships were
debating the then Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill, the
public’s main concern about policing was not how to improve the
integrity of officers but how to improve their value for money. As a
result, local chief constables were once again given the main
responsibility for handling complaints, including appeals, against
their officers. The IPCC would now consider only complaints and appeals
which were thought to be, or classified as, “serious”.

although perhaps not surprisingly, public opinion has changed again in
the last year or two. This is because so many of the police officers
who have managed to get themselves into trouble in the last few
years—or, more accurately, whose inappropriate behaviour has
been exposed in the last two years—were not at the bottom of the
barrel, but at the very top. The public once again turned against chief
constables and decided that they could not, after all, be trusted to
deal with complaints against their own officers.</hs_para>

employed in the professional standards departments of local forces.
Indeed, as recently as Monday of this week, the commission set up by
the Labour Party under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord
Stevens, which we will be discussing in this Chamber next Thursday,
recommended the creation of a new national body to handle police
complaints. Why? It was because, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord
Stevens:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13112867000282" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000282">“The

I said a few minutes ago, I am very worried about making changes to
institutions as fundamental to our society as our police complaints
system simply as a response to public opinion polls. If the problem he
is concerned to tackle really is, as the noble Lord, Lord Stevens,
believes, a loss of public confidence in police integrity, the answer
must be to take steps to improve police integrity. The response cannot
be to accept the present level of police
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T15:50:42"></hs_TimeCode>integrity as a
given and try to work round it by transferring responsibility for
police complaints away from chief constables to a team of civilians in
a national body. This will simply reinforce the public’s loss of
confidence in the police. It will also damage the confidence of those
chief officers—the vast majority of whom, I hasten to add, are
public servants of the highest professional standard and men and women
of unimpeachable integrity.

do not accept that nothing can be done about police integrity, or what
some people call police culture, or that, for this reason, we must not
let chief constables anywhere near the arrangements for handling police
complaints. Police integrity is no doubt in a bad place at the moment
but something is being done about it. The Government’s College
of Policing has already begun to tackle the issue with determination. I
am optimistic about what the college will achieve, particularly if its

any way.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112867000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000048">In
short, making major changes to the way police complaints are handled is

one PCC as, “labyrinthine, slow and bureaucratic”. They

are plenty of reasons for changing the present arrangements, but the
changes must deliver a system 
<?notus-xml column=1582?>which is much more user friendly, quicker, more transparent and more
responsive to local needs. All this points to keeping the complaints
system as local as possible. Policing is primarily a local service
whose principal aim is to make people safe in their own communities.
The best way of achieving that objective is by retaining responsibility
for local policing locally. As noble Lords will know, that is why I
argued so forcefully for police and crime commissioners, directly
elected by the people and accountable to

is also why I believe that complaints against local officers should be
dealt with within the local community. If the local community is not
prepared to trust its chief constables to deal with complaints, the
answer is not to transfer responsibility to the centre. The way forward

arrangements of the force and hold the PCC accountable for the way
complaints are handled in the same way as the PCC is accountable to the

in one London borough there was a disparity of 400 in relation to
burglaries from dwellings. I would be interested to hear the
Government’s response to
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000056">Having
looked through the Library note and the analysis of the role of the
IPCC, I ask: do the Government feel that it is genuinely as independent
as it should be? Does it really have the necessary powers to inspire
confidence in the public that it is independent and that it can
genuinely and thoroughly investigate complaints? As the report pointed
out, it cannot call evidence from non-serving officers or those who
have retired. That seems a yawning gap in its role. Some would suggest
that, given its make-up, the commission is not truly
independent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000057">Like
the two previous speakers, I do not want to cast aspersions on the

satisfactorily, and I think that the majority of them do a difficult

ignored. A number of recent cases, which are not just about police
constables but go much further up the hierarchy of command, give the

Doocey (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord
Paddick for enabling the House to consider the question of public trust
in the police. Public trust is absolutely vital. A loss of public trust
can damage the reputation of any organisation, but because public trust
is vital to the functioning of the police, the effects of its loss are
much
worse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000059">The
problem has become more acute in recent years because of a change in
the climate of public opinion. People have become increasingly
sceptical about power and authority generally. In a healthy democracy,
that is not necessarily a bad thing, but this scepticism can easily tip
over into a corrosive
cynicism.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000060">Therefore,
it has become more important to ensure that public trust in the police
is protected and enhanced. This can be done only through the effective,
transparent and fair resolution of complaints made against our police.
The vast majority of police officers are honest and hard-working, and
they should not have to suffer public criticism because of the failure
to investigate properly the activities of a badly performing
minority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000061">The
system currently used to resolve complaints is through the Independent
Police Complaints Commission. However, there are a large number of
problems with the IPCC that combine to undermine public confidence. The
IPCC generally lacks independence from the police. Most investigations
of complaints are carried out by the police themselves, and relatively
few are investigated independently by the IPCC. When the IPCC
investigates 
<?notus-xml column=1584?>complaints, a large number of these investigations are conducted by
former or seconded police officers. The IPCC lacks transparency and
does not do enough to ensure trust and confidence in its
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000062">A
major problem for the IPCC is its perceived lack of independence. That
is ironic, given that the principles of transparency and independence
were central to its creation. Unfortunately, the IPCC has not lived up
to those high hopes of independence. It has the power to carry out
independent investigations, but in the vast majority of cases it
delegates those investigations to the
police.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000063">There
are presently four categories of investigation. Most fit into the two
least serious categories—local investigations and supervised
investigations—where all investigation work is done by the
police. That is not a problem when it comes to more minor cases, where
a complainant agrees to a local review. However, it is a problem when
the case is more serious. The third and more serious category of
investigation is the managed investigation. This still relies on police
to carry out the investigative work. Even when we reach the most
serious of the four categories, independent investigation, many people
would be surprised to find that, in most cases, it is still former or
seconded police officers who carry out the investigations. That lack of

statistical review identified that, in 2011-12, the IPCC upheld more
than 1,400 appeals against the outcome of investigations—a huge,
40% increase on the previous year. The IPCC investigates
only a tiny proportion of complaints about the police and only a small
proportion of even the most serious cases. That becomes absurdly clear
when one sees how many complaints are made and how few are investigated
independently. In 2011-12, more than 31,000 complaints were made about
police officers in England and Wales. Compare that figure with the
total number of police officers in post—some 134,000—and
the scale of the problem becomes
clear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000065">Of
course, not all complaints warrant the attention of the IPCC. It is
right that low-level complaints about rude and uncivil behaviour by
police officers, for example, should be considered by their
supervisors, provided there remains an independent appeals process.
However, not enough serious cases are subject to independent
investigation. For example, of the 128 deaths in police
custody in the five years to 2008-09, only 43—just over a
third—were independently investigated. The overall number of
referrals—that is, the more serious cases demanding the
attention of the IPCC—was 2,165 in 2011-12. However, of those
2,000-plus referrals, the IPCC launched only 126 independent
investigations—just one for every 17 cases

restore public confidence in the independence of the IPCC, we need more
independent investigations and fewer police officers working as IPCC
investigators. We should remember that it is not just for victims that
we need an effective police complaints system. Only by prompt, open and
fair investigation will honest police officers be able to continue to
police by consent. I look forward to the opportunity to address this
issue in more detail as we continue to consider the Anti-social

O'Neill of Bengarve (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble
Lord, Lord Paddick, for his very courageous speech. I listened with
great care and I think we all learnt from it. I should declare an
interest as the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission,
which undertook some work on the disproportionate use of stop and
search and managed to show that reducing levels of stop and search, in
particular its inequitable application, does not in any way lead to
increased crime. That is an extraordinarily important empirical
finding.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000068">I
want to talk about trust. I am not an expert on policing, but I have
thought a good deal about trust and trustworthiness in other contexts.
It is a constant worry in most areas of public and commercial life that
there may be a crisis of trust, that things may have gone radically
wrong.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000069">There
is very mixed evidence for that claim, because the evidence that people
like to cite is that of the opinion polls. In the case of most of
those, we do not have a long time series, so it is difficult to compare
the past with the present and to draw that conclusion of the declining
level of public trust. Where we have longer series—20 years,
say—we find that the people who came low in the trust rankings,
for example, politicians and journalists came low 20 years ago and
those who came high, for example, judges and nurses, came high 20 years
ago. Most of the rest of us are in between. That is mixed
evidence.</hs_para>

I think that this is probably the wrong sort of evidence to focus on.
What we are really interested in is trustworthiness rather than trust.
To get evidence of trustworthiness is a good deal harder. How does it
make a difference if we switch to think about trustworthiness? I start
by characterising the received view on these matters as consisting of a
claim, an aim and a view about the task that we face. The claim is that
the trust has gone down and the aim, it is said, is more trust. The
task, therefore—I hear the conclusion coming from all
directions—is that we must rebuild
trust<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:11:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000071">I
do not think that that is a sensible position. I do not want just more
trust; I want something much better. I want more well placed trust and,
if you please, more well placed mistrust. For example, I do not think
that it was desirable that all those people placed their trust in the
aptly named Mr Madoff, who then made off with their money. That was an
example of too much trust placed in the wrong
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:11:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000072">My
view is that what we really want is trustworthiness before trust. Our
proper question should be: how do we increase trustworthiness? It is
not easy, of course. It is much harder to think about trustworthiness
than to think about trust, but it is pointless for us to seek better
trust in the police unless we think first about what helps and supports
the police in being trustworthy, and what helps and supports the police
complaints procedures, current or future, to be trustworthy. When we
have thought about trustworthiness, that is the time to start thinking
about how we might increase the alignment of public trust with
trustworthiness.</hs_para>

have been popular over the past 20 years as to what one should do. It
is thought that we should go for more accountability. Who can be
against that? It also thought that we should go for more transparency.
Who, it is said, can be against that? I am only selectively for
transparency and accountability. Those remedies have, after all, been
tried energetically and repeatedly—you could even say,
obsessively—for some 20 years, but they do not seem to have
worked. Is it sensible to say, “We must try harder. We must do
more, we must jump in and have more of the remedy that did not

the supposed
remedies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:13:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
forms of accountability that have been instituted in policing and
elsewhere have not always been brilliantly designed. We all know that,
sometimes, detailed regulation works by setting targets. Targets have
been set in policing and the targets that have been thought appropriate
in policing have sometimes, including recently, been subject to change.
That suggests to me that we need to think much more carefully about
which targets we have and what effects the setting of
targets has. In general, the problem with targets is not that they are
ineffective but that they are all too effective. Once targets are set,
people know what the aim is, and they pursue the targets at the expense
of the broader, deeper social aims. That, perhaps, has happened in
policing, in which I am not expert, as it has in higher education,
which I know a bit about, and certainly in
schooling.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000075">We
also need to think about what the real aims of policing are. I do not
intend to enter into that large debate but I take it that we probably
have a considerable measure of consensus there. We need accountability,
but we need intelligent accountability and we have had to do without it
all too often. What sort of processes would help us to secure more
intelligent forms of accountability? Here, we are looking at the
thickets that grow up around primary legislation, so I would bring it
back to Parliament in part.</hs_para>

legislation seems odiously detailed when you are looking at a Bill, it
nevertheless leaves a great deal that is open. In its wake comes masses
of regulation, with codes of practice and guidelines. In another
context, I was told by a midwife that the trouble was that it took
longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby. Something has gone
wrong if anywhere in our public life we have forms of regulation that
achieve that, where the accountability measures disrupt performance of
the primary task. I have heard, as all your Lordships will have heard,
complaints again and again that police officers are overwhelmed by that
aspect of accountability. We conduct many consultations; we conduct
them until the cows come home. Yet seemingly we do not have reliable
ways of weeding out dysfunctional, useless and merely burdensome forms
of accountability. I am sure that we can do better.</hs_para>

word or two on transparency. Suppose that we had a better set of
systems of accountability, which were not dysfunctional but useful to
police officers. How then would we link that to systems that would help
the public to discriminate and would strengthen the trust
placed in trustworthy policing? If trustworthiness is to be matched by
public trust, we need to pay attention to how the public are 
<?notus-xml column=1587?>enabled, or not enabled, to place trust in others’ performance.
It is often said that transparency will do that. Transparency is about
putting more information into the public domain, as we all know, and
that creates certain incentives. I believe that this remedy is
inadequate. Transparency is surely, in the first instance, a really
good remedy for secrecy, including inappropriate
secrecy.</hs_para>

intelligently placed trust we need more than a reduction in secrecy.
Secrecy is after all not the only problem with the procedures of the
police, or indeed with IPCC investigations. Trust is given only when
the public can judge the honesty, competence and reliability of those
in whom they might place their trust. If the processes for
investigating complaints that the IPCC or a successor body uses do not
enable ordinary people to judge the honesty, competence and reliability
of the police, they will not enable ordinary people to put well placed
trust in policing. It is that matter of discriminating, well placed
trust and, where appropriate, well placed mistrust that surely goes to
the heart of
it.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_28_PT_1/3B2735B5D96087235CA31240A7A2D6FFF635E2B1" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 November 2013">Thursday,

our police forces for their major role in establishing a courteous and
sensitive society. Like many of my colleagues, I have, for example,
accompanied police when they have been sharing news of a tragedy with
relatives. I have been consistently impressed by the careful way that
they have gone about their task. It is professionalism of the highest
order. That reputation does indeed depend on the confidence of the
public. I was a vicar in Sheffield at the time of the Hillsborough
disaster in 1989, and I spent much of the following week taking
relatives of the Liverpool fans who had died onto the Hillsborough
pitch, working with police officers who were invariably courteous,
sensitive and supportive. It is tragic that so much good work has been
lost to our collective memory by the subsequent lack of confidence in
senior police behaviour at that

I was the vicar of the south Yorkshire mining community of
Wath-upon-Dearne at the time of the 1984 miners’ strike, when
relationships between police and the community were at their most
fraught. Reputation then was upheld—significantly—only by
the story that the police officers guilty of taunting the community
were not the local officers whom we knew, but officers imported from
Sussex and other places south of the Trent. I still do not know whether
that was true, but it was a very convenient story for all sides in that
tense situation. Confidence becomes fragile so quickly. In many of our
communities, however, trust is still based on personal knowledge of
individual police officers. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Wasserman, for stressing the importance of keeping policing local,

behaviour delineated there, for the police to build that confidence
based on community relationships. These standards are filled with
detail of how that relationship is to be developed, and I welcome the
robustness of the sections on honesty and integrity, authority, respect
and courtesy, and equality and diversity. Those are at the root of the
proper use of authority by a citizen police force that is a part of our
society and not set apart from it in order to police it. Police forces
are given authority by the public and trusted to use it honestly, and

have two general points about the code on which I would be grateful for
comments from the Minister. First, I regret what seems in the code and
in our discussions about the IPCC to be a note of persistent
negativity. The code seems more concerned with preventing bad policing
than promoting the good. Not for one moment do I deny that we need to
stop bad policing, and that where it happens we need to make due
inquiries about it; but “thou shalt not” goes only so far
in creating an effective culture for the way in which we work
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000084">It
would be good to see the code developed so that it points confidently
to the part that policing can and I believe does play in building a
good society, creating and upholding the Queen’s peace, and
positively establishing a foundation of confidence on which our
communities will flourish. I have seen good policing doing just that,
in personal contacts with those in need, in good relationships with
local schools, and in the way in which, where necessary, arrests are
carried out. The negativity of the code is understandable because it
grew out of a disciplinary code, but positive energy for the common
good is even more crucial than the elimination of bad
practice.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112867000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000085">I
would also value a comment from the Minister on those points where the

support some of the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady
O’Neill. A key stated criterion in the code is,</hs_para>

of that could be that an action is good or bad only if someone is
watching or if somebody finds out about it. That cannot be the
only—or an appropriate—moral imperative. Honesty and
integrity exist or do not exist whether or not anyone knows about them.
If the culture of respect to which the noble Lord, Lord Young, referred
is to be developed among our police, the College of Policing would do
well to get on to the front foot in its ethical work so that our police

Jones of Moulsecoomb (GP):</Member></B> My Lords, 100 years ago last
month, my father’s father, Thomas 
<?notus-xml column=1589?>Jones, was killed in the Senghenydd mining disaster in south Wales,
along with 438 other men and boys. It is still the worst industrial
accident ever to happen in these islands. It left hundreds of widows
and orphans, including my grandmother, Polly, who had seven children,
including my father, Percy, who was eight. The mine owners paid out
something like £26 in total for all those men and boys. My dad
therefore grew up in abject poverty. He and one of his brothers had to
share a pair of shoes; one of them would wear them one day to school
and the next day the other would wear them. After the First World War,
when my father left school, rather than work down the pit that had
killed his father, he and a brother walked all the way from Abertridwr
in south Wales to London to find work. They slept in Hyde Park on
benches until the Salvation Army found them and fed and
sheltered
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000087">My dad
found work in London and then moved to Brighton, where he met and
married my mother, Christine. She came from a staunch Labour Party
family. Her granddad, Will Evans, was the first Socialist—no
Labour Party back in the 1890s—councillor on Brighton Council.
He was a strong supporter of trade unions. During the Second World War,
my dad was a cook with the RAF while my mother painted railway engines.
When the war was over, they moved to a new suburb of Brighton,
Moulsecoomb, which was part of the Homes Fit for Heroes project. I grew
up very happy and secure, with my brother Allan, not realising that we
were quite poor and the last in our road to get a fridge, a phone or a

the issue of this debate, I would like to say trust in the police has
always ebbed and flowed, but “plebgate” has caused a
flurry even among the usual supporters of the police. Even the middle
classes are saying, “If the police might do something like this
to a government Minister, what chance does a working class youth have
on a council estate?”. I have been working on the issue of trust
in policing for more than a decade. I published a short report this
year that looked at the levels of trust among young Londoners and the
Met. I went and talked to young people and listened to them, and I
found out what they thought. It was very marked that they did not trust
the police. It was also marked that they differentiated between
different parts of the police. Local police they accepted and saw as
doing a generally good job, but the TSG—the Territorial Support
Group—for example, was heartily disliked. Young people talked
about “bully vans”, and about how the TSG would come into
their streets, cause problems, make messes and then leave the sorting
out to the local police.</hs_para>

seemed to be a result of stop and search. Although most young people
could actually see a use for it, and felt that it might make them safer
sometimes if the police found weapons on others, they disliked the way
it was done. Again and again, Met officers managed to mess things up
because they did not show professional politeness and did not
communicate
properly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000091">My
years of Met scrutiny, first on the Metropolitan Police Authority and
now on City Hall’s Police and Crime Committee, have led me to
the conclusion that the police’s biggest problem is
communication. If forces could communicate better, they would hear more
useful intelligence from communities, and get more support on the
streets and fewer attacks in the press, which would raise morale
internally and improve the public’s confidence. For example,
recently I complained that the Met was reducing its training of armed
officers. Now this really is an area where you would think that you
need the maximum amount of training, the highest level; there are
already enough incidents and we do not want any more. It was explained
to me by the Met that the training had reduced slightly but appeared to
be generally better for officers and their skills. But the Met had not
bothered explaining the changes to anybody. They had not communicated
properly, which wasted my time, their time and actually gave them some
unfavourable
publicity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000092">Then
there are the undercover police, spying on and sleeping with their

targets are people—women—who are innocent and who have
not committed a crime. The officers have intruded in their lives to
the most astonishing degree. One of them even fathered a
child—and then vanished, of course. The Met seems strangely
mixed up about this. In public the Met Commissioner has told me that
such activity, sleeping with targets, is never authorised. In court,
the Met lawyers claimed that the police who were charged had been
authorised. At some level, there is a deep amount of confusion about
this. It really does need cleaning up.</hs_para>

do not normally tell anecdotes, but I will tell one. A long time ago,
before the current rules on evidence-taking, I gave a statement to the
police after seeing someone behaving suspiciously. I was asked what he
looked like and what he wore, and I said, “I couldn’t
really see. He was wearing dark clothes”. The statement, as
written by a police constable, was: “He was wearing a pale grey
sweater with a navy V-neck trim”. I refused to sign it but I am
ashamed that I did not take it further. However, I realise that that
has coloured the attitude—the trust—that I have. That is
one reason why neighbourhood policing is so important, because it is
not just about the content of what is done but the impression that is
made. Neighbourhood police are the police whom the public meet day to
day, whether north or south of the

My personal experience has had a particular impact. I think that
personal experience has an impact because one applies one’s own
judgment and makes one’s own assessment of trustworthiness.
There is a different approach to assessing trustworthiness in the case
of individuals and of institutions. I was interested in the comment
about young people making a distinction between local police and the
TSG. When you look at individuals you are more discriminating and
nuanced, but of course you often judge the whole institution by a small

course, these are general comments that apply to public service
generally, as did the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Young, about the
necessity and difficulty of changing culture. There is a range of
obvious reasons why trust in public services and public servants is so
important—that is blindingly obvious, and I apologise for my cod
philosophy. However, without trust, how can one win the co-operation of
the public or, as my noble friend Lord Paddick, has termed it,
“collaboration”? That may be right, because it suggests
partnership, which is so necessary for

reason for the importance of public trust is its impact on recruitment.
The police, like other services, need to recruit good people and I
doubt that anyone is more upset by the bad apples than other officers;
in that, I echo my noble friend Lady Doocey. The police service needs
to be a service with which people want to be associated. It needs to be
seen by young people thinking about it as a career path as a profession
of which they would be proud to be a member, and one that would provide
job satisfaction. Therefore, like other noble Lords, I welcome the
College of Policing, about which we will talk more outside this

recruitment and retention, it is clearly necessary to recruit a mix of
people who inspire trust. Some people trust the stereotypical powerful
authority figure, but even that figure does not necessary come in the

and search has been mentioned. That is not just a matter of numbers or

how they are treated. Transparency is also a component, as has been
said. However, I share the view that it is not a panacea. It is not
just a matter of pushing information into the public domain. Indeed,
one way of concealing information is to give so much that what matters

crime commissioners but I want to mention police and crime panels. We
cannot assess the success or otherwise of commissioners without also
looking at the panels because they have the specific role of being a
check and balance, for which they need powers and resources. They

scepticism. I absolutely agree with her. Her Reith lectures on the

talking about some of the issues concerning policing and trust, I want
to make only a very limited point—one which I think is
sustainable—about transitions in public mood. I agree with the
noble Lord, Lord Wasserman, that we need to be careful about these
matters as the public mood can be enormously fickle. I draw attention
particularly to the <I>Survey of Public Attitudes Towards Conduct in
Public Life</I>, which was published in September 2013 by the Committee
on Standards in Public Life, often known as the Nolan committee, of
which I am the recently appointed chairman. The survey looks at public
perceptions of trust in public officeholders, including the police and
politicians. There is a general trend in the survey, and in surveys of
this type across Europe. Our survey is entirely compatible with the
data from the European Social Survey 2002-10. Our survey states that
the European

national parliaments, political parties and politicians, tend to be

are not alone in this. We are typical. In our survey, judges score
particularly highly as to the amount of trust the public is prepared to
bestow upon them. The police come next with a level of public
acceptance of almost 70%. This is a summary of the results from 2004 to
2012. Cabinet Ministers lurk at around 25% to 26%. Until recently, in
our country in this type of polling the police have been running at
more than twice the levels of respect or trustworthiness of Cabinet
Ministers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:45:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13112867000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000110">However,
looking at more recent polling there is evidence of a worrying change.
For example, in a recent YouGov poll, respondents who trust senior
police officers have decreased from 72% in 2003 to 49% in 2012, and a
quarter of those surveyed by ComRes in 2013 said that the plebgate
affair has made them less likely to trust the police. These very
high-level indicators do not characterise the surveys carried out by
the Nolan committee. Let me give a health warning: I take seriously
everything that the noble Baroness, Lady O’Neill, says about
such surveys. However, for 
<?notus-xml column=1594?>what it is worth it does seem possible that, over the past year, a

year in the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:49:46"></hs_TimeCode> name
of the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, with a technical title about looking at
police performance management statistics. This most interesting debate,
in the Moses Room, looked at gaming in the police service and the
gaming of statistics. The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, has played a major
role in drawing attention to these interesting questions. As an
academic, I think it only fair to add that gaming, as the noble
Baroness, Lady O’Neill, said, is not confined to the police
service, and can also be found, as we both agree, in universities. That
debate, although it was an important and serious, attracted little
attention. Since then the momentum around this question has been
transformed. The Public Administration Select Committee has announced
that it is going to hold an inquiry into the management and accuracy of
police statistics. It is a major consideration in terms of the public
trust. Earlier this month my own committee, the Committee on Standards
in Public Life, made a submission on this question to the Public
Administration Select Committee, and in the middle of last week the
<I>Times</I> front page led with serious questions about how accurate
our police statistics have been and about the pressures that existed in
the past which have perhaps ensured they are not as accurate as we
would hope they would be. So there has been a dramatic change in that
one specific area in just a few
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:49:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000112">Taking
a more positive view, one interesting thing in the last few weeks is
the publication by the College of Policing of its <I>Draft Code of

fact that the Nolan principles, particularly those of honesty,
accountability, integrity and leadership, have been put at its heart.
In principle, this document from the College of Policing is a good
thing. I want to add a few caveats and concerns about the current
draft. One is that in the earlier code of conduct for the Police
Service of Northern Ireland from 2008, there is a clearer relationship
between not living up to the code of conduct and possible issues of
misconduct. It is much clearer in the PSNI document than in the College
of Policing document. The great danger is that the College of Policing
statement of principles just becomes abstract and out there and is not
fully operationalised in the conduct of police
officers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T16:49:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the things that have become clear during the past three and a half
years are the reservations felt by the Government about the police. The
creation of police and crime commissioners, the setting-up of the
Winsor inquiry and some of the provisions on policing in the current
Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill are a reflection of the
Government’s apparent feeling that the police are no longer one
of us. It seems at times that the fact that crime has been falling for
a considerable number of years appears to the Government to have
happened despite the police rather than, at least in part, because of
the contribution of the police.</hs_para>

enough to take part in the police parliamentary scheme and to have

also spent some time with officers on immediate response duties and
with the traffic police, as well as with police community support
officers. You certainly see and begin to appreciate some of the
frustrations and aggravations that police officers have to put up with
daily and the importance of the ability to keep calm, to keep
one’s temper and in potentially very heated or dangerous
situations to think rationally and coolly, and act decisively in order
to prevent things getting totally out of hand. While there are
certainly glaring exceptions to this, I think that, overall, the police
do a far from easy job very well

very helpful briefing that we have had from the Library provides some
firm information on trust in the police. It refers to a recent Ministry
of Justice report which analysed data from the 2010-11 Crime Survey for
England and Wales and considered long-term trends which suggest that,
from the early 1980s until 2001, there was a gradual decline in public
ratings of the police but that, more recently, public ratings of the
police have improved. On current levels of confidence in the police
according to the Ministry of Justice report, approximately
three-quarters of the sample agreed that they had confidence in the
police in their area, 13% disagreed that this was the case and 15%
expressed no opinion. Approximately 85% agreed that the police would
treat them with respect if they had contact with them for any
reason.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000119">The
Library briefing also refers to a report using data from the European
Social Survey to compare levels of trust in the police across Europe.

Ministry of Justice’s report to which I referred a few moments
ago considered levels of trust in the police among different genders,
ethnic groups and socioeconomic groups. The analysis undertaken
indicated that opinions of the police were more favourable among

results of those two surveys do not suggest that everything is perfect

suggested or implied by some, although not here this afternoon, unless
there has been a shift in attitude over the past three years that has

been expressed, particularly in the light of some recent events and

said, trust and confidence are vital, and that is no doubt one reason
why suggestions or evidence of any police failure to conduct themselves

the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, said, without trust and confidence there
will be less likelihood of communities and individuals working
collaboratively with the police, providing information, reporting
suspicions, coming forward as witnesses and reporting crime. That then

suggested that levels of trust in the police and in the criminal
justice system as a whole have a greater impact on levels of compliance
with the law than any perceived deterrent effect of the criminal
justice system. Others have argued that perceptions of fairness in the
way the police conduct themselves are an important determining factor
in the level of trust in the police and, with it, compliance with the
law. A further school of thought argues that trust is related to the
extent to which the police force is perceived as representative of the
society that it serves, which might mean that the lower levels of trust
in the police among ethnic-minority groups are, in part, a result of
the low representation of ethnic minorities within the police ranks.
Indeed, the Metropolitan Black Police Association suggested quite
recently that the police force remains “institutionally
racist”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000125">The
Government have taken various measures since they came into office,
some of which have hardly contributed to increasing confidence and
trust. They abolished the target introduced in 2009 under which police
forces were expected to achieve an improvement in public confidence, as
measured by the British Crime Survey. The policing pledge, which
introduced a set of 10 standards for the police, was also abolished. It
is interesting to see that, having done that, the Home Secretary has
now expressed astonishment that the police do not have a code of ethics
and has decided that such a code should be brought into

affect questions of confidence and trust will be the visibility and
availability of the police and their success rate in preventing and
solving crime. More than 10,000 police officers have been taken off the
front line since 2010, with neighbourhood police teams being cut. While
the government response to that is, in effect, “So

Officers says that the thin blue line is in danger of reaching a

with increases in the numbers of mugging and shoplifting incidents

has been a reduction in the solving of overall crime in 22 forces, with

increase in the number of rapes reported to police. There is a similar
trend in respect of child sexual abuse cases. Then there is the crime
that is rising fast—namely, fraud. This crime, particularly when
it occurs online, often goes unreported because people feel embarrassed
at having to admit that they have been taken in, and they also have
real doubts as to whether the police will be able to catch the
perpetrators

of the police work on online fraud and scams is geared to disrupting
such activities when they are identified, rather than the all too often
likely fruitless task of successfully identifying, building up a robust

area of police work that is seriously underresourced, no doubt in part
because so many victims do not often hit the headlines amid strident
calls for action. As long as there is a continuing failure to provide
the resources to get on top of, or even contain the rising rate of
fraud-related crime, it will slowly gnaw away at the issue

quality of police leadership is crucial and now very much under the

declaration of the principles and standards of behaviour expected of
those working in police forces. The code of ethics will be a living

the Independent Police Complaints Commission so that it is equipped to

will not be a transfer of officers to the IPCC but it will receive
substantial extra funding—I cannot give details of the

must consult victims of crime. This gives them a vital link to those
who have come into direct contact with the police and who will
therefore have a view on the integrity and behaviour of officers within

misconduct proceedings. The issues raised by the Andrew Mitchell case
are very serious. It is right that cases such as this hit the
headlines. We must remember that these are not the rule. Even so, it is
an issue and we are targeting unprofessional behaviour through the
range of measures that we are implementing alongside our partners. It
is a privilege for us in the Home Office to work with the IPCC, HMIC,
the College of Policing and PCCs to enhance police integrity, and we
look forward confidently to seeing some excellent results from this

I may address some of the issues that were raised in the excellent
speeches made in this debate. My noble friend Lord Paddick referred to
the difficulties 
<?notus-xml column=1600?>of black and ethnic minority recruitment into the police. I think we
would all agree that police forces that reflect the communities they
serve are crucial to cutting crime in a modern diverse society. While
the police force is much more representative than before, there is
still much to be done. The Government’s reforms will stimulate
progress. We support the aspiration of the Commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police to achieve a much better representation of BME
officers in the force in the next wave of officer
recruitment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T17:11:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0002.htm#13112867000140">My
noble friend also referred to stop and search, which is not a totally
unrelated issue. Where stop and search is used properly, it allows the
police to tackle serious crime effectively. Where it is used badly, it
can cause personal humiliation for the individual, a disconnect between
the police and the public and an undermining of public confidence. A
number of reports have raised concerns about the use of this power,
which is why we have undertaken a consultation on it and are currently
analysing the responses to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T17:11:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Doocey was concerned about the independence of the IPCC. I can
understand that concern. That is one of the reasons why it is having
funding of its own to recruit its own staff. About 80% of
the IPCC staff do not come from a police background. Investigators in
the most serious cases overseen by the IPCC can never have worked for
the police; they are not allowed to have worked for the police. All
IPCC investigators undergo a period of training. As I said, giving the
IPCC the resources to recruit its own independent investigators will be
a great step

extensive public commentary on the report that took place at the time
of its publication focused on our finding that the Government had until
that moment been rather unclear about UK military action in Syria. That
question was of course resolved by what has been rightly described as a

that vote and the events leading to it later in my remarks. The other
important findings of our report remain extremely relevant to future

years now, there has been a debate about the role of Parliament in
decisions about whether to use armed force overseas. In 2006, our
predecessor Constitution Committee undertook a major inquiry into this
area and produced a very substantial report. Since then, the position
has continued to evolve, with various proposals put forward about how
Parliament’s role could or should be formalised or, indeed,
enhanced. Both the previous Labour Government and the coalition have
considered whether to formalise Parliament’s role. It is also
relevant that in recent years there have been significant changes in
the nature of military intervention and the techniques of warfare. As a
result of all these developments, both political and military, we
decided to carry out a short inquiry into the constitutional
arrangements for the use of armed
force.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000155">We very
deliberately used the expression “use of armed force”
although the 2006 report had spoken of “waging war”. The
committee thought the term more

occur today. We thought it useful to examine developments in the
Government’s internal processes for deciding on the use of
force, as well as looking at how Parliament’s role may have
changed.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112867000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000156">Our
report dealt first with the Government’s internal
decision-making process. We were particularly interested in the
significant innovation in 2010 when the coalition Government created
the National Security Council. This is a Cabinet committee that meets
weekly under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister. Its membership
includes senior Cabinet Ministers and Armed Forces personnel. The
National Security Council has a very wide remit, covering all aspects
of foreign, defence, security and international development
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000157">The
committee explored the impact of the National Security Council in the
political and military sphere. Several witnesses commented positively
on how it has allowed a cross-departmental approach to develop in a way
that reflects the very close connections between foreign policy,
security and defence. Although not all the commentary on the council
was complimentary, we were informed that its existence ensures that
there is a regular and formal line of communication between Ministers,
military officers and the heads of the intelligence services. The
committee agreed that this was particularly valuable. It was clear that
effective structures were essential when it came to decisions on
deploying our forces

course, the committee recognised that informal discussions will always
take place outside the Cabinet room and that smaller, ad hoc groups of
Ministers and officials will no doubt make preliminary decisions.

consider that, taken as a whole, the Government’s current formal
internal arrangements seem appropriate. However, we were concerned that
these processes may not be generally very well understood. For example,
we looked at the Defence Council, which has been in existence since the
1960s and has formal legal authority for the conduct of defence in the
UK. One might therefore think that the Defence Council is a significant
factor in decisions on whether to deploy force. That is not the case.
The evidence we heard was almost unanimous that its practical role in
the UK’s defence arrangements is very limited. We were told that
it meets infrequently and is not involved in the executive
decision-making. Mr Andrew Robathan, who was then Minister for the
Armed Forces, told

now to the committee’s consideration of Parliament’s
role. Of course, the legal position on decisions to deploy force is not
in dispute. Such decisions are made by Her Majesty’s Government,
exercising the royal prerogative. Parliament has no legal role in
authorising and approving the use of armed force overseas. However,
that is not to say—as Members of the House will be very
aware—that Parliament does not scrutinise such decisions
closely. In recent years, the House of Commons has passed substantive
Motions to approve the deployment of force in Iraq and Libya, and now
to disapprove any intervention in Syria. Parliament has also
scrutinised several other conflicts through regular debates, Questions
and Select Committee inquiries. In 2013, it would be generally agreed
that it is commonly accepted that the House of Commons should have the
opportunity to debate decisions to use force before troops are
committed, unless there is an emergency and such action would not be
appropriate. The Government have stated that this is now a
constitutional convention and it is accordingly recognised at the
moment in the <I>Cabinet
Manual</I>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000163">The
debate in recent years has centred on whether this convention should be
formalised in any way, so as to require precise parliamentary approval
before force is deployed. Three possible options have been put forward
for another role for Parliament: first, a detailed resolution of the
House of Commons; secondly, primary legislation on this subject; and
thirdly, continued reliance on a constitutional convention. In 2008, as
part of its <I>The</I> <I>Governance of Britain</I> White Paper on
constitutional reform, the previous Labour Government proposed that a
detailed resolution should be passed by the House of Commons, requiring
the Government to secure its approval for the deployment of troops
overseas. It would be for the Prime Minister to decide when to seek
approval. In emergency situations, retrospective approval would not be
required. Nor would re-approval be required when the nature of the
conflict changed. The proposed resolution would not have had the force
of law, but would have meant that Parliament’s role was formally
set out. Although a draft resolution was produced, no progress was made
in implementing it before the 2010
election.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000164">When

necessary democratic legitimacy for a decision as important as this. It
is argued that Parliament’s role should be enshrined so that no

the other side of the current debate, none of those against formalising
Parliament’s role sought to argue that Parliament should have no
role. However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T17:32:08"></hs_TimeCode>,
the committee heard several arguments against having either a formal
parliamentary resolution or primary legislation. They were problems of
definition, the risk of challenge in the courts, the risk of
parliamentary engagement in operational decisions, the need to preserve
political and military flexibility, and the argument that, given our
convention, more formal procedures are just
unnecessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000168">Perhaps
I can elaborate briefly on some of those arguments. First, there are
the definitional problems. Formalisation would require
Parliament’s role to be codified in a workable way. There would
be major problems in what were called operational definitions. It will
be necessary, for example, to specify what type of action would engage
formal parliamentary involvement. For example, if the deployment of
ground troops—boots on the ground—was the trigger, as was
suggested in the 2008 proposed resolution, that would risk leaving out
such interventions as the bombing of Kosovo in 1999 and imposing the
no-fly zone over Libya in
2011.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000169">A
further decision would have to be made about the potential escalation
of any activity and about at what point approval would have to be
sought or might have to be renewed in different circumstances. The
military might want a blanket approval at the outset, but
parliamentarians might, for obvious reasons, want to keep their options
open. A further dilemma would be whether there should be exemptions for
emergency or secret deployments. If so, should Parliament’s
approval be retrospectively sought? If so, what would happen if
approval was
declined<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T17:33:34"></hs_TimeCode>? Having
looked at such complexities, the committee was not surprised that
Ministers still had difficulty in agreeing the best way
forward.</hs_para>

objection to formalisation was the need to ensure strategic political
and military flexibility. It was suggested, for example, that when the
UK’s international obligations required the Government to commit
to action with fellow NATO members, it would be detrimental to the
Government’s position for there to be any doubt about whether
they could commit. Any Government would also want to preserve
flexibility to take defensive action or deploy force in an emergency.
It is likely that any formalised process would leave a wide margin of
discretion to the Prime Minister about when and where to seek
Parliament’s approval, and there might in the end be so many
exemptions that the formal process itself became only
theoretical.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000171">Additionally,
there was the question of whether, if Parliament passed a formal law on
authorisation, for example, the statute might be liable to be
challenged in the courts and there might be judicial review. This was a
new risk raised, which I thought was very interesting. Our witnesses
were united in thinking that the appropriate forum for controlling and
scrutinising such decisions is Parliament. In noting a recent judgment
of the Supreme Court in Smith v Ministry of Defence, we were concerned
that this demonstrated the court’s apparent willingness to
become more involved in decisions relating to the battlefield. The
committee shared the concerns expressed to us about the negative effect
on the morale and operational independence of the Armed Forces when the
courts scrutinised some operational decisions. In response, again, the
Government have agreed with these comments and say that they will
vigorously defend cases which call into question the principle of
combat immunity, and will take further action as
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000172">To
me, perhaps the final and most persuasive argument against greater
parliamentary formality is that it is unnecessary. We understand that,
in practice today, any Prime Minister seeking to deploy force overseas
would politically be obliged to obtain the approval of Parliament,
except in very exceptional circumstances.</hs_para>

that formalising Parliament’s role would involve significant
difficulties and that such difficulties would outweigh any benefits. We
concluded that much of the impetus for formalisation was to make a
political statement rather than to correct deficiencies in the existing
legal or military process. We therefore recommended that neither
primary legislation nor a resolution should be introduced in an attempt
to formalise Parliament’s role.</hs_para>

wishing to be unduly wise after the event, I will return briefly to the
events of last summer in relation to Syria. Your Lordships will
remember that at the time of the report in July, there was widespread
and agitated discussion about whether the Government would arm
opposition forces in Syria. It was only after sustained parliamentary
pressure that Ministers gave an undertaking that the House of Commons
would be given a vote before any decision to arm the so-called rebels
was taken. As I said at the outset, it was the committee’s view
that the Government’s intentions had perhaps been unhelpfully
opaque. Very importantly, it was also unclear about how the Government
might intend to involve Parliament should Her Majesty’s Armed
Forces get further engaged in what seemed then, and seems now, an
escalating conflict.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1607?><hs_para UID="13112867000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000175">In late August 2013, the
Government reacted to the apparent use of chemical weapons by President
Assad’s forces in Syria by recalling Parliament. The proposal
then was for the House of Commons to debate a government Motion,
authorising the Government to take action in response to the attack.
However, the business for 29 August stated that the proposal was in two
stages and that before any direct British involvement, a further vote
of the House of Commons would take place. The House will not need
reminding that the Government’s Motion was defeated, and that in
response the Prime Minister immediately stated that the
Government would respect the wishes of the House of Commons. No further
consideration of military intervention has, at least publicly, taken
place.</hs_para>

major constitutional importance. First, the Government recalled
Parliament before any decision to deploy force was taken. The
Government respected the existing constitutional convention and, I
would say, perhaps further entrenched it. Secondly, the Government
immediately undertook to abide by the decision of the House of Commons,
even though Ministers legally retain the power to commit the Armed
Forces to action through the prerogative. Again, that can be seen as
strengthening the convention. Thirdly, the fact that the Motion, if
passed, would have involved a two- stage process of agreement by the
Commons showed the benefits of keeping these matters flexible. It seems
fairly clear that as a two-stage process of approval had not occurred
in any previous conflict, it is unlikely that it would have been
foreseen in any formalised resolution or legislation. In other words,
the practical and contemporary experience of the intense debate on
Syria underlined and demonstrated the correctness of our
report’s conclusions and recommendations.</hs_para>

permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, leading member
of NATO and contributor to several other alliances that our history,

wholehearted endorsement of the committee’s report, as I believe
its conclusions have been overtaken by the parliamentary discussion and

failure to act on their <I>Governance of Britain </I>White Paper of

period since 2008, we have seen from successive reports by the House of
Commons Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, and from several
discussions with the Minister, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, why we have
not achieved a satisfactory outcome. I should say that the Minister is
ideally placed to be answering this debate given his long experience of
all three relevant ministries in this discussion: the MoD, the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office and the Cabinet Office. Moreover, lest there be
any doubt, one of our witnesses, the former Foreign Secretary Mr Jack
Straw, who was the originator of the Labour Government’s
proposed detailed war powers resolution, told us when he gave evidence
for this report that he still believed that a formal resolution was the
way forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000184">I
will not labour the point that all sides were and have recently been
committed to giving the House of Commons a formal role in
approving the use of armed force in conflicts abroad. What sets me

go through the arguments that the committee poses as obstacles to
formalisation. The report highlights the difficulties of definition,
specifying the kind of action that would engage parliamentary
involvement. The detailed war powers resolution goes some way to
spelling out the definition of a conflict decision: this is if the use
of force is outside the UK and is regulated by the law of armed
conflict. For those who feel that this is too narrow, I suggest that
its definition is that of the director of Royal United Services
Institute, Professor Michael Clarke, who said,</hs_para>

obstacles include what we would do if Parliament was not in session.
The vote of 29 August demonstrated that a recall can be effective when
the situation is serious enough. As for when Parliament has been
dissolved, I argue that the Government of the day would have to take
the relevant decision through the exercise of the royal prerogative and
seek retrospective approval from the fresh
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000187">The
committee was also concerned about retrospective approval being sought
for certain emergency deployments. What would happen if approval was
declined? The draft detailed war powers resolution could be improved in
order to make provision for that through being provided with a 90-day
period when, retrospectively, it could call for UK deployments to
cease. That is what the US has, were Congress not to approve a
deployment under the War Powers Act. In other words, the action could
go ahead contingent on retrospective
approval.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000188">The
report also talks about problems of disclosing secret, legal and
tactical information. We saw all of them come into play on 29 August,
and I know, from having read <I>Hansard</I> extensively, that the
advice provided was insufficient for the Members voting in the other
place. I think that the proposal put to the other place’s
Political and Constitutional Reform Committee by my friend Professor
Philippe Sands is a good one. He argues that since the Attorney-General
is not Parliament’s law officer, the House of Commons should
consider appointing its own law officer who would interface with the
Attorney-General on the extent of disclosure to be provided. That law
officer could also interface with the Intelligence and Security
Committee and provide assurance of the legality of a course of
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000189">At
paragraph 53, the Committee also covers the difficulty of lifting the

best, experts disagreeing prove that there is a question mark over our
assessment in terms of what a key witness believes. My view is the same
as that of the committee: the condition would not be met, but these
different interpretations make my point precisely. It is that until a
draft resolution has been put forward by the Government for
consideration and a chance has been given to the relevant committees in
the House of Commons and this House, we cannot arrive at any consensus
about what conditions would require parliamentary approval and what
would not.</hs_parafo>

final point against formalisation: the justiciability of deployment

today’s world, it is right that our citizens expect that major
decisions of war and peace which are made in their name are made with

whether they are predictable or not. Where they are predictable, the
maximum information should be provided in advance. Where the actions
have to be taken as an emergency, they should be guaranteed the right
to disagree and have the tools with which to seek to draw back from the
decision. A parliamentary resolution such as that proposed in 2008 may
be capable of amendment and improvement. What is not in dispute in our
report is that Parliament has a role to play in these decisions; what
is regrettable is that all three political parties have pledged in the
past to formalise the role of Parliament on these decisions yet, in
office, seem to be incapable of honouring that commitment to the

time. Of course, the very deployment before hostilities can be a
deterrent in itself, but our current arrangements allow quick decisions
to be made and we have been able to act quickly, often before the
situation on the ground has deteriorated. As a member of NATO we are
committed to aid other members who are attacked, and the United Nations
charter mandates countries to undertake operations should the Security
Council require them. As a signatory to NATO and UN treaties, we are
expected to commit troops quickly when called on to do so.</hs_para>

possible and sensible, to seek parliamentary approval for deployment
before service men and women are committed, but there is a need for
some flexibility and it would not always be wise or practical to debate
prior to deployment, even though parliamentary debate and approval
would be highly desirable. It would also be reassuring for the Armed
Forces. I do not see it as particularly helpful for us to vote in the

first place, it is a widely perceived truth that the royal prerogative
in the area of committing forces to overseas conflict is an
anachronism. It was described in evidence to the House of Commons by
Professor Nigel White as an unregulated vestige of former
times<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T18:02:16"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
certainly the case that the movement of governmental opinion since 2003
has been rapid—and, to my mind, it has moved in an appropriate
constitutional direction. I do not think that it would be wise to reach
a final conclusion about these matters until we have heard from the
Chilcot committee of inquiry into the origins of the Iraq war, because
it is to be hoped that that will reveal something about the inner
workings of the decision-making process that have not yet been fully
revealed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000206">I
fully acknowledge and accept the comments of the Minister who is to
reply to this debate when he said on 24 October, in giving evidence to
the House, that we must recognise the urgency and secrecy requirements
of decision-making in certain circumstances if defence is to be
properly sustained and if the outcomes are to be favourable. Our troops
will require as much evidence as may be made available, but the public
are behind them in the actions they are taking. That, I believe, is one
of the strong points made in the distinguished report of the noble
Baroness, Lady
Jay<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T18:02:45"></hs_TimeCode>. It seems to
me that there are precedents for making transparent the issues that
face government. The law passed by Germany in 2005 requires
parliamentary approval to be given before the Executive can take a
decision. However, I admit that Germany’s global role is
considerably more limited at present than that of the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T18:03:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

out very clearly in the report is that the country needs reassurance
that action is being taken in accordance with international law. I
repeat my noble friend’s recommendation, taken from evidence
given by Professor Philippe Sands, that Parliament should have a legal
adviser. The Attorney-General does not, and cannot, fulfil that role
because doing so could involve a conflict of interest between the
advice that he gives to the Executive and that which he gives to the
legislature. However, if Parliament is to make decisions such as that
which it made on 29 August this year in respect of Syria, we need to
have the best evidence we can on the legalities of what is proposed.

accept the committee’s view that judicial review of such action
is neither appropriate nor desirable if one is to maintain the sense
among our fighting troops that they are acting in accordance with the
law and public opinion. I hope that the possibility of a statute will
not be pursued. None the less, there is a strong case for parliamentary
resolution: for setting out the requirements for the taking of action
and for approving or rejecting the proposals of the Executive.
Parliament, in particular the House of Commons, is the representative
of the people, and the decision in most cases should be that of the
people through their representatives. I therefore urge the Government
not to seek hurriedly to reconcile the differences that have been made
clear within it, but to think about the possibility of couching a
resolution in terms that are wide enough to cover most eventualities.

the threat of military force. Certainly, I never declared war, even
though we were involved in an exercise in which we sent 45,000 troops
fully armed and equipped to evict Saddam Hussein from
Kuwait<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T18:18:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

what authority we set up something called Operation Provide Comfort. We
had a United Nations resolution to evict Saddam Hussein from
Kuwait—a country that he should not have been in—but at
the end of that conflict, as some may recall, we found that he was
attacking the Kurds in northern Iraq. We sent into Iraq a Marine
commando unit, based, I think, on a Turkish air base at Incirlik, and
we conducted air patrols over northern Iraq. I am not sure under what
authority we did that, but it illustrates exactly the point made by the
noble and gallant Lord: things develop and you get mission creep,

background, I entirely understand why the Minister, in giving his
evidence to the parliamentary committee and discussing Mr William
Hague’s assertion that the necessity to consult Parliament would
be enshrined in legislation, said that we had found that things were a
bit more complicated—“a bit more complex” was, I
think, the phrase that he used—than we had previously imagined.
I agree with that very much. There are complexities and difficulties,

those debates on Syria, would it not have been a good thing if the

experience of this House and the advice brought to the subject would
have been available to the House of Commons? By accident, fortunately,
the House of Commons prevented us going to war. I was highly relieved
about that, which I made clear in my speech. That is one element that
might be added to convention. Otherwise, the Government’s

the report and the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, said, the committee looked
at the issue in 2006 and conducted an extensive inquiry. It came to the
conclusion more recently that with the establishment of the National
Security Council in 2010, the lack of clarity in the role of the
Defence Council and the changing nature of military interventions
overseas, it should have another look at the constitutional
arrangements. We are all grateful to the committee for

position on the use of force by Her Majesty’s Armed Forces is
clear. As noble Lords know, it is exercised by the Prime Minister of
the day and the Cabinet. It is a decision of the Government, and
Parliament has no legal role in authorising or approving the use of our
Armed Forces overseas. Parliament looks carefully at the use of force
and we in this House benefit from enormous expertise, such as that of
the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank, on such
matters. Members will be aware that for the conflicts in both Iraq and
Libya, there were votes to approve the use of force, that recently a
vote in respect of Syria was not carried and that the Government
respected those

is also important to point out that there could be emergency situations
when the immediate use of force is necessary. It would be helpful to
the House if the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, could elaborate,
as other noble Lords have asked, on the Government’s
decision-making process in respect of Syria. The committee rightly
highlighted that the Government took some time to make their position
clear. The committee during the course of its inquiry looked at the
internal decision-making processes of the Government, 
<?notus-xml column=1618?>and at the major difference since the 2006 inquiry with the creation of
the National Security
Council<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T18:23:07"></hs_TimeCode>. The
view of many is that this has been an important and significant

inquiry also confirmed the position of the Defence Council, and noble

Government welcome the report of this committee. As noble Lords will be
aware, the Commons comparable committee, to which I gave evidence last
month, is now compiling a similar report. We hope that that
committee’s report will be published within the next few weeks
and that it will take our debate a little further forward. The
Government will reflect on both reports and respond to the Commons
committee report. I have no doubt that in the course of the next year
our conversation will move

outlined in their response to this report, the Government are extremely
grateful for the committee’s thorough and thoughtful
consideration. As the committee recognises, the decision to deploy UK
troops in overseas conflicts is one of the most difficult and important
that a Government can take. We all recognise that the shadow of the
decisions on Iraq, and the fact that the available information which
led to the decision on Iraq was not entirely full, is part of the
context in which we have been discussing this ever
since<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T18:29:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

acknowledged that a convention had evolved whereby the House of Commons
should have the opportunity to debate and vote on such deployment
decisions before troops were committed, except when there was an
emergency and such action would therefore not be appropriate. Our
commitment to that convention was demonstrated most recently by the
Government’s decision to request the recall of Parliament on 29
August this year to debate the role that the UK should play in relation
to the conflict in Syria, and then to respect the will of the House of
Commons expressed by the subsequent vote. The committee’s report
concludes that that convention provides the best framework for the
House of Commons in which to exercise political control over, and
confer legitimacy on, decisions to deploy UK forces in overseas
conflicts.</hs_para>

have been, in this debate, a number of interventions saying that we
needed to go further and that we should formalise that convention

great deal of sympathy in this debate for the view that formalisation
through statute would perhaps attempt to make things too solid in a
situation where, as the noble Lord, Lord King, remarked, the definition
of armed conflict and the decisions about deployment we are taking
could take many forms. Those include whether or not one puts troops on
the ground, sends cruise missiles or drones or sends a training unit to
Mali, supported by a couple of transport planes, to deal with a
situation in which one is dealing not with conflict, let alone with
forces of another state, but with armed groups operating across borders
in states which do not entirely control their own territory and one
does not know how far they may have to go once they are there. That is
very much where we are
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112867000249" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-0003.htm#13112867000249">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T18:32:02"></hs_TimeCode>
have immense admiration for the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy, and indeed I
recall a stage in 1996 when we regarded him as so much the living
embodiment of the British constitution that my party arranged for him
to give a lecture on how coalition government might be formed, because
we thought that his would be an authoritative view if we found we had
to do so. I say to him that the idea that any Government could now say,
before committing troops to armed conflict, that we knew how long they
might be deployed for, let alone what the exit strategy might be, does
not fit with where we now find
ourselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T18:32:04"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-28T18:32:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
Mali is a good example. There are a number of other conflicts in Africa
at the present moment—indeed, there have been a number of other
requests for a couple of British transport aircraft or a training
team—of the sort that we are likely to be find ourselves in in
the coming years where the question of where the threshold comes is
very difficult to operate. That is part of the argument that we are
going through within government at the moment and about which we are
having a dialogue with Parliament.</hs_para>

response is that I find myself—rather to my
surprise—becoming one of the Government’s supposed
experts on this area, and we need to have a continuing dialogue with
Parliament about the numbers of deployments that we have. I remind the
House—as I said in evidence to the Commons committee—that
there are now 16 different operations overseas under 
<?notus-xml column=1621?>European common security and defence policy. The British have
contingents in 14 of these. I am sure all noble Lords taking part in
this debate could name all of them. In most cases, these are very small
numbers of people; some of them are policemen, not military. In all of
them, we are not entirely sure how secure they are or how long these
deployments will last. In places like Somalia and South Sudan, or in
Darfur, where we are often working with UN, AU or other forces, the
question of how far we are formally committed is itself not entirely
clear. That is part of the uncertain world in which we

are a number of other areas where it is not entirely clear where the
threshold is. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Guthrie, rightly pointed
out that the Gulf conflict involved a very major commitment of forces.
However, we found ourselves carrying on afterwards in Kurdistan, with a
number of much more shaded decisions to take. I think I recall being
told that there was a point during that deployment when the colonel in
charge of the Royal Marine commando issued orders to his companies, and
the Dutch major who was part of the commando said, “If you ask
my company to do that, I will need to refer back to The Hague”.

international law requires. Do we have to have a resolution of the UN
Security Council, with all five 
<?notus-xml column=1622?>permanent members authorising the action? The western powers intervened
in Kosovo with some real sense of legitimacy, in spite of the
resistance of some permanent members of the Security Council. Do we
have to be sure that we can justify what we did in terms of the concept
of just war? In the aftermath of the Iraq war, I remember taking part
in a rather large Anglo-American conference, jointly organised by the
Anglican Church and the Roman Catholic Church, on the concept of just
war and coming away thinking that we had failed to agree on what that

We will continue to reflect on this. The Government’s response
to the Commons committee will be the next stage in that. Part of that
reflection will be whether we are satisfied that this convention has
now become strong enough or whether we should yield to the demands in
both Houses that what we now need is a resolution. If so, we need to
reflect on how that resolution should be formed and what sort of
threshold one might need to write into such a resolution, as well as
the continuing dialogue that Parliament and the Government need to have
about the commitment of armed forces. In future these are likely to be
in relatively small elements, which are multinational, in which the
British may not be a major element, in which we are in support of the
troops of other nations, in which we are dealing with multiple conflict

the difficulties of formulating any process more formally than the one

change his mind. When I report back to it, that will be something of
which it is particularly proud. The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner,
illustrated the animated discussions that we had within the committee

wish to inform the House of some further important steps that the
Government is planning to take to tackle bovine TB (bTB). BTB is the
most worrying and costly animal health problem facing our cattle
farmers today, with more than 305,000 cattle slaughtered in Great
Britain in the past decade alone. These plans are designed to address
the risk of cattle to cattle transmission of the disease. They form
part of the Government’s wider strategy for achieving national
bovine TB free status in England within 25
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112854000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-wms0001.htm#13112854000005">Today I
am announcing our approach for addressing a number of long-standing
weaknesses in our bovine TB controls. The first concerns the problem of
late TB tests by a small minority of cattle farmers. Late testing is
unacceptable, so from 1 January 2014 anyone who fails to complete their
test by the set deadline, even by one day, will see their CAP Scheme
payment reduced. The reductions will vary, depending on the seriousness
of the case, but the outcome I want to see is no late testing at
all.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112854000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-wms0001.htm#13112854000006">I am
also launching a consultation on proposals for further tightening of
cattle controls. Our proposals build on the raft of enhanced cattle
measures that have been in place for many years, a number of which were
enhanced in 2012. They include abolishing the pre-movement testing
exemption for movements of cattle to and from common land. In doing
this, we will need to find ways of ensuring that the testing
requirements do not prejudice the very important part that grazing on
some commons plays in protecting and maintaining valuable
habitats.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112854000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-wms0001.htm#13112854000007">The
proposals also include phasing out the practice of lifting bovine TB
restrictions on parts of a restricted holding. In future the whole of a
holding would be either restricted or officially TB free any one
time.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112854000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128-wms0001.htm#13112854000008">I am
also consulting on proposals that would, as a last resort, enable wild

means to take action in exceptional cases where cattle of unknown
disease status cannot be safely tested.</hs_para>

this consultation is designed to respond to the Members of this House,
and their constituents, who have pressed the Government to make
available information on the location of bovine TB herd breakdowns, so
that livestock farmers are better equipped to deal with the local risks
to their herds. This would build on the risk-based trading scheme
launched earlier this month, which encourages 
<?notus-xml column=90?>farmers to share details of the disease history of any cattle they sell
so buyers are better able to manage any disease risks.</hs_para>

these rigorous measures will be tough for a
significant minority of livestock businesses. However, we will not
achieve the aims of our Strategy, and be able to guarantee the future
of thriving cattle industry we all wish to see, without tackling all of
the vectors by which this disease can spread. That is why I remain
committed to doing everything possible to get on top of and eradicate
this devastating disease in both wildlife and

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe) (Con):</Member> The Government's position is
clear on minimising the use of animal testing, and on encouraging the
development of other in vitro methods in place of animal testing where
this is possible. The Government has a coalition agreement to reduce
the number of animals used in scientific research. The Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is working closely with the
National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of
Animals in Research on a number of projects committed to reducing or
replacement of animals in safety testing. It is very important to
recognise that at present there are no laboratory methods available to
totally replace animal testing of medicinal
products.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112866000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128w0001.htm#13112866000004">Pharmaceutical
legislation requires that before a new medicine is granted a licence, a
battery of in vitro and in vivo tests are conducted to establish the
toxicity profiles for the medicine. Before humans are exposed to a new
medicine for the first time, it is required to go through appropriate
tests in animal studies to ensure that the toxicity profile is
adequately characterised. As a result of adverse findings from animal
studies, a large number of drug candidates do not progress to being
tested in humans. Animal tests are also crucial for understanding the
absorption, distribution and disposition of the medicine by the body
and its therapeutic effect on the body and for detecting unforeseen
toxic effects. Only on the basis of a full evaluation of all the
available data can it be decided whether it is safe to proceed to
clinical trials in humans. It would be unacceptable to expose humans to
potentially dangerous medicinal products without knowledge of their
toxicity
profiles.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13112866000344" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128w0001.htm#13112866000344">Animals:

The delegated powers conferred on the European
Commission by Regulation (EU) No 1021/2013 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 9 October 2013 concern a very limited
number of provisions contained in the annexes to the directives
referred to by the noble Lord. They relate to technical aspects of the
directives which may need to be updated and amended relatively quickly
to take account of technological developments or changes to other 
<?notus-xml column=290?>international standards. In fact, as a result of pressure from Member
States, no powers at all were delegated to the Commission for two of
the five directives covered by this
Regulation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112866000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128w0001.htm#13112866000045">The
UK’s preference is that the duration of delegated powers should
be for a fixed period capable of being extended by the same period
unless the Council of Ministers or the European Parliament objects.
This ensures that there is an inbuilt periodic chance for the delegated
powers of the Commission to be reviewed, and brought to an end if any
concerns are raised. The period of five years is the standard period
for which delegated powers are granted in the food information sphere,
and the drafting of the provision is, in all other respects, in line
with the specimen provision for powers of a fixed duration contained in
the Common Understanding for delegated acts under Article 290 agreed by
the Council of Ministers and the European
Parliament.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13112866000349" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131128w0001.htm#13112866000349">Health:
