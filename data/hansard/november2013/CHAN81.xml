Williams:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point on
discretionary housing payments for last year. Of course, last year
those payments were in place to deal with differences in the private
rental sector. I wish Opposition Members would remember that the Labour
Government introduced tight controls on the funding 
<?notus-xml column=3?>of spare bedrooms in the private rental sector. Some 43% of people in my
constituency rent in the private rental sector. I do not recall much
protest from Labour Members at that
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000035"><Member ContinuationText="Sir Tony Baldry" PimsId="3858" UID="1311255000285" xid="25" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000285"><B>Sir
Tony Baldry</B> (Banbury) (Con):</Member> Following on from that
answer, am I right in thinking that the rules on housing benefit for
those in social housing are now broadly the same as the rules on
housing benefit for those in the private rented sector, and that the
latter rules were introduced by the previous Government? Is there any
reason why those on housing benefit in social housing should have
different rules from those on housing benefit in the private rented
sector?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000036"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Williams" PimsId="4842" UID="1311255000286" xid="813" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000286">Stephen
Williams:</Member></B> My hon. Friend has neatly followed the logic of
what I said in my previous answer. There is a logic behind the reforms
that this Government have introduced. Throughout the entire 13 years
that the previous Government were in office, they had tight controls on
the private rental sector and tightened them further. I do not recall a
single Labour Member describing that as Labour’s bedroom tax on
the majority of people, certainly in city centres like mine and that of
the shadow Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Leeds Central
(Hilary Benn), who rent in the private sector. The rules are now
aligned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000037"><Member ContinuationText="Jonathan Edwards" PimsId="5701" UID="1311255000287" xid="1034" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000287"><B>Jonathan

fall into arrears—they are not a new feature under this
Government. Rent arrears, whether in the council or housing association
sector, were a feature under the previous Labour Government too. Behind
each individual case, there will be a reason why people have fallen
into arrears. Perhaps people think that some Labour councils are
adopting a policy of hoping this policy will go away. I think perhaps
they are misleading their tenants on that basis. They should be
helping their tenants to adapt to the change in

the Act, local opinion is extremely important. There has been almost no

of the state of the economy. They will also not be reassured because,
as things stand, next April will see a further rise of 3.2%. Since he
has not been able to tell the House what further help he will give to
small businesses, is it not time that the Government looked at our
plan, which is a commitment to cut and then freeze business rates over

Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr William
Hague):</Member></B> With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a
statement about our negotiations with Iran. Two weeks ago I reported to
the House on the negotiations in Geneva between 8 and 10 November. I
explained then that our aim was to produce an interim first-step
agreement with Iran that could then create the confidence and time to
negotiate a comprehensive and final settlement addressing all concerns
about its nuclear
programme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000181">We
have always been clear that because Iran’s programme is so
extensive and crucial aspects of it have been concealed in the past,
any agreement would have to be detailed and give assurance to the whole
world that the threat of nuclear proliferation in Iran would be
properly addressed. I said that we believed that such a deal was on the
table, and that we would do our utmost to bridge the narrow gaps
between the parties and conclude a strong
agreement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000182">On
Wednesday last week the E3 plus 3 and Iranian negotiators resumed their
work in Geneva, and on Saturday morning I and the other E3 plus 3
Foreign Ministers joined the talks. At 4 am yesterday we concluded the
negotiations successfully, agreeing with Iran a thorough and detailed
first-stage agreement that is a significant step towards enhancing the
security of the middle east and preventing nuclear proliferation
worldwide. In this statement I will cover the extensive commitments
that Iran has made, the sanctions relief that it has been offered in
return, and the steps we will now take to implement and build on what
was
agreed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000183">First,
we have agreed a joint plan of action with Iran, with the end goal of a
comprehensive settlement that ensures that its nuclear programme will
be for exclusively peaceful purposes. The agreement has a duration of
six months, renewable by mutual consent, and it sets out actions to be
taken by both sides as a first step, as well as the elements to be
negotiated in a final comprehensive settlement. I have placed a copy of
the agreement in the Library of the House, but I wish now to highlight
its most important
aspects.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000184">Iran
has made a number of very significant commitments. Over the next six
months Iran will cease enriching uranium above 5%, the level beyond
which it becomes much easier to produce weapons-grade uranium.
Furthermore, it has undertaken to eradicate its stockpile of the most
concerning form of uranium enriched above 5%, by diluting half of it to
a level of less than 5%, and converting the remaining half to
oxide.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1311255000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000185">Iran will not
install further centrifuges in its nuclear facilities or start
operating installed centrifuges that have not yet been switched on. It
will replace existing centrifuges only with centrifuges of the same
type and produce centrifuges only to replace damaged existing machines,
on a like-for-like basis. In other words, Iran will not install or
bring into operation advanced centrifuges that could enable it to
produce a dangerous level of enriched uranium more quickly. Iran will
cap its stockpile of up to 5% enriched uranium in the highest-risk UF6
form by converting any newly enriched uranium into 
<?notus-xml column=24?>oxide, and it will not set up any new locations for enrichment or
establish a reprocessing or reconversion
facility.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000186">Iran
has agreed to enhanced monitoring of its nuclear programme, going
beyond existing International Atomic Energy Agency inspections in Iran,
including access to centrifuge assembly workshops and to uranium mines
and mills. Iran will also provide the IAEA with additional information,
including about its plans for nuclear facilities. At the heavy water
research reactor at Arak, which offers Iran a potential route to a
nuclear weapon through the production of plutonium rather than uranium,
Iran will not commission the reactor, transfer fuel or heavy water to
the reactor site, test additional fuel, produce more fuel for the
reactor, or install any remaining
components.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000187">This
agreement means that the elements of Iran’s nuclear programme
that are thought to present the greatest risk cannot make progress
during the period of the interim agreement. In other words, if
Iran implements the deal in good faith, as it has undertaken to
do, it cannot use those routes to move closer towards obtaining nuclear
weapons capability. Moreover, some of the most dangerous elements of
Iran’s programme are not only frozen, but actually rolled back.
For instance, the agreement involves the eradication of around
200 kg of 20% enriched uranium that Iran has been
stockpiling for several years.</hs_Para>

return for those commitments Iran will receive proportionate and
limited sanctions relief from the United States and the European Union.
For its part, the US will pause efforts to reduce crude oil sales to
Iran’s oil customers, repatriate to Iran some of its oil revenue
held abroad, suspend sanctions on the Iranian auto industry, allow
licensing of safety-related repairs and inspections for certain Iranian
airlines and establish a financial channel to facilitate humanitarian
and legitimate trade, including for payments to international
organisations and Iranians studying
abroad.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000189">It
is proposed that the EU and the US together will suspend sanctions on
oil-related insurance and transport costs, which will allow the
provision of such services to third states for the import of Iranian
oil. We will also suspend the prohibition on the import, purchase or
transport of Iranian petrochemical products and suspend sanctions on
Iranian imports of gold and precious metals. But core sanctions on
Iranian oil and gas will remain in
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000190">It
is intended that the EU will also increase by an agreed amount the
authorisation thresholds for financial transactions for humanitarian
and non-sanctioned trade with Iran. The EU’s Council of
Ministers will be asked to adopt legislation necessary to amend those
sanctions and the new provisions would then apply to all EU member
states. The total value of the sanctions relief is estimated at $7
billion over the six-month period. There will be no new nuclear-related
sanctions adopted by the UN, EU and US during that period.</hs_Para>

bulk of international sanctions on Iran will remain in place. That
includes the EU and US oil embargo, which restricts oil purchases from
Iran globally, and sanctions on nuclear, military-related or ballistic
missile-related goods and technology. It includes all frozen revenue
and foreign exchange reserves held in accounts outside Iran and
sanctions on many Iranian banks, including the Central Bank of Iran,
which means 
<?notus-xml column=25?>all Iranian assets in the US and EU remain frozen, apart from the
limited repatriation of revenue agreed under this agreement. Iranian
leaders and key individuals and entities will still have their assets
in the EU and US frozen and be banned from travelling to the EU and US,
and tough financial measures, including a ban on using financial
messaging services and transactions with European and US banks, also
remain in place. Those sanctions will not be lifted until a
comprehensive settlement is reached, and we will enforce them robustly.
That ensures that Iran still has a powerful incentive to reach a
comprehensive solution, which is the third aspect of the agreement on
which I wish to update the House today.</hs_Para>

sets out the elements of a comprehensive solution, which we would aim
to conclude within one year. These elements include Iran’s
rights and obligations under the non-proliferation treaty and IAEA
safeguards; the full resolution of concerns related to the heavy water
research reactor at Arak; agreed transparency and monitoring, including
the additional protocol; and co-operation on Iran’s civilian
nuclear
programme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000193">In
return for the international community’s full confidence that
Iran’s programme is solely peaceful, the plan of action
envisages a mutually defined enrichment programme with agreed
parameters and limits, but only as part of a comprehensive agreement
where nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. This comprehensive
solution, if and when agreed, would lead to the lifting of all UN
Security Council sanctions as well as multilateral and national
sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear
programme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000194">Reaching
this interim agreement was a difficult and painstaking process, and
there is a huge amount of work to be done to implement it.
Implementation will begin following technical discussions with Iran and
the IAEA, and EU preparations to suspend the relevant sanctions, which
we hope will all be concluded by the end of January. A joint commission
of the E3 plus 3 and Iran will be established to monitor the
implementation of these first-step measures, and it will work with the
IAEA to resolve outstanding issues. The fact that we have achieved, for
the first time in nearly a decade, an agreement that halts and rolls
back Iran’s nuclear programme should give us heart that this
work can be done and that a comprehensive agreement can be
attained.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000195">On
an issue of such complexity, and given the fact that to make any
diplomatic agreement worthwhile to both sides it has to involve
compromises, such an agreement is bound to have its critics and
opponents. However, we are right to test to the full Iran’s
readiness to act in good faith, to work with the rest of the
international community, and to enter into international agreements. If
the Iranians do not abide by their commitments, they will bear a heavy
responsibility, but if we did not take the opportunity to attempt such
an agreement, then we ourselves would have been guilty of a grave
error. It is true that if we did not have this agreement the pressure
of sanctions on Iran would not be alleviated at all, but it is also
true that there would be no restraint on advances to their
programme—no check on their enrichment activity and stockpiles,
no block on their addition of centrifuges, no barrier to prevent their
bringing into operation their heavy water reactor at Arak, and no
limitation on the many actions that could take them closer to a nuclear
weapons capability.</hs_Para>

bringing together of this agreement with all five permanent members of
the United Nations Security Council united behind it sends a powerful
signal in itself. While it is only a beginning, there is no doubt that
this is an important, necessary and completely justified step, which
through its restrictions on Iran’s nuclear programme gives us
the time to negotiate a comprehensive settlement. I pay tribute to
Baroness Ashton, to my Foreign Minister colleagues and to our Foreign
Office staff who played an indispensable role. We will apply the same
rigour and determination we have shown in these negotiations to the
implementation of the agreement and to the search for a comprehensive
settlement. At the same time, we will continue to be open to
improvements in our bilateral relationship on a step-by-step and
reciprocal basis, and our new chargé d’affaires will

has shown that the combination of pressure expressed through sanctions
coupled with a readiness to negotiate is the right policy. For a long
time, that has been the united approach of this country, from the
efforts of the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw) to pursue
negotiations a decade ago to the cross-party support in this House for
the wide-ranging sanctions that we have adopted in recent years. We
have been steadfast in pursuing that twin-track policy and seeking a
peaceful solution. This agreement is true to that approach and to that
sheer persistence in Britain and among our allies. This will remain our
policy over the coming months as we build on and implement this
first step on the long journey to making the middle

May I thank the Foreign Secretary for his statement and for

this House and, indeed, this country to these issues over recent years,
including the approach of my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn

particular, the work of the European Union High

develop a nuclear weapon, that would make the world less safe, so the

absence from the final agreement of the phrase, “right to

second key test will be whether the interim agreement can, in the

have made the criticism that we should have concentrated on moving
straight to a final and comprehensive agreement, but from everything
that I have seen, I know that that would not have been possible, and
while we negotiated such a comprehensive agreement, the progress of the

would have continued. This is therefore a crucial step on the way to a

one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000214">The

no feeding of uranium hexafluoride into the other 12 cascades and so

right hon. Gentleman asked about inspections at Parchin. That remains a
point of difference between the IAEA and Iran, including in their
latest talks, and it is another aspect of the Iranian programme that
must be addressed as part of a comprehensive and final

right hon. Gentleman asked about the urgency. On that, it is important
to put the $7 billion of sanctions relief into perspective, because he
referred to it as being effective immediately. The $7 billion of
sanctions relief is actually available to Iran over the six-month
period once that period has begun, which we hope will be  by
the end of January. A good deal of the $7 billion involves the
unfreezing of assets, so those assets will be  
<?notus-xml column=29?>unfrozen in stages. Iran will not therefore receive
$7 billion on the first day, and then decide whether to
implement its side of the
agreement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000219">It
is also important to see that $7 billion in perspective. In January,
Iran’s Oil Minister acknowledged that the fall in oil exports as
a result of sanctions was costing Iran between $4 billion and $8
billion every month. Reports suggest that Iran currently has between
$60 billion and $100 billion of assets frozen overseas that
it cannot access. The $7 billion of relief is therefore a very small
proportion of the total frozen assets and of the total effect of
sanctions applied to
Iran.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000220">That
is why I have said that how we apply sanctions relief leaves Iran with
a huge incentive, since it wants wider relief from sanctions, to
negotiate a comprehensive and final settlement. That will help to
maintain the urgency, but of course all our diplomatic
activity—seeking to maintain the momentum behind the agreement,
and to ensure that it is implemented and that we can go on to negotiate
a comprehensive settlement—will also convey that urgency. The

Government. The Prime Minister discussed matters with Prime Minister
Netanyahu during the negotiation of the agreement over the past few
weeks. It is important to understand the concerns of those who are
sceptical about any agreement on the grounds of Iran’s past
deceptions. It is also important to ask those people what the
alternative to the agreement would be. The alternatives would involve
Iran getting to nuclear weapons threshold capability, Iran having a
nuclear weapon, a conflict with Iran or all those things. We have to be
clear that there are compelling arguments for the agreement. We would
discourage anybody in the world, including Israel, from taking any
steps that would undermine the agreement. We will make that very clear
to all
concerned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000224"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jack Straw" PimsId="4165" UID="1311255000435" xid="570" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000435"><B>Mr

hope that the Foreign Secretary accepts that it is crucial that the
momentum is kept up. The agreements that we made between 2003 and 2006
were undermined not only by the difficulties in Tehran, but by a
desperate Faustian pact that was developed between hard-liners 
<?notus-xml column=30?>in Tehran and hard-liners in Washington who fed off
each other. That ended up with President Khatami being replaced by
President Ahmadinejad. The United States helped to produce that
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000226">Lastly,

remarks and I agree very much about the importance of maintaining
momentum. It was possible to see that even over the past two weeks. The
10-day gap between the negotiations that took place two weeks ago and
those this weekend brought forth a great deal of criticism in Iran, in
the US Congress and elsewhere in the world that could easily have
fatally complicated the efforts to reach agreement. Considering the
months of work that need to go into the implementation of this
agreement and into attaining a comprehensive and final agreement, it is
vital to maintain the momentum all the
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311255000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#1311255000228">The

However, the right hon. Gentleman can be assured that the United States
Administration are extremely strongly committed to this process. The
leadership and persistence of Secretary Kerry were crucial in bringing
about the agreement and the clarity of President Obama on the matter is
clear. I do not think that we need, at this point, to start looking at
the other scenarios that the right hon. Gentleman brought in of acting

involved on achieving this exceptionally important agreement. It must
be hoped that not only will it lead to Iran re-entering the
international community, but that it will ameliorate oppressive aspects
of its internal policies. Will the right hon. Gentleman point out to
the Prime Minister of Israel, who yesterday said that nuclear weapons
are the most dangerous weapons in the world—he should know
because he has a stockpile of several hundred nuclear warheads and the
missiles with which to deliver them—and who in addition refuses
to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, that any attempt to
damage or attack the agreement in any way will be unacceptable and will
be opposed?</hs_Para>

inspection work that will result from the agreement. In addition, a
joint commission will be formed from the E3 plus 3 countries and Iran
to work on implementing and monitoring the deal. That means that there
will be constant discussion between the E3 plus 3 countries and Iran,
which will require the Iranians to respond to any concerns we have

Hague:</Member></B> I do not regard it as a
revolutionary thing to say that it is desirable to have good
co-operation between European nations in foreign policy. Indeed, that
often helps to produce results. The scale and effectiveness of EU
sanctions, agreed by all EU countries, has made a big difference on
this issue. It is important to add, though—this is something of
a qualification to the hon. Gentleman’s question—that
here the work with the United States has been absolutely indispensable.
Such an agreement cannot be made without the United States. Indeed, the
assistance of Russia and China has been important, too. So this is
something that includes European unity, but goes beyond that, which is
why it is so powerful.</hs_Para>

Hague:</Member></B> My hon. Friend asks how we can trust people with
whom we have many differences—we certainly have them—and
who have concealed aspects of their programme in the past. The answer
is that this agreement is so specific and so extensive that we will
soon be able to see whether they can be trusted or not. We will all be
able to judge whether these commitments are being entered into or not.
If we are to take the approach that, whatever we agree, the Iranians
cannot be trusted to deliver it, we can, of course, never have an
agreement on this issue. That would not even allow us to test whether
an agreement could be made and implemented. That would be a disastrous
course to embark
upon.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112514000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#13112514000011"><Member ContinuationText="Jonathan Edwards" PimsId="5701" UID="13112514000163" xid="1034" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#13112514000163"><B>Jonathan

developments are due in no small part to the election of the moderate
President Hassan Rouhani of Iran, who stood on a platform of improving

that he had been in post only for a few weeks when we had a debate on
the proposed military attack on Syria in August, does the Foreign

strengthened his position with the Iranian President or destabilised

Hague:</Member></B> This is a similar question to the one from my hon.
Friend the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis). It is, of course, a
hypothetical question, because such action did not take place. The
debate about such action did, however, produce a change of policy by
Russia and the Assad regime, and we are now seeing the dismantling of
Syria’s chemical warfare programme. It is idle to speculate what
might have happened in many different scenarios. Relations with Iran on
this issue should be viewed on their own merits and on their own terms,
and they are not necessarily related to Iran’s other policies
and to its involvement in, or opinion about, Syria. We should be
careful about making those linkages.</hs_Para>

talking about either sanctions that will be suspended—not lifted

Hague:</Member></B> I hope so. There have been
several questions about that topic. As I have said, it is too early
to conclude from this agreement that other aspects of
Iranian foreign policy will change, but of course we should like that
to happen. I have said to Foreign Minister Zarif that if
Iran—along with nearly all the rest of the world—were to
accept last year’s Geneva communiqué on Syria as the
basis for future discussions on the subject, many countries would be
much more open to its involvement in those discussions. That is up to
the Iranians, and I hope that they will respond positively to such
suggestions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112514000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#13112514000021"><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Timms" PimsId="4291" UID="13112514000171" xid="593" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0001.htm#13112514000171"><B>Stephen

movement on those issues, irrespective of anything relating to the
nuclear issue. The right hon. Gentleman gives just one example of a
truly appalling human rights record. Of course we will wish to discuss
human rights with Iran as part of our bilateral discussions, and we
will impress on the Iranians not only the importance, in our opinion,
of universal human rights, but the positive impression that they would
make on the world if they were to deal with those issues as well. Let
me stress again, however, that it is much too early to say that we can
read from this agreement a change in Iranian policy on other
matters.</hs_Para>

a recognition of the right to enrich, which we do not believe exists

agree a comprehensive solution, that would enable Iran to enjoy its
basic rights of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, with a mutually

and inspection will be the best way to put aside those who oppose this

very strong pressure for an increase in sanctions on Iran. That is what
Iran would have to expect in those

Goggins</B> (Wythenshawe and Sale East) (Lab):</Member> On a point of
order, Mr Speaker. You will be aware of the growing concern
that exists about the conduct of G4S and Serco, and whether they should
be allowed to continue with their bids to run probation services. Last
Wednesday, I asked you whether the Justice Secretary intended to make a
statement following the admission by G4S that it had been overcharging
for electronic tagging services. On Friday, the Justice Secretary
announced his decision that he would not award the contract to run
three prisons in Yorkshire—again, this was for reasons that
appear to be linked to the investigation into overcharging. It appears
that the Justice Secretary is making this up as he goes along, and I
wonder whether he had, even now, indicated that he intended to make a
statement.</hs_Para>

Speaker:</Member></B> No Minister from the Department has given any
indication to me of an intention to make a statement to the House. I
may misrecollect, but I thought there were going to be scrutiny
opportunities in relation to legislation before very long, which might
allow this issue to be aired. Whether that would include the right hon.
Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul Goggins) or, in any case, is
an avenue satisfactory to him, I cannot say. I recognise that he is
being persistent on this point, but the straight answer to his question
is that no such notification has been given to me and he will have to
use the resources available to him further and better to flag the issue
up with Ministers.</hs_Para>

Bryant</B> (Rhondda) (Lab):</Member> On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I
am sure that the whole House is very grateful to the Foreign Secretary
for having come here at the first opportunity to brief the House on
what happened in relation to Iran. I know that when he went to the
Conservative Friends of Israel meeting at 1.30 this
afternoon, he was religious in not saying anything there before he had
said it to the House of Commons. Unfortunately, his officials were
tweeting throughout his statement—while he was still making his
opening remarks—the content of what he was about to say. The
rules are very clear, as I am sure you are aware: nothing shall be said
by the Department until such time as the 
<?notus-xml column=46?>Minister has sat down. I afraid that we now have a different set of
officials with us, but I wonder whether it might not be a good idea to
write to Departments just to remind them of the
rules.</hs_Para>

Speaker:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his point
of order and for his courtesy in giving me advance notice of it. Let me
say to him, and to the House, what the position is. My predecessor
ruled on 9 June 2008, at column 21, that the text of statements
should be released simultaneously to Members of the House and to the
media, and that that should happen when the Minister giving the
statement sits down. That ruling still applies, and it applies equally
to electronic release as it does to the circulation of hard copies so
far as I am concerned. The hon. Gentleman has referred to
people to whom we do not ordinarily refer in the Chamber. Whichever
particular individuals might have undertaken this activity, the
principle is very clear: Ministers are responsible for everything that
happens in their Departments. That is a fundamental feature of our
constitution, so I am sure that the point will have been noted by the
Leader of the House and elsewhere, as necessary. I hope we will not
need to return to it, because it is breathtakingly clear.</hs_Para>

absolutely clear that we will in no way dilute or diminish any of the
existing regulations relating to the extraction of hydrocarbons from
underground. A whole framework of different regulations is already laid
down by European legislation, and we intend to respect them, but there
is great merit in developing fracking, as we have seen in the dramatic
reduction in gas prices in the States, with huge benefit to the US
economy. We think we will see similar merits in our
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112514000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112514000072"><Member ContinuationText="Barbara Keeley" PimsId="4794" UID="13112514000212" xid="910" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112514000212"><B>Barbara

dewatering those precious mosslands. They see a real need for reform in

still enabling companies to invest in high-quality services and the

competition less attractive. The conditions need to be right. For
example, we would need much higher levels of metering before household
competition was practical. Although household customers will not be
able to choose their supplier, they will benefit from a framework that
encourages water companies to put customers at the centre of decision
making or risk losing market share. Ofwat will ensure that household

reforms will increase water supplies by making it more attractive for
landowners to develop new sources of water, or for innovative
businesses to treat and dispose of waste water. Let me take a
hypothetical example. If a brewery with its own borehole has
spare capacity, it might be able to supply its pubs in the area more
cheaply than they could be supplied by the local water company. The

either a licensee or the incumbent water company to enable it to put

Reform of the regime is complex. It has been in place for 50 years and
the changes will affect the businesses of abstractors up and down the

been raised. I am satisfied that there are robust regulatory safeguards
in place to prevent upstream competition from leading to environmental
damage. We will also co-ordinate implementation. The new upstream

long-term resilience. The Bill includes a new primary duty to take

adequately address the high dividend payments, particularly relating to
gearing, which happen across the industry. Last Thursday, the Secretary

elsewhere in my constituency. In fact, I had to take a 10-mile detour
because there was 
<?notus-xml column=67?>a lake outside my office, which I could not access as I normally would.
The floods started in November and went on, intermixed with snow, until
about March or April. It is therefore timely that we debate the Water
Bill today. There is much in it to commend. It has been a long time in
progress and, as hon. Lady said, there remains a great deal of
unfinished business from the Pitt review, the Walker review and the
Cave review and, indeed, the Flood and Water Management Act 2010. The
largest and most significant recent development since 2007 has been
surface water flooding. It is a new threat, particularly with water
running off the road in just about every constituency of every Member
who has spoken in the debate thus far.</hs_Para>

the hon. Lady misses the point that so many other people do. Water
running off the road in this way is a new development. While the water
is on the surface of the road, it is the responsibility of the highways
authorities, whether it be the Highways Agency, the county council or
the unitary council. As soon as that water runs off the road and goes
into a combined sewer, it most frequently becomes the responsibility of
the water company.</hs_Para>

“What will the cost be?” I do not care what it will be:
if we are to have sustainable drainage systems, we have to look at
creating a system that will retain the surface water on the road and
stop it going into the combined drains and sewers. That has been
happening since 2007, for nearly seven years. Surface water has been
mixing with sewage and coming into homes, such as the home of Mr and
Mrs Hinds, causing health-related and very antisocial problems.
Successive Governments have failed to deal with the issue, but I

out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112532000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000006">According

risk of flooding from rivers and the sea, 1 million of those properties

role of the Environment Agency has been extremely positive, and fewer
properties have been built on functional floodplains since it became a
statutory consultee. However, I believe that it could do much more to

frustrating for constituents not to be able to access a single
map. Sir Michael Pitt—from east Yorkshire—was
very clear in that regard, and I think that we owe him a great debt of

more than just £20 million per annum in England for that

implications are for customer bills. It has been put to us that there
might be de-averaging of household bills. We also need to know the
implications for national resilience of upstream reforms, including in
respect of climate change and population growth. We note that the start

know the timetable for the application for state aid. It would be
helpful to know that we are going to be in a position to have signed
off on state aid before this Bill leaves the House and achieves Royal
Assent and, more importantly, by the start date of 2017. Concerns have
been expressed about stranded assets and the impact on household

conclude, the potential risks of de-averaging prices in respect
of household customers and upstream competition must be addressed. On
the comparative merits of the Ofwat duty, we would prefer sustainable
development as opposed to the Government’s proposal of
resilience. That needs to be explored. We also need to look at possible
greater resilience in terms of both water supply and the use of
abstraction, and we need the review of abstraction policy sooner rather
than later. We applaud the sustainable development and wider
environmental aims of biodiversity protection and climate change
mitigation, but I personally would argue that this should be addressed
through Ofwat’s primary duty of sustainable development. The
Government need to explain how the transition in the insurance sector
from the cross-subsidy being formalised in Flood Re to an eventual free
market will be managed. I believe this is too important to leave to
secondary legislation and we need more details in the Bill.</hs_Para>

Walley</B> (Stoke-on-Trent North) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to
follow the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh). As Chair
of the Select Committee that has conducted detailed pre-legislative
scrutiny of the Bill, she speaks with great knowledge and authority on
these matters. The Secretary of State would have been well advised to
listen carefully to her comments, particularly in view of the greater
role and scope there now is for Select Committees, especially in
speaking in favour of amendments. The Government must urgently reflect
on, and respond to, her points in respect of how surface water mixes
with sewage in flooding situations. The cross-cutting issues that she
raised in relation to water—not least highways and expenditure
on highways, which are matters for the Department for Communities and
Local Government and other Departments—need to be looked at in a
holistic way. I hope that, in the winding-up speech tonight and in
Committee, Ministers will take the Select Committee recommendations
seriously.</hs_Para>

debate takes me back to the first Committee of this House that I was a
member of, which considered the paving Bill for the legislation that
led to water privatisation. It was very divisive at the time and was
rightly opposed by the Opposition and by many of the environmental
groups that believed water to be a natural eco-service, and that the
concept of paying large dividends to shareholders at a time when
investment was needed in the water infrastructure was simply the wrong
way of addressing how to secure investment and manage our water supply.
A quarter of a century later, the private companies that were
created—and indeed Ofwat, the regulatory body—have had
mixed fortunes and mixed success. However, where we are now and the
current structure has to be our starting point for taking the Water
Bill forward. Today, the challenges we face are greater than ever,
particularly, as we heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Garston
and Halewood (Maria Eagle), given that we are getting close to the
finalisation of the next price review in 2015. It is absolutely
critical that as much pressure as possible be applied in order to get
this right.</hs_Para>

list of questions is, how do we ensure a safe, affordable water supply
for domestic use, for industry, for farming, for all areas of the UK,
particularly given that different administrative arrangements apply,
which does not make matters easy? There are parts of the Bill I do
welcome, not least the one dealing with flooding and insurance, but
like many of the Members who intervened earlier, I feel that the
flooding issue must be dealt with urgently and in detail. A statement
of intent is not quite the same as a measure on the statute
book.</hs_Para>

Walley:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
his intervention, and that is exactly the point I am making: our water
policy needs to take into account the whole issue of mitigation to
prevent such situations, but it also needs to be adaptable. The
adaptation that we need requires huge amounts of investment and a whole
new, collaborative approach to planning. The Bill has been brought
forward by DEFRA, but as the Energy 
<?notus-xml column=73?>and Climate Change Committee has pointed out, it is
the problems associated with climate change that are bringing about
flooding, and we have to find new ways of dealing with them urgently.
It has taken much too long to deal with outstanding flooding insurance
claims. Importantly, it is a question not just of how we deal with
individual claims and of having an insurance system in place, but of
how we deal with all the associated disruption.</hs_Para>

approach the European elections—I am sure that many of us here
will be thinking about what Europe has done for us—how do we
ensure that water supply and management fits within the context
of the European water framework directive? We have a
fundamental disconnect at the heart of water policy which the Bill
could actually put right. As my hon. Friend the Member for Garston and
Halewood said, the Bill is a wasted opportunity. The water companies,
regulated by Ofwat, supply water, but at a local level there is little
meaningful collaboration, accountability, transparency or resource, as
has been mentioned, to ensure that we have in place what is needed to
meet the requirements of the water framework directive.</hs_Para>

has two key objectives: an environmental objective, based on the
premise of preventing further deterioration and achieving “good
status” in all waters; and a managerial objective aimed at
creating integrated water management at the river basin level to ensure
overall co-ordination of water policy. Here, I want to make a plea to
the Government and to DEFRA on behalf of the Environment Agency. The
agency needs to be fully resourced for its task of leading the
framework directive, in order to enable it to identify significant
water management issues, to develop measures to address these at the
river basin district level, and to develop and publish the plans for
implementing these measures, known as the river basin management
plans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112532000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000044">Given
the length of time it takes to get legislation on to the statute book,
equipping the Environment Agency to work within the framework to carry
out its responsibilities needs to be looked at in parallel with the
Water Bill before us. Let me give an example of the current
unsatisfactory position. When the Government set up the Canal &amp;
River Trust in 2012, they committed to a new structure for the canal
network which included the navigational waters—some 2,000 miles
of canals and river navigations in England and Wales. These rivers were
to be handed over to the trust to ensure certainty and long-term
funding through the trust arrangements. However, we now know that the
Chancellor has reneged on this commitment, and the plans have been put
on hold. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary of State for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs, the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan
Rogerson), for agreeing to meet with me to discuss this issue, as I
believe it is vital that this transfer take place and be fully
funded.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112532000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000045">There is a
further concern, which was touched on in an intervention from my hon.
Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller).
Through clause 12, Ofwat is to be given the power to intervene in
private supplier agreements with water undertakers, with the apparent
intent of assisting smaller private water suppliers in their commercial
relations with undertakers. Not surprisingly, the Canal &amp; River
Trust is alarmed that Ofwat will therefore be able to vary or terminate
water sales agreements at the request of the undertaker and without the
agreement of the trust.  
<?notus-xml column=74?>I heard the Secretary of State’s rather
complacent reply to my hon. Friend’s intervention, and I hope
that, when the Under-Secretary replies, he will tell us what specific,
constructive discussions he will have with the trust on
this issue, so that we can make amendments to the
Bill that will safeguard delivery of the trust’s charitable
objectives when the Bill’s legislative passage is
completed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112532000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000046">There
is uncertainty about other aspects of the Bill, as well. The Bill is
all about the economics of, and very little about the environmental and
social aspects of, water policy. It mirrors the assumptions that lay
behind the changes to the water industry proposed back in 1987, rather
than looking at the assumptions we need to make today for the future.
Here, I would like to give credit to the former Environment Minister,
the hon. Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon), who only last week in the
press disclosed how close we were to drought just before the 2012
Olympics. There are also many other factors that point to
the need for long-term planning.</hs_Para>

take account of the work of the Natural Capital Committee, which is
looking to embed the value of natural capital in the national accounts
and policy making as soon as possible. We must also recognise the need
to look for a credible long-term plan to restore our natural capital,
and recognise the work of the Committee on Climate Change. Reference
was made earlier to the adaptation sub-committee report, which
highlights the need to incentivise efficient water management and to
have a price for water that better reflects its scarcity. Of course,
there are also the risks associated with water flooding. All these
factors point to the need for a much wider, all-encompassing approach
to water than the one the Bill provides for.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112532000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000048">We should
also address the issue of Ofwat having a primary sustainability duty.
Its role of granting new water supply licences and
overseeing bulky supply agreements should include consideration of the
sustainability of water sources. There is common agreement that,
without such a duty, we will see over-abstraction, over-licensing and
greater environmental damage to our already overstressed river systems.
We have heard the Secretary of State’s response to concerns
about fracking. He has stated that all the protection and regulation
that we need is already in place. However, the proposal for financial
guarantees in relation to pollution that my hon. Friend the Member for
Garston and Halewood outlined will be vital, and I hope that they will
be incorporated in the Bill as it completes its passage through both
Houses. I know from the initial meeting that the Minister kindly
organised recently that there is widespread concern among many
organisations, including the WWF, the Royal Society for the Protection
of Birds and the Angling Trust, about the need for a primary
sustainability duty, not only on resilience, incorporated in the Bill.
Will the Government table an amendment on sustainable development? Will
the Minister tell us how he intends to deal with this
issue?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112532000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000049">I
want briefly to broaden the debate. Following the discussions that I
have had with many different experts in the industry, I do not believe
that we should be carrying on with business as usual. Instead, we
should be gearing up to a different set of policies designed for the
21st century. The confluence of the various factors I have
mentioned means that we should be taking a more fundamental step change
in how we invest in improving the environment and safeguarding our
water supplies.</hs_Para>

would like to see far more local governance arrangements that would fit
with the river basin concept, involving not just water companies but
local councils, farmers and other organisations working together on a
risk-based approach. I should mention that some water companies are
starting to think outside the box. I refer the House to a recent
document published by Severn Trent Water, “Changing Course
through the sustainable implementation of the Water Framework
Directive”. We need much more collaboration of that kind, but
the Bill does not really give it to
us.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112532000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000051">I
want to mention the work that I have been doing in my constituency to
bring all the different partners together. This has culminated in an
application for European funding under the Life Plus programme, which

Water efficiency should also be promoted.</hs_Para>

promote greater competition, but what will it do to challenge
traditional kinds of capital investment? We should be looking into
different kinds of investment. Expensive engineering solutions are not
always the way forward, even though the water companies depend on
capital value for the returns that they make. If the Government can be
persuaded to introduce an obligation for sustainability into
Ofwat’s powers, Ofwat could look at a return on revenue
expenditure, too. We need to look at the kind of investments involved.
The Bill could enable Ofwat to take a much more proactive role in
vetting companies’ proposals for investment.</hs_Para>

like to see the dividends paid out to water company shareholders
managed differently. Yes, money is needed for investment in water
management, but it would be so much better if the profits could stay in

river basins paying out massive returns—well above what we can

Benyon</B> (Newbury) (Con):</Member> I refer hon. Members to my entry
in the Register of Member’s Financial Interests. It is a great
pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent North (Joan
Walley), for whom I have the greatest respect. She will be a loss to
the House when she stands down. I listened to her remarks with great
interest, and I will comment on a number of them in due
course.</hs_Para>

the House will forgive me if I start by quoting from the water White
Paper, about which I feel a sense of propriety. If I say so myself, it
was a very good document. It is a rare occurrence in Parliament for
such a document to be well received not only by those on both sides of
the House but by green non-governmental organisations, by the water
industry and by people throughout the sector who are involved in this
important subject.</hs_Para>

do we protect the environment and take less water from our rivers,
while meeting the demands of a growing population? How do we encourage
innovation and dynamism in the water sector while ensuring it remains a
low-risk choice for investors? How do we incentivise less wasteful use
of water while keeping water affordable for
everyone?”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13112532000064" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000064">That
encompasses, in a short paragraph, what we are seeking to achieve, not
only in tonight’s discussion of the Bill, but across the much
wider platform of restoring 
<?notus-xml column=77?>sustainability in this sector. This is about the
balance between the environment and the demands of a growing
population; the need for innovation and a new type of investment, which
the hon. Lady was right to talk about, without spooking the investor,
whose money we need; and stopping waste yet keeping water affordable.
The water White Paper was a call to action and a vision for the
management of this sector and its theme will, I hope, run and
not only through this Bill. As hon. Members on both sides of the House
understand, the Bill is just a work in progress in respect of
delivering that ambition; it delivers an element, and I particularly
wish to discuss the importance of abstraction.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112532000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000065">Let me make
an obvious point: water comes from nature. It is vital that we
understand that we are talking about not just an environmental factor,
but a key economic matter. The hon. Lady talked about the Natural
Capital Committee. When we discuss natural capital, we need to
understand its importance for the economy. We need to consider how we
manage water resources in parts of the country with a level of rainfall
lower than that in some sub-Saharan African countries. When we talk
about development and the needs of the economy in the years ahead, we
must address that through the prism of natural capital. I am grateful
to people such as Dieter Helm, who guided me in this relatively
new—for me and for many other hon. Members—approach to
economic thinking. I am proud that this Government have hard-wired
natural capital into their economic thinking.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112532000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000066">It is a
shaming statistic for this country that only 27% of our rivers and
lakes are fully functioning ecosystems. I am pleased that we have set
about addressing that, through a catchment management approach and
targeting our resources in as a meaningful a way as possible. We are
talking about not only an environmental imperative, but an economic
one. We have to comply with the water framework directive. If by 2027
we have not got our house in order and our act together, we will get a
slapped wrist and a stonking great fine from the European Union. If we
are talking about improving the quality of our environment just so that
we comply with a European directive, what a pathetic ambition that
would be. We should want to restore the quality of our natural
environment because we want to restore the quality of our natural
environment and feel proud about this country’s natural
systems.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112532000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000067">We have what
some would call the “God-given” advantage of having 80%
of the world’s chalk streams in this country, but in many cases
they are failing ecological systems. We have to set about putting that
right and making sure that we do not just suck water out of the top of
aquifers, such as those of the River Kennet, to provide water for
excellent and much-needed households in places such as Swindon; we must
set about getting reforms that can address that problem. I
really welcome the Bill’s means of ending the very bureaucratic
system involved in closing down unsustainable abstractions and of
getting this into the five-yearly price review. That is a major step
forward, which came about through a proper process of pre-legislative
scrutiny. I congratulate everyone, including the Select Committee, on
the work that was done in trying to draw that to our attention. Let us
make it clear that our ambitions for getting our act together require a
new piece of legislation in a new Parliament. It would be a great help
if the Minister could assure us in his wind-up that we have a
continuing and dynamic ambition to legislate in the 
<?notus-xml column=78?>next Parliament to make sure that the increase to about 30,000
abstraction licences in England will be properly managed in a
fit-for-purpose system that recognises the demands of a growing
population and the economic growth potential that that will
bring.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112532000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000068">On economic
potential, let me relate to the House my last experience as a Minister,
which was to take a trade mission of water companies and others in the
environmental sector—the green growth sector—to Brazil.
That BRIC country—the group made up of Brazil, Russia, India and
China—is wrestling with the problems that make ours appear small
fry. Sao Paulo, the largest conurbation in the southern hemisphere, is
trying to address the demands for water and for dealing with waste, and
it is desperate for new technologies. British companies from our supply
chain sector have achieved great things in the delivery of the greenest
Olympics ever and are ready to give work to British companies and to
create British jobs in that green technology sector. So the water
sector has a lot to give, not just in this country, but around the
world. Understanding that economic driver is as important as the
environmental and social dimension to our policies.

Lee</B> (Erewash) (Con):</Member> I thank my hon. Friend for all the
work he has done in this area and for his expertise. I hesitate to
interrupt his flow—to use a water analogy—but he just
mentioned the social aspect. Does he agree that volunteers play an
important part in managing all this country’s waterways,
particularly through the Canal &amp; River Trust? In my constituency,
where the waterways play a hugely important historical and heritage
role, I have set up the Erewash rangers scheme to try to recruit more
volunteers along the waterways.</hs_Para>

Benyon:</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her
intervention. If I felt a degree of paternalism towards the water White
Paper, I feel one even more towards the Canal &amp; River Trust, which
is one of the great successes. It has seen volunteer numbers rocket
since it went from being a government organisation—as British
Waterways —to being in the charitable sector, and Members on
both sides of the House should take pleasure in its success. Will the
Minister respond, if not tonight, at some point, to the real concerns
that the CWT has about clause 12? I hope that we can allay its fears
because, as the Secretary of State rightly said, the CWT will be an
important player in delivering the kind of connectivity we want in our
water sector. The CWT will also be a huge resource, in terms of the
economic regeneration of our cities, the potential for tourism and the
social dimension of volunteer numbers. So I hope that the Minister is
able to address the CWT’s concerns, which have been eloquently
voiced to hon. Members on both sides of the House.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112532000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000071">A debate is
rightly taking place about the affordability of water. That was of
primary importance in the Government’s mind as we developed the
vision in the water White Paper and in the Bill, and I know
that it is a great concern of the Minister as he steers the
Bill through. Those who believe in price caps can relax about water,
because we have a price cap for water—the five-yearly price
review. Ofwat provides a price cap for customers, albeit one that is
done by negotiation. It has been an effective way of keeping water
relatively affordable, although I know that some of my colleagues from
the south-west have views on that—we have partly addressed 
<?notus-xml column=79?>those. Obviously, there are ongoing concerns about water prices, so it
is also important to recognise what the Walker review said. It found
that the rateable value of a property bears no relation to a
customer’s ability to pay and it discovered that 40% of
low-income households live in the top rateable value
properties.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112532000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000072">The concerns
and fears that people have about increased metering do not necessarily
correlate with the idea that we should leave as many households as we
can paying for water through a rateable system. In the next price
review period, possibly with the aid of some legislative stimulus, we
could see a much higher rate of metering. Knowledge is power for
households. We will not be having this debate in 20 years’ time,
because we will all be managing our utilities on our laptops at work.
We will be able to see that a rocketing in our water usage could be
down to a leak in the system. We will be able to manage our household
bills more effectively. The high level of metering in the south-west
and the work that Southern Water and Thames Water are doing to increase
the level of metering should be applauded and supported.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112532000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000073">The WaterSure
scheme and other social tariffs are important tools, but we should
consider the whole question of affordability in a much more holistic
way. The effect of a freeze in council tax, of getting more families on
low incomes out of paying tax altogether and of other measures will
have infinitely more impact on the total expenditure of those
households than will tinkering around the schemes with some of these
points.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112532000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000074">My hon.
Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh), the Chair of
the Select Committee, made an important point about bad debt, but I
refer her to her own local water company, Yorkshire Water, which is an
exemplar in dealing with bad debt. The money we all pay on our bills
for bad debt varies around the country. Some are paying £14 or
£15 and some are paying a lot more, because our water companies
might be bad at dealing with bad debt. I was impressed to hear that, at
Yorkshire, a resolve scheme negotiates repayment terms for customers
with arrears of more than £500. A couple years ago, some 5,000
customers paid back £650,000 of bad debt, and the water company
wrote off £1 million of bad debt. It is that kind of partnership
approach that is delivering a much lower figure of bad debt, which
should be seen in the context of affordability. Ofwat estimates that
the next year’s price review could reduce bills by between
£120 million and £750 million, which seems an awfully
wide difference.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112532000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000075">Of course we
all want to keep water bills low and as many people as possible out of
water poverty, but we concentrate on that at the risk of reducing
investment. I have spoken about that matter recently in the House and I
will continue to do so. A high level of investment is better for
customers. It is about stimulating innovation and resilience and
reducing the impact on the quality of people’s lives and
ultimately on the bills they pay.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112532000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000076">The hon.
Member for Stoke-on-Trent North mentioned my comments about the
drought. In the spring of 2012, the Environment Agency said to me that
there was a 3% chance of us having enough rain through that summer to
refill the reservoirs and depleted aquifers. We were fortunate because
it started to rain in May. It rained right through the jubilee and
stopped just as the first athletes started arriving in the Olympic
village. We all 
<?notus-xml column=80?>thought, “Thank goodness”, although we did have a number
of flooding incidents in certain areas. That rainfall might have caused
us a problem that summer, but we were planning very seriously for a
third dry winter. I put to the House this question: are we really
content to see people in the most economically active part of the UK,
which is sixth largest economy in the world, reduced to collecting
their water from standpipes in the street? That is the sort of image
that brings down Governments and causes wholesale, serious and endemic
problems in society, and we must use this Bill to avoid
that.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_25_PT_1/DB5C26F57FA601031B5BB95CFFEA5A74A2E76783" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 November 2013">Monday

Opperman:</Member></B> I represent Northumberland—probably the
wettest county in England—and we should probably have held the
Olympics, as there would then have been no such fears. The Secretary of
State referred to water supply earlier, when he called on business men,
farmers and other people to get involved and create smaller reservoirs.
As my hon. Friend drafted the White Paper on water and knows so much
about the subject, can he say what assistance will come from DEFRA and
the Bill to incentivise and assist such people to create those
reservoirs?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112532000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000078"><B><Member ContinuationText="Richard Benyon" PimsId="4746" UID="13112532000124" xid="868" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000124">Richard
Benyon:</Member></B> There is provision in the Bill to establish an
inset regime and allow new entrants to design innovative
infrastructure, which can link into the water system. Moreover,
under the capital allowance system, farmers can invest in new
reservoirs and have the right to give the surplus of that water to
their water companies. In dire circumstances, the Environment Agency
can purchase that water to keep rivers flowing. Real opportunity exists
for people. I am not saying that that will resolve our water resilience
issues; many farmers will need to build many reservoirs for that to
happen. None the less, there is a genuine opportunity.</hs_Para>

plea. Yes, we can get involved in lengthy debates about whether we
should have a primary or a secondary sustainability duty, or whether
the robust new resilience duty—I urge hon. Members to read about
that—will provide an added incentive; but if the rivers do not
flow, our reservoirs are empty and our economy suffers, we should be
absolutely determined to concentrate on the outcomes. I appeal to
Members in this Chamber and in the other place not to get stuck on the
tokenism of any duty, but to consider the outcome that it can deliver.
I am relatively agnostic about whether Ofwat should have a primary or
secondary duty to deliver sustainability. I am much more concerned
about the outcomes, and I have yet to be convinced that just changing
the wording will make a huge amount of difference. A really important
gain in all this is the resilience duty on
Ofwat.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112532000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000080"><B><Member ContinuationText="Neil Parish" PimsId="4943" UID="13112532000125" xid="1159" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000125">Neil
Parish:</Member></B> Like other Members, I thank my hon. Friend for all
the work that he did on the Bill when he was Minister. Does he not feel
that the one thing we are missing in this country is the recycling of
water? It would be good to use recycled water to grow crops, as it
contains a huge amount of nutrients. When we get a wet year, we forget
about all the dry years that we have had or may have in the
future.</hs_Para>

Benyon:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right. I see this in household
terms: my simple view is that if a builder wants to build 1,000 houses
in the Test valley—I do not 
<?notus-xml column=81?>know why I am picking on the Test valley; I
could pick on any number of catchments in the south or east of
England—for that to be considered sustainable development, he
should have to prove to his local authority that he is hardwiring into
his thinking recycling rain water, greywater systems and permeable
membranes outside the houses. In fact, he should think of everything to
ensure that the development’s water demands are as low as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112532000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000082">An
important change is being made that will assist investment in our water
sector, by cracking the problem with the investment cycle that we have
faced for years. I am grateful to British Water—the
organisation that represents supply chain companies—for drawing
my attention to how investment fell off a cliff edge a year or so
before the end of a price review period. That is a problem. Britain is
losing jobs, losing skills to abroad and losing much-needed
infrastructure investment. Three changes will make a difference in that
regard. The first is the resilience duty, which I have already
mentioned. The second is the requirement on water companies to invest
for the long term, particularly through the 20-year reviews of their
water needs. The third is the need for a six-year investment programme,
which is a major step forward. Over time, the cycle of investment will
level out rather than fall off that
cliff.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112532000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000083">We
need to think beyond the Bill on sustainability. I am pleased,
for example, that improvements to the building regulations include a
standard daily usage of 125 litres per head. The code for sustainable
homes refers to 105 litres per head. We use 155 litres per head in this
country—a figure higher than almost anywhere in Europe. We must
consider the demand side as well as the supply
side.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112532000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000084">I
hope that that clause on flood insurance goes through with the support
of all parties. All Members with constituents who live at risk of
floods feel strongly that the statement of principles, worthy though it

risk. It will limit the cost, and as best it can, it will link that
limit to people’s ability to pay. Linking the scheme to council

key question is how we make the transition from a system under which a
subsidy supports the change to a much more risk-reflective form of
insurance, which reflects betterment, such as when a household spends
money from the scheme to improve resilience to flooding in the future.
For example, sockets would no longer be placed at the skirting board
but a metre above it. Other household measures could be reflected. We
should encourage households to see the process as a transition under
which they will be rewarded when they take responsibility. If they take
measures to reduce the flood risk to their property, they will
benefit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112532000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000089"><B><Member ContinuationText="Diana Johnson" PimsId="4791" UID="13112532000129" xid="854" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112532000129">Diana

Bill is an opportunity to change how we approach the management of

are as relevant today as they were yesterday and will be more relevant
in the years to come, as floods such as those that happened in Cornwall
and other places happen more frequently. Droughts such as those that we
experienced in 2012 might possibly be followed by a third dry winter. I
do not want to be part of a House of Commons or a society in this

part of the process of facing up to that risk, creating more resilience

point which has not yet been made— the territorial
significance for Wales of the current water companies. Labour in
government, through the Government of Wales Act 2006, failed to act on
that. Much of mid-Wales is served by Severn Trent Water. Part of
north-east Wales is served by Dee Valley Water. As a consequence,
perhaps, part of Herefordshire is served by Dwr Cymru Welsh Water. One
of the aims of my party is to regularise that situation. The lines
should be redrawn. That is something that I will talk about in

for the current arrangements in Wales, to paraphrase L P Hartley, Wales
is another country: they do things differently there. That is a
slightly over-used phrase, but in Wales we have a different situation.
We have a water company, Dwr Cymru Welsh Water, which is a third sector
company, as I mentioned earlier, with a non-distributable profits
model. The previous company, Hyder —or Hi-dere, as the BBC used
to insist on calling it 
<?notus-xml column=84?>—was run on conventional commercial lines.
Glas Cymru reinvests its profits in a better system and in lower

have been concerns about large profits in the industry, overcharging
and a lack of investment, alongside high gearing and a low tax take. I
read a report to that effect in the <I>Financial Times</I> on 27
October. Hence the need for greater competition. A water industry
insider put it to me thus: some water companies are over-geared, they
are over-reliant on cheap finance, which is not going to be there for
ever, and they are run as cash cows. This is not a sustainable model.
Dwr Cymru has the lowest gearing in the industry and, as I said, all
its profits are ploughed back. Unsurprisingly, this third sector
company has reported customer satisfaction levels at well over
90%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112536000011">Another
way in which things are different in Wales is the Welsh
Government’s stance on competition, which essentially is against
it. Under the Bill, businesses and non-householder customers will be
able to switch their water and sewerage suppliers, but the
Bill’s provisions on competition are confined to England. I
refer the House to the report by the Welsh Assembly Environment and
Sustainability Committee chaired by Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas. When
questioned, 113 large-scale users—using over 50 megalitres per
annum—said that a price differential of 10% to 15% would be
required to tempt them to switch. By the way, that was also the stance
of small and medium-sized enterprises.</hs_Para>

differential of 10% to 15% is substantial, and it is significant that
none of the large users that have the ability to switch in Wales have
done so. Customer service is important and that is a central element of
the water service that we have in Wales. Either Dwr Cymru is doing a
cracking job, or switching is unlikely to hold
much appeal other than, perhaps in theory, to
Ministers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112536000013">Competition
could be extended to Wales if the Welsh Government so wished. Dee
Valley Water’s evidence to the Welsh Assembly Committee noted
that competition in the non-domestic sector might be cross-subsidised
by the domestic sector—that is, the public would be paying. That
point was made earlier, and the answer, I think, is transparency. I
understand that the Government in Cardiff do not wish competition to be
extended to Wales. Can the Minister, when he winds up the debate or
later in writing, clarify whether under the 2006 Act the Government in
London have a veto on Welsh decisions on water? Will that continue to
be the case, or is the Cardiff Government’s right to choose not
to introduce competition an absolute right? I would be grateful to hear
from him on that
matter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0002.htm#13112536000014">Other
Members have posed the question of how we can incentivise
companies to alter the way they manage their systems and water and
sewerage networks 
<?notus-xml column=85?>to improve efficiency and to encourage the development and deployment of
innovative technologies that can cut down costs and lower the
sector’s electricity usage and its carbon footprint. The point
has not yet been made that water companies are heavy users of
electricity. I am not sure whether competition and the price instrument
will achieve all these aims. I hope we will able to discuss this
further in

on affordability, the question is how the bottom 1% of the population
pays for its utilities. Overall, the Bill is a missed opportunity. It
has no specifics on sustainability or the decarbonisation of the water
sector. The point about fracking has already been made. There is no
legal obligation on people to pay their bills. In other countries,
there is a voucher system for vulnerable groups. The Bill is also
lacking in specifics on water management. The current UK system is
luxurious in that there is no separation of clean and grey water, which
could be achieved in the future. That is a formidable list and I hope
we will have the opportunity to address these matters in
Committee.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13112536000173" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000173">7.17

begin by continuing a theme established by the hon. Member for
Arfon (Hywel Williams)—extending competition. He was talking, of
course, about extending competition in Wales. Although the extension of
competition in the water industry allowed for in the Bill is welcome,
it is a missed opportunity because it could go further. It is welcome
that businesses, charities and public sector organisations will be able
to switch suppliers in pursuit of the best deal, but it is regrettable
that that does not extend to household residential supplies and
consumers.</hs_Para>

the Secretary of State said about the need to increase metering before
such a transition can be put in place. It strikes me that offering the
ability to switch to those households that already have meters would be
a driver for greater take-up of metering. As we know from our
experience in the south-west and in Cornwall, where we have
particularly high levels of metering, that can help households to bear
down on water use and improve affordability. The incentive of being
able to shop around for the best deal if the household has a meter may
produce a double whammy. Consumers would shop around for better water
tariffs and metering would increase, enabling households better to
control their water usage and its affordability. It is a thought that I
leave with my hon. Friend the Minister.</hs_Para>

is clear that the introduction of competition into the market is long
overdue. The fact that the previous Conservative Government essentially
created a number of monopolies across the country has been a key
failing of that privatisation. I have always felt that it was a
privatisation too far, and precisely because it did not allow choice in
the way that other privatisations of state industries did. There was no
competition in the market and therefore no real driver for improved
conditions. We see that in my constituency, much to our pain, as we

his hard work to secure the renegotiation with the Association of
British Insurers and the National Flood Forum. He and I crossed swords
here when I tried to push him to accept a deal to ensure that flood
insurance remained affordable and available for my constituents. I am
delighted to welcome a deal that I think takes a huge step in that

ago this week parts of my constituency were under water and hundreds of
businesses and homes had been damaged by flood water. I think that it

some key issues remain. I seek assurance from the Minister that
premiums for those people in flood risk areas will not be dissimilar to
those for people in non-flood risk areas and that there will be some
equivalent of the premium element on the household insurance policy
that flood insurance will cover. In particular, I support the calls
from other right hon. and hon. Members on excesses. I have constituents
who were hit by the flood three years ago and had a £15,000
excess on their flood insurance. Clearly, if they do not have
£15,000 in the bank, having insurance that requires them to pay
£15,000 before being able to make a claim is nonsense. We must
ensure that we drive down those excesses as far as possible. I welcome
the figure of £250 to £500 that has been
proposed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000033">I

occasions when there are Members with enormous experience of the
subject under discussion sitting on both sides of the House. As a
result, the discussion we are having is extremely useful. I draw
attention to the contributions from the hon. Member for
Newbury (Richard Benyon), who said that he has scars on his back from
this, which I quite understand, and the hon. Member for Thirsk and

that we are surrounded by water in this country—certainly in the
south-west, which has some of the highest levels of rainfall, because
of the prevailing winds—yet we are in need of additional powers
to protect us against drought. Such measures are important, so there is
a lot of sympathy with the general thrust of the Bill, but the issue is
with the detail and with what is not there. I was concerned to hear the
Secretary of State say that he hoped to bring forward—not that
he would do so for certain—the clauses to Committee. It would be
helpful if the Minister, when winding up the debate, confirmed whether
all the clauses specific to the insurance elements, and any other key
elements, will be dealt with by a Commons Committee and not left to a
Committee in the House of Lords.</hs_Para>

insurance is desperately needed to protect domestic properties.
A number of Members have seen their constituents flooded regularly, or
indeed have been flooded themselves. In Plymouth we are relatively
fortunate, but we have small areas that flood regularly. Our biggest
problem is the railway, which is regularly cut off. The organisations
involved seem incapable of coming up with a solution that does anything
other than cut off the far south-west every time there is flooding at
Exeter, which is desperately bad news for business. I am not sure how
the insurance companies view claims for loss of business, but without
doubt there is a loss of business. That is a separate issue, but it is
very specific to our region.</hs_Para>

that concerns me is that so much of this is being done by order and by
statutory instruments—that is, secondary legislation. Indeed,
the EFRA Committee, which has done sterling work in this area, felt
that the draft Bill relied heavily on secondary legislation in a number
of key areas. The Government have obviously not listened with regard to
this aspect of the Bill. I am absolutely confident that in Committee my
Front-Bench colleagues will press for some of those key issues to be
firmly and clearly included in the Bill.</hs_Para>

seeks to extend competition, which most people would say is a worthy
aim, but not to extend it to domestic bill payers—a point well
made by the hon. Member for St Austell and Newquay (Stephen Gilbert).
That is another missed opportunity. The Government are failing yet
again to get a grip on the things that could make a significant
difference to the cost of living that all my constituents are facing.
Despite the welcome £50 rebate, the south-west still has some of
the highest water bills in the country. The amount paid by people on
relatively low incomes is extremely high, and about 200,000 households
are described as being under water stress.</hs_Para>

I personally went to see the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make
exactly that point—to say that we needed, frankly, to get our
fingers out and do something about

Water bill payers are the victims of a botched privatisation process.
We have too large an area, with a massive need for capital investment,
including cleaning up our shoreline, and very few bill payers to meet
those costs. It is a dreadful situation, and one that was not thought
through but driven through purely for ideological reasons. This Bill
develops the market in water further, with a new retail market. The
proposed changes are interesting, but they are not embraced entirely by
the water companies, which are asking questions about the need for a
provision to allow for retail exits, about why the system is voluntary,
and about whether there will be a level playing field for all
retailers.</hs_Para>

Water has expressed concerns about the Government’s
ill-considered and risky-to-implement proposals on the relaxation of
the selling of licences without reforming abstraction methods, and says
that it can foresee problems for rivers. During this debate, people
have been tweeting me about the importance of the chalk streams.
Indeed, several hon. Members on both sides of the House have touched on
that point. The Secretary of State talked about new sources of water.
However, if my local water company is saying that it has concerns, I
have to be concerned. Equally, if the general public and Members of
this House have concerns, the Minister must respond to them when he
winds
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000045">Water
companies across the UK, many of them based overseas, are making
significant and increasing profits, with soaring dividends for
shareholders. I am sure that they would say that the picture of their
accounts is much more complicated than that which appears in the
headlines, and that, in some cases, they hold significant debts, but
that just means we need greater transparency so that we can fully
understand where the pressures exist. The new chair of Ofwat has
suggested that some of the financial arrangements that these companies
pursue are complex, or perhaps they could be otherwise described as
hidden, and that they are running a debt in order to minimise tax
payments in the UK, but—surprise, surprise—they are still
managing to pay out huge dividends. As we have heard, they have
announced £1.9 billion in pre-tax profits and given £1.8
billion back to the shareholders. This is a system for the few, not the
many. People in Plymouth have been paying through the nose for a basic
commodity while shareholders seem to be benefiting. No one denies that
shareholders are people who have backed a company for a decent return,
but we need to understand that it is a decent return and not an
excessive
one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000046">Water
is a commodity that needs to be valued because it will potentially
become even more scarce as climate change kicks in further. If we do
not prepare well for the decades and century ahead, we could be left
with water in short supply or prices rising further for the taxpayer.
At a time of soaring utility bills, high inflation 
<?notus-xml column=90?>and stagnant wages, water customers really do need
to feel that they are getting a fair deal from their supplier. South
West Water has invested in new technology in Plymouth—I recently
saw it for myself at its treatment works in my constituency—and
there are, at last, some improvements to the local sewage works, but it
needs to offset that capital expenditure and the benefits to customers
against its profit and dividend levels.</hs_Para>

not put in place measures that achieve transparency or affordability.
The notion of a national scheme to assist with affordability, which has
been discussed over very many years, and in depth by the Walker review,
needs to be implemented. This Bill could have been the vehicle
to do that—another wasted opportunity. Some companies are doing
some of the work on a voluntary basis, including, in all fairness,
South West Water, but it makes much more sense to bring them all
together into some sort of national scheme—to get them all
signed up and have a level playing field where good companies feel that
everybody else is pulling their weight.</hs_Para>

constituents find it impossible to understand why the regulator seems
to have no teeth and simply rubber-stamps increases in bills. I am sure
that the Minister will say that is not the case, but that is how it is
viewed by my constituents. We know that the regulator has to perform a
complex balancing act, with requests for increases from companies
because they need to develop major schemes such as new ring sewers, new
reservoirs, and so on, but my constituents are not convinced that
anybody is listening to them. No one would argue against the vital work
on infrastructure, protection against flooding and drought plans, which
the Bill champions, but what is missing is the fairness agenda. The

supporter of such work. I am pleased to say that as a result I had
three flood defence schemes supported locally, and I am grateful for
that. The Bill is very welcome as part of a series of across-the-House

challenge, inevitably, is in the detail. The Minister, and you, Madam
Deputy Speaker, might remember that in 2005, when there was
deregulation of the industry, there was a review of the so-called cost
principle, which had been put in place to ensure the protection of
water authorities in areas where, because of their rural nature and the
distances involved, water would be very expensive 
<?notus-xml column=91?>to supply. It meant that rural customers did not have to bear a
disproportionately high price for their water supply. That has now been
removed and responsibility for overseeing the issue has been

flood insurance, flooding is a very key issue in my constituency and I
think that a fantastic deal has been brokered, but there are
challenges. The Minister will probably agree that prevention is
undoubtedly better than cure. Our planning process has a number of
statutory consultees, but after speaking to my local district council
and the Environment Agency I understand that neither the Environment
Agency nor the water companies are statutory consultees with regard to
planning or connection. That means that a disaster is waiting to
happen. Such consultation happens on a voluntary basis from time to
time, but not
regularly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000053">What
happens, therefore, is that connections are made and the water
companies have no power to make any recommendations—they
certainly have no power to object—and yet, when the rain comes
down, the sewers are flooded and the playing fields get covered in
sewage, as has happened in my constituency, it is the water companies
that have to take up the challenge of remedying the problem. I urge the

the challenge is in the detail. The Government proposed that, when
domestic users were billed through commercial intermediaries, the
benefit would, in effect, pass down the line. For example, if the owner
of a park home with a number of plots applies to South West Water for
the rebate, the intention is for that rebate to get passed down to
local users. Unfortunately, there is no obligation on commercial
intermediaries—which include not just park home owners, but
housing associations and Ministry of Defence premises—and the
consequence, as I have discovered in my constituency, is that a number
of local residents are not benefiting. Park homes
represent 2.5% of the housing stock in my district council area
of Teignbridge, so this is not a small problem; it is a significant
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000057">Will
the Minister consider some changes that I think might resolve the
problem? First, on the obligation, one of the reasons why park home
owners and others are not claiming is that they say that the claim
process is 
<?notus-xml column=92?>complex and time-consuming and that they get no
compensation, so let us simplify the process. Secondly, it seems that
any claim has to be validated by the district council, so why not give
the opportunity to a tenant whose commercial intermediary does not
claim to ask the district council—which will have the records
and will know whether they are a domestic individual—to apply on
their behalf to the water company and then the subsidy could simply
flow
through?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000058">There
is another issue: I am afraid to say that some unscrupulous commercial
intermediaries will take the money and not pass it on to the individual
resident. At present, the only recourse for the resident is to bring a
civil action—a small claims court action—which costs, on
average, £1,000. To be frank, that is completely inappropriate
given the amount of money involved. From my days studying law, I
remember learning that if someone takes something with the intention of
permanently depriving someone else of the use of it, that is theft,
which, in my book, is a crime. If not passing on the subsidy were to
result in criminal rather than civil liability, that would be a measure
with teeth and I suspect that those who are not minded to pass on the
subsidy at present would do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000059">I

2004. Like areas all over the UK that were given planning permission
before 2009, some properties built since 2009 will not be covered by

homes in an area that another Department says will be completely
excluded from the Flood Re scheme. There is a mis-selling issue there,
with people not being fully aware of what this Government are doing.

The problem is that 90% of Hull is below sea level, so it is prone to
flooding. The Government cannot have it both ways. They must accept
that issues in different geographical areas of this country have to be
addressed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000078">I
want to make three more points. The first is about the role of the
Environment Agency. I understand that of 455,500 applications for
planning permission, the Environment Agency has commented on only 6.6%.
The vast majority do not require it to comment because they are too
small or do not meet the requirements set out in legislation. If we
want the Environment Agency to play more of a role, we must make it
clear that its advice on where houses are built must be taken. I
say to the Minister that it is wholly unfair and arbitrary to
choose 2009 as the cut-off date for Flood Re; 2015 would be much
better. If he is not willing to go that far, perhaps he should consider
mitigation for Hull and similar areas.</hs_Para>

second point is that the Government should look at what is happening to
small businesses. The Federation of Small Businesses has said that one
in five small firms was affected by flooding last year alone. Small
firms will end up paying exorbitantly high costs to be insured against
the threat of flooding. I hope that amendments will be tabled on that
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000080">My
final point is about the 25-year transitional element of the Flood Re
scheme. Will the Minister set out what the five-year reviews are about,
because we need more details? Will he address what will happen to areas
such as Hull in the longer term? If the free market is just opened up,
we will be left with no insurance companies that want to offer
insurance in those areas, because the risks are too high. I hope that
he will give us more information about the Flood Re
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13112536000177" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000177">7.56

that there has been a lack of willingness to focus on the fact that
water, because of the way in which we manage it, is a rare resource in
this country. Quite a lot of it falls out of the sky but, as the

those who, like me, are new to Parliament, I will remind the House of
some of the history of water affordability. The only time when water
charges have been reduced was under the last Labour Government. The
average water bill in my constituency is now £359 per year and
has increased nationally by almost 50% since privatisation was
introduced by the Conservative Government in 1989. At the same time,
regional water companies made £1.9 billion profit last year. I

energy prices, but the situation with water bills is no

households spend less on water as a flat figure, the proportion of a
water bill that goes towards company profits is three times higher than
for an energy bill. As with energy prices, the rising cost of water far

is essentially free; and it is essential for our survival. Management
of that natural resource therefore needs to be conducted with some kind
of social responsibility.</hs_Para>

constituency are clear in the knowledge that water bills are likely to
rise in the future due to a growing population, climate change, the
replacement of water infrastructure and additional
environmental standards. Under the previous Labour Government, the
Walker review, which was published in 2009, advocated affordability and
made a number of recommendations to ensure that water remains
affordable for all. Two years later, the current Government
published a consultation on those proposals and rejected universal
discounts, which they cited as “unaffordable”, for people
on low incomes and minimum discounts for low-income households with
children. Instead, the Government opted for WaterSure and social
tariffs, and repeated that intention in the “Water for
Life” White
Paper.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000115">WaterSure
intends to cut costs for households that have a water meter and more
than three children under 19 years old and that claim a range of
benefits including council tax benefit, housing benefit and employment
and support allowance. The scheme ensures that those families pay only
the average for their region, so adding approximately 40p to the bills
of those customers not on the scheme. Water Direct is another scheme
whereby the Department for Work and Pensions subtracts money from the
benefits of those who are in debt to their regional water company and
sends it direct to that water company. What is not clear, however, is
how such schemes are likely to be affected by the introduction of
universal credit, and that creates uncertainty for a number of
families.</hs_Para>

allow water companies to develop tariffs in consultation with
customers, with the intention of helping the most vulnerable. However,

way short of dealing with the scale of the problem. In evidence to the

Water estimated that to “effectively address the problem”
of affordability would cost anywhere between £162 million and

than take strong action to ensure that companies have a duty of
affordability, the Government introduced tariffs on a voluntary basis
from April this year. So far, only three companies have taken that up.
Northumbrian Water—my local provider—certainly found
little appetite among customers for the implementation of a social
tariff. That is hardly surprising when so many people are already
struggling to afford bills with stagnating wages. In constituencies

more people.</hs_Para>

little to help consumers. Citizens Advice has expressed disappointment

It is no coincidence that Citizens Advice has reported increasing
numbers of people coming to it with inquiries about water debt. It is
not only Citizens Advice that recognises the problem. This afternoon, I
spoke with Northumbrian Water, which is anticipating a rise in debt
over the next year, linked to the severity of public sector cuts in our
region. It now works closely with Citizens Advice, recognising that if

financial times and that consumers must be protected in a monopolistic
market. The Bill will help. The opening of certain retail markets to
competition, with the prospect of that widening to all consumers of
water, must surely be a crucial step in keeping downward pressure on
end-user pricing. That and many other measures in the Bill, such as the
change in the byzantine regime that compensated companies for the
removal or change in abstraction licences, will help to solve a number
of problems that the industry faces and that directly impact on
pricing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000128">We

the tap water and get into the position in which the energy sector

to power outages, as old capacity is closed down and new capacity has
yet to come on stream. The few hon. Members who are in the Chamber
might think that the two sectors are wholly different. They might

Friend the Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon), who is in his place,
has painted a compelling picture of the crisis that we faced. It is not
an exaggeration to say that many parts of the country would have faced
severe shortages. Many people in the south and east of the country
would have relied on standpipes, and there might have been an absolute
disaster for our natural environment. Rivers had begun to run dry, as
their natural sources dried up and as water companies abstracted yet

need to understand that the three-year scenario will happen—it
is not a matter of if, but truly a matter of when. We should remember
that it does not matter how cheap water is if there is none. I
therefore want to make a few comments on resilience. More can and is
being done on leakage. There is some success on consumption through
metering, through the advent of modern technologies that use less water
for the same tasks and through education, but we face a potential
structural problem in the regulatory environment.</hs_Para>

necessarily means building infrastructure. Ofwat rightly has a primary
duty to protect customers, but it therefore has a perverse incentive
not to sanction investment in what is, by definition, redundant
capacity. That is why I am particularly pleased by clause 22, which
promotes resilience to being a primary duty for Ofwat. The measure is
very much helped by the explicit guidance published in May by my hon.
Friend the Member for Newbury and the Department, “Strategic
policy statement to Ofwat: incorporating social and environmental
guidance”. Paragraphs 3.6 to 3.9 explicitly set out the
Government’s expectation that Ofwat should ensure long-term

is important to recognise that resilience is not the same as
sustainability. None of us wants a system that creates resiliency in
the water supply that relies on sources that are environmentally
damaging. In the round, however, I am glad that we now seem to have a
regulatory environment that recognises that protecting customers also
means protecting a sustainable supply of water. However, I wonder
whether we might go a step further. Hon. Members know that one of the
biggest problems faced by large-scale infrastructure projects, such as
those likely to be needed by the water industry, is delays
in the planning system. To that end, I wonder whether the
Minister has considered a national policy statement for water. After
all, we have one for waste water, so why not have one for water? Such a
statement would go a further step towards allowing Ofwat’s two
conflicting duties to be resolved in a timely and structured manner. It
should ensure that the necessary infrastructure is introduced in a way
that is controlled by the Government, at a reasonable pace, and as the
economy and consumers’ wallets
allow.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000134">As
we have heard, one of the most urgent but complex areas of change that
is needed is in abstraction. Hon. Members know that over-abstraction is
damaging our environment and that the governing regime is antiquated
and not fit for purpose. Licences granted in an entirely different
social and historical context are still in force and in urgent need of
change. I accept that that is a complex matter, but I remain somewhat
disappointed that the necessary reform is not tackled in the Bill. I am
reassured by the Secretary of State’s remarks this evening on

lecture countries such as Brazil and Indonesia on environmental damage

understand why the Government have delayed reform, but the fact that
the Bill does not change abstraction licensing at the same time as
allowing new upstream supplies may well present a problem. One of the
proposed resilience reforms is that those with unused abstraction
licences for purposes other than general water supply and those with
water surplus to their needs can sell water on. I welcome that in
principle, but one concern is that, if proposals to reactivate old
licences or sell bulk water across borders are not very carefully
assessed in respect of their impact in source areas—in terms
both of the environment and of local pricing incentives and
competition—unanticipated damage could easily be done. I am glad
to note that the Government have partially recognised that and
committed to introducing changes to the Bill in Committee to ensure
that permission must be obtained from the Environment Agency before any
changes of use of water abstraction rights are made. May I suggest that
a similar assessment of the impact on local pricing and competition in
source areas also be
made?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000139">The
same rules must surely apply to the bulk transfers proposed by the
Bill. The Government have said that they are considering that, and I
hope that similar changes will be introduced. It is worth noting we
will need to consider how permitting would apply across the border into
Scotland and Wales. No doubt, the ministerial team have that under
review. Furthermore, it would be reassuring if the Government
considered allowing such arrangements to be terminated on advice from
the relevant assessor if it is clear that they are contributing to
over-abstraction, causing environmental damage or skewing the
competitive
environment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000140">Finally,
on water metering, as undertakers have made more progress on leak
reduction, measures to reduce demand will become more important.
Measures in building regulations and the advent of new technologies
that reduce the amount of water needed to perform certain tasks have a
part to play, but so does water metering. That is another complex
matter. Hon. Members know that water metering increases costs for some
people and reduces them for others. We should never allow companies to
cut off supply to those who cannot pay their bills. However, water
metering reduces consumption and allows householders and undertakers
more accurately to identify local leakage, which can then be dealt
with.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000141">The
Water Industry (Prescribed Conditions) Regulations 1999 allow universal
water metering to be introduced in areas of water stress. I wonder
whether it is time to take that a step further. We should consider not
standing in the way of rolling out water metering schemes throughout
all areas, water stressed or not, if an undertaker can demonstrate that
they have a clear, deliverable plan to help customers to deal with the
change; that they have similar, robust plans to
deal with the difficulties faced 
<?notus-xml column=104?>by those who are least likely to be able to deal with increased bills;
that their request for the roll-out forms part of a long-term strategy
to reduce demand; and that the Secretary of State retains the power to
remove the scheme if those things are not delivered. All I ask is that
the Minister and his team consider such a
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112536000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112536000142">In
conclusion, the Bill is a step in the right direction towards reform of
the water industry. Its measures will help to increase competition and
so keep down prices. It clearly recognises the need to guarantee
long-term supply, but does so in the context of other measures and
proposed changes that acknowledge that sustainability of the source of
supply is as important as resilience. It would have been hugely
preferable if abstraction reform were followed by changes to upstream
competition in that order, but, when taken with the licensing
requirements that Government are contemplating, the dangers posed can
be mitigated. So I look forward to joining colleagues in the Aye Lobby
should a Division be
called.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_25_PT_1/5602E2B8D2AFE852700F296425515FFD7339232F" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 November 2013">Monday

imperative that we monitor water quality without putting an expensive
burden of regulation on our water companies. I am thinking in
particular about our beaches and coastal water. We must remember that
the south-west is a tourist area, and it is vital that local
hard-working families do not have to pick up the cost burden of further
European legislation. We must not become the Government of red tape.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and other
Departments have done much to reduce the burden on industry following
the mess left by the previous Labour Administration.</hs_Para>

legislation must allow water companies to be able to react quickly to
circumstance. We do not need legislation that says that everyone must
be consulted in triplicate. There is no point in putting sandbags out
once a town has been flooded. When the need arises, water companies
must be able to do what is necessary to save lives, homes and
businesses. Tragically, my constituency has been hit more than most by
the weather and by flooding—it is a key problem. I thank the

<?notus-xml column=106?>the issue in great detail. It has met the British Insurance Brokers

met the National Flood Forum. The group had the pleasure of meeting my

remarks will focus entirely on the all-party group’s
opinion of the Government’s proposals and the
representations it made as part of the consultation. The concept of
Flood Re is generally supported by the group, but its members have a
number of concerns. Many of those were raised by the hon. Member for
Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson). She reminded us of the
dreadful experience in Hull and highlighted some of the issues we need

concern regarding small businesses. The Bill proposes to cover
residential property, but under the statement of principles some small
businesses were covered too. It is easy to see in Hull many corner
shops and things of that nature where it is difficult to distinguish
between the residential and business elements. The Federation of Small
Businesses, the British Insurance Brokers Association and the British
Property Federation have urged the Government to reconsider their
exclusion of small businesses under the scheme. We do not want major
businesses covered, but perhaps a turnover of £1
million would be an appropriate cut-off point when covering smaller
businesses. The cost would not be prohibitive.</hs_Para>

contentious area, the Government say, “Come what may, we must
have the flood insurance obligation.” That is clearly desirable,
but it cannot be a blank cheque. Under the one-in-200-years principle,
insurance is supposed to cover all circumstances likely to arise, but
it is difficult to assess what a one-in-200-years risk might be, given,
for example, that the six wettest years on record have all been since
2000. As we have heard, climate change is happening and it is difficult
to make those assessments. Just this year, there have been major floods
in Alberta, Canada that might count as a one-in-200-years event: total
estimated damage was more than 5 billion Canadian dollars, 100,000
people were displaced, several people died and 2,200 troops were
deployed. In the next few years, we could suffer such a calamity, yet
it is not clear from the Flood Re proposal what the Government would
bring to the party. It is unrealistic to think the insurance industry
could cover the costs of such a calamitous event. The Government have
been sending signals about what they might do, but they have not been
much more than signals. We would like a bit more than that.</hs_Para>

proposed that Flood Re be based on council tax bands. I agree with my
hon. Friend the Member for Newbury, the former Minister, that we do not
want to unpick this, but I would like it to go a bit further. The
measure is a sort of rating by proxy, not risk, but band H properties
have been excluded, which is something that the all-party group is
concerned about. As he said, the reason for the exclusion is that we do
not want subsidies for the rich, but I wonder whether that has been
thought through. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and
Radnorshire (Roger Williams) will be able to remind the House, as I
can, of the council tax 
<?notus-xml column=107?>revaluation in Wales. Our top band is no longer H, but I. Band H
properties are not occupied by millionaires, yet would not be covered
by this proposal. Has that been taken into account?</hs_Para>

do not want band H properties excluded is that historically all bands
have been based on valuations of no relevance today. At some point,
there is likely to be a revaluation, and who is to say that new bands
will not be added, as happened in Wales? For that reason, it would be
much better not to exclude band H properties. Against the claim that it
would help the wealthy, I would simply say that the wealthiest
occupiers probably use brokers to arrange their insurance. It is the
people who cannot do that—people in what I would term
“middle class-ish” properties—who might find
themselves in difficulty. I make that case on behalf of not one
political party, but the all-party group, and I urge the Government to
reconsider.</hs_Para>

everyone knew that from that year onwards they would be excluded, so
let’s not have them covered,” but we know that there is

Evans:</Member></B> That is a much better proposition than telling
someone in a property built in 2010, “Flood Re is not for
you.” If it is to be a solution to the difficulties of
insurance, as many properties as possible should be covered. That
includes what are termed “genuinely uninsurable”
properties. They are excluded as well, yet they might be occupied or
habitable properties with a council tax rating. Why are we not to
include them? In my judgment, their number is not so considerable as to
make the scheme impossible to operate. As the Minister knows, the
all-party group made that representation to him during the
consultation, and we hope he will take it on board as he considers his
amendments in Committee.</hs_Para>

Williams</B> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD):</Member> It is a great
pleasure to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff North
(Jonathan Evans). In a different incarnation, he was my Member of
Parliament, and indeed my tenant, so our relationship goes back a long
way. His expertise on insurance, which he brings to this
debate, is well known. We have heard many other 
<?notus-xml column=108?>contributions tonight, including from the hon. Member for Newbury
(Richard Benyon), who has great experience and knowledge of these
matters. Had he been introducing the Bill, he would have had three
years to prepare, whereas my hon. Friend the Minister, whom I am
pleased to see here, has had about three weeks. Nevertheless, he was a
member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee that
scrutinised the draft Bill and will be aware of the detail and some of
our concerns about things that are not in the Bill.</hs_Para>

welcome the Bill. One of the vital challenges facing the UK is the need
to protect the health of our rivers and lakes, while keeping water
available and affordable. Water resources are currently under
considerable pressure, and it is predicted that water
constraints will become more severe in the future. There is
limited competition in the current system, so I welcome the competition
clauses, which will open the sector up to more competition and
encourage the construction of more connections between water company
areas. The introduction of retail competition among water companies
could support greater water efficiency in the non-domestic
sector.</hs_Para>

welcome the idea that businesses and local authorities can switch water
suppliers, I recognise that individual consumers will not have that
opportunity. The regulator must ensure that bills remain affordable,
while expecting water companies to have the ability to invest in the
infrastructure. We need consumer bills to be affordable now,
but we must also recognise that water supplies are needed for the
future, so I hope that we can amend the Bill in Committee to make it
better for consumers and for the environment. There has been concern
that, as companies compete for customers in the commercial sector,
domestic customers may carry more of the costs of supply. We will need
to hear from the Minister in Committee how that will be
prevented.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112541000026">The

been faced with an increase in the number and severity of flood events,
and it is vital for the Government to provide widespread and affordable
household insurance in at-risk areas. I thus welcome the proposed new
legal framework that seeks to establish Flood Re—a levy-funded
reinsurance pool for high-risk individuals. If that is introduced,
insurance companies must make their customers aware of the scheme and
the opportunities it provides. A number of my constituents in
Llangammarch Wells were really frightened by some press releases put
out by the Environment Agency in Wales—now called Natural
Resources Wales—about restricted insurance. After further

set a particular challenge for low-income families. There are no
specific benefits such as housing benefit or council tax benefit to
help with these costs, but the Government have stated that they will

industry is responsible for the most essential public services. Few
things are more important for public health—or indeed
for normal day-to-day living—than a safe and reliable supply of
drinking water, and the efficient collection and treatment of waste
water. More than 90% of health improvements over the last two centuries
have resulted from the provision of safe-to-drink tap water and proper
sanitation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112541000036">The
water industry everywhere is very capital-intensive. Many of its
assets—reservoirs, treatment works, water pipes and
sewers—have very long lives, but, even when we allow for that
and for the fact that investment doubled after privatisation in 1989,
the average age of water company networks is increasing every day. The
rate of renewal of sewers, for example, gives an average assumed age of
more than 600 years. Investment levels are agreed with regulators every
five years, and investment decisions are based on the priorities for
the years ahead.</hs_Para>

industry invests and spends more than it receives from its customers
through bills. It finances its expenditure by raising money from
investors in the 
<?notus-xml column=110?>capital markets, and so far that money has come almost entirely from
bonds and other borrowing. In other words, the industry is cash-flow
negative, and that will persist, partly because of the backlog of asset
renewal but mainly because of the new standards that must be met. As a
result of that cash-flow negativity and continuing high and necessary
levels of investment, the cost of capital and funds raised from the
capital markets is key, and will become more and more important. The
cost of capital on money raised since privatisation already absorbs a
third of the bill, and relatively small changes in the allowed or
achieved cost of funding. Every 1% saving on the cost of financing the
industry’s “regulated capital value” reduces
customer bills by
5%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112541000038">Given
that so much of the value chain is represented by the network of
assets, both the raw material and the retail element represent a very
small part of the overall bill. The Water Bill proposes that business
customers in England should be allowed to choose their water retailers,
but the Welsh Government have decided not to go down that route. As
Professor Dieter Helm has said, large business customers will argue
that they should pay only marginal costs, and if water companies
succumb to the pressure, it will mean higher bills for household
customers.</hs_Para>

per customer varies enormously, and the rural customer costs many times
more than the urban customer. Averaging the cost in that way is good
public policy. “De-averaging” poses a real risk by giving
business customers choice, thus causing water companies to reduce their
tariffs locally to satisfy demands from big customers and to recover
the lost income from household customers who cannot exert the same
pressure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112541000040">The

water company that serves Wales, and much of Herefordshire and Deeside,

has a strong board with a majority of non-executive directors, all of
whom are individuals of high standing. It complies with corporate
governance best practice, although it 
<?notus-xml column=111?>has no shares listed on the Stock Exchange. It
accounts for its performance to its members and other stakeholders and
measures its performance against things that really matter to
customers: drinking water, reliability of service, protecting our
rivers and coastal waters from pollution, and customer satisfaction.
The pay of everybody who works for Glas Cymru is linked to performance
against those measures, and because Glas Cymru is one of 10 large water
and sewerage companies in England and Wales everyone can judge whether
it has done a good, bad or middling job on the measures that matter to
customers and the environment. Welsh Water is unique in the water
industry. Its employees are rewarded on the basis of customer
satisfaction rather than shareholder value. The Bill does not address

think that being on the coast would help because water can run to the
beach and away, but we have problems with natural watercourses and
culverts. Some of those natural watercourses are commemorated in
current street names: the Fleet, Long Beck and West Dyke. Culverts,
sewers and house building have together created environments in which
the water cannot get away as it should, the most absurd example being
in the village of New Marske, which is halfway up a hill yet has
serious flooding problems. Northumbrian Water has been investing
heavily in tanks around the town and they are there to hold up excess
surface water, to avoid inundating the sewerage system and putting raw
sewage into the sea. Of course, given the golden beaches from Redcar
down to Saltburn, which are a Mecca for surfers, I very much welcome
that I and attended the “Surfers against Sewage”
reception in the House just a few weeks 
<?notus-xml column=112?>ago. However, I also have to say that I support householders against
sewage and many householders in my constituency had raw sewage in their
house that day. An investigation is going on into the role of these
tanks, and it is concerning that a lot of the major flooding was in the
area of these tanks—so-called hydro-break tanks. I therefore
think they may well be part of the problem, and I am not convinced that
their overflow arrangements work sufficiently well in times of very
high
rainfall.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112541000048">My
area is suffering from a set of man-made problems. It is by the sea and
it is not in a valley, so drainage should be no problem. We need

after serious flooding in the 1950s, the entire river was taken out of
the city. If anyone watches the Formula 1 race at Valencia, they can
see the cars racing around where the new river is now, and the old
river is a very strange-looking park in the middle of the city. It is a
nice green area, but with bridges all the way across it. We may need
similarly radical solutions to help divert flooding away from towns and
villages, and I hope that, once the needs assessment is made, DEFRA

solutions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112541000049">On
the wider issues, one of the problems the water industry has is that
the benefits of investment are not necessarily aligned with the costs.
For example, councils and builders continue to build on flood plains
because they benefit from that and do not bear the costs when things go
wrong. Who pays if watercourses are not properly kept clear? The people
responsible for keeping them clear do not pay the costs if they are not
clear. Do developers pay for all the new infrastructure costs of water
and sewerage when they do developments? One of the things the
Government should therefore look at is the alignment of costs and
benefits.</hs_Para>

planning permissions on land in areas that have already flooded are in
existence now, but I want to concentrate on future developments. In
large parts of my constituency, it would be hard to build any sort of
home or business without it being on the flood plain. Would the
Minister consider encouraging local authorities to look at the
townhouse model? Homes should be built on stilts in flood areas, or at
least with garages at ground floor level so that people are not put at
risk through flooding and so that goods and property can be moved to
upper floors more easily to avoid damage.</hs_Para>

minor suggestion for the Minister. It was suggested earlier that the
water companies should be a statutory consultee, but would it also be
possible for representatives of the Association of British Insurers to
clarify the insurance situation on new property proposals being put
before development committees, when they involve developments in areas
of flood risk? In that way, developers would be forced to use design to
mitigate the risk, and purchasers would understand the risks and
insurance costs involved, as well as knowing that they would be able to
get insurance for their home or
business.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112541000059">Turning
to flooding on farmland, I should like to pay tribute to my hon. Friend
the Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon), who took the trouble to visit
my 
<?notus-xml column=114?>constituency when he was the Minister with responsibility for this
issue. He visited the Axe and Brue valleys in April this year and met
more than 100 farmers and smallholders whose homes, stock and
businesses had been severely affected by months of flooding. The
farmers made it clear that the rivers, rhynes and waterways had
suffered over the past 13 to 15 years because they had not been cleared
or maintained. They had been neglected in the areas served by the Axe
and the Brue rivers. There were problems with silt, blockages and
overgrowing. In Somerset, money usually goes to the areas surrounding
the Tone and Parrett rivers, but it is important that all our waterways
should be maintained and improved.</hs_Para>

that the Minister will use this opportunity to ensure that the
residents and businesspeople in my part of Somerset get the dredging

Munt:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It would be so
much better if we could get the dredging programme sorted out, because
it would get rid of the need for massive insurance claims. In my area,
if water can reach the pumps, it can be pumped away. Because of the
lack of dredging, however, it cannot reach the pumps. It is possible to
see the pumps from the flooded areas, but the water cannot reach them
and therefore cannot be taken away. Dredging would cure that
problem.</hs_Para>

of concern is the risk that fracking for shale gas poses to our rivers
and groundwater in terms of pollution and water stress. The Bill
already amends the 2010 environmental permitting regulations that cover
fracking activities, making it an excellent opportunity to address
these concerns and strengthen the existing regulatory framework. The
House has heard repeatedly that our regulatory regime for fracking is
the most stringent in the world, and it is true that, if properly
implemented and enforced, the existing regulations could mitigate many
of the risks posed by fracking. However, although fracking has been
taking place for years, this particular new technology that is planned
for the UK brings more serious risks that we cannot properly assess at
this early stage. Even the best regulatory regime can only mitigate
risk; it cannot eliminate it. That means that a water pollution
incident cannot be ruled out. It is therefore of considerable concern
that it is not clear who would be liable if something does go wrong.
One of the main risks from fracking is pollution of groundwater, which
can occur because of faults in production wells. Groundwater clean-up
is very costly and can take decades. For example, the contamination of
a chalk aquifer near 
<?notus-xml column=115?>St Albans in Hertfordshire in 2000 led to an extensive contamination of
the public drinking water supply, and the cost of the clean-up, which
took a decade, was about £16 million.</hs_Para>

liability for pollution can be proven, there remains a risk that
fracking companies could go bankrupt, leaving taxpayers or water
companies with the costs. That has been a major issue in the case of
Scottish Coal, whose liquidators have been given permission to abandon
coal mines and polluted land without carrying out restoration or in any
way controlling pollution from the sites. Instead of identifying and
addressing these risks, it appears that the opposite direction of
travel is being taken. Not only is there pressure to
simplify and streamline regulation, with the Environment Agency
committing to, for example, a dramatic reduction in the time it takes
to issue permits to fracking operators, but there is evidence to
suggest that existing regulations are not being adequately enforced.
For example, at Preese Hall, the Environment Agency did not issue
environmental permits for the disposal and management of flow-back
waste water; it only discovered after the site had been hydraulically
fractured that the flow-back fluid should be classified as radioactive
waste.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112541000066">If
experiences in the United States have taught us anything, it would be
that we need a strict regulatory regime. We cannot rely on putting our
faith in the industry behaving well on a voluntary basis. In
a groundbreaking peer-reviewed study of aquifers overlying the
Marcellus and Utica shales in Pennsylvania and New York, Osborn et al,
2011, uncovered systematic evidence of methane contamination of
drinking water linked to shale gas
extraction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112541000067">In
England, a third of all our domestic water supply comes from
groundwater reserves, which are also essential for industry and
farming. It is vital that we go as far as possible to mitigate risks in
advance and ensure that we make provision to cover the full costs of
clean-ups. With that in mind, I ask the Minister to ensure the Bill
addresses these issues by implementing a liability guarantee. Such a
guarantee would ensure the public purse and the taxpayer are not hit
when anything goes
wrong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0003.htm#13112541000068">My
next big concern is the amount of water that is required for
the production of shale gas. Shale gas exploration and production is a
highly water-intensive industry, and the process of fracking requires
enormous volumes of water. At Preese Hall up to 8,400 cubic
metres—about the equivalent of three and a half Olympic-sized
swimming pools—is required per well. The fracking process may
have to be repeated several times over the life of the well to keep the
gas flowing. With proposals for thousands of sites, each with multiple
wells, the potential drain on our already stressed rivers and
groundwater could be huge.</hs_Para>

Minister and his Department to consider the Bill as an opportunity to
address these concerns by reforming the abstraction regime for taking
water from the environment. That should go a long way to ensuring that
additional pressure on water resources from fracking does not result in
the over-abstraction of water from areas already under water stress. If
the Government choose to exploit this new resource, we can make sure
that we do so in a way that does not place unacceptable 
<?notus-xml column=116?>risks on the environment or on the public purse. Such an approach will
also guard against unnecessary resource risks to our communities, our
countryside and our
businesses.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_25_PT_1/E8D4689B0EDAA4CC7F270BB0EE0FB671160D15CE" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 November 2013">Monday

about the need to tackle abstraction, which is damaging our rivers. We
are tackling this in two ways. First, we are taking action using the
tools already available to address over-abstraction. The Environment
Agency has reviewed thousands of abstraction licences and has changed
about 80 of them, returning 75 billion litres of water per year to the
environment in England. That is equivalent to the annual average water
use of a city larger than Birmingham. There is clearly a lot more to do
in the individual catchments that have been mentioned, and we have to

it was his work that got us to this stage. I am sure that that will

clear that any moves on abstraction and upstream reform must work

I am meeting her this week to discuss the matter. I will be pleased if
we can make progress on it, but there are issues with the way in which
they take their water from an intermediary, as she pointed out. Canals
were mentioned. We have discussed the Canal &amp; River Trust on the
Floor of the House in Question Time. I am happy to meet the hon. Member
for Stoke-on-Trent North (Joan Walley) and other hon. Members to
discuss that
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0004.htm#13112541000145">I
am grateful that we have had so much time to discuss the issues and to
get them out in the open. We have talked about the need to keep water
available and affordable, and to continue to improve the environment.
We have also mentioned the uncertainties in our water supply and the
pressures on it, such as unpredictable weather and the growing
population. We have a responsibility to ensure that we use our water
wisely, to protect it and to ensure that there is enough for future
generations. That is why we are taking action now. I am grateful for
the support of Members from all parts of the House. I commend the Bill

have enough time to debate this motion, which will effectively suspend
our Standing Orders. Given that the subject matter that we will be
debating on 2 December is amending the Standing Orders, it seems to me
that it is wrong to limit the debate because, as we know, in the
absence of a written constitution, the Standing Orders are the
constitution of our country. I do not think that we should take
changing the Standing Orders lightly. That is why I hope that in the
course of this debate we will hear from the Leader of the House about
why he thinks it reasonable for the Standing Orders to be altered, and
for the time limit for debate to be as short as set out in the motion.

in a county that has huge variances, from the busy city of Derby and

enjoy the respect and admiration of us all, not just for their untold
bravery that sees them run towards burning buildings while the rest of
us urgently back away, but because of their amazing life-saving work
and the horrors we know they witness during fire, flood and road
traffic accidents. Firefighters everywhere are admired, but in
Derbyshire, alongside the geographical challenges that face our force,
there are many causes for pride. Firefighters in Derbyshire have won
awards for the standard of care they provide to citizens, and they have
worked to identify individuals at greatest risk and provided additional
measures to protect them. Numbers of fires have reduced in recent years
due to their tremendously proactive approach to fire prevention, made
possible by their outreach work fitting smoke detectors and educating
citizens.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0004.htm#13112541000169">However,

Department that we could argue—in fact, I would argue—has
been the most cowardly in the whole Government. Of all the big spending
Departments, it is the one that devolves most of its funding, and
meanwhile it has taken the largest share of cuts. At a time when other
departmental budgets have been squeezed, Department for Communities and
Local Government budgets have been crushed, passing tough choices of
austerity to council leaders and fire authorities around the country.
It has been left to council leaders to decide whether to cut libraries

safety budgets, and for fire chiefs to decide whether to cut back on
firefighters or reduce fire prevention work.</hs_Para>

was a councillor for the Rother ward in Chesterfield in 2009 when the
old Whittington Moor fire station was closed and the new one was built
at the Donkins roundabout, at a cost of £4.5 million. We were

and to the area that had the most fires. When the Chesterfield retained
unit was disbanded, the public were assured that they would still be
provided for by the two fire engines at Staveley and back-up from
Dronfield and Clay Cross. Under the new plans, Dronfield and Staveley
will disappear. To allow the service to respond to those closures, the
brand new fire station will be moved a mile back up the road—I
am not making this up—to Whittington Moor, precisely where the
original station was. The fire authority tells us that it wants to
spend £4.3 million replacing the £4.5 million station
that still has its first coat of paint. Unsurprisingly, it will take a
hit on the resale value. It estimates that the used fire station might
get them £1 million, but who wants a used fire station? That

months from the day of recruitment for retained firefighters to be

station’s location for 120 hours a week, and the allowance
received for that equates to approximately 50p an hour. There are
already difficulties in recruiting and the changes will require a

13 staff who work at Duffield fire station, only two can make the five
minute “turn in” time for the new proposed station at
Milford—the other 11 staff would need to relocate to keep their
jobs. None of the Dronfield retained firefighters are able or willing
to be within the five-minute perimeter of Eckington fire station.
Chapel-en-le-Frith has 11 staff, none of whom can make the “turn

future locations of fire stations seem to change so
arbitrarily and so quickly? If implemented, these changes would
effectively mean a 10-year recruitment freeze for full-time
firefighters—a huge deskilling as a whole generation is told:
“No vacancies

risk of flooding, as we know from the great floods of Chesterfield in

The front line is being hit—in the police, social services,
libraries, Sure Start centres, accident and emergency departments, and
most certainly the fire service. No wonder the Conservatives have
chosen to delete their “no front-line cuts” pledge from
their website—they will not remove it from the memory of people
in Derbyshire so easily. Could anyone claim that the closure of 11 fire
stations and the loss of 16 fire engines and 108 full-time firefighters
is protecting front-line services? This plan does not just mean
millions being spent upfront on the basis of future savings; it does
not just mean the millions spent a few years ago going up in
smoke; it does not just mean dedicated firefighters being thrown out of
work; it does not just mean years of experience lost and thousands
spent in recruitment costs; it means people in Derbyshire being less

resulted in the tragic deaths of Claire James, Josie Leighton,
nine-year-old Tyler Green and 12-year-old Jordan Green. Our heartfelt

would to like to commend widely the incredibly important work that fire
and rescue authorities such as Derbyshire’s undertake, as the

place during the recent strike action.</hs_Para>

fire and rescue services despite the need to tackle the deficit
inherited from the last Administration. Reductions for the fire and

smaller reduction of 3% anticipated for 2014-15—I shall come
back to this—in terms of the indicative figures that we
published in last year’s settlement. Derbyshire has been
proactive in planning its spending not just for the current spending
round, but for the 2013 spending round. Its risk management plan stated

couple of years alone, Derbyshire fire and rescue has managed to move

front-line matters, such as the deployment of firefighters and the
stations themselves are best assessed at the local level. It is for
each fire and rescue authority to determine the operational activities
of its fire and rescue service through its integrated risk
management plans—something that the community has a chance to
look at and have its say on—in such a way that the particular
fire and rescue authority is budgeting to risk, not just budgeting to
budget. I know that part of Derbyshire’s strategy is a move
towards the greater deployment of retained rather than whole-time
firefighters. Members will know that this model works well in a number
of areas—my own county of Norfolk, for example, has a high
proportion of on-call firefighters—and that the move towards
greater use of the retained firefighter is the kind of change
identified by Sir Ken Knight for fire and rescue authorities to
consider to increase their overall efficiency and
effectiveness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0004.htm#13112541000210">It
is also important to note that there are other funding streams for fire
and rescue authorities. Funding is provided for resilience, for
example, including specialist equipment for flooding and other
emergencies. In Derbyshire alone, from 2013 through to 2015,
approximately half a million pound of funding has been provided for
resilience. Capital grant funding for fire and rescue authorities
overall has been significantly increased from £45 million in
2010 to £70 million in 2013 through to 2015. In Derbyshire, the
total amount received has been over £2 million. The Government
have provided wider funding in support of our belief that there is
scope to drive out waste and inefficiency through well-planned
efficiency measures, while ensuring that local communities continue to
receive an excellent service.</hs_Para>

point, which was that despite the claim of the hon. Member for
Chesterfield that the fire authority does not have enough money, it has
managed to go from having £10 million in reserve to nearly
£16 million over the last two years. That is a
substantial increase, bearing in mind that the entire budget is only
£40 million. My understanding is that Derbyshire wants to invest
some of that money to save for the future. That comes back to the local
fire authority deciding what it 
<?notus-xml column=137?>spends itself. It is important to note, as I say, that while some
Members are saying that the Derbyshire authority, on a £40

as the hon. Gentleman noted, the number of injuries and fatalities
caused by fire in general—notwithstanding the recent

authorities, the impact of the Fire Kills campaign and changes in
technology, the number of accidental fire deaths has decreased
nationally. The number of non-fatal hospital casualties has fallen by
more than 54%, and the number of fire attendance call-outs in
Derbyshire has fallen by about 15% over the last 10 years. That is a
real achievement, in which fire and rescue authorities should take
great pride. However, as the tragic fire last week has shown us, they
must continue to put prevention and protection first in all that they
do. Fire prevention is the front line for
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112541000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/debtext/131125-0004.htm#13112541000215">Although

loans were available to eligible higher education students who were
enrolled between 1990 and 1998. Borrowers are required to repay in
fixed monthly instalments over a set period, typically five or seven
years. Interest is charged at a rate equivalent to the retail prices
index. Repayments can be deferred for a year at a time if a
borrower’s income is below the threshold, which is 85% of the
national average earnings. From 1 September 2013 the threshold is
£28,775. There will be no change to borrowers’ terms and
conditions (including interest rates) as a result of the sale; these
are set down in regulations and borrowers’ credit
agreements.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1311251000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/wmstext/131125m0001.htm#1311251000026">As

value to Government of retaining the loan book. The terms of the sale
transfers the financial risks associated with loan repayments to the
purchaser. Any impacts on the public finances will be decided by the

Members of the consortium have a great deal of experience managing
consumer debt and a history of treating customers fairly and I am
content that they are a fit and proper owner of the loan book. They
will have to adhere to strict Office of Fair Trading guidance about the

Later today the High Speed Rail (London - West Midlands) Bill will
receive its First Reading. This is a significant step forward in the
Government’s strategy for a high-speed rail network that will
address the critical capacity constraints that we face and improve
connectivity between our great cities. This is vital to ensure that the
country is equipped to compete economically in the 21st
century.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1311251000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/wmstext/131125m0001.htm#1311251000054">The

changes to the statutory service represent a key milestone in our
progress to reform child maintenance. But we are also aiming wider: our
starting point is that children tend to do better when they have a
positive relationship with both parents and we want to make working
together the norm across all parenting issues, not just child
maintenance. We are supporting separated parents to do this through the
Help and Support for Separated Families (HSSF) initiative. As part of
this, we have launched the Sorting out Separation web app; an HSSF
mark; the HSSF Telephony Network; and an Innovation Fund to test and
evaluate new interventions to help separated parents work
together.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Petitions" ColStart="1"><?date 2013-11-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_25_PT_1/00D679FCBDEB1A23CA54977AAFC84967B1A65D1E" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 November 2013">Monday

However, based on provisional data and assuming an allowance price of

various searches of the departmental correspondence system have been
conducted. In relation to fuel poverty in the private rented sector and
the operation of the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, it
has been possible to search the records on correspondence with DECC
Ministers with the case title “fuel poverty”. In the
period since June 2013, 214 letters from hon. Members were given this
case title. Providing the average time taken to reply to these letters

is allocated using the Police Allocation Formula (PAF). No
consideration of investigating deaths oversees is made by the PAF. The
allocation of resources within each force is a matter for the Police
and Crime Commissioner (PCC) in consultation with the Chief Constable.
PCCs are able to apply for a Special Grant if they face an unexpected
event which requires significant
resources.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13112526000071" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/text/131125w0001.htm#13112526000071">Disabled

warships are allocated by the Surface Ship Support Alliance, an

Maritime—Naval Ships and Babcock Marine. These allocations are
based on what is best for the maritime enterprise as a whole, taking
account of factors such as industrial capacity, past performance and
the ability to meet Royal Navy crew harmony guidelines. In allocating
major upkeep work, the aim is to balance work across the surface fleet
as a whole, rather than by each individual class of ship.</hs_Para>

designate payment systems to bring them—and system
participants—into the scope of the regulator's powers.
Initially, the Treasury expects to designate the main inter-bank
systems, the cheque clearing system and the international three and
four party card systems. However, as set out in the legislation, all
retail payment systems active in the UK will be in the potential scope
of regulation, meaning "no-party" schemes may also be brought into the
scope of regulation, if and when they meet the criteria for
designation. These criteria require that the Treasury must be satisfied
that any deficiencies in the design of the payment system, or any
disruption in its operation, would be likely to have serious
consequences for those who use, or are likely to use, the services
provided by the system. Once designated, the Payments Systems Regulator
will be required to advance its objectives in a proportionate manner,
which will include taking into account differences between members of
the regulated
population.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13112534000033" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/text/131125w0002.htm#13112534000033">Personal

Wright:</Member></B> The National Offender Management Service's
National Tactical Response Group (NTRG) is a specialist resource to
assist both public and private sector establishments in safely managing
and resolving serious incidents in prisons. NTRG also supports
“Tornado” response teams. Operation Tornado is the code
name used by the National Offender Management Service to describe
mutual aid arrangements across the prison estate in England and Wales.
Trained staff are deployed from neighbouring establishments to assist
with the most serious incidents. Available information shows that the
incidences of deployment of Tornado teams from April 2010 to 30
September 2013 have fallen.</hs_Para>

have been called to attend incidents at only 45% of the total number of
establishments in the past year, illustrating that the majority of
prisons have not required assistance. The number of callouts has been
fairly consistent over the period in question, though there has been a
slight rise in the number of callouts over recent months. This is
mainly due to minor incidents such as prisoners protesting by climbing
onto the netting between landings. NTRG staff have the specialist
skills required to deal with such incidents which accounted for 68% of
all the callouts in the past year, and they are frequently called to
attend as a precautionary measure. Not all callouts result in
engagement by NTRG staff, with a number of situations being resolved
locally. Of the 151 incidents NTRG attended up to 30 September 2013,
75% were resolved by surrender. There has been no rise in the number of
serious incidents being
attended.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112540000263" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/text/131125w0003.htm#13112540000263">The

which is used in the prison or probation context. Where an offender is
released from prison on licence, they must seek the approval of their
supervising officer for the place they wish to reside, unless they are
required, as a condition of licence, to reside at a specified address,
such as an approved premises. A supervising officer may approve,
following risk assessment as appropriate, private rented accommodation
for an dwelling. Such properties are not funded centrally. The only
properties which the Ministry of Justice funds centrally are approved
premises (of which there are 100 in England and Wales) and properties

a police officer may choose between one and six different factors that
they felt contributed to the accident. The contributory factors reflect
the reporting officer's opinion at the time of reporting and are not
necessarily the result of extensive investigation. Moreover it is
recognised that subsequent enquires could lead to the reporting officer
changing their opinion. It is important to note where some factors may
have contributed to an accident it may be difficult for a police

booking arrangements for motorcycle tests in response to the Transport

to the introduction of OBS, a minority of businesses were booking, and

tests are predominantly booked by approved training bodies (motorcycle
rider training schools) on behalf of their pupils. OBS allocates
training bodies a proportion of available motorcycle test slots based
on the number of tests they have previously booked. Trainers who cancel
20% or more of their total test bookings within seven working days of

drawn from the public, who are responsible for monitoring the company's
standards of corporate governance, with the Secretary of State as a
special member. Network Rail has reformed its corporate governance to
become more accountable to passengers and freight customers. This
includes reducing the number of members, evolving their selection

cost efficiency of roads delivery. This is similar to the benchmarking
activity already carried out by ORR for the rail sector, and a high
degree of synergy appears to exist with ORR's existing functions. This
could involve changing the statutory remit of ORR, as well as providing
additional funds to cover roads-related work. Further details are

paracetamol and dextropropoxyphene were mentioned and where

in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. Registration delays do not
exist in Scotland. Additional information on registration delays for

mandatory reconsideration stage for employment and support allowance is
intended to be an independent step in the process, therefore, whether
the claimant has claimed jobseeker's allowance or not in the
intervening period, this will have no bearing on the mandatory
reconsideration decision. Work Capability Assessment decisions are
binding—a jobseeker's allowance decision maker cannot decide
that a claimant is too ill to work if this contradicts the ESA decision
maker's decision. However, the claimant must agree to the jobseeker's
agreement/claimant commitment to be eligible.</hs_Para>

completion of the mandatory reconsideration process, however, the
process will be monitored to avoid any unnecessary delays. The time it
takes to complete a mandatory reconsideration will vary depending on
the circumstances of the case, but DWP will contact the claimant once
the mandatory reconsideration process is
complete.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112540000945" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/text/131125w0005.htm#13112540000945">If
no further information is needed and the case is straightforward, the
mandatory reconsideration process for employment and support allowance
could be completed relatively quickly. We would usually expect this to
take around 14 days, but it could take longer. For example, if further
information is needed, the law states that DWP have to give people one
month to provide it and this may be extended further at the decision

sale and supply of products that contain asbestos. These will apply to
Second World War gas masks, if they contain asbestos. REACH does permit
the continued use of existing asbestos containing articles. However the
Health and Safety Executive's advice is that, while the overall risk is
low, it is not appropriate to wear or handle, for demonstration
purposes, Second World War gas masks that could contain asbestos. There
are some types of gas mask that do not contain asbestos, and others

registration. This will apply to providers from the public, private and
the voluntary sectors. Where a director is considered by the Care
Quality Commission to be unfit, it could either refuse registration, in

England is investing £5 million through Sports coach UK to
improve the standard and availability of coaching. This includes a
pilot project to recruit and retain 500 new female coaches in the
south-east. The aim is to roll out the project nationally from 2015 and
recruit up to 5,000 new female coaches. While there is some evidence to
suggest the gender of coach can be important to participants, the
quality and enjoyment of the coaching session remain key factors in
increasing and maintaining the number of women who take part in a

Robathan:</Member></B> It continues to be a fundamental principle of
Government policy that reward in the public sector should be linked to
performance. The Ministry of Defence (MOD), in line with other
Government Departments, rewards performance through the use of
non-consolidated payments which reflect outputs, results and
performance. These payments are colloquially known as ‘bonuses',
although this is a misleading description because the
performance-related element of pay is part of the Departmental pay bill
rather than being an additional cost. In addition, the MOD operates a
special bonus scheme (SBS) to reward civilian staff below the senior
civil service (SCS) for exceptional performance in a specific task or
for the achievement of professional qualifications which benefit the
MOD and the individual. Both types of payments are non-pensionable and
are a cost effective way of rewarding performance since they do not
count towards pension costs, and so reduce the overall cost of
employing civil
servants.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112517000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/corrtext/131125c0001.htm#13112517000011">Since
2010-11, the Government has restricted performance related payments for
the SCS to the top 25% of performers (from 65% in previous years),
saving the taxpayer around £15 million. They are only paid to
reward excellence, for example to recognise and incentivise those
responsible for delivering high quality public services and savings to
the taxpayer. Pay decisions for non-senior staff are delegated to
individual departments, enabling them to tailor reward packages that
meet their own work force and business needs. Payments made since
1 April 2011 are detailed in Departmental transparency data

Robathan:</Member></B> It continues to be a fundamental principle of
Government policy that reward in the public sector should be linked to
performance. The Ministry of Defence (MOD), in line with other
Government Departments, rewards performance through the use of
non-consolidated payments which reflect outputs, results and
performance. These payments are colloquially known as 'bonuses',
although this is a misleading description because the
performance-related element of pay is part of the Departmental pay bill
rather than being an additional cost. In addition, the MOD operates a
special bonus scheme (SBS) to reward civilian staff below the senior
civil service (SCS) for exceptional performance in a specific task or
for the achievement of professional qualifications which benefit the
MOD and the individual. Both types of payments are non-pensionable and
are a cost effective way of rewarding performance since they do not
count towards pension costs, and so reduce the overall cost of
employing civil
servants.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112517000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131125/corrtext/131125c0001.htm#13112517000214">Since
2010-11, the Government has restricted performance related payments for
the SCS to the top 25% of performers (from 65% in previous years),
saving 
<?notus-xml column=6?>the taxpayer around £15 million. They are only paid to reward
excellence, for example to recognise and incentivise those responsible
for delivering high quality public services and savings to the
taxpayer. Pay decisions for non-senior staff are delegated to
individual departments, enabling them to tailor reward packages that
meet their own work force and business needs. Payments made since 1
April 2011 are detailed in Departmental transparency data which is
