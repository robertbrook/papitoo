commissioning groups are now responsible for commissioning services and
treatments for their local populations, with NHS England providing
oversight and support. NHS England has advised that it does not
routinely collect data on the number and type of treatments that CCGs
have decided not to offer to patients. We have been clear: restricting
access to services on the basis of cost alone is wrong and compromises
patient care. Commissioning decisions should be made using clinical

response. Is he not concerned about the recent <I>British Medical
Journal</I> survey, which showed that since CCGs took over, one in
seven have introduced new treatment restrictions, including treatment
for hip and knee replacements, cataracts, and caesarean births for
non-medical reasons? What steps are the Government taking to ensure
regional and national monitoring and consistency of treatment policies
across the NHS? Moreover, the Royal College of Surgeons is concerned
that so few CCGs are meeting their legal obligation to publish guidance
on how they will provide medicines, surgery and therapeutic
interventions. This was meant to provide transparency in rationing
decisions. What will the Government do about
it?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111259000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111259000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13111259000072" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111259000072">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the availability of
some<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> healthcare
services is determined nationally; for example, under NICE technology
recommendations. Some services are commissioned directly by NHS
England, but in most cases decision-making on whether to fund a service
or treatment is left to the local CCG or local authority. That is to
enable CCGs and local authorities to commission services that best fit
the needs of their local population. For such decision-making it is
very important that the process is rational, transparent and fair. The
right contained in the NHS constitution ensures that that happens. If a
CCG decides that a treatment will not normally be funded, it needs to
be able to consider whether to fund that treatment for an individual
patient on an exceptional basis.</hs_para>

the specific point made by the noble Lord about the financial
sustainability of provider trusts, we would expect commissioners and

patients are treated in the right setting. As we all know, that

from the one given by the chief executive of RBS, who, as the noble
Lord will know, has told us that the bank is working very closely with
the Treasury—by which he means Treasury officials. RBS has now
set up an internal bad bank, while the Chancellor, whom I assume the
officials talk to occasionally, has refused to set up a bad bank.
Between them, they have found £38 billion of high-risk assets
which they have decided will go into the bad bank. They have also said
that they propose to finish the rest after writing off £4.5
billion by 2016. For those who owe that money, there is now an
incentive to wait until the very end, which will mean the bank having
to write off even more. Is that something that the officials, with the
Chancellor’s consent, have agreed

review about whether there should be a formal good bank/bad bank split
of RBS. The Government decided that the cost and disruption of doing
this was not justified. However, as the noble Lord says, the bank has
itself decided to make an internal split, enabling it to have a greater
focus on lending and on dealing in a more orderly way with many loans
which will not be repaid or will be only partially repaid. Many of
these are related to the property

gross lending is now rising. The picture is clouded by the fact that a
lot of SMEs are still paying back loans, so the net position is not as
positive, but net lending is down by a much lower amount. As far as
lending to SMEs as a whole is concerned, the picture is improving. The
Business Bank was launched on 17 October and it aims to support
economic growth by bringing together public and private sector funds to
improve financial markets for SMEs. Very recently it announced its

Andrew Large for RBS, which found that the bank had failed to meet its
own lending standards, had risk-averse staff and took longer to process
applications than other banks, and that its treatment of customers in
financial distress had led to major negative perceptions of the bank.
The bank is now, at long last, moving to tackle many of those issues,

Lord Spicer—the railway essentially was expected to fall into
decline, having had a long history of underinvestment and of
stop-and-start annual budgets. Since then, the UK has seen a doubling
of passenger journeys to the highest level since the 1920s;
4,000 more services a day than in the mid-1990s; a 60%

the territory of Royal Mail. The privatisation of the railways may not
have been perfect; we certainly had Railtrack going into administration
in 2002, and there have been other issues. The question is: do we have
a system that has delivered a significantly better railway for
customers and freight in this country? I would argue that we very

magistrates in youth courts are trained and encouraged to engage in

would place a duty on the Secretary  of State to prepare and
publish guidance about the consequences of forced marriage and
breaching a forced marriage protection order. We all agree that
criminalisation, whether through criminalisation of a breach of a
forced marriage protection order or through direct criminalisation, is
not enough to tackle forced marriage alone. The previous Government
recognised this and that all the authorities which come into contact
with victims of forced marriage—schools, colleges, the police,
doctors and health services, social services, local authorities,
airport staff, FCO staff and the courts—must be aware of forced
marriage, how it manifests itself, what to look for and, most
importantly, the appropriate action that needs to be
taken.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111249000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111249000053">For
example, in August this year, the Government issued a warning to
teachers, doctors and airport staff to be alert to forced marriages
over the summer holidays. Between June and August, the Forced Marriage
Unit—a joint operation between the Home Office and the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office—received over 400 reports. This year the
unit handed out leaflet cards called <I>Marriage: It’</I><I>s
Y</I><I>our Choice</I>, to provide help and information to potential
victims, signposting them to 
<?notus-xml column=630?>confidential advice. The cards reminded young people to speak to police
or airline staff if they found themselves at an airport with nowhere to
turn. That is an important initiative. Of course, it referred them to
the Forced Marriage Unit, which was set up in January 2005 as the
Government’s one-stop shop for dealing with forced marriage
policy, outreach and casework. It does an excellent job, operating both
inside the UK, where support is provided to any individual, and
overseas, where consular assistance is to be provided to British
nationals, including dual nationals. I pay tribute to my noble and

Karma Nirvana and the Southall Black Sisters gave during Committee in
the Commons. Karma Nirvana’s evidence showed that little had
changed in schools since 2008, and that schools were often reluctant to
participate in the charity’s work on forced marriage, for
example. Other evidence confirms that schools do very little to ensure
that pupils are informed about forced marriage and to offer them the
necessary support if they need it. There was even evidence that some

have now been two Select Committee inquiries and the Forced Marriage
Unit report, and still the Department of Education does not treat
forced marriage as a child protection issue in many schools—a
reason why this amendment is so important. We have to recognise that
the voluntary sector is doing an excellent job in trying to remedy this
situation. I know that were he here, my noble friend Lord Harris would
tell us about the organisation he chairs, the Freedom Charity, which
first and foremost wants to protect the lives  of children and
young people by raising awareness of 
<?notus-xml column=631?>forced marriage in the UK and the associated problems of dishonour-based
violence, giving young people  the tools and confidence to deal
with the problem. The charity plays a vital role in spreading the word
and helping to prevent forced marriage, and runs the country’s
first 24-hour, seven-days-a-week helpline to raise awareness and
prevent abuse. It should be commended for the work it does. However, we
have to accept that it is almost certainly not

second point, which I will raise very briefly with the Minister on this

safeguarding policies and practices are implemented, and that is what

of some of the problems that I encountered as a young teenager living
in my community. I like to think that we have moved on considerably in
the intervening 35 years or so, but this is still a real issue. Too
many young women are still exposed to this problem and are victims of
it. We need to do far more to tackle it than is currently the

guidance needs to be uniform and all the agencies that come into
contact with potential victims need to be very clear about what they
can do to support these young people who come forward needing help. I
agree with the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, on
schools. There are huge concerns about schools because they follow
their own principles and guidelines. In addition, we now have far more
free schools, whose practice in this regard may not be in line with
that of local authority schools. I would like assurance that the role

have had conversations with survivors and some of the organisations
working in the front line of forced marriages, particularly Jasvinder
Sanghera of Karma Nirvana, who is very supportive. As most noble Lords
who have worked in this field know, Jasvinder is herself a survivor of
forced marriage and has set up the organisation to support other women
in this situation. I was struck by the advice that Karma Nirvana gives
girls who are forced to travel overseas to marry; namely, to conceal a
spoon or fork, for example, about their person so that an alarm will be
set off when they go through the airport X-ray machine. Then the
airport security staff will have to take them aside to speak to them,
thus giving them the opportunity to speak privately with security staff
and try to enlist their support. It is sad that this advice still has
to be given to young women and some young men. If everything worked
effectively, presumably they would not need to resort to
such tactics. Is my noble friend the Minister confident that there is
consistency across the country regarding 
<?notus-xml column=632?>the guidance and support given by airport security staff to young girls
who are being forced out of the country and who follow the advice to
activate an alarm, or is it just up to individual staff to decide what

Butler-Sloss (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as
chairman of a forced marriage commission which is currently hearing
evidence. An interesting aspect of that is that we went to visit the
Karma Nirvana organisation just outside Leeds and the victims to whom
we spoke were all very anxious that forced marriage should be
criminalised. I have had my doubts about that. I took part, with the
noble Lord, Lord Lester, in the original initiative on this issue,
which led, I am very glad to say, to a government Bill being produced
some years ago under the previous Government. I know that the noble
Lord is very opposed to the criminalisation of forced marriage.
However, there is no doubt that all the victims to whom members of the
commission spoke considered that this was an essential next step, which
I thought was very

am very concerned about how the immigration authorities, or emigration
authorities, can cope with this problem. I talked to an immigration
official at Gatwick and asked him what he did about girls going out to
Pakistan with their parents and those coming back, or a young man
coming into this country, where a girl is waiting with her parents to
welcome him as her intended husband. The official told me that he had
spoken to these girls on many occasions. One such girl was waiting for
an intended husband to come through the airport and the official took
her aside and asked her whether she wanted to marry that man. She
replied, “No, I do not”. When he asked her whether it was
a forced marriage, she replied, “Yes, it is”. He said
that he could stop the forced marriage by preventing the young man
entering the country but that the girl would have to declare publicly
that she was being forced into a marriage. The girl replied, “I
cannot do 
<?notus-xml column=633?>so in front of my parents”. This is a major problem. We know that
a lot of girls and some young men, many of whom are under 18, are being
forced into marriage in Pakistan, Bangladesh and India and, indeed,
other places. This is by no means only a Muslim problem. It is also a
Sikh problem and occasionally a Jewish problem, but it is a problem
across the world. One of the major problems in this regard I have been
told about concerns disabled young people, particularly those with
learning difficulties, as the parents think they are doing the young
woman concerned a favour by marrying her off as she will be protected
for the rest of her life. Nevertheless, she does not want the marriage
and this is a very real
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T12:37:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111252000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111252000005">I
very much support Amendment 5, particularly because I think it is time
that everyone, from the Government through to the Department for
Education and schools in particular, should do as the noble Baroness,
Lady Thornton, suggests and treat this as a child protection issue. If
you force a girl or boy to marry under the age of 18, particularly
under 16, when they do not want to marry, this is a very real child
protection issue. However, another extremely worrying issue arises.
These girls—it affects particularly the girls—are being
married in other parts of the world with an Islamic ceremony. That
ceremony is not registered overseas and it is not registered in this
country. Therefore, the girl is not married according to English law.
The husband can divorce her under Islamic law and she can obtain no
redress in this country for herself. She does not have to be married to
get financial help for her children but she gets no financial help
whatever for herself because she is not married according to English
law. Interestingly, there is a law that gives the second wife in a
polygamous marriage some financial assistance.</hs_para>

Lady Thornton, and my noble friend Lady Hussein-Ece for tabling the

marriages. As I said when we moved on to this part  of the
Bill, there is evidence to suggest that this is a 
<?notus-xml column=634?>reality and we have to deal with it. I can assure her that the
Government take this very seriously. The issue of unregistered
marriages which take place abroad or even on home soil, and which do
not provide the protections afforded by the rule of law, is one that
must be looked at and the Government are looking at how this can be
done. An example of good practice within Muslim communities is where
the nikah—one aspect of Islamic marriages—is not
performed by the imam until a registration certificate is provided.
Many Muslim communities adhere to that principle and we should be
encouraging that kind of practice across  the board.</hs_para>

I will explain the existing statutory provisions in relation to

Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007. I join noble friends in paying
tribute to my noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill whose
Private Member’s Bill resulted in the 2007 Act and provided a
widely used civil remedy for victims and potential victims of forced
marriage. Subsection (1) of Section 63Q of the 1996
Act provides that the Secretary of State may, from time to time,
prepare and publish guidance to such descriptions of persons as the
Secretary of State considers appropriate about, first, the effect of
Part 4A of the Family Law Act 1996, and, secondly, about
other matters relating to forced marriages.</hs_para>

107 amends Part 4A to make the breach of a forced marriage protection

the preparation of guidance about the offence in Clause 108 is also

recognise that, unlike other amendments tabled by the noble Baroness,
Lady Thornton, the existing statutory provision does not place a duty
on the Secretary of State to prepare and publish guidance. However, as
the Minister explained when the same amendments were debated in
Committee in the House of Commons, the fact remains that two editions
of the multi-agency statutory guidance for those dealing with forced
marriage have been published, in accordance with Section 63Q of the
1996 Act, since the provisions of Part 4A came into force in 2008. The

noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, has already spoken about the
importance of adherence to guidance. Subsection (2) of Section 63Q

come back to my central point about education within the community.
This is not a one-off: it is not about passing legislation or
criminalising a particular activity; it is about how it is applied in
practice. This will require a community effort involving training,
education, doctors’ surgeries and practitioners on the ground.
It will mean going into the communities, into all places of worship and
all community centres, to ensure that the routes are available to
people. This is not about targeting one community or another. I am sure
all noble Lords share that sentiment. It is about ensuring that no
young girl or boy—boys are also forced into this—has to
endure pressure or fear of social ostracism if they take a step to say
no to forced marriage. The relevant support and guidance must be

to provide guidance it is always ready to do so. Forced marriage is
totally unacceptable and schools should be part of the process by
ensuring that intervention or support is provided where they feel it is

communities. 
<?notus-xml column=638?>Whether it involves an Irish farmer, someone in this country from a

1977 to date, which is not very long—I have had the privilege of
working with families in which both boys and girls have been subjected
to forced marriage. During that time, my experience in the Foreign
Office caused me to seek to create the Forced Marriage Unit and then to
pursue the issue with vigour through each of the departments in which I
was privileged to be a Minister. Lastly, as noble Lords will know, as
Attorney-General I had the opportunity to assist victims of domestic
violence, of which forced marriage is part. The prosecution of
those who unlawfully seek to coerce others into a marriage to which
they do not consent is something which all of us, no matter which

then looked at the other indications that we have had, and there is a
concern. I shall explain why that is. At the moment we have a plethora
of criminal offences. Just as with domestic violence, forced marriage
comes in many forms and will be used and perpetrated by a number of
individuals in different ways. You may have cases that involve the
victim of a forced marriage being subjected to common assault, actual
body harm or Section 18 or Section 20 grievous bodily harm. You may
have cases that involve false imprisonment, attempts to murder or
threats to kill. Each of those offences carries a different penalty.
False imprisonment, rape and conspiracy to rape all carry life
imprisonment, not seven years’
imprisonment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:02:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111252000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111252000031">Therefore,
I ask the Minister how this particular offence will be prosecuted. How
will we differentiate between this offence and cases where someone may
have been kidnapped or falsely imprisoned, for which the punishment
could potentially be up to life imprisonment? How will prosecutors and
others implementing this new offence differentiate between those more
serious offences and the offence of forced marriage, where the activity
used to try to coerce or oblige the individual to enter into a marriage
will be one of those offences? I am concerned that we might downgrade
the offence if it involves a forced marriage. The effect would be that
if you kidnap someone simpliciter, you may be subject to a potential
penalty of life imprisonment, but if you kidnap someone for the purpose
of forcing them into a marriage and you are then prosecuted for the
offence of so doing, under this legislation you will be subject to the
lesser penalty. I am very concerned about what we may be saying to the

Scotland of Asthal:</Member></B> My Lords, that, of course, is the way
forward. However, the question that I pose is this: how are the
prosecutor and the police officer to decide which offence to go for?
Criminal prosecutions, as the noble Lord will know, will be carried out
on the basis of proving things beyond reasonable doubt. If you look at
the forced marriage provision, you have to identify a course of
behaviour that is coercive. In so doing, the prosecutor will have 
<?notus-xml column=640?>to identify what criminal act was alleged against the defendant. For
example, is it alleged that the accused hit the person or that they
threatened the person? It seems to me that in order to prove the forced
marriage provision, you have to identify a substantive criminal act
which it is asserted that person committed. If one then has a jury,
what will we say to the jury? How do we differentiate the forced
marriage allegation from the substantive allegation made in relation to
the other
offence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:05:39"></hs_TimeCode>? I am
asking this probing question to understand how the Government expect
this to be done, because you cannot have an alternative in the way that
we have just debated unless there is clarity about what the prosecutor
is seeking to establish. In the case of a kidnapping, in order to
satisfy the jury that a forced marriage offence was committed, how do
you differentiate between those two if the accused is found not guilty
of the kidnapping but guilty of the forced marriage based on the
kidnapping? There is an inherent
difficulty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:06:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111252000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111252000034">The
only element of this offence that seems not to be currently covered is
coercion on an emotional basis. I take as an example a devout Jewish
family which discovers that one of its children wishes to marry outside
the faith. A matchmaker has arranged a marriage within the community
and the child rejects the suggestion made by the parent. The parent
then says, “If you do not do this, I will rend my garments, I
will sit shiva for you”—which means, in effect, “I
will treat you as if you were dead”—“and you will
break my heart”. That is coercion inasmuch as it is emotional
blackmail, perpetuated for the sole purpose of making the child change
their mind, but it is genuinely felt by the parent, who believes that
to refuse will be detrimental to the child’s long-term being.
Looking at this offence, it seems to me that it would be possible to
prosecute such a parent under this legislation. I want to be clear as
to whether the Government believe that such a prosecution would be
merited and is what they wish to achieve.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13111252000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111252000035">The
whole question of forced marriage is a very delicate and difficult
issue. If emotional blackmail, which is not yet on the statute book, is
the only offence, do the Government intend this provision to apply to
parents who use it? Emotional blackmail can be devastating; if you
think your mother is going to kill herself, that the family are going
to be shamed, that your father will never again be able to raise his
head and that you will be thrown out of your community, that is very
powerful coercion, directed specifically to cause the child to comply
with the request. It seems to me, looking at the offence created, that
that behaviour could be caught by this provision. I would very much
like to know from the Minister whether that is the Government’s
intent.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:09:26"></hs_TimeCode> Let us
be clear. If a loving parent disagrees with a child and seeks to
persuade them to do something, which the child does not want to do but
which the parent believes to be right—no matter how wrong that
parent is and if they do it lovingly—they could find themselves
in difficulties. I need to understand from the Minister whether that is
indeed his
intent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:09:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111252000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111252000036">The
other issue is to see how the legislation is currently working. From
the evidence that I have been able to cull, the forced marriage
protection orders 
<?notus-xml column=641?>appear to be a very effective tool. Between November 2008 and the end of
2010 there were 257 applications for forced marriage protection orders,
of which 181 had power of arrest attached. By June 2011 339
orders were recorded. A study carried out in 2011 at Roehampton
University shows that of the 74 written responses received from a range
of groups, including local authorities, organisations concerned with
domestic violence, faith groups, police and lawyers, 50% of respondents
thought it should not be criminal, 38% were in favour, 13% were unsure,
57% thought it would be more difficult for criminals to come forward,
and 64% thought that the existing legislation was enough. So 64%
thought that what we have now is enough. The real issue that came
forward strongly was the enforcement of the forced marriage protection
orders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:11:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111252000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111252000037">Before
we step into an area where there may be unforeseen consequences, I
should like to hear from the Minister how it is proposed that this
offence will operate and what guidance the enforcement
agencies—the police and the CPS—should be given. If,
however, as my amendment proposes, the Government were minded to make
it an “aggravating feature”, that would be a very useful
tool for the courts. Forced marriage involves a breach of trust. It is
not just that you kidnap, falsely imprison or assault someone you are
supposed to love, it is that you do so to force them to enter into a

Hussain (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, coming back to what the noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, said earlier on forced marriage, I,
too, am glad that the Government are taking this seriously and are
trying to do something about this awful practice involving many victims
whose lives are made miserable. At the same time I, too, wonder whether
the measures that the Government are trying to take will be helpful or
counterproductive, as I said at an earlier stage. As has been suggested
by other noble Lords, I fear that by making forced marriage a criminal
act, a lot of young 
<?notus-xml column=642?>people will not come forward to report it, so it could be pushed more
under the carpet, rather than being dealt
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:16:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111252000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111252000040">Will
the Minister shed some light on the background from which forced
marriage comes? I share the view that it is not an issue from one
particular community or faith. However, many noble Lords will know that
most cases registered with the Forced Marriage Unit of the Home Office
come from the Pakistani Muslim community. I speak from that community,
as I belong to it and know what is happening. Does the Minister
understand that one of the major factors in forced marriages is the
clan system? The tribe system strongly exists within the Pakistani
community in the UK, although we have been settled here for 40 or 50
years. In the tribes, sects, brathries, clans or castes—whatever
name we use—people are divided into those groups and many of
them do not want their sons or daughters to marry out of their clans,
brathries or castes. This is where many forced marriages are taking
place.</hs_para>

the Minister recognise that and what will the Government do about
educating people to come out of the brathries system? I get invited to
many community meetings and have spoken many times about this. I have
written in the Urdu language, which I am able to do, in newspapers
against this practice. For example, 15 years ago in my home town of
Luton, there was a big community meeting where we discussed community
issues. There were a couple of hundred people there, and I spoke on
this issue. By the time I had finished, every leader of every clan or
caste gave me a dirty look, as if to say, “How dare
you?”. That is how strongly the caste system is built into some
of these cultures. We need to educate them not only through the normal
education channels but through the ethnic media, which has hardly been
mentioned but which can play a positive role in educating
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:18:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111252000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111252000042">Then
there is the film industry. I was watching a film on one of the
satellite channels; many Pakistani-origin people watch dramas and films
on these channels. In this film, a female was to be married to someone
out of her caste. Another female tells her, “My dear, you will
have to give up this idea”, and points to the cemetery outside
their house, saying, “It is full of virgins”. They are
the virgins who were not allowed to get married outside the caste. This
is how strongly this is practised outside the UK and these films, when
they are shown, have an impact on people’s lives and behaviour.
We need to understand that as well, and maybe we need to educate our
own people in how to look into
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111252000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111252000043">On

Minister will be able to tell us how he thinks he can prevent the
criminalisation of forced marriage discouraging reporting. I strongly

Uddin (Non-Afl):</Member></B> My Lords, I stand somewhat hesitantly and
ask for the House’s leniency, as I did not take part at Second
Reading. I hope that the 
<?notus-xml column=643?>House will indulge me for a few minutes, as someone who chaired the
initial work on forced marriage in 1998, alongside the noble Lord, Lord
Ahmed, instructed by the then Home Secretary. I was inspired by the
comprehensive understanding of the noble and learned Baroness,
Lady Scotland. I have no words of expertise to be able to relay the
issues she laid before the House. I was also deeply inspired by the
noble Lord, Lord Hussain. All those years ago, in 1998, such a speech
would have been unthinkable from a Member of the House of Lords coming
from the Pakistani community. The noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, also comes
from the Pakistani community and, although he took a little
pulling in on my sisterly part to bring him along to the discussions,
when he did, he did so with vigour. We are standing on the shoulders of
giants regarding much of the work that was done across the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111252000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111252000045">We
went across the country for 18 months, talking to various sections of
the community: we left very few stones unturned, whether it was the
Jewish community, the Irish community, the Scottish borders or the
Welsh community. We did not leave any of the women’s
organisations out of the debate. Out of it came the Forced Marriage
Unit, which is very laudable, and the work it has subsequently done. I
support the amendment moved by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Scotland, because it is critical. All those years ago, women really
wanted some protection and their consensus, which was right across the
board, led to forced marriage protection orders. However, our report
made it very clear that we proposed that this should have been done
under the protection of domestic violence legislation and child
protection legislation. Whether it is kidnapping or murder, we wanted
to mainstream the issue of forced marriage into the criminal
legislation. That did not happen at that
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111252000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111252000046">The
women’s organisations listed by the noble and learned Baroness,
Lady Scotland, have played a critical part in leading to the changes
that have occurred and we have to acknowledge how much change there has
been, led by community organisations, faith organisations and the
women’s organisations themselves. If they are now saying that
criminalisation will impact on the numbers of women and young people
reporting, I suggest to the Committee that we take that very seriously.
I have attended a number of meetings with these organisations, both
here in the House and outside, and they have consistently asked that
the Government recognise their work and expertise. They are saying that
criminalisation will make it very difficult for them to work because,
whatever we say about the amount of resources available outside, we
have done very little since 1998 to empower those marginalised women
economically and to address their welfare needs and their education.
Women, in particular, will not be confident to come forward, whether it
is to report violence against them or to report rape or forced
marriage, unless we address the issue of their economic well being. I
suggest that this added burden of criminalisation will be a very
deep-seated aggravation, compounding the levels of pressure women face
within the community. I hope that we will listen to some of the
women’s organisations. I think that the amendment

Faulks:</Member></B> My Lords, I am a member of the Joint Committee on
Human Rights, which looked at this issue, as with other
issues in the Bill, and realised that there was a great deal of
knowledge and experience in your Lordships’ House, some of which
we have heard today. We came to the conclusion that we cautiously
accepted the Government’s reasoning for the criminalisation of
forced marriage, but we recommended, among other things, that the Crown
Prosecution Service should develop a strategy on prosecutions over
forced marriage and that, in developing such a strategy, there should
be consultation with the relevant stakeholders. It was very much a
cautious acceptance of the Government’s
reasoning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111252000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0001.htm#13111252000048">I
appreciate that the noble and learned Baroness has put this down as a
probing amendment rather than anything more and I accept it in that
spirit. I counsel some caution, however, about having an offence which
one commits if there is an aggravating feature in relation to another
offence. It causes difficulties in sentencing in other cases in which
this form of offence has been introduced. It seems to me, as I
suggested in a brief intervention on the noble and learned Baroness,
that it would be perfectly possible to have an offence of forced
marriage and to have an offence if the context required it—a
further offence, perhaps, in Section 20 or Section 18—of
whatever other offence had been committed. However, I understand the

that the same arguments were deployed in the debates on the proposal to

us look at the facts. No religion supports forced marriage and it is
not a religious requirement. It is also a barrier to integration. These
girls, when they behave in what is perceived to be too pro-western a

considered to have lax morals. The barriers then come up and the
pressure starts. I go into schools and talk to girls whose families do
not want them to move on into further education. They do not want them
to go into further education because they then start to lose control.
They think, “Oh, they will have boyfriends and get into
relationships where they have sex before marriage”. That is when
the oppression starts. It is a barrier to integration and goes against
the opportunity for girls to reach their full potential. That is
something I feel very strongly about. Moreover, it is a form of slavery
and rape. I will be clear on this because that is what happens in many

makes it clear that choice is a key message of engagement. That is
because there is still the dilemma of how one’s family and
community will react to either type of proceedings. I then asked myself
whether, conversely, it could produce the reaction of, “Well,
they are civil proceedings, not pursuing the criminal route, so it is
not that serious”. That worries me as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:36:59"></hs_TimeCode>. I have
said to my noble friend that I am concerned about training in this

for sentencing. However, in England and Wales, the courts already have
an overarching guideline on the principles of seriousness which they

noble and learned Baroness raised several other questions,
which I shall address briefly. In respect of the emotional
element in decision-making, Clause 108(1)(a) covers any
other form of coercion, which includes emotional coercion or emotional
blackmail. That forms part of the mischief that we are seeking to
address via criminalisation. However, in practice, the CPS will
prosecute in cases only where it is in the public interest to do so.
That will also involve an analysis of all the facts of the case,
including the gravity of the offending behaviour and the harm caused.
The definition of force in the Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act
2007 already addresses coercion by other psychological means, which
could encompass emotional coercion and emotional blackmail. This is not
a new proposition but something that Parliament has already endorsed.

the same emotions as when they watch what are often fictional accounts?
That is the education that needs to be given to the community—to
realise that, whether this is about Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism,
Christianity or humanism, what should prevail above all else is the

Speaker, in January this year the board of NHS England launched a

care covers a range of areas, including A&amp;E departments, NHS 111
centres and other emergency telephone services, ambulances, minor
injury units and urgent care centres. The review is being led by
Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England’s medical director. A

is an NHS England report. NHS England is an independent body
accountable to me through the mandate. The report being published
tomorrow is a preliminary one setting out initial thinking. The final
version will be published in the new year. Sir Bruce has said
that he will outline initial proposals and recommendations for the
future of urgent and emergency care services in England. These have
been formed by an engagement exercise that took place between June and
August this year. These proposals will be further consulted upon
through a number of channels, including commissioning guidance and
demonstrator sites. Spring 2014 will see another progress

performance levels largely have been maintained thanks to the expertise
and dedication of NHS staff. A&amp;E departments see 95% of patients
within four hours and this figure has not dropped below the 95% target

behind the public’s needs and expectations. The number of people
going to A&amp;E departments has risen historically, not least because
of an ageing population; 1 million more people are coming through the
doors than in 2010. Winter inevitably further challenges the system,
which is why we are supporting the A&amp;Es that are under most
pressure with £250 million. Planning has started earlier than

overseen the closure of walk-in centres. He cannot pass that on to
clinical commissioning groups as it is well known that NHS England put
pressure on clinical commissioning groups to close those walk-in

accountable in a number of other ways, including regular meetings. I do
not think that there is anything wrong about those meetings; indeed,
noble Lords would be surprised if the Secretary of State took a
detached view of what NHS England did. There is a balance to be struck.
We believe that the direction of travel of NHS England is one for
Ministers to set through the mandate and through the outcomes
frameworks, in particular, but it is then for NHS England to adopt a
clinically led approach to how it

under the previous Government we saw the closure of some of these

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T14:16:35"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, the
subject of this debate may affect only a small number of pupils in
terms of the total school population—some thousands of children
a year—but their education is put at risk either by a lack of
co-ordination by their school when they are out of school and getting
help elsewhere or, I am afraid, the complete absence of any
support.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111259000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111259000048">The
statutory guidance, <I>Ensuring a Good Education for Children Who
Cannot Attend School </I><I>B</I><I>ecause of Health Needs</I>, which
was reissued this May, is helpful but sadly not followed by all
schools. The main categories of children that I have met or heard from
recently are those with medical conditions, children who are so
severely bullied that they cannot face going to school, or those who
have been excluded informally by the school and pressured by the
parent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111259000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111259000049">Perhaps
we can tackle that last one first. Over recent years there have been
anecdotes about children with emotional and behavioural difficulties
not being quite difficult enough to be excluded, and this is worsened
when the school does not want them on the premises during an Ofsted
inspection. I had hoped that this habit had died down, but recently I
heard from the National Deaf Children’s Society about two very
different cases from different parts of the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111259000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111259000050">In
the first, a parent was repeatedly called to her deaf child’s
school from work during lunchtime and told to take her son home because
of “social disruptions” caused by his learning
difficulty. The repeated phone calls acted informally to exclude the
student from school and to burden the parent, and very few formal steps
were taken by the school to remedy the problem. In the second case, the
support assistant of a deaf student was called to jury duty for 12
weeks and the school failed to provide any supplementary support for
the student. An Ofsted inspection was taking place and the mother was
pressured into not sending her child into school so that the inspector
would not see the
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111259000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111259000051">Schools
are also very anxious about recording authorised and unauthorised
absences. One student received multiple “unauthorised
absences” from school because he had to attend his medical
appointments. His parents had informed the school of the medical needs
but the school still held him accountable and required the parents to
meet officials to discuss the absences. The parents said that they felt
under pressure to avoid their child going to necessary medical
appointments so as to improve the school’s attendance

the Minister whether there are robust systems in place to ensure that
schools are being held to account for these informal exclusions. How
will Ofsted be made aware that they are happening? Who can parents

Westminster, a number of pupils and students from the Alliance of

an 18-year-old girl who, at 14, had been diagnosed with osteosarcoma
and had a tumour removed. This meant 
<?notus-xml column=658?>she was out of school, either in hospital or at home, for the best part
of a year just as she was starting her GCSE courses options. Her maths
teacher, who was also the deputy head of the school, called every other
week to check in and offer her support for maths, which the girl then
passed very well at age 16, having returned to school. But there was
absolutely no co-ordination between the school, other staff, and the

talked last week to Dr Clarissa Pilkington, a pediatric rheumatology
consultant at Great Ormond Street Hospital, who confirmed that this

schools would welcome more contact with children’s schools, not
least because they can target support at the right level of learning,
especially for students working towards exams or qualifications. The
statutory guidance I mentioned earlier talks about liaising with a
school when the child is going back to school, but it does not talk

concentration can help her patients manage their pain and other
symptoms, so learning is useful to the medical process too. Will the

co-ordination in cases where it is obvious that children will be out of
school for an extended period? Who checks the level of support that a
pupil or student gets at home if they are out of school for a period,

diagnosed with severe ADHD, had passed his entrance exams with high
marks, tested well, participated in athletics, but struggled with
homework and long tasks due to difficulty concentrating. That is not
uncommon with ADHD. He also struggled with sleeping. Eventually a
meeting was called at the school. The deputy head promised to provide
details of an educational psychologist but failed to do so and
recommended a school counsellor instead. His parents were eventually
told he would be excluded if he continued to behave in that way. They
felt compelled to remove him before he was excluded. Following his
formal diagnosis by a pediatric neurologist, he now attends a new
school with smaller classes and full-time SEN staff. The pupil was very
distressed by the behaviour of his former school. I raise this example

now move to children so severely bullied that they cannot go to school.
The Minister and I have talked about alternative provision for these
children, but that is not the focus of this debate, even though much
more of it is needed across England and Wales. I want to know what
happens to the pupils defined as school refusers but still on the
school roll, often because the 
<?notus-xml column=659?>school will not accept that bullying is happening in the school. Last
week I heard of a young man who was the victim of homophobic bullying,
who was last in his school two years ago. He cannot get to alternative
provision elsewhere because the school insists that he must return to
the specialist support unit inside the school, as the school believes
it can handle the problem. It has failed, however, to take into account
that he is still taunted and bullied on his walk to and from the school
and inside the school on his way to the unit. He is now 17. He is
approaching the end of his school career with no qualifications,
clinical depression, and despair about the whole education

issue for children with medical conditions. An 11-year-old girl I met
has very serious allergies, causing life-threatening anaphylactic
shock. Because of her allergies, the hospital consultant has said she
should not travel on public transport. Her mother applied for her to go
to the local school. Her appeal to go there was refused because
the school said it was not a medical condition despite the intervention
from her consultant. Worse, the staff at the school said they would
refuse to use the EpiPen if she went into shock, so she could not
attend the new school from the beginning of term. When I last talked to
her mother 10 days ago, she was still out of
school<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T14:25:14"></hs_TimeCode>. Are

Medical need for admission has always been prioritised. It is shameful
that some schools are running away from their responsibilities. I know

conclude, there are too many pupils out of school for extended periods

the tremendous efforts made by schools and teachers up and down the

The child, however, must not then be deprived of education. We on this
side of the House understand the critical importance of discipline. It
provides a bedrock for sound learning. We also 
<?notus-xml column=660?>understand that there are times when there is a need, for the sake of
discipline, to exclude pupils from school. The vast majority of
teachers do everything they can to ensure that pupils get the best
start possible. I particularly applaud the efforts of teachers and head
teachers on the reduction in the number of children who have been

are, however, concerned by the increasing number of children who have
been informally excluded—or, to put it another way, illegally
excluded—from school. I say “illegally” because
the rules on informal exclusions are absolutely clear. The rules state
that if a child is excluded from school in any way at any time, this
should be formally recorded. A due process has to be followed, which
includes a referral to the board of governors. A child can be legally
excluded only for disciplinary reasons. Head teachers must tell parents
and carers formally, in writing, why their child has been excluded and
for how
long<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T14:28:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000004">Guidelines
have also been set for what kind of activity would lead to exclusion.
It states clearly that a school cannot exclude children because it
feels it does not have the resources to deal with them or because it
believes a child needs time to cool off. The guidelines specify that
any exclusion of a pupil, even for a short period, must be made and
recorded<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T14:28:59"></hs_TimeCode>
formally. Are the rules being followed? The answer to this, according
to the Children’s Commissioner for England, which published a
report on this issue in April, and according to the charity Contact a
Family, which published a separate report in February, is a resounding
no. The Children’s Commissioner for England has found evidence
to suggest that one in 10 secondary schools is forcing pupils to stay
away from lessons but failing to record the punishment formally in the
register.</hs_para>

problem seems to be that many head teachers simply do not realise that
asking parents to collect a child at lunchtime to cool off, or to keep
them at home for a few days, counts as exclusion. There is increasing
evidence to suggest that head teachers use this as a method to exclude
children for minor misdemeanours, such as larking around in the
classroom, breaking uniform policy or a bad haircut. Some academies are
attempting to avoid scrutiny of their exclusions by external
independent appeals panels and are refusing to hear appeals from
parents. That right has been removed. Part of the problem is that we
cannot be sure of the scale of the problem. Is the Department for
Education collecting figures or monitoring local authorities’
and academies’ performance on this
issue?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000006">According
to the Children’s Commissioner, the scale of illegal exclusions
is enormous. Who is affected by this? As the noble Baroness, Lady
Brinton, mentioned, children with special educational needs, disabled
and bullied children and poor children feel the brunt of these
exclusions. According to the charity Contact a Family, 22% of disabled
children are illegally excluded at least once a week and 15% are
illegally excluded every day for part of the day. Pupils with special
educational needs are eight times more likely to be permanently
excluded than their peers. Pupils with SEN statements are seven times
more likely to be excluded while those without statements are nine
times 
<?notus-xml column=661?>more likely to be excluded. More than two-thirds of all permanently
excluded children have some form of identified SEN. It is clear
that informal exclusions now follow the same
pattern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000007">Of
course, it is not just the children who are affected. Parents also
suffer as they often feel constantly on call. Many have to drop
everything to pick up their children. That means it is impossible for
them to hold down a job, forcing them into further poverty, according
to the Children’s Society. Parents are often afraid to take on
the school and challenge illegal exclusions because of the impact that
might have on their child’s school
record.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000008">If
we know this is happening, why is nothing being done about it? Who is
responsible for enforcing these rules? Ofsted is the lead body
responsible for policing these policies but its sanctions on the issue
are mixed in with an assessment of the school as a whole. It would seem
highly unlikely under the present system that this one issue would have
a dramatic impact on the overall assessment of the school. It is very
difficult for Ofsted even to know that these temporary exclusions are
happening as they are not recorded. Local authorities have a duty to
provide full-time education to children, but in the face of tremendous
budget cuts imposed by the coalition Government, the resources that
local authorities have to police this problem and to track these cases
are being put under increasing pressure. There is a responsibility to
educate but the follow-up of excluded children is sporadic at best. If
the issue is as large as the Children’s Commissioner suggests,
and if we know that these actions are illegal, how does the Minister
intend to tackle this issue? Currently, it seems as if there are very
few sanctions for illegal
exclusions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000009">It
is right to dwell on the consequences of illegal exclusions on
children. Informal exclusion means that children are more likely to
fall through the education net. If local authorities are not informed,
children are unlikely to be given the statutory schooling that they
have a right to receive. Once children fall behind, it is very hard for
them to catch up and they are likely to become even more disruptive.
Their chances of finding a job are diminished and they are forced on to
the state and the taxpayer for support. Fixing this problem early is
therefore an economic imperative for the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000010">Could
the Minister answer the following questions? Does he agree that head
teachers and teachers should be given training and guidance on the
rules, so that they are aware that informal exclusions are in fact
illegal? Part of the reason for unofficial exclusions from school is
the lack of the teachers’ ability to instil discipline and
manage behaviour. These skills are taught to teachers with teaching
qualifications but we are deeply worried that the Government are
allowing unqualified teachers into schools on a permanent basis who
have not had this training. Does the Minister believe that we should
look to best practice and encourage schools to ensure the professional
development of school leaders, teachers and trainees, including formal
teaching qualifications that teach strategies to create a good learning
environment and prevent
exclusions?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000011">Will
the Government reinstate the independent appeals panel for illegal
exclusions? The Education Act 2011 removed the right of parents to
appeal to an independent 
<?notus-xml column=662?>appeals panel against permanent exclusion. That has been replaced by an
independent review panel with reduced powers that cannot require a
school to reinstate a pupil it judges to have been unfairly excluded.
Will the Government issue further, more specific guidance on the
principles of exclusion thresholds? For example: “Exclusions
should happen only to protect the health and safety of pupils and
prevent disruption of learning”. This would stop schools
excluding children for having a bad haircut or for other trivial
reasons. That is happening today in our
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000012">As
I mentioned at the start, schools should be congratulated on the
reduction in the number of formal exclusions over recent years but
there is a danger that the problem is simply being displaced to
children being informally excluded from schools. The Government need to
nip this issue in the bud and save these children from a life of

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord Nash)
(Con):</Member></B> I thank my noble friend Lady Brinton for securing
this important debate and for her eloquent speech. I also thank the
noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, for her excellent contribution. I pay
tribute to the work of my noble friend Lady Brinton in championing the
cause of children who are excluded, particularly those who have been
subject to bullying. I am also aware that Ofsted intends to publish
next week a report on children who are not receiving full-time
education, which will highlight weaknesses in the system and make
recommendations for improvement, with examples of good practice. I hope
noble Lords will find that helpful. I welcome this opportunity to set
out the other actions the Government are taking to help ensure that
pupils outside mainstream schools receive the good quality education
they
deserve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000014">I
hope that the instances to which my noble friend referred will be
helped by the managing medicines amendments we have tabled to the
Children and Families Bill. She raised a question about ensuring
co-operation between hospitals and mainstream schools. Where a pupil
attends hospital while at school, the local authority retains its duty
to ensure that they receive suitable education. We enforced in
statutory guidance the role of the local authority in promoting
co-operation between schools and children who cannot attend because of
health
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000015">On
omissions, while there is a clear omissions appeal procedure, I will
look at the particular point that my noble friend made about who can
decide what a medical condition is and will write to her about that. On
the point about who records the educational attainment of these pupils,
if they are permanently excluded the AP provider would retain that and
Ofsted would report on it. The results would show that. If they are not
permanently excluded, the school would continue to hold those
results.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000016">She
raised briefly the subject of bullying. In this Government’s
view, bullying is completely unacceptable. Every school must have a
behaviour policy which includes specifically what it does about
bullying, including 
<?notus-xml column=663?>homophobic bullying. Ofsted will inspect against that. We have provided
considerable support to a number of organisations to help schools in
that regard. Where a child has been permanently excluded, it is the
responsibility of the local authority to organise full-time education
through an alternative provision provider. Where the child is
temporarily excluded under a fixed-term exclusion, it is the
school’s responsibility to make other
arrangements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000017">On
unlawful exclusion, there is no excuse for a school to exclude
unlawfully any pupil. As I have said, the Government have given schools
greater powers to manage behaviour. We are also addressing the
underlying causes of disengagement, for example by reforming SEN and
identification, particularly in relation to early identification.
Ofsted is fully aware of this issue and we have toughened up the Ofsted
inspection regime. Should evidence that exclusion has been used
unlawfully come to light during an inspection, this will be taken very
seriously. Unlawful exclusion would raise serious questions that may be
linked to leadership, management, school safeguarding procedures,
governance, behaviour and
safety.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000018">If
a parent though that their child had been unlawfully excluded, their
first right of redress would be to the school governing body. If it is
a maintained school, it would be to the local authority, or, if it is
an academy or a maintained school, they could complain directly to the
Department for Education. We would take a dim view of any school that
we thought was gaming the system in this way. Certainly, the academy
sponsors that we are supporting to turn around schools that have been
left to languish in failure for years up and down the county are
passionately committed to inclusion and are completely against the
concept of exclusion, as I am. In five years at my school, we have
permanently excluded only two children, in those cases
reluctantly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000019">As
the noble Baroness states, statutory guidance on exclusions is clear:
exclusions must follow the legal process. The Children’s
Commissioner report made clear that the majority of schools follow that
process. In the past, some schools might have taken an “out of
sight, out of mind” approach to alternative provision. That is
why, since last September, school inspection has included a specific
focus on the education, health and safety of pupils in off-site
alternative provision. It is important to note that an increasing
number of schools are making excellent use of such provision. The
Government are also currently trialling, in 11 local
authorities, the benefits of schools taking greater responsibility for
permanently excluded children. The lessons learnt from that trial will
be available to be rolled out across the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000020">There
are examples of excellent provision. Sawston Village College in
Cambridgeshire, of which my noble friend may be aware, uses funding
devolved from the department to provide an excellent on-site centre for
children in need of short-term respite, including any pupils who have
experienced bullying. The centre provides one-to-one support,
maintaining a rigorous focus on education and successful reintegration.
It also works with a local charity, Centre 33, to provide counselling
for those children, including pupils guilty of bullying. A similar
approach is used by St Benedict Catholic voluntary academy in Derby. It
has a sanctuary to 
<?notus-xml column=664?>nurture the emotional needs of pupils who may have been bullied. The
school has also had a number of pupils trained as anti-bullying
ambassadors by the Diana Award, funded by the
department.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000021">Revised
guidance sets out a clear expectation that pupils in alternative
provision should receive an education on a par with that provided in
mainstream schools. That is something that the Government are
determined to see happen. This came into force only in January and it
will take time to have an impact, but it has been widely welcomed and I
am grateful for comments from noble Lords during the passage of the
Children and Families Bill in support of this. Local authorities are
provided with funding for alternative provision, at £8,000 per
pupil, and they are free to top this
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000022">Our
focus on alternative provision was highlighted in Charlie
Taylor’s report and we have followed all his recommendations.
Ofsted is conducting a detailed three-year thematic survey of
schools’ use of alternative provision. It is in its second year
and early indications are that overall schools’ use of this
provision has improved. The final report will make recommendations to
supplement better practice. Ofsted has also increased its focus on
local authorities’ use of alternative provision. Under the
revised framework for integrating looked-after children and
safeguarding inspections, published in September of this year,
inspectors will now ask local authorities to report on school-age
children for whom they are responsible, but who are not in receipt of
full-time education. The first inspections under this new framework are
expected later this month. Increasingly, local authorities and school
partnerships are developing robust quality-assurance frameworks for
alternative provision. A framework developed by Waltham Forest, for
example, has formed the basis for a more co-ordinated approach to
commissioning across 10 other local
authorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000023">Alternative
provision is not solely for pupils with behavioural needs. While it is
not possible to identify precise numbers, our best estimate is that
around half of pupils in alternative provision are there for reasons
other than behaviour. Many so-called pupil referral units, for example,
are expressly set up for the purpose of educating pupils with health
needs. Among this excellent provision is Hawkswood therapeutic school
in Waltham Forest, which caters specifically for pupils unable to
attend a mainstream school because of complex emotional reasons. Ofsted
noted favourably the success rate in this
school.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000024">Despite
the examples of good alternative provision, we recognise that the
overall quality and range of providers have not always been sufficient.
We have already taken steps to raise standards by increasing the role
of maintained schools in PRU management committees, for example, and
allowing trainee teachers to undertake placements specifically in
alternative provision providers. Eight PRUs took up this opportunity in
the first year and their experience has formed the basis of a toolkit
to support others to do the same. We are also allowing PRUs to benefit
from the freedom of academy status. Eighteen have converted already,
such as the outstanding Bridge AP Academy in Hammersmith and Fulham. We
are also supporting new, high-quality

reassurance that we are taking effective steps to ensure that children

uncomfortable this afternoon—I stress this afternoon—for
my noble friend, but would he be able to write to me about that,
following today’s Committee proceedings? This looks like a
lawyer’s point, but it is a very real one. We have already
talked today and will continue to talk about the choice between the two
routes. Of course, one of the factors in the choice will be if the
definitions are different, and therefore if the criteria for choosing
one route are not the same as the criteria for choosing the other. I
gave notice to my noble friend—although probably not directly to
him—of the points that I wanted to raise on these two

of my noble friend Lady Smith and the noble Baroness, Lady Hussein-Ece,
seeks to test whether the Bill adequately covers the issue of capacity;
in other words, the capacity of a vulnerable adult who may be forced
into a marriage. Almost by 
<?notus-xml column=668?>definition, they are very often not in a position to give free or full
consent to a marriage, or otherwise. We are looking at Clause 108(1)(a)
and (b). Paragraph (a)
says,</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13111256000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000119">“A

second question, which is linked to but is not only about capacity, is:
how can marriages be voided in these circumstances? When is a forced
marriage voidable? How does it go forward and, in particular, if there
is no capacity to agree to the marriage, how can it be ended? In recent
times there was a judgment in which the courts decided not to end the
forced marriage of somebody who they admitted lacked capacity. That has
troubled many people who are concerned about this area. That is the
issue we would like to probe, and I would like to know whether the

warrants a bit of debate. As the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, said,
there have been a number of these cases. I read the same article that
she quoted, on the 114 cases that the Government had dealt with, with
some concern. In August there was the case of a woman from a Sikh
background who was married to a man who had mental disabilities. He did
not annul the marriage because she pleaded that that would cause her

is an important principle. If the Minister is planning to respond by
saying that the issue is adequately covered either in the clauses we

before giving the Committee that response. It needs to be made
absolutely explicit that a forced marriage is not valid where there is
any question at all that the person being coerced into marriage and who
has entered into it does not have capacity. That capacity may be
related to age—elsewhere in our legislation there has been all
sorts of discussion about capacity and age, and some of the girls
concerned are of a very young age—or it may be related to
learning difficulties of various sorts. We therefore need to make it
absolutely explicit in the legislation that this is intended to cover
those circumstances where the individual concerned does not have
capacity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000050"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T15:19:31"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon" PimsId="5907" UID="13111256000155" xid="2117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000155">Lord
Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness,
Lady Thornton, for her amendment. I also thank my noble friend Lady
Hussain-Ece and the noble Lord for their contributions. The noble Lord
alluded to the Freedom Charity, which carries out notable work in this

without consent or the capacity to consent is totally unacceptable.
Clause 108 specifies that an offence is committed if the perpetrator
uses coercion and believes, or ought reasonably to believe, that their
conduct may cause another person to enter the marriage without free and
full consent. A person who lacks capacity to enter into marriage is
incapable of providing free and full consent to marriage. In the cases
that have come to the attention of the Forced Marriage Unit, some form
of coercion has invariably been involved in forcing a person who lacks
capacity to consent to a marriage. The new offences would therefore
cover this
behaviour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T15:22:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000052">Although
I totally understand the noble Baroness’s concerns and those of
other noble Lords, the definition of the new offences in Clause 108
already captures in practice the types of cases intended to be covered

between Committee and Report we will look at the issue once
again in the context of Clause 108. However, I assure noble
Lords that Clause 108 is intended to capture that particular element.

issue was also raised of a vulnerable person getting a decree of
nullity. The procedure to do so is available and a person can apply for
a decree of nullity by filing a petition at any time after the marriage
ceremony. If the application is not opposed, there is unlikely to be a
court hearing and the person will not have to attend court. Following
the petition, the court will issue a decree nisi and, following this,
the applicant can apply for a decree absolute. The Family Procedure
Rules make provision to ensure that these matters are straightforward
for unrepresented applicants. However, having said all that, I fully
acknowledge the points made by noble Lords about the special
circumstances that they have mentioned.

came from a range of experts, including survivors of child marriage,
representatives from UN and government agencies, academics, doctors and
NGOs. Our witnesses testified that child marriage had many undesirable
consequences. I will not run through the whole gamut but will give a
few examples of those. It is associated with violence, rape and sexual
abuse, resulting in emotional and psychological problems, desertion and
divorce. It takes away opportunities for education—that
is perhaps the most important consequence—undermines
self-confidence and reaffirms gender stereotypes. It is associated
with, and helps perpetuate, harmful traditional practices, including
female genital mutilation and contributes to infant mortality and poor
child development. There are more consequences. UNICEF says in its
report <I>The </I><I>State of the World’s Children</I><I>

many noble Lords have said, child marriage is a major problem in the
developing world and we are increasingly seeing it here. In England and
Wales, marriage under 16 is illegal, but between 16 and 18 it is
permitted, providing there is parental consent, which is not required
in Scotland. In some cultures, child marriage is virtually the norm and
parents are likely not only to give consent, but to force marriage on
girls who may not wish to marry yet go along with it. We heard earlier,
from the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Hamwee, about emotional blackmail. A major problem which
has not been mentioned is that, as with female genital mutilation,
girls are taken outside the UK to get married. This amendment does not

one underestimates the variety and complexity of situations that lead
people to find themselves in forced marriages. A cursory glance at the
case law reveals that children are sometimes subjected to such
marriages by their parents, and the law needs to be flexible in its
remedies. Under Clause 108(3), let us imagine that a woman takes a
brave step to come forward to complain about a forced marriage in a
religious ceremony which is not, as the Bill envisages, valid in UK
law. She may take that step after many years of marriage and it will
take enormous courage. She will almost certainly have to testify in
court against her so-called husband and perhaps other community or
religious leaders. This may affect her acceptance within her community.
Her husband and others may be convicted and sent to prison.</hs_para>

course, this woman may need supporting financially and there may be
family assets such as a car, a pension, a business, inherited wealth
and most probably a home. However, they could all be in the legal name
of the husband, who is in prison. Ordinarily the woman seeks a divorce
or an annulment, and in both types of proceedings the courts have
wide-ranging powers to transfer or split the family assets—but
herein lies the problem: this forced religious marriage cannot be
annulled and cannot be the subject of divorce proceedings. It is not
viewed in law by the family courts as a marriage; it has been
inelegantly described as a
“non-marriage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T15:38:12"></hs_TimeCode>”.
Without the legal means to get an annulment or divorce, the woman
cannot put in a proper claim for the family assets. In those
circumstances she will most likely be making a claim for benefits,
supported by the UK taxpayer instead of by any family assets. I also
shudder to think of what she may feel like if after a few years in
prison her so-called husband comes back to the community and waltzes
back into the family home with all the assets. I very much doubt
whether any other women will come forward and take such risks if, on
top of everything else, by doing so they make themselves financially
destitute, with recourse only to the benefits system. Without giving
her the remedy of an annulment, which is what the amendment gives her,
there may be a grave

if a person is forced into a marriage that is valid under UK law the
marriage is void and can be annulled, and the family assets divided up.
The Bill therefore currently gives rise to the different treatment of
women forced into a marriage that is not recognised in our law, as
opposed to women forced into what would otherwise be a valid marriage.
There is extensive human rights case law on such differential
treatment. I should therefore be grateful if the Minister can outline,
if he does not accept the amendment, what reasonable and objective
justification the Government have for such differential treatment of
women in analogous situations.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> the absence
of any such justification, the law should be amended to give women the
option of petitioning for an annulment. A woman will not be required to
do so, and there may be cases where it is not appropriate, but the law
should give her the option.

when they consent to the marriage, are not aware that the ceremony is
not valid in UK law. In some cases they discover this only when, after
many years of marriage, the husband says three times that he divorces
them and walks out. Literally, the first person to explain the

different definition of marriage has crept into our law, there can be
many inadvertent consequences. They need to consider different
solutions, such as making the provision of a civil marriage certificate
a requirement before any person conducts a religious ceremony. Such an
inquiry could also look at whether the basic legal requirements of how
to be married under UK law need to be part of citizenship teaching,
especially given the popular trend of travelling to sunnier climes for
wedding ceremonies. I fear this is not common enough knowledge; your

Cox (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, before I speak to Amendment 13,
grouped with this amendment, I apologise for missing Second Reading as
I was in South Sudan, where it was rather difficult to engage with
parliamentary business here. I understand that a primary goal of the
forced marriage provisions of the Bill is to increase the protection of
victims of honour-based abuse while bringing perpetrators to justice.
As noble Lords may be aware, this is also the primary concern of my
Private Member’s Bill, the Arbitration and Mediation Services

to increase protection for those who suffer abuse and gender

One of the concerns underlying the 
<?notus-xml column=676?>reason for that Bill could be addressed by this amendment, which would
make it an offence to solemnise a marriage in England and Wales
according to the rites of any religion or belief in circumstances where
the marriage is not also solemnised as a legal marriage under the terms
of the Marriage Act 1949 if either or both parties to the marriage
wrongly believe that they are married according to the law simply
because they have been through a religious

amendment would tackle the problem that arises in some communities
where those getting married, particularly women who are not familiar
with English law or the customs of this country, undergo a religious
marriage without understanding that they are not married according to
English law. They are therefore unaware that they are without any legal
protection. I think there are parallels here with the amendment just

most cases, religious celebrants would not need to be concerned about
committing the offence created by the amendment. They would not need to
act any differently. Most marriages solemnised by religious celebrants
are in registered buildings under the terms of the Marriage Act 1949.
They are legal marriages. Under the Marriage Act 1949, a couple who
have already entered into a civil marriage may go through  a
religious marriage ceremony after giving notice to a minister of
religion, and on the production of a certificate of their marriage
before the superintendent
registrar.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000081">Therefore<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T15:45:43"></hs_TimeCode>,
in circumstances when no certificate is provided, ministers of religion
should already be on notice that a couple may not be married legally.
In those situations when they are not sure that the parties properly
understand the status of a religious ceremony, they may choose to say
something about this publicly during the religious ceremony to ensure
that there is no doubt, or they could choose to obtain a written
declaration of understanding from the couple before proceeding with a
marriage service. How they go about that procedure is a matter for them
and the amendment does not seek to prescribe any particular means. What
matters is that when there is some doubt as to the understanding of the
parties, my amendment would effectively require celebrants to ensure
that the couple they are marrying only according to religious rites are
fully aware of the status of the ceremony and its
implications<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T15:45:49"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T15:46:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13111256000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000141">3.45

religious or cultural group. Over recent years, I and my colleagues
have met victims of honour-based abuse. We have heard harrowing
real-life stories of suffering which should not be allowed in this

because their marriage is not legally recognised, these women are
unable to access any legal redress. Many have told me that had they
known this before entering into the religious marriage, they would have

Hope of Craighead (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I had not intended to
say anything about this amendment, but two points occurred to me in
listening to the noble Baroness, Lady Berridge, which I mention in case
they might be of any assistance to the Minister in looking into the
matter. First, I should have thought that it would be plain that if the
individual is not capable of entering into a marriage at all, because
he or she was 
<?notus-xml column=678?>underage or simply did not have the mental capacity to agree, one could
not treat that as a valid marriage for the time being until it was
annulled. There may be something to be said for some categories which
are not in that very stark situation; where there was initially the
capacity to marry, but there has been enforcement or something like
that which has persuaded the individual to enter into it. It is rather
as in the law of contract: there are some contracts which are void ab
initio and some which are voidable. There may be room for that
distinction: no doubt the Minister will wish to research that

when I was at the Bar in my junior days I used to do cases in Scotland
which were described as “nullity of marriage cases”. The
ground of nullity in those cases was lack of capacity to consummate the
marriage. An individual who found that the husband or wife could not
consummate the marriage was entitled to come to court and if that fact
could be proved—it was very often not disputed, which was just
as well—the marriage would be set aside. I do not know how the
law is in England, but there must be a similar process where the
marriage cannot be consummated. It may be that those cases are
precisely in the category that Amendment 11 is talking about, where
somebody has a choice. An individual who finds that the marriage cannot
be consummated may feel that the marriage should go ahead for other
reasons—simply because they enjoy living with each other. Nobody
forces them to apply to the court to have the marriage set aside. It
may be that there is an analogy there which can be drawn upon, to
follow up the point that the noble Baroness is

Berridge and the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, for raising these important
issues, which I shall address in turn. As both noble Baronesses will
know, I take this issue very seriously: it needs to be addressed and
the issues that have been raised are perfectly valid, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Thornton, has said. I also thank the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, for his contribution. He has raised one
or two matters which I shall certainly take back to officials to
discuss

my noble friend has explained, it is crucial for victims of forced
marriage to be able to ensure that the marriage that they have been
forced into is subsequently rendered void as a matter of law. While I
agree that this is important, especially to the victims of this crime
who rightly want clarity on where the marriage stands in the eyes of
the law, there are reasons why the Government feel that this amendment
is unnecessary. Under the current law, if a forced marriage takes
place, victims can apply to the court to end the marriage by divorce or
annulment. If a victim wishes to apply 
<?notus-xml column=679?>for an annulment, it must be shown that the marriage was either void or
voidable. The grounds on which a marriage is void or voidable are set
out in the Matrimonial Causes Act
1973.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000093">A

a victim wishes to apply to the court for an annulment on these
grounds, and the court grants the decree of nullity, the annulment will
take effect on the date on which the decree of nullity is issued. This
amendment would mean that if a conviction for an offence of forced
marriage occurred, the court would be required to issue a decree of
nullity. The date on which that decree of nullity would take effect
would be the date on which the perpetrator was first charged with the
offence. I understand totally the sentiments behind the amendment
tabled by my noble friend, but I do not agree that the process by which
a victim can seek to end a forced marriage, and the date on which that
marriage ends, should be determined by reference to whether a
conviction for forced marriage has taken place. Such an approach
provides no flexibility for victims whose perpetrators are convicted of
an offence of forced marriage to choose how they wish to end their
marriage. It would also be unfair to those victims whose perpetrators
are not found guilty of the offence of forced marriage, and who would
have to continue to rely on the current law to end their
marriage.</hs_parafo>

of forced marriage experience a range of specific extenuating factors,
as a consequence of which they may wish to have a divorce rather than
an annulment. For example, there may be children involved, as my noble
friend pointed out, and property rights to consider. As a result, they
may prefer a specific legal route to end their marriage. Preserving a
victim’s choice is the intention behind the Government’s
proposals. We are seeking to provide flexibility to victims who, on
seeking legal advice, can end their marriage as and when they see fit.
I hope that, having heard this explanation, my noble friend is
reassured about where the Government currently stand on this
issue.</hs_para>

I may now turn to religious

issue focused on by the noble Baroness, Lady Cox. I pay tribute to her
because I know that she represents women’s interests very widely
and that this is an issue on which she does not seek to target any
particular faith or community. However, she recognises
fully that many, if not all faiths, protect such marriages.
Unfortunately, it is the case that some of the practices do not live up
to the theology. As the noble Baroness has explained, the purpose of
her proposed new clause is to create a new criminal offence, under
Section 75 of the Marriage Act 1949, of solemnising a marriage
according to any religion so that the couple getting married believe
they are validly married when in fact the marriage is not valid under
that Act. This proposed new offence clearly arises from a desire to
help couples who have a religious marriage ceremony that they think is
perfectly valid, but which has no legal status because the requirements
of the law in England and Wales have not been complied with.</hs_para>

legal position in respect of religious marriages in England and Wales
is that anyone who wishes to contract a religious marriage and acquire
a legal marital status has two options. They can either have a
religious marriage and a separate secular civil ceremony or they can
choose to solemnise their religious marriage in a place of worship
registered to conduct marriages, thus removing the need for a separate
civil ceremony. Where a marriage is invalid for want of the appropriate
formalities or other elements, this does not necessarily leave the
parties without any remedies. If the marriage purports to be in
accordance with the provisions of the Marriage Act but does not fully
comply with those provisions, it may be void under Section 11(a) of
Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. This section enables a party to the
marriage to apply to the court for a decree of nullity and the court is
able to make orders in respect of children and the division of property
in the same way as on divorce. We believe that this will provide
protection for some of the couples whom the noble Baroness seeks to
protect with her amendment.</hs_para>

Government accept that there will be some religious marriages to which
Section 11(a) will not apply. In such cases, the courts may be able to
view the marriage as being valid in principle and, as such, susceptible
to a decree of nullity. The court will determine such issues on a case
by case basis and will consider issues such as whether the ceremony or
event set out or purported to be a lawful marriage, whether it bore all
or enough of the hallmarks of a marriage, and whether the parties acted
in good faith. If the court is not able to make such a finding, again,
that does not mean that the spouse will be left without any form of
redress. For example, it would still be possible for the court to make
an order for financial relief in respect of any children under Schedule
1 to the Children Act 1989. While the Government are keen to ensure
that any person who enters into a purported religious marriage in good
faith has adequate protection before the law, we do not consider that
making the solemnisation of purported religious marriages a criminal
offence is the correct way forward. This would, in our view, involve
unjustified interference in people’s private and religious
lives.</hs_para>

the Government take these matters, as raised by the noble Baroness,
Lady Cox, very seriously. Even though we may differ in how best to deal
with it, the sentiments are certainly much the same. We want to ensure
that couples seeking a religious marriage are aware of the need to have
a civil marriage as well. If this is to be achieved, it must be with
the support of religious leaders and must not be seen as an attempt to

options are available to the communities, which the Government have
highlighted. For example, on religious marriage ceremonies, there are
cases of invalid marriages in a number of religions, although
statistics show that the largest numbers are currently likely to occur
in the Muslim community, partly because it represents one of the
largest minority groups in the UK. I can assure the noble Baroness that
the Prime Minister has raised concerns about the vulnerability of
Muslim women in marriages that are not valid 
<?notus-xml column=681?>under the law in England and Wales, and the Government are currently
undertaking work directly with the Muslim community to encourage
mosques to register places of worship where marriages can be solemnised
and to raise awareness of the requirements to be

Wales<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000100">As
I said earlier in response to a question raised by the noble and

is something that some Muslim communities already practise, which is to
be encouraged. It is certainly something which, through work being done
at the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Department of
Communities and Local Government, is being encouraged. Communities,
imams or other religious priests who perform religious marriages are
asked in advance of performing that marriage to ask the couple to
produce a certificate of registration constituting a civil marriage.

young child knows that her parents may be criminalised as a result of
such protection, she will be alarmed by the involvement of the police
and the criminal courts, as well as by the publicity and the dishonour
to her family that the stigma of a criminal offence will bring.
Invariably, it will affect, in negative ways, not only the victim but
other siblings and family members not party to the forced marriage
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T16:06:19"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope
the Minister can assure the Committee that the civil protection route
will remain the preferred way forward and that clear guidance will be
given to the CPS and the police that everything should be done to use
the family courts for civil protection first and that the criminal
process will be used only as a last
resort<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T16:06:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000109">Even
if the Minister can reassure me on both those points—he has
already gone a long way in this discussion to show the
Government’s commitment—I believe there remains a real
need to monitor the effect of criminalisation to ensure that we can
evaluate the progress being made. If the Minister is minded to accept
my proposal, the annual report should include, for example, the number
of cases going to the family court, to allow benchmarking, the age, sex
and ethnic origin of the victims, the number of cases sent to the CPS,
the number of people convicted, and what financial or other aid has
been given to the victim, including 
<?notus-xml column=683?>accommodation and legal aid to support individuals
through the criminal court
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T16:07:29"></hs_TimeCode>. I also
look forward to seeing the Government develop these ideas in their
response to the JCHR. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain
what steps the department will take, if it is unable to accept the
proposals in my amendment for an annual report, to ensure that the
effect of criminalisation is kept under review so that, if there are
unintended consequences, they are identified quickly and can be dealt
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T16:07:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111256000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111256000110">Finally,
I believe that it is important that we also look at other
approaches, including working internationally, and do not just focus on
criminalising the practice as the only way forward. As the Forced
Marriage Unit knows well, victims can be taken to Pakistan, India or
Bangladesh and coerced into so-called marriages. They may be victims of
rape and bodily injury; if they do not comply, they may be victims of
what are disgracefully called honour killings or of forced
suicides. Tackling these issues through working with international
partners is, in many ways, more important than criminalisation here in
the UK, as we already have laws in place in relation to this heinous
crime. I hope that the Minister can reassure me that criminalisation
will form only part of our approach to tackling forced marriage, and
that Ministers will continue to work internationally to put an end to
the practice across the world and ensure a more joined-up approach to
the criminal justice system in the UK on this issue. I beg to

not a panacea as far as this problem is concerned; it will not solve

support the noble Baroness in her amendment. I saw her nodding at the

press upon the Government is that there should be greater discussion in
families, for example about marrying close relatives, such as cousins.
I used to chair the Human Genetics Commission and there was
considerable sensitivity about this kind of discussion and about the

increased risks for future generations. I think that when people are

also think that imams should be well informed about the ways in which
the women in their congregation are disadvantaged by not having the
cover of civil marriage so that they have rights that can be enforced
in the courts. My clients have sometimes invoked Sharia law as being
generous towards women at the ending of marriages or after death.
Although that might have been the case in the past, nowadays women are
more advantaged by what is available to them through the civil courts
in the United Kingdom. I think that such pieces of information should
be much more widely disseminated to communities where these issues

very aware of is the impact on the whole family, with

through its direct work in assisting victims and those at risk of

As I said, the Government take this issue seriously. Once this becomes

issue that the Government will return to, not least because we believe
it is important to update the House. It would not be appropriate for me

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment is in my name and those
of my noble friend Lady Smith and the noble Baroness, Lady
O’Loan. It relates to Clause 151, dealing with
compensation for miscarriages of justice where new evidence comes to
light some time after—indeed, sometimes very long after—a
criminal trial procedure has been concluded and the defendant convicted
and sentenced, and which demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt that the
conviction was unsafe. In those cases, the Criminal Justice Act 1988
requires the Secretary of State to pay compensation where the
conviction has been reversed or the claimant pardoned. It should be
emphasised at the outset that such cases are few and far between, with
only two cases a year succeeding out of around 50
claims.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111263000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111263000030">At

killed two people but of which it eventually transpired she was
innocent. The noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan, reminded us of what

it is perfectly clear that Clause 151 is concerned not merely with the
interpretation of Section 133, as he seemed to suggest. It would
exclude the type of 
<?notus-xml column=692?>claim which was recognised and allowed in Adams, and what was said at
Second Reading simply does not address that particular step. Secondly,
it seemed to be suggested that there was a current state of uncertainty
in regard to the law. However, it is important to bear in mind that in
Adams the Supreme Court carried out an exhaustive study of the
scope of Section 133 and made a fresh analysis. Part of that was to get
a final resolution of conflicting statements that had been made by
judges in previous years.</hs_para>

Court had to consider what meaning should be given to Section 133 in
the light of that article. Therefore, is it appropriate for Parliament

Kennedy of The Shaws:</Member></B> My Lords, I express my gratitude to
those who have already spoken on this very important topic. To some
this may seem like rather arcane law, but it is something very simple
and very clear that comes down to fundamental principle. When I spoke
at Second Reading, I did so with some force, because the reality of
cases reminds you why law matters. When you conduct cases where there
has been a miscarriage of justice, you know why it is so important that
the law acts fairly to those who have suffered the consequence of
miscarriage of justice. I, too, feel shocked that the
Government—and it might be supported by others—seek to
say that this is about saving taxpayers’ money when the sums of
money involved are very small and the number of cases are few, and when
we<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T16:43:55"></hs_TimeCode> are dealing
with such an important issue of principle: that is, that we in this
country believe, powerfully and rightly, that a person should be
presumed to be innocent unless they have been proved guilty.</hs_para>

a person has to prove their innocence is an affront to fundamental
principle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T16:43:56"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
shocking that our Supreme Court reached a decision with great care and
that we are now seeking to overrule that decision. To most of us, the

I, too, wish to invoke the fact that this is about not just an article
of the European court or European convention; it is also an affront to
the common law built up over the experience of our nation which says
that persons should be deemed to be not guilty unless the state has
managed to prove their guilt. I have been involved in cases where it
would be very difficult to prove that you were innocent—indeed,
the cases which have been mentioned, to which I referred at Second
Reading, where mothers were found 
<?notus-xml column=693?>guilty of causing the death of their babies but thereafter it was felt
that medical science was not yet in a place to help to ascertain
possible genetic causes of sudden infant death. To ask those women who
were released on appeal—having been in prison and having
suffered the anguish of being accused of killing their own
babies—to prove that they were innocent on the standard we are
discussing is, of course, asking the
impossible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T16:45:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111263000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111263000053">The
reality is that with some cases, usually those involving the use of
DNA, you can show that the miscarriage of justice most certainly
involved the wrong person being accused. However, that happens rarely
and usually involves calling into question the evidence that went
before a jury and raising the spectre that a wrong decision was made.
Too often, I am afraid, it also involves the state having behaved badly
through its agents. In the cases mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady
O’Loan, in which I was involved—Irish cases where there
were miscarriages of justice—false confessions had been made
following the misbehaviour of police officers. Sometimes a question
mark is raised over cases because the state has failed to behave
appropriately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T16:49:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111263000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111263000054">We
must be clear that, even on the balance of probabilities, it is asking
the impossible for someone to show that they are innocent. Great
experience gained in the common law has taught us that we do not make
innocence a test; we decide as between guilt or non-guilt. On a
previous occasion it was a source of shock to me to hear one of our
eminent judges speak about a case where it seemed to him that it would
be an affront if someone were compensated. Occasionally people are
acquitted where they may be guilty but we in our wisdom know that that

Pannick (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I agree with the speeches that
have been made this afternoon. Clause 151 should not be
included in the Bill unless it is amended in order to restate current
law, as the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, suggested. There are three
reasons for that. The first is the reason about which the noble
Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, spoke; namely, a defendant does
not have to prove innocence at trial. It would be contrary to basic
principles to require the defendant to prove innocence in order to
obtain compensation for a wrongful conviction. Even the Scottish
verdict of not proven, to which the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, referred,
does not, as I understand it, require the defendant to prove anything
at all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111263000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111263000058">The
second point is the practical one, which is as important as issues of
principle in this context. The point was made at Second Reading by the
noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan, and the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Hope of Craighead, and made this afternoon by the noble Baroness,
Lady Kennedy of the Shaws.  
<?notus-xml column=694?>It will often be very difficult indeed for an innocent person to prove
their innocence: the evidence may simply be unavailable. It is very
unfair that they should be unable to secure compensation for the
miscarriage of
justice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111263000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111263000059">The
third point is that the approach adopted by Clause 151 breaches the
European Convention on Human Rights because it contravenes the
presumption of innocence in Article 6.2 of that convention. All
17 judges of the Grand Chamber of the European court stated
this on 12 July in the case of Allen v United Kingdom, a case about
compensation for miscarriages of justice. It was a unanimous judgment,
which found that there was no breach of the presumption of innocence,
but an important part of the court’s reasoning, at paragraph
133, was that the courts of the United Kingdom,</hs_para>

is the test that was stated by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Steyn,
in the case of Mullen in 2005—found in 1 Appeal Cases, page

Section 133 did contain a proof of innocence test. That
approach was not adopted by the Supreme Court later, in the Adams
case.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13111263000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111263000060">Clause
151 now wishes to introduce the approach of the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Steyn. It would be a quite remarkable step for Parliament to enact
legislation now which contravenes a clear and recent statement in a
unanimous judgment by the Grand Chamber of the European court, a step
which should be taken only in the most exceptional circumstances, where
some fundamental principle of English law is at stake. That is not the
case here: we are not dealing with a clause that seeks to maintain some
fundamental principle of English law. Indeed, to the extent that
fundamental principles are at stake, they are those explained by
previous speakers in this debate and which Clause 151 will frustrate
and breach.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111263000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111263000061">I
will make one other point. At Second Reading, the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, who I am very pleased to see

conviction was quashed because of an abuse of process by the
prosecution. However, my understanding of the Adams judgment in the

everything to do with statutory compensation but, frankly, little to do
with criminal justice. That may sound simplistic but it is true.
Convictions may be quashed in a wide variety of circumstances. It may
be that fresh evidence comes to light that shows that the accused could
not possibly have committed the particular offence. That may be as a
result of DNA evidence, or perhaps someone later admitted to the very
offence of which he has been convicted. Or it may be that the fresh
evidence gives rise to a “lurking doubt”, as it is
called, as to whether the defendant really was guilty. Or perhaps the
judge can be shown to have unfairly admitted evidence or possibly
misdirected the jury so that the conviction can no longer be regarded
as safe. In all these cases, the conviction must be quashed and the
defendant set free, and the presumption of innocence applies at that
point in all those cases. However, it would be a very great mistake to
suppose that all those defendants, merely because their convictions
have been set aside and they are now presumed to have been innocent,

may be unsafe because it is perfectly obvious that the man could no
longer be regarded as guilty, or because doubt has been thrown on an
important aspect of the evidence. It may be that the jury would have
convicted in the light of new facts, or it may be that they would not.
It may sound certain but there is considerable uncertainty over how
this would apply. It will always be for the Secretary of State to
decide, whatever the test, whether it is satisfied. The Secretary of
State will have to decide, by reference to what is called in this
clause,</hs_parafo><hs_quotefo UID="13111263000259" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111263000259">“the

of the offence. I gave one instance of that at Second Reading, in col.
1539. The noble Lord, Lord Beecham, referred to it today, as did my
noble friend Lord Pannick. However, with respect, 
<?notus-xml column=697?>my noble friend misunderstood the concept of the abuse of process that
we were discussing in Adams. That was the sort of abuse of process that
had caused Mullen in the earlier case to be brought wrongly from, I
believe, Zimbabwe and tried, when he should never have been tried. That

me give another instance of where a probably guilty person could fall
to be compensated under the proposed language in the amendment. Let us
assume that the main prosecution evidence is a confession of guilt and
it can later be shown that it was procured by an inducement. It may be
that the police officer said, “Come along, you’ve only
got to tell us what happened and we’ll give you bail.
You’ll go free”. So a confession is made, perhaps to
rape, and it may be demonstrably true. It may contain the sort of facts
that only the guilty person could know. It is completely irrelevant
whether it is demonstrably true; if it is obtained through an
inducement, it has to be disregarded. In those circumstances, on this
test, that person would be compensated. It could be that, such a
conviction having been set aside, the victim of the rape could bring a
civil claim for damages for assault, and establish the case on a
balance of probabilities, which is the test on a subsequent civil
claim. That claim would succeed and the assailant would be shown to be
probably guilty but nevertheless entitled to

am conscious of the time, so I shall come fleetingly to Strasbourg. The
Joint Committee and my noble friend Lord Pannick appear to understand
Allen to be saying that the proposed test would be incompatible with
the convention. I can entirely see those passages in the judgment that
could take one to that conclusion, although those were not the facts of
that case and it was not the conclusion arrived at by the court.
To my mind, that simply cannot be right. It would be complete
nonsense. The higher the state raises the bar for what is necessary to
qualify for compensation, the less the chance that a decision to refuse
compensation would be understood as an allegation of criminal
liability—in other words, a denial of the presumption of
innocence.</hs_para>

If, however, he is refused because he cannot conclusively demonstrate

The critical issue is: how large should be

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, I was quite right to wait for others to
table the amendment before adding my name, so that they could all go
first with the arguments. I tried to canter through them at Second
Reading in considerable haste and will try to be quick now. I accept
that the new clause is to do with compensation, not the criminal law,
otherwise every overturned conviction would lead to a right to
compensation and Section 133 makes it clear that that is not the case.
However, what has been troubling me is that if you do not have to prove
innocence at the original trial and then the matter turns on a new or a
newly discovered fact, surely you would not have had to prove that. If
the fact had been available at the time of the trial, this would not
have changed whether you would have to have proved your innocence,
which you did not have to do. I do not see that bringing in a new fact
should change that at all. I do not see why that is necessary

noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, has said that this is about who

save the taxpayer. The impact assessment on this clause says
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13111263000220" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111263000220">“The

of cases we have has produced the clarity. The impact assessment says

Faulks:</Member></B> My Lords, I fear that I do not share the view just
expressed by my noble friend Lady Hamwee that the law is clear at the
moment. The number of decisions, one following another, with
disagreements between judges in the same tribunal indicates the
difficulty of the question and, I conclude, the lack of clarity in the
test that should be applied. One of the reasons for this provision is
in order to provide clarity. That, I believe, it does. The second
question is whether it is appropriate and whether it offends the
presumption of innocence. I am part of the Joint Committee on Human
Rights and originally I took the view that it did offend the
presumption of innocence. I have changed my mind, having thought about
it. Although I was not often able to persuade the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Brown, of anything, he has contributed to persuading me, on
the other hand, of the merits of the arguments he advanced, both at

have also had the opportunity of reading the cases of Allen v the

the point of these applications for compensation is to hold the state

an easy question, but in my submission the Government have come to the
correct answer. Sadly, a few people who are genuinely innocent will not
obtain compensation, which in my view, for the reasons given, is an
unsatisfactory element. However, it does not involve people being

Hope of Craighead:</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to make four
brief points. The first is whether there should be a test in the
statute, taking account of what has been said by the judges so far. The
second is a brief word about the standard of proof, to which my noble
and learned friend Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood referred. The
third question is the wording of the amendment, and the fourth is the
wording of the clause that the Government are
proposing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T17:15:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

am very much in sympathy with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord
Faulks. Particularly in view of what the Divisional Court said
following what the majority said in Adams, there is a bit of confusion
as to the way the judges are going. I must say that I would have hoped
that Adams had settled the matter, admittedly by a small majority, but
then we find the Divisional Court in Ali using a formula which I do not
think fits with the majority view in Adams very well, if at all. Given
that state of affairs, the Government are probably right to say that
the time has come for the matter to be laid down in statute. This has a
bearing on a point with which I am inclined to agree with the noble
Lord as well. We are dealing here with compensation, not the criminal
law as such, and therefore while one has a concern about the
presumption of innocence, it is not going to affect the
individual’s position as to whether or not he is to be
convicted.</hs_para>

support the Government in principle on those points and, coming to my
second point, I also support them on the standard of proof. The wording
of Article 14(3) uses the phrase “shows
conclusively”, which points the way to the standard of proof
that the new clause is adopting. I would be very uneasy about reducing
it to a balance of probabilities test in view of the background of the
article and the purpose of the provision, which is to provide for
compensation in exceptional cases which really do justify that
kind of
award<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T17:17:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

concerned with the wording of the amendment, I am bound to say that I
am troubled by it. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, will 
<?notus-xml column=700?>look at it again. What he has done, as I understand
it, is adopt the formula that was used in Ali by the Divisional Court.
If one looks more closely at the judgments in Adams, it will be found
that the majority were not adopting a formula that, as my noble and
learned friend Lord Brown rightly pointed out, is used more or less
every day in the court of criminal appeal. It was not in the mind of
the majority—I have to say that I am speaking as a member of
that majority—that any conviction which is shown to be unsafe
should justify an award of compensation; not at all. Lord Bingham, who
started thinking about this before we came to it in Adams, was talking
about some kind of failure in the trial process, something quite
fundamental which has gone wrong. The example mentioned by my noble and
learned friend Lord Brown was the person brought to trial here who
should never have been brought to trial here at all. That is quite a
strong example. One is looking for something different from and more
exceptional than the Ali test indicated. I suggest that the noble Lord,
Lord Beecham, and his advisers look more closely at what the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Phillips, said in paragraph 55, supported by the
noble and learned Baroness, Lady Hale, in paragraph 114, the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Clarke, in paragraph 217 and myself in
paragraph 74, indicating that what was really being looked
for was something that is so fundamental that it undermines the
evidence so that no conviction could possibly be based on it. The words
“so undermined” and “could not possibly”
were intended to indicate a much tougher test than the test that
rightly is of concern to my noble and learned friend Lord
Brown.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111263000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111263000083">Coming
to the wording of the Government’s proposal in Clause 151, it
may be a practical point, but it is a fundamentally important point. I
have here the letter which was written by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor
of Holbeach, to the noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Basildon, on 7
November. Quite rightly, he is pointing out for everybody’s
information that the applicant will not need to prove anything. What he
is saying is that the requirement that the clause imposes is something
that will be satisfied
simply:</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13111263000260" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0002.htm#13111263000260">“they

brings me to one of the cases which the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy,
was looking at. It is the case of Sally Clark, which was one of the
most tragic cases, I think, that has ever come to the court’s
attention. Noble Lords may remember that she was the lady who had two
babies, each of which died. Initially, it was thought that this was due
to cot death. The authorities were not satisfied with that; it looked
like too great a coincidence. The matter was referred first to
pathologists, who conducted post-mortem examinations of both infants.
Then it was referred to Professor Meadow, who looked at the statistics.
He came up with a statistic that the situation of two infants dying and
their deaths being attributed to cot deaths was really stretching the 
<?notus-xml column=701?>imagination far too far, because if one has a second death following on
the first, the chances are one in 74 million against its
being due to natural causes. That startling statistic was the basis of
the Crown case before the jury. The jury
convicted<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111263000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0003.htm#13111263000085">Subsequently,
the case first went on appeal and the conviction was upheld by the
Court of Appeal. It was then referred by the Criminal Cases Review
Commission back to the Court of Appeal. The significant point is to
look at the way in which the Court of Appeal dealt with the argument.
The noble and learned Lord and his advisers may care to see the way in
which the narrative proceeds in the case of Meadow, which was reported
in 2007 Queen’s Bench 462. The relevant facts can be
gathered from paragraph 102 in the judgment of Lord Justice Auld and
the opening remarks of the Master of the Rolls, Sir Anthony
Clarke<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111263000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0003.htm#13111263000086">The
point is that the basis on which Sally Clark’s conviction was
set aside was non-disclosure of relevant material by the biologist who
conducted the biopsies, the post-mortem examinations of the infants,
particularly one point relating to the second of the two infants to
die. It was a non-disclosure point. With great respect to those who are
proposing Clause 151, I do not think that it could possibly satisfy the
test which Clause 151 sets out. The Court of Appeal did not go ahead to
examine the significance of the evidence of Professor Meadow. It did
not have to, because it found that non-disclosure was enough for the
conviction to be unsafe and there was a standard being applied in that
case.</hs_para>

course, there was no declaration of innocence; that certainly would not
happen in our criminal Appeal Court. It was on the basis that it was
unsafe on the ground of a non-disclosure. However, if one had
gone on to look at the statistic, which was grossly
irresponsible—indeed, Professor Meadow was taken to task by his
professional body and found guilty of misconduct; serious misconduct
was set aside, but he was found guilty of misconduct—that was
evidence that should never have been placed before the jury, because
the one point that he failed to disclose was that the statistic did not
apply in a situation where two children were related. It was a
statistic for when the children were unrelated, which was not the case
that was being dealt with at

She had totally changed physically from when she went into prison and,
as we all know, she later took her own life. If there was a case that
called for compensation, surely that was it. I do not know what
happened, as the case was decided early in the decade, before Mullen,
which was the conviction from, I think, 2000 that was set aside. The
question of the Mullen test did not arise and I think it was decided
under some ex-gratia system, although I do not know the facts. However,
that is not really what should disturb the Minister. The question is

Cullen, questioned whether Parliament has the right to override a
carefully calibrated judgment of our Supreme Court. As I say, I am not
a lawyer but I am, if I have any other description, a parliamentarian
and have always thought that Parliament has that right, however well
calibrated the judgment might be. The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, was
very keen to see it as an affront to that fundamental principle of the
presumption of innocence and, indeed, as an affront to our common law.
The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, warned us that it was a breach of the
European convention. Then, almost like the 7th Cavalry, the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Brown, came over the hill with what sounded like,
even from my layman’s position, a magisterial dissection of the
arguments. I hope and advise that all participants in the debate, and
wider readers, read what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, had to
say. He pointed out clearly that compensation was not available in all
circumstances and that only a limited number would qualify. I will not
try to repeat his arguments, as I want to study them
carefully.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13111263000270" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0003.htm#13111263000270">5.30

was not. Again, I will not try to analyse and dissect this, but I think
that those on all sides who are interested in getting this right would
do well to study the intervention of the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Hope. He acknowledged 
<?notus-xml column=703?>that there is confusion, that it is important to get

Second Reading, several noble Lords spoke on this issue. We heard
concerns about the relationship of this provision to the presumption of
innocence, which have been repeated today. The Government do not
believe that the provision conflicts with, or in any way
undermines, the presumption of innocence. The presumption of innocence
is a fundamental constitutional right, enshrined in the European
Convention on Human Rights, and one that we fully support. Once a
person’s conviction has been quashed on the basis that it was
unsafe, he or she is once more presumed innocent. That is only right.
However, as the European Court of Human Rights recognised in the Allen
judgment, and in the subsequent judgment of KF, the fact that someone
is once more presumed innocent does not automatically mean that they
suffered a miscarriage of justice. In the Government’s view, a
miscarriage of justice will have taken place only when someone should
not have been convicted—not just because something went wrong
with the trial process or with the investigation, either of which could
render a conviction unsafe, but because there was a fact, unknown at
the time of their conviction, that clearly demonstrates that they did
not commit the
crime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111263000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0003.htm#13111263000096">We
agree that people should not have to prove their innocence in order to

equivalent to reversing the burden of proof. That is why we are not
requiring it. We do not, and do not plan to, require applicants for
compensation to prove anything. We do not wish them to provide us with
new evidence relating to their case. We look only at the new fact that
led the Court of Appeal to quash their conviction and at the
impact of that new fact. If the new fact shows that they were
innocent—for example, that they were somewhere else when the

Government argue that it is the proper role of the courts to interpret
the law made by Parliament. Where this law is not clear, or leaves
gaps, as Section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 does at the
moment, it is entirely appropriate for the courts to fill those gaps

for applicants and incur significant costs for them and the taxpayer.
The purpose of Clause 151 is to make the definition of a miscarriage of
justice more consistent, clearer and easier for the public and
potential applicants to understand. We believe that it is fairer than
using an obscure and confusing definition or continuing to work with a

procedural defects of a significant nature—for example, somebody

categories about which questions might be asked. He asked how large the
category of innocent people not getting compensation would be, and how
large the category of guilty people getting compensation would be. That
is a factor, but it is not the crucial factor that we ought to weigh as
we determine whether to make what is, in my submission and that of
other noble Lords, a significant change in how guilt and innocence are
treated, at any rate for the purposes of compensation. The noble and

problem identified by members of the retail trade and the
Magistrates’ Association in particular, and perhaps also by
others, is that under the present system an on-the-spot fine can be
given for a low-value shop theft if the penalty, which I believe at the
moment is £80, is not paid within 21 days. Half of them,
incidentally, are not. It then becomes a higher fine of £120 and
the court system manages the collection. That is a reasonable way to
approach first-time offenders. It should not, however, continue to be
available for repeat offences. The penalty notice for
disorder—we are into alphabetical descriptions again: the
PND—is not an admission of
guilt.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111263000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0003.htm#13111263000117">The
police often caution offenders for shop theft—that does require
an admission of guilt. It could be the next stage after a previous PND.
A summons to court may follow after two previous incidences of shop
theft. If the Government’s measures turn this into a kind of
postal process only, there is the danger that repeat offenders will
accumulate a succession of fines without really being stopped or
deterred at all. The view of the Magistrates’ Association is
that a great deal of shop theft goes undetected as it is, and some
offenders detected under this process for the third time will have
committed nearer to 30 offences. This is obviously not good for the
trade. It is also probably not good for the offenders. Many of them
have huge problems. They may be afflicted by homelessness and a
consequent inability to claim benefits, or they may have problems of
addiction to drugs or alcohol. Of course, those aspects will not be
picked up on at all under this process. There is therefore a double
risk, both to the trader and, indeed, very often to the
offenders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T17:55:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendment is therefore to narrow the scope within which these new
procedures can apply. The figure is one which simply
triggers the debate. In the Commons, my honourable friend Mr
David Hansen who moved the amendment did so with two figures,
£100 and £40. It is irrelevant which figure one looks at,
the question is whether the system as proposed will produce more
problems rather than fewer for both traders and potentially for
offenders, and whether—at the very least—a lower figure
might limit that. I hope that the Minister will consider that area. I
am not expecting a complete response tonight, but perhaps by the time
we come to Report the Government could have had another look at this
issue with a view to seeing whether some of these fears
which have been expressed by those with an interest in the matter can
be properly addressed. I beg to

see little point in this clause if it introduces for the first time

From my experience of years ago, I am afraid that the general public
seem to think that shoplifting is not nearly as serious as real theft.
It is something that most people engage in when they are young, or
otherwise. However, to label this aspect “shoplifting”
rather than theft in general, as the Government are doing, is perhaps
to lend credence to the notion that shoplifting is not so important at
all.</hs_para>

long time ago I was director of the British Retail Consortium, and I
know that it is one of the most irritating things for shopkeepers,
large and small, when shoplifting is seen as some kind of victimless
crime or childish prank. I often think, when looking at first-time
offenders, that they should be listed as “first-time court
offenders”. It is a scourge, and as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie,
knows as a former champion of the consumer, in the end the consumer
pays for the tolerance of shop theft. Therefore this certainly in no
way trivialises shop theft. We intend to produce guidelines for the
police on these provisions and we are currently working with the police
and retail associations to draft guidance on them, which we hope will
be available in time for Report. That will primarily cover the
circumstances under which it would be appropriate to pursue the Section
12 Magistrates’ Courts Act procedure, which allows defendants to
plead guilty by
post<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T18:01:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111263000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0003.htm#13111263000125">The
volume of people who go through the court is certainly a problem. Just
over 120,000 people were brought to justice for shop theft in 2012, 40%
of whom received out-of-court disposals. However, we do not believe
that these changes will result in shop theft being treated less
seriously; in the vast majority of cases they will affect neither where
the case is tried nor the sentence that is imposed. Ninety-nine per
cent of shop theft cases are heard in magistrates’ courts, and
of those who are convicted 98% are sentenced there. Only 1,650 shop
theft cases were sentenced in the Crown Court last year, and 90% of
them resulted in a sentence that the magistrates’
court could have given.</hs_para>

are remaining concerns about that in the retail sector. However, we
believe that they flow mainly from a misunderstanding about what the
provisions seek to achieve. Any incident of theft continues to be a
serious matter. However, the changes we are introducing simply enable
more efficient processes to be employed to bring such cases to justice
quickly. They do not change the fact that 99% of shoplifting cases are
already considered in the magistrates’ court and that 90% of
cases involve goods worth less than
£200.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111263000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0003.htm#13111263000127">Amendment
16 would reduce the number of shop theft cases to which Clause 152
applies by reducing from £200 to £100 the monetary
threshold that defines these cases. However, I appreciate that that was
a figure given to stimulate the debate. The purpose of the clause is to
enable cases of low-value shop theft to benefit from more efficient
arrangements that are limited to summary-only offences. In particular,
it will mean that the procedure that enables defendants to plead guilty
by post will be available, and the police will be able to make use in
these cases of powers that they already possess, whereby they can
prosecute certain offences where they are uncontested. The result will
be to speed up the prosecution of these cases and to provide swifter
justice for retailers.</hs_para>

that the theft of valuable property should be made a summary-only
offence. A line has to be drawn somewhere, and the £200
threshold was chosen on the basis of research that was done in 2006 for
the Sentencing Advisory Panel. That showed that 90% of all shop theft
cases heard in magistrates’ courts involved goods worth
£200 or less. Lowering the threshold to £100 would catch
rather fewer cases—77% of them, according to that research. I am
not sure what would be gained by excluding cases where the item stolen
was worth more than £100. Almost certainly it would have no
effect at all on where the defendants were tried or on the sentence
that could be given. It would simply mean that the more efficient and
speedier procedures would not be available in those

assure noble Lords that we do not expect all cases of low-value shop
theft to be dealt with by post and prosecuted by the police in the
defendant’s absence. That is not the intention. It may well be
appropriate for prolific shoplifters to be charged and bailed to appear
in court, to be dealt with in person. That would not only be suitable
but necessary in cases where a custodial sentence was in prospect. The
new provisions do not prevent this: whether the “guilty by

17 would exclude from the ambit of Clause 152 any case in which the
defendant had already received a caution, conditional caution or
penalty notice for disorder in respect of shop theft. It is not clear
why a case should be excluded from the scope of these provisions simply
because the defendant had previously received a caution or other
out-of-court disposal. That sort of disposal is not an unusual outcome

bail hearings are rightly encouraged to make arrangements for their

the court is assured that suitable support is in place, this amendment
will not necessitate any further action whatever. However, where those

confident of being released or was simply overwhelmed by the judicial
process, it offers a vital opportunity for early intervention to
prevent people from coming to harm. The importance of avoiding any
break in care for children or vulnerable adults is well established.
The Government themselves advise that children under 16 should not be
left alone overnight; children under 12 should not be left alone for

we are only too aware of the danger posed to older or disabled adults

use the toilet or even without vital medication. In more extreme
situations, people have experienced serious harm, or even lost their
lives, after falling through gaps in the system and finding themselves
without support. Many steps are being taken to ensure that such
tragedies are never repeated and that homecare schedules are properly
adhered to. Yet equally robust provision is lacking in situations where

is worth revisiting the number of people at risk of being left

Wales experience the imprisonment of a parent every year, more than
twice the total number of children in the care system. While statistics
for adults who experience the imprisonment of their
carer are not centrally collected, this figure is also likely
to be significant, given that the prison population currently stands at
over 80,000 and approximately one in eight of Britain’s adults
is a recognised carer. A simple process whereby courts make relevant
inquiries and notifications regarding dependants, at the point when a
sentence is passed or bail is refused, will go some considerable way to
addressing current shortcomings, without creating significant pressure
on either time or resources. The proposal also stands to reduce the
need for the more intensive and costly intervention often required
further down the line if people are left without

we can take this opportunity to adopt this sensible and constructive

for the elderly parent who finds that there is no one to help prepare
their dinner because their son has been handed a custodial sentence.
When anyone is sent to prison, the families and dependants who are left
behind will invariably feel the consequences. It is perhaps impossible

Judd (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support the amendment. I
remember, on a visit to Holloway, being tackled very forcefully by a
prison officer, who said how outraged she was, fulfilling her duties,
sometimes quite late at night, of receiving and processing people who
were being taken in to that prison after court proceedings, that only
at that stage did the staff discover that there was somebody vulnerable
at home. It is outrageous in any decent society that there is any
possibility of something like this happening. I think sometimes that we
just do not think though the consequences. Apart from the possible
inhumane results, not that infrequently a vulnerable person in that
situation will have been in the care of a woman or a man—it is
not exclusively a matter for women—in a home that has had more
of its share of disrupting influences on 
<?notus-xml column=715?>that child. For the child suddenly to be left in
this predicament only compounds the insecurity that that child has
faced in life and, indeed, could well accentuate a tendency to
anti-social behaviour at a later
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T18:21:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111263000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0003.htm#13111263000149">If
we are trying to reduce crime and encourage the young to forgo the
possibility of delinquent behaviour, a demonstrable sense of care by

this amendment is crucial. I will be very sad if the Minister feels
unable to accept it, because I am quite certain that it must be
pursued on Report. For a prison officer, who was deeply concerned, to
raise the matter with me brought the point home to me all the more
forcefully. It is quite shocking that this sort of situation can occur.

that individuals facing sentence may be in denial about the
consequences. In what I think is a parallel example, working on
adoption through the Select Committee earlier this year and talking
about placements of children and whether it was right for a child to be
placed away from its birth parents, we were told time and again that it
was at a very late stage that other members of the birth family would
come forward offering to care for the child. I do not want to leap to
conclusions on how this proposal might operate, so I ask the noble Lord
whether he or those involved with this campaign—I regret that I
have not seen the detail—have consulted, first, the courts and,
secondly, the Local Government Association about the operation of such

issue raised by the noble Lords, Lord Hylton and Lord Judd, and by my

ready to leap on the idea that the cold and uncaring state is not
concerned about these matters. Sometimes some of these cases arise
because an accused person has not informed anybody of children or
dependants at home, and it is difficult in those circumstances to deal
with 
<?notus-xml column=716?>matters. Courts already have a duty to take account of mitigating
factors in every case, including the fact that an offender has primary
care for children or other dependants. It is important that the
presence of dependants is brought to the court’s attention, but
the duty proposed in this amendment will not and could not force
convicted offenders to tell the court about the existence of
dependants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T18:26:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111263000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0003.htm#13111263000158">The
case law in this area makes it clear that a judge must perform a
balancing act when making a sentence, weighing up the welfare of the
child against other factors, such as the length of sentence and the
necessary limitation on the offender’s rights by reason of their
imprisonment. Where necessary, the court must obtain information on the
consequences of the sentences on any children. It is important,
therefore, that the existence of dependants is brought to the
court’s attention. There will, however, be cases where the
seriousness of offending is such that despite the existence of
dependants a custodial sentence is necessary. I can also say that the
changes in the women’s estate which I recently announced will
try to make sure that women who are in prison and with family

particular concern is the duty this amendment places on a criminal
court, dealing with serious crime, to take on what is essentially a
non-criminal function. The criminal court should take account of a
number of relevant factors, including any responsibility the offender
has for dependants, but it cannot be the responsibility of our criminal
courts to address all  
<?notus-xml column=717?>the issues that flow from the offender’s conviction and custodial
sentence. It is simply not realistic for the criminal courts to step in
and manage an offender’s life after they have been convicted. I
am also concerned that, under the noble Lord’s amendment, the
proposed duty on the court comes at the end of the court process. At
that point the offender has already been convicted and has been
sentenced to a custodial term. The effect of a custodial term on
dependants is a factor which should have been taken into account in
considering the sentence to impose, not as an afterthought once the
sentence has been decided on. In deciding on an appropriate sentence
the court is required to consider, first and foremost, the seriousness
of the offence. It will also consider personal mitigating factors
relevant to the offender, which can include the impact of a sentence on
dependants.</hs_para>

responsibilities may have on the type or severity of a sentence has
been clarified over the years by decisions of the Court of Appeal. In
short, it is long established that the courts can, and in certain
circumstances must, consider the potential impact of a sentence on
dependants and, if they do not where it is relevant, this could give
rise to an appeal against sentence. The judge or magistrates, in
deciding on sentence, should therefore already know about any
dependants and have taken them into account. The pre-sentence report,
prepared for the court by the probation service, should set out the
background circumstances of the offender, including any family
connections or caring responsibilities. I do not believe that our
reforms will change that. The legal representative of the offender can
raise any such caring responsibilities with the court, often as part of
a plea in mitigation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13111263000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0003.htm#13111263000163">The Children Act 2004
already requires interagency co-operation to safeguard and promote the
well-being of the child. Probation staff working in court or preparing
pre-sentence reports already have a responsibility to consider the
impact of custody on an offender’s children. If there is a
likelihood of custody, children’s services will be alerted to
ensure arrangements are in place to safeguard the well-being of
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T18:32:37"></hs_TimeCode>. This
brings me to a crucial point. In order for agencies to promote the
well-being of children, or for courts to take into account the impact
that a custodial sentence would have on dependants, they must know
about them. In the case studies provided by PACT, it is striking that
the offender has often not disclosed to probation, any other
authorities or even to their own legal representative that they have
dependants. It is often not until they are in prison that this fact
emerges. This amendment would not, however, address that situation. It
would not force an offender to disclose to the court that they had
dependants; it may well have the opposite effect. Judges or a bench of
magistrates can be seen as intimidating authority figures. If they are
quizzing a defendant about children in the context of calling in social
services, that may, in fact, reinforce the offender’s mistaken
desire to keep their dependants secret. It is simply impractical for a
court to satisfy itself in every case involving custody of the adequacy
of arrangements for care of dependants, especially if the offender does
not disclose they have dependants. It is also unclear as to what duty
the criminal court 
<?notus-xml column=718?>would have should the care arrangements be unclear,
and how, if at all, this should impact on the sentencing or remand
decision.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111263000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-0003.htm#13111263000164">It
is for those practical reasons that the Government cannot accept this
amendment. However, we believe that the issue should be addressed and
we are willing to look at ways to do so. For example, I recognise that
often, although not always, offenders who are primary carers are likely
to be women. Last month, as I have said, we set out new approaches to

that women can stay closer to home and maintain links with their
families. Under our Transforming Rehabilitation reforms, all
women’s prisons are to become resettlement prisons. This means
that female prisoners will serve their sentences as close to home as
possible and, most importantly, as close to their children as
possible—maintaining vital links that will help them to break

about the inconsistency of courts exercising their responsibility to
try to find out these facts. As I have indicated, I pay tribute to the
work of PACT along with the senior judiciary to ensure that posters and
information are available in courts to bring that message to the

representatives of PACT, the court services and the senior judiciary to
see how we can refresh these efforts to ensure that maximum coverage

the remarks made by the Minister and his suggestion of a meeting, but
here we have a chance to put in a safety net. I have no crystal ball,

deal with it briefly. Members of the Committee will know that Section
47 of the Criminal Justice Act 1925 contains a special defence for a
wife who is charged with any criminal offence other than treason or
murder. It is a defence for the wife to prove that the offence was
committed in the presence of and under the coercion of her husband. No
such defence applies to husbands for offences committed in the presence
of wives. The defence cannot be claimed by a live-in partner of either
sex, by the partners to a same-sex marriage or a civil partnership, by
other family members who may live in the same household, or by
employees<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T18:39:55"></hs_TimeCode>. The
defence does not apply if the husband is 100 metres away when the crime
is committed. Neither wives nor any other person need this defence,
because of the defence of duress and the ability to mitigate by
reference to relevant 
<?notus-xml column=720?>circumstances. The existence of this special defence has repeatedly and
consistently been criticised, including by the 1922 Avory Committee and
by the Law Commission in its 1977 report, which concluded that the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Astor

Committee’s consideration today. The Armed Forces (Remission of
Fines) Order 2013 is required because, having introduced
arrangements to set a term of imprisonment as a means of ensuring that
fines are paid, we must also be able to reduce that term in proportion
to any reduction of the financial penalty at a later date. This order
does that, reflecting the position of the criminal
courts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000004">Fines
are meaningless unless there is a mechanism to ensure they are paid.
The risk of imprisonment will help to deter those who otherwise might
default on their fines, but for those who fail to pay their due, it is
only fair and reasonable for them to expect any consequential terms of
imprisonment to be proportionate to their fine. To put this into the
service context, the alternative period of imprisonment comes into play
only when a financial penalty enforcement order is made.</hs_para>

services have mechanisms in place to recover fines from serving
personnel through deductions from their pay. Financial penalty
enforcement orders are the mechanism to recover fines from those who
have left their service. Financial penalty enforcement orders apply to
a person who is neither subject to service law nor a civilian subject
to service discipline, but they also apply to certain personnel who are
subject to service law as a special member of a reserve
force.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000006">Financial
penalty enforcement orders may be made by the Service Personnel and
Veterans Agency when such persons have failed to pay all or some of a
financial penalty that has been awarded against them. The financial
penalty enforcement order may be registered with the relevant
court—in England and Wales a magistrates’ court—to
be enforced, and in due course,

way of background, the Crown Court in England and Wales must fix a term
of imprisonment to be served in default of any fine imposed on a
defendant aged 18 or over. This is necessary and right to enable fines
to be enforced. Separately, the civilian courts also have the power to
reduce or remit entirely a fine following a review of the
offender’s financial circumstances. Where the court does so, and
a default term of imprisonment has been fixed, the court must
proportionately reduce that default term of
imprisonment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000008">I
turn to the service courts. The court martial already has a similar
power to reduce or remit a fine, but it has not, until now, been
required to set a default term of imprisonment when fining a defendant.
The Armed Forces Act 2011 inserts new Sections 269A and 269B into the
2006 Act. The first of these new sections requires the court martial,
when it imposes a fine on a person aged 18 or over, to specify a term
of imprisonment to be served if the fine is not paid and an enforcement
order is made. Similarly, the second new section enables the court
martial, when making a service compensation order against a person aged
18 or over, to specify the maximum term of imprisonment which may be
imposed if the compensation is not
paid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000009">These

Regulation 1072/2009 revised the previous EU rules governing road
haulage cabotage with the intention of clarifying the minimum extent to
which carrying out cabotage in another member state is allowed.
Translated into domestic law, this results in non-UK goods vehicles
being limited to carrying out no more than three cabotage operations in
the seven-day period following the last delivery on the incoming
international journey. Once the limit has been reached the vehicle must
leave and re-enter with a new international load in order to undertake
further cabotage.</hs_para>

provided by the 2009 EU rules has been welcomed by industry in place of
less certain application of the former rules on “temporary
use”. However, the explicitness of the new rules has had an
appreciable and restrictive impact on the ability to move sufficient
motor vehicles in the new car registration peak periods each March and

vehicles are highly specialised and are not suitable for general
haulage. Whereas the core demand outside the peak periods is
satisfactorily met by UK vehicles operating domestically, at times of 
<?notus-xml column=254?>peak demand vehicles from other member states have traditionally been
used to supplement the UK fleet. Regulation 1072/2009 has the effect of
restricting the amount of work that non-UK hauliers can legally
undertake on each visit. When there is a shortage of haulage capacity
to move cars and vans, they accumulate at factories and ports during
these peak periods. This lack of capacity in the supply chain becomes a
bottleneck for UK manufacturers distributing vehicles for domestic
consumption and
export.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000020">My

impact assessment refers to policy options under consideration, but it
does not include the option, or the feasibility, of removing the cause
of the trouble, which is the GB system of having new registration
numbers every six months, and with it the quite dramatic 
<?notus-xml column=255?>peaks in car registrations in March and September compared to the rest
of the year. The impact assessment dismisses this point, when it says
on page 3
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13111258000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000244">“The

I would have thought the peak registration system had everything to do
with this order. Will the Minister tell us whether the peak
registration system is in the interests of growth, since growth is
obviously an important issue for the Department for Transport? This
order supports the growth agenda, as the Explanatory Memorandum itself
states, without answering the question as to whether the arrangement it
is seeking to prop up is also in the interests of growth. Would the car
industry, including car transporter firms, be better off with a much
more even flow of cars being produced and sold each month than is the
case at
present<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T12:15:51"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T12:15:51"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T12:15:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13111258000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000028">Figure
4 on page 5 of the impact assessment indicates that, apart from some 10
weeks of the year around March and September, capacity in the haulage
fleet comfortably exceeds—in some weeks far
exceeds—demand for moving new and export cars. I hope the
Minister will give us the facts and figures to show that the GB system
of having new registration numbers every six months, and its cost
consequences, are justified by the additional cars sold compared to
what the position would be with a much more even number of car
registrations and sales through the year. Frankly, if this cannot be
shown, why are we introducing this
order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T12:16:41"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T12:16:37"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000029">The
impact assessment also dismisses the registration peaks issue on page
8, on the grounds that any changes to the system would be too
complicated to implement. However, should we not be trying to do
something about peak periods for the longer term, if that is what is
causing problems for UK transporter firms, rather than getting in extra
UK haulage capacity at peak times, possibly at greater cost?
Can<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T12:17:35"></hs_TimeCode> the Minister
say whether other vehicle manufacturing countries—such as
France, Germany and Italy—have the same problem as us over car
transporter capacity because of their own systems of registration
numbers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T12:17:20"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T12:17:18"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000030">The
impact assessment refers to the effect of this order in allowing
Ministers to relax selectively the application of EU cabotage rules in
Great Britain. What is the maximum number of weeks in the year that we
are allowed to do this? The Explanatory Memorandum states that the
Association of European Vehicle Logistics and the Ford Motor Company
both suggested that any relaxation period should start two weeks before
the peak months; that is, it should be the last two weeks in February
and August. The Government do not appear to have agreed to that
suggestion, since the relaxation periods will begin on 22 February and
25 August respectively. The department agrees that it is sensible to
allow the relaxation periods to commence before the start of the two
peak months, but does not indicate in the Explanatory Memorandum why it
would be inappropriate to agree to the last two weeks in February and
August, which was what was being sought. Can the Minister say why not?
I note that even the Government’s proposals will put additional
heavy vehicles on our roads at a peak holiday time, around
a  
<?notus-xml column=256?>bank holiday weekend at the end of August. Perhaps the Minister can
comment on the wisdom, from a safety point of view, of doing
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T12:18:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000031">We
are told that there were three negative responses. They were not
exactly from lightweight sources. The traffic commissioners pointed out
that foreign goods vehicles were generally more likely to be
non-compliant than domestic vehicles. They said there was a risk to
road safety and fair competition from the proposal. The commissioners
referred to random fleet compliance surveys conducted by VOSA, which
show that domestic hauliers attract a prohibition rate from mechanical
defects of 10.4%, whereas the average for all foreign hauliers is more
than double that, at 21.8%. The impact assessment goes on to

the Department is not convinced that this is likely to be a significant
issue. Car transporters are highly specialised and costly pieces of
equipment and we believe they are less likely to be non-compliant with
routine roadworthiness requirements than the average

is really not a satisfactory response when rejecting the concerns of
the traffic commissioners. The “we believe” school of
policy-making is not on a very firm footing compared to policy-making
based on evidence and facts. I ask the Minister to provide the
non-compliance rates with routine roadworthiness requirements of,
first, domestic car transporters and, secondly, foreign
hauliers’ vehicles covered by this order, which would provide a
factual basis for the department’s statement that it is not
convinced that this is likely to be a significant issue.</hs_parafo>

assessment appears a little imprecise on this point, I am assuming that
the effect of the order is that more non-UK transporters will be in
this country in the peak periods than are currently. That is because
the impact assessment talks about the order removing bottlenecks and
about exports no longer being delayed or factories put at risk because
end-of-line compounds become choked. One of the negative responses came
from a UK-based car transportation company which said that it would
have to reduce the size of its fleet if transport operators from other
member states were able to operate in Great Britain without restriction
for two months of the year. Bearing in mind that outside these two
months capacity exceeds demand, it seems likely that the months in
question are ones when car transportation companies have more
business—and more income coming in—than at any other time
of the year. How can the department be so sure that non-UK hauliers
being able to operate without restriction during those two peak months
for business for UK car transporter firms, as a result of this
government order, will not have an adverse impact on the UK
firms?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111258000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000034">The

Kramer:</Member></B> I very much thank the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, for
a series of entirely pertinent questions. Let me try to take them
roughly in the order in which he presented them. His primary question
was about whether it is possible to level out or do away with these
peaks of registration. As he will be aware, until 2000 there was just
one registration date, which was each August, and the peak period was
even more pronounced than it is today. Indeed, it was in response to
pressure from the motor industry that the DVLA consulted on the
registration periods. Subsequent to that consultation, it introduced a
system of registrations each March and September. It spread the peaks
over two periods. The general assessment of the industry is that the
system has worked well and there has been no pressure from the industry
to change the system in recent years.</hs_para>

am sure that the noble Lord will agree that it is to every advantage to
have a system that is effective for the UK’s very robust car
manufacturing and retail industry. Were there to be any review, it
would probably be a BIS-driven review, because it would be to ensure
that that is working effectively both for the manufacturing and retail

Rosser:</Member></B> I take the noble Baroness’s point that that
may have more to do with BIS than the Department for Transport. I asked
whether in fact having the peak in car registrations in two months of
the year was conducive to encouraging growth. I repeat one part of my
question in this context which I think is a matter for the Department
for Transport: do other car-producing countries in

a once a year basis, so it has something closer to our older form of a
single peak. Otherwise, that is not the pattern in continental Europe,
but then buying patterns are very different in various countries within
the EU. I am sure that the noble Lord would not recommend that we
change our system in 
<?notus-xml column=258?>order to follow continental buying patterns which may not fit buying
patterns in the UK. I suspect that he would also agree that this has to
be an industry-led consideration, because the goal is to ensure that it

noble Lord talked about an adverse impact on the economy. He will
appreciate that if we were to have a generally higher fleet at all

noble Lord asked whether there is a maximum time for which the
relaxations can apply. Exactly as he said, the relaxations are over two
fixed periods, from 22 February to 31 March and from 25 August to
30 September each year. However, there is flexibility,
because the normal EU cabotage rules permit non-UK car transporters to
carry out up to three cabotage operations in the seven days prior to
the relaxation period coming into force. In effect, it allows for up to
six weeks of cabotage operations without having to leave the UK. I
think that that responds to the issue raised by the industry when it
asked for an extra week, because there is that normal process in the
period prior to the actual start of the specific exemption. That
provides the coverage that meets the requirements of the car
manufacturers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000042"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Rosser" PimsId="462" UID="13111258000307" xid="1693" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000307">Lord

providing an additional week, as originally requested by the industry,
was unnecessary because it is covered by that element. If we added two
weeks on, as he asked, we would have yet another week added on, and I
do not think that that would be either necessary to the industry or

that if there were need to look at an exemption in another area, it
would be quite easy to do a mirror SI, simply changing the description
of the problem and the vehicle. The issue before us is the only one
being addressed. Any further exemption would still be required to go
through exactly the same parliamentary procedure as this

safety concerns raised by the Freight Transport Association, the noble

exist across all EU member states, and the Commission is looking to
harmonise standards in the future. The Vehicle and Operator Services

vehicles to ensure that they are roadworthy and can take enforcement

the most serious cases can impound

issue of safety is partly addressed by that, but the noble Lord picked
up on the point discussed in the impact statement; namely, that
vehicles able to access the UK because of this exemption will be car
transporters. As he knows and reaffirmed, those are highly specialised,
very costly pieces of kit. I do not think that anyone has done the work
for the UK domestic market or for non-UK resident hauliers to compare
their accident rates versus other forms of haulage. VOSA will keep a
sharp eye out and monitor car transporters more closely, and that
applies to both domestic and overseas vehicles; but it is generally
expected that these highly sophisticated pieces of kit will be less
involved in collisions and raise many fewer safety issues than the
haulage industry at large. VOSA is on to that and will keep an eye on
it. There is no experience that suggests that we should have any

Rosser:</Member></B> There are one or two, but I am not pushing the
Minister to give a reply today. One argument advanced by one of the car
transporter firms is that it might have to reduce the size of its
fleet. I think that the Department for Transport’s answer to
that is, “No, you won’t, because the costs of the non-UK
hauliers will be greater”. What is the difference in cost for
non-UK transporters in hiring domestic equipment under the present
arrangements and under the proposed arrangements? Presumably, the

helpful; I thank him for triggering my memory on both this and another
question. Only one 
<?notus-xml column=260?>UK road haulier raised this issue. It is expensive, quite frankly, for
the UK industry to have to carry the additional equipment—it is
expensive equipment, as we said earlier—to meet peak. From an
economic perspective, therefore, I think that most road hauliers regard
it as an advantage to know that the peak can be met from elsewhere
without a requirement that they carry equipment which would have to sit
redundant for much of the rest of the year. As the noble Lord will see,
the argument works both ways on this issue.</hs_para>

not from the industry, but as I understand it, the other argument that
has been put forward is that those two peak months are probably the
time when companies take in most of their income. What guarantee is

highest income—time, companies will not find non-UK hauliers

car purchasers within the UK and to UK manufacturing industry. So the

cost. He also raised the issue of peaks on the road in August. Sending

has proposed two criteria, which correspond broadly to two of the
ongoing standard licence conditions. The first criterion requires
providers to be registered with the Care Quality Commission, if
required by law, in order to provide NHS services, and acts as an
objective measure to assess compliance with standards of quality and
safety. In order to meet this criterion, applicants for a licence must
be registered with the Care Quality Commission, if required by law to
do so, when the licence is granted.</hs_para>

focuses on providers’ fitness. The purpose of this criterion is
to ensure that people involved in overseeing the organisation and
influencing the provision of healthcare services meet certain fitness
requirements. In particular, no person who is a director or governor of
a provider, or is performing an equivalent or similar function, may
fall within the specified description of an unfit person. The
description of an unfit person is designed to ensure that individuals
performing these functions must comply with the statutory fitness
requirements which are equivalent to those set out for directors and
governors of NHS foundation trusts, and certain requirements on
directors of companies. Examples of these requirements are that an
individual must not be an undischarged bankrupt; have undischarged
arrangements with creditors; be subject to a moratorium period under a
debt relief order; have received a prison sentence of three months or
longer during the previous five years; or be subject to a
disqualification order or
undertaking.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T12:44:32"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000069">The
criterion also requires that any corporate body which holds the
position of director or governor of a provider must not be subject to
the insolvency proceedings or arrangements listed in the order. Such
proceedings might indicate that the company is not effective in
governing the applicant and managing the applicant’s financial
affairs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T12:44:25"></hs_TimeCode>.
Providers must be able to meet these criteria in order to be granted a
licence, but they must 
<?notus-xml column=263?>also continue to meet them to keep their licence, along with other
licence conditions designed by Monitor to protect and promote
patients’ interests. The department agrees that these are
robust, appropriate criteria for Monitor to assess providers against,

responsibilities, its independent regulation of pricing of NHS services
and the general support that it gives for NHS foundation trusts. Now
that Monitor has had time to consider these matters, since the passage
of the 2012 Act, can he explain how it avoids conflicts of interest
between these three separate roles? He will be aware that we discussed

period of great uncertainty for Monitor, with the nature of its role in
the new system being unclear for most of the 18 months between the
introduction of the Bill in January 2011 and its passing in 2012. Dr
Bennett has both shaped and interpreted the role that Monitor now plays

powerful bodies, all with well paid executives and strong boards, vying
for influence. What that does at a time of huge pressure in the health

Hunt, for his questions. I start with the issue that he raised
initially, which was about the role of Monitor and what he perceives as
the conflicts within that role. I address that by saying that there is
no fundamental conflict, although he is perfectly right to say that
Monitor has distinct, separate functions. Different executives within
Monitor lead on each of those areas. Monitor has a board, which
functions to ensure that David Bennett’s dual role as chair and
CEO works effectively. At the same time, the Department of Health, as
the steward of the system, keeps Monitor’s performance under
review. It does that through quarterly accountability meetings. I
suggest that the conflicts that the noble Lord perceives are much more
in the perception than the reality. There are mechanisms in place
within Monitor to ensure that the functions are kept distinct and that,
where appropriate, Chinese walls operate.</hs_para>

Monitor as the sector regulator of healthcare. That involves a duty

noble Lord referred to enforced tendering of services. I acknowledge
that there is still a degree of misconception within the health service
on this issue, despite the public statements made by Ministers. The
position is that patients should receive healthcare services from
providers from whichever sector—public, private or
voluntary—is most capable of meeting their needs and improving
the quality of services. Competition can be a valuable tool for
commissioners in delivering greater choice and control to patients and
can be an important way of bringing in fresh new thinking and new ideas
about different ways of doing things. It is already well established in
the NHS, including competitive tendering and has shown that it can be
used as a means of driving up quality—I think there is general
consensus on that—but it remains for commissioners to decide how
best to procure services in the interests of their patients, including
where it might be appropriate to introduce competition and where it
would not be appropriate. Commissioners take decisions on the best
provider to deliver those
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000090">It
has never been and is absolutely not the Government’s intention
to make all NHS services subject to competitive tendering. The Section
75 regulations in place are intended to maintain the previous position
on procurement, which was introduced before May 2010 and is set out in
existing NHS guidance and UK procurement law. It is worth reminding
noble Lords that acute elective care, which represents the vast
majority of NHS services, is not secured through 
<?notus-xml column=267?>competitive tendering, and that will continue to be the case. A single
tender action may well be justified on the basis that there is only one
provider able to meet the clinical quality and safety standards
required by a commissioner, and I say again that it is for the
commissioner to decide what services it believes are appropriate for
meeting the needs of patients in its catchment area. If a commissioner
can properly satisfy itself, for example, that a certain case load
volume or case mix needs to be maintained in order to provide a safe
and effective service and there is only one provider capable of doing
that, that would be a legitimate justification for awarding a contract
without a competition. The noble Lord may like to know—I am sure
he is aware of this already—that very shortly Monitor and NHS
England will be issuing further guidance on this subject which I hope
will dispel any remaining misapprehensions that persist among
commissioners.</hs_para>

to walk-in centres. The problem with walk-in centres is that many of
them, when looked at closely by clinical commissioning groups, fail to
provide value for money. Many were and are performing a very useful
service, but GPs have voiced concerns about a lack of demand for these
services in parts of the country and have pointed out, as highlighted
in Monitor’s report, that in some areas the centres duplicated
existing GP services which effectively means that the NHS is paying

straightforward: a provider has to be registered with the CQC and it
must have a fit and proper persons overseeing what it does. Monitor has
chosen those tests as being proportionate; they draw on tests from
other appropriate contexts; they can be objectively measured. Later
this year Monitor will publish guidance to help providers understand
the licence criteria and to assess whether Monitor will determine
whether they meet the criteria, and what information they will need to

Newby (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the draft regulations before the

holders of Equitable Life with-profits annuities which began before 1
September
1992.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000097">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:09:12"></hs_TimeCode>

debated in this House in July. As a result of that
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:09:19"></hs_TimeCode>, a
drafting error was identified in the regulations. The policy as
announced by the Chancellor specified that a single payment would be
made to each eligible policyholder regardless of the number of relevant
policies they held. However, the previous draft allowed for multiple
payments to be made to policyholders if they held multiple policies.
The previous draft has now been withdrawn. I thank the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, for identifying the error, and I apologise for our having
made it in the first place.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:09:28"></hs_TimeCode>, all
policy decisions surrounding the regulations remain the same, and only
technical changes have been made to the
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000098">I
briefly remind the Committee of the background to the decision to make
these payments. As noble Lords will be aware, this Government
established the Equitable Life payment scheme in 2010 to make payments
totalling up to £1.5 billion to about 1 million former Equitable
Life policyholders who suffered financial losses as a result of
government maladministration which occurred in the regulation of the
Equitable Life Assurance Society.</hs_para>

of the scheme, the Government have received representations suggesting
that a specific group of elderly policyholders who bought their
with-profits annuity from Equitable Life before 1 September 1992 should
be included within the scheme. The Government remain of the view that
there is no basis for their inclusion. In short, this is because the
scheme is based on the understanding that those investing with
Equitable Life relied on regulatory returns that were subject to
government maladministration. As such, they had lost the opportunity to
make a fully 
<?notus-xml column=269?>informed decision. If they had had this opportunity, they might have
invested elsewhere. The first returns that would have been different if
maladministration had not occurred were those of 1991, which would not
have influenced policyholders’ decisions until September 1992.
Therefore, investment decisions made before this time are not included
in the scheme.</hs_para>

clear, however, that this group of policyholders is under significant
financial pressure in their later years, as they have not received the
income that they planned for from their Equitable Life annuity that
they bought more 20 years ago. In this year’s Budget, the
Chancellor announced that the Government would make an ex gratia
payment of £5,000 to those individuals who bought an Equitable
Life with-profits annuity before 1 September 1992 and were aged over 60
on 20 March 2013, the date of the Budget. An additional
£5,000 is available to those policyholders who are also in
receipt of pension credit.</hs_para>

reassure noble Lords that the revision of the regulations has not
caused any delay to the planned timing of these payments. We appreciate
that many of the pre-1992 with-profit annuity policyholders are very
elderly and in financial hardship, so the Treasury intends these
payments to be made soon after the parliamentary process has been
completed. We are very grateful to the Prudential, which makes ongoing
annuity payments to this group of policyholders, for its support in
making these one-off
payments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000102">In
September, the Treasury wrote to all those who are expected to be
eligible under these regulations to give more detail on the payments
and to encourage people to check their pension credit status by 1
November with the Department for Work and Pensions. As a result, the
Department for Work and Pensions has recently begun work to identify
which pre-September 1992 annuitants are in receipt of pension credit.
This will allow the payments due to them to be increased from
£5,000 to £10,000 without the need for them to make any
application. Under the regulations, we also have a provision that
should an annuitant be eligible for pension credit on 1 November but is
not on the DWP’s records for some reason on that date, they can
apply directly to the Treasury for the additional £5,000 due to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000103">As
I explained on a previous occasion, should an eligible annuitant have
passed away after the Budget announcement on 20 March 2013 before
receiving their payment, this payment will be made to their estate. As
these payments have a more complex administrative process, the Treasury
has already begun the process of writing to the personal
representatives of those deceased policyholders with details of how to
apply for this payment. I hope that the Committee will join me in
supporting the

McKenzie of Luton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister
for introducing the regulations, which engender a sense of
déjà-vu. We note that the error in the original
regulations has been corrected to ensure that only one payment of
£5,000 is due regardless of the number of relevant with-profits
annuity policies held by a qualifying annuitant.</hs_para>

delay in payment—I think that the Minister said that this re-run
of the regulations would not mean a delay—it would seem that no
individual has been disadvantaged by the re-run of the regulations.
Perhaps the Minister will confirm that because I think that the same
parameters operate for pre-1 September 1992 with-profits annuity
policies; that is, that the individual should have been aged over 60 on
20 March 2013 and should have checked their pension credit status by 1
November 2013. If the re-run meant that payments were later than they
otherwise would be, there could be a very narrow category of
individuals who might have survived to receive pension credit but did
not survive to the additional payment, but I do not think that that
arises if there is no delay in the
payments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000106">We
went over some of the convoluted background to the Equitable Life saga.
I do not propose to revisit it today as the Minister gave us a summary.
Perhaps the Minister will clarify the status of our earlier debate. I
cannot remember whether it was reported to the House or whether it just
withered on the vine. I do not know whether the Minister has anything
further to add to our exchanges on the tax profile of recipients. If he
does, perhaps he can do that this
afternoon.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13111258000270" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000270">1.

discussed the defective regulations in July, the Minister announced
that the Treasury had plans to accelerate the payments to the current
financial year rather than 2014-15, and I think that it has been
confirmed that that is still the plan today. For the most part, it is
planned that the payment will be automatic, but there are circumstances
in which an individual will have to apply, including when payment has
not been received by 5 April 2014 and when a person is entitled to
pension credit. However, it would seem that an application has to be
made by 5 July 2014. What is the position if that deadline is missed?
If, through no fault of the annuitant, payment is not made before 5
April, and an application by that annuitant is not made before the
deadline, does entitlement cease? If that is a Treasury or Prudential
mistake, it would seem a little harsh. Is there anything to stop the
Treasury making payments after April 2014 without an application? How
are those application requirements to be communicated to potential
recipients, especially those overseas? The Minister mentioned a letter
going to everyone in September, which is to be supported, but what will
be the follow-up to that, if
anything?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000108">Incidentally,
paragraph 7.6 of the Explanatory Memorandum says that payments will be
made in the financial year 2013-14 “or earlier if
possible”. Perhaps the Minister can tell us how it might be
possible to pay them earlier than the current financial
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000109">It would
seem that the administration of this payment scheme is to be separated
from the administration of the Equitable Life payment scheme, which is
just as well. Since we considered the earlier regulations, we have seen
a report from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee on the
administration of the Equitable Life scheme. The involvement of Atos,
which has been at the centre of a number of recent disasters, should
certainly set alarm bells ringing. Will the Minister take the
opportunity to comment on the 
<?notus-xml column=271?>recommendations made in that report, particularly around publicity for
closure of that scheme and the extent to which policy holders have been
traced? These have a potential read-across to the scheme that we are
considering today. Subject to that, we would not seek to resist the
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000110"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13111258000326" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000326"><B>Lord

Bates (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, these regulations are intended to
increase existing stake and prize limits for some, but not
all, categories of gaming machine. Gaming machines are an important
source of revenue for many sectors of the gambling and leisure
industries, and these measures will provide support for businesses
which continue to experience difficult trading
conditions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000117">The
challenges faced by individual sectors, including family entertainment
centres, bingo clubs and pubs, have had a marked effect on gaming
machine manufacturing and supply businesses. According to the Gambling
Commission, the total number of machines in the regulated industry fell
by around 10% between 2010 and 2012. The Government consulted earlier
this year on proposals to increase stake and prize limits for some
categories of gaming machine. The Government received many
representations in support of their proposals and remain confident that
increases will not risk the licensing objectives in the Gambling Act,
which rightly include the protection of children and vulnerable adults
from being harmed or exploited by gambling. In fact, the Government
have secured commitments from the gambling industry to develop, trial
and implement strengthened player protection measures to help to build
and maintain the public confidence necessary to accommodate the
increased stake and prize limits. Such measures are particularly
relevant to the casino industry, where gaming machines offer
significantly higher prizes than other sectors of the
industry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000118">Increases
to stake and prize limits vary depending on the category of machine and
the premises in which they are located. The level of increase is
highest in casinos, which represent an appropriate venue for high stake
and prize gambling given the stringent regulatory controls they are
required to uphold. The new limits provide greater consistency with the
level of gambling that is expected to take place in a casino and will
stimulate capital investment in the industry, allowing it to compete
more effectively internationally.</hs_para>

clubs and pubs, the level of increase is lower. The Government are
persuaded that these increases will provide support to businesses while
remaining consistent with the licensing objectives. The Government
propose to maintain stake and prize limits for all types of machine
found in seaside arcades and travelling fairs, with the exception of
penny-fall machines, where a small increase is proposed. This will
minimise any potential risk to public protection from gaming machines

children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000120">These

although it is an important growth measure for many struggling

Jones of Whitchurch (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the
Minister for his explanation of the changes. I am also extremely
grateful to the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee, which has
taken such an interest in these proposals and raised many of the
questions that I might otherwise have
asked.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000124">First,
I make clear that I welcome the decision to have a triennial review. It
is obviously useful to keep stakes and prizes under review in a
structured and timely manner, so that is a useful
development.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13111258000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000125">Secondly, however, I
share the concern of many who responded to the consultation, as well as
the Scrutiny Committee, that the research evidence on the effects of
those forms of gambling on poverty and addiction is so sparse. Given
that we are dealing with important aspects of social policy, it is not
good enough to argue that because something is unproven, we should
carry on as before. Surely, the onus should be on the industry to prove
that there is no causal link between the use of gambling machines and
addiction before asking us to increase the stakes, and therefore their
profits. Is the Minister happy that sufficient research is taking
place? If not, what further steps do the Government have in mind to
deliver substantive and compelling evidence on these issues? Thirdly, I
believe that it is important to have a wider cost-benefit analysis on
the impact of those changes than simply measuring the economic
advantages of jobs in the
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000126">In
answer to a question by the Scrutiny Committee on the potential public
sector impact on young and vulnerable people who are harmed by
gambling, the Government replied that public protection will be secured
if the industry delivers on its social responsibility and player
protection commitments. However, it is not clear what mechanisms the
Government have in place to secure those commitments from the sector.
Surely, the evidence so far is of an industry reluctant to act against
its own interests in maximising player participation and therefore
potential profits. What levers do the Government intend to use to hold
the industry to account on social responsibility and player
protection?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000127">Turning
to the specific proposals in the regulations, I first ask the Minister
about the increased stakes proposed for category D coin-pusher or
penny-fall machines. I accept that the increase is small and that the
impact may be minimal, but what justification is there for encouraging
children and young people to gamble at an early age, given the
acknowledged link between early gambling and problem gambling later? In
reply to the Scrutiny Committee, the Government say that coin-pushers
are generally played for amusement and are provided in a family
environment. Although that may be true, is it not also true that those
machines 
<?notus-xml column=274?>are usually sited next to other gambling machines that children might
then also be tempted to play? A renewed attraction to those relatively
small-scale machines cannot be seen in isolation if it is encouraging a
more general gambling habit. Why is it necessary to take an added risk
when there is a known connection between early gambling and problem
gambling?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000128">Finally,
I would like to discuss the major concerns over B2 fixed-odds betting
terminals. The Minister will know that there is increasing evidence of
the harm that those machines are having on individuals and local
communities through the proliferation of high-street betting shops,
which are increasingly reliant on the profit from those machines. These
machines are the source of some of the worst examples of gambling
addiction. It is possible to lose up to £100 every 20
seconds, which is £18,000 an hour. The speed of play is faster
than a roulette table, and it can happen without any staff contact or
intervention. Meanwhile bookmakers containing these machines are being
clustered in some of the poorest high streets in Britain, and local
authorities have limited control over their expansion as in planning
law they are classified in the same class as banks and building
societies.</hs_para>

Minister aware that last month the Prime Minister pledged to
investigate whether these high-stakes machines should be banned from
betting shops? Does he accept that a triennial review is exactly the
right time to review this policy, or will we have to wait another three
years for action to be taken? Is it the case that the triennial review
can put stakes and prizes down as well as up and therefore this should
be the opportunity to get a grip on this addictive gambling by reducing
the sums of money involved, or even banning them? Why are we not using
this regulation to make changes to B2 use? Does he accept that as well
as reducing the stakes and prizes, gaming machines could be required to
include a pop-up warning of the length of time played and the amount
spent as well as to lengthen the time between plays to allow players
time to reflect on the amounts they are staking? Does the Minister
accept the argument that continuous play could be broken up by
requiring players to load money on to the machines via interactions
with staff, which would allow staff members to monitor and potentially
counsel against any perceived addictive behaviour? Is he prepared to
consult his colleagues in DCLG to see whether planning law could be
changed to place betting shops in their own class of use, thereby
giving local communities more control over their
proliferation?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000130">These
are really important issues, and it feels that this review is a missed
opportunity to get a grip on machines that are highly addictive and
lead to an increase in crime and poverty. I do not feel that it is
sufficient to sit back and wait for the industry to act, and I hope the
Minister is able to persuade me this afternoon that the Government are
on the case and prepared to change the rules, if not in these
regulations, then before the next
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000131"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Moynihan" PimsId="2024" UID="13111258000333" xid="1353" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000333">Lord
Moynihan (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome this order and echo
many of the concerns mentioned by the noble Baroness with regard to the
social protections 
<?notus-xml column=275?>we need to have in place for young and vulnerable people. But this is a
regulated sector in which job losses, business closures and competition
with jurisdiction overseas are to be found on virtually every page of
the Explanatory Memorandum. Two hundred and ninety arcades have closed
since 2009-10, with 900 jobs lost. These arcades are part of the
character of so many of our traditional seaside resorts, and we should
do everything we can to keep them
competitive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000132">My
principal reason for intervening on this order is because of the
importance of consultation with sports clubs, which are mentioned in
this document. I hope that sports clubs have welcomed this order, and I
will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on that
subject. Sports clubs’ major task is to retain members and
increase participation. Substantial investment is needed in sports
clubs so that they stay competitive and attractive, whether by
floodlighting their premises, segregating their changing rooms or
upgrading their facilities—three items on which the noble
Baroness, Lady Billingham, has always been eloquent and occasionally
vociferous. Today, I am sure she will agree with me that licensed
gaming machines, properly controlled, are an important source of income
for some of our sports clubs, and we need to provide interest in those
machines and demand for them from the membership. For that reason, it
is important for sports club to view this order, see the changes that
are being made and, I hope, welcome them. As I understand it, sports
club machines come in category B4, or possibly B3A—the Minister
will correct me if I am wrong. The proposal is to increase the minimum
stake from £1 to £2 for those machines, and potentially
the prize money from £250 to a maximum £400, to make it
more attractive to players and, in turn, to generate more income for
the sports
clubs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000133">The
noble Baroness rightly mentioned, and I echo her comments, due social
protections should be put in place, with proper regulation in the clubs
and protection of young and vulnerable people. With that, it would be
right to support the order and recognise that both sport and sports
clubs will benefit, in a difficult economic environment. Ultimately, I
hope that we will see the goals that many of us who will participate in
the next debate, albeit briefly, will want to see on the
record—namely, an increase in participation in sport in this
country, which can best be delivered by the clubs, which are there in
the interests of their
membership.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_12_PT_1/038EA8E0D73A5C61D449299A76329343F7483EA5" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 November 2013">Tuesday,

spoken, who have in many ways captured the extent of the

and other commercial enterprises around the country and, at the same

noble Baroness, Lady Jones, asked a number of specific questions, and I
want to give them an appropriate response as best as I am able. But to
respond quickly to my noble friend Lord Moynihan, who talked about the
importance of gaming machines as a revenue stream for sports clubs and
other private members’ clubs, that is correct. In the category
of machines that will be found there are the B4 machines to which he
referred, as well as the B3A and C machines. The clubs 
<?notus-xml column=276?>observe the Gambling Commission’s guidance and codes of practice
to ensure effective social responsibility arrangements are in

noble Baroness asked about research into the effects of gambling. I
reassure her that work is already under way to advance our
understanding about gaming machines and their impact. The Responsible
Gambling Strategy Board, an independent expert advisory body, is
working to develop a strategy which will review the impact of
regulatory change and any associated changes in gambling behaviour,
while the Responsible Gambling Trust is carrying out research which
aims to better understand how people behave when playing gaming
machines and what will help people to play responsibly. Again, in the
context of this, it is important to realise that one reason for the
decline is the growth of online gambling, which has no regulation or
supervision at all. So drawing people to enjoying this form of leisure
in a reasonable way in regulated areas would seem to help towards that.
The work being carried out will further our understanding of the social
impact of regulatory change and allow for the wider cost-benefit
analysis on the impact of these changes to which the noble Baroness

strengthening player protections, the Government have consulted
extensively and invited representations about research as part of the
review. I should say to my noble friend Lord Moynihan that there were
many representations and responses to the consultation received from
sports clubs to this, and they were broadly in favour of the measures
being put forward for the reasons that he has outlined. The Government
have received advice from the Gambling Commission and the Responsible
Gambling Strategy Board, and there is scope to increase the stake and
prize limits for some categories of gaming machine, provided that the
industry makes progress in strengthening player protection. It has twin
sides; as the industry gets better at providing protection, it may be
possible to consider further changes to the limits. That is the right
way in which to
proceed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:39:39"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:39:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000139">The
noble Baroness, Lady Jones, referred to the risks to children,
particularly from the increases in stake and prize limits to penny
falls and coin pushers. The Government share the view that a cautious
approach should be taken to products accessible by children. It is for
these reasons that the Government have rejected the proposals from the
industry to increase the stake and prize limits for reel-based gaming
machines accessible to children and all other category D machines, with
the exception of coin
pushers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:40:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000140">The
noble Baroness also referred to fixed-odds betting terminals, the
so-called category B2 gaming machines. As part of the review, the
Government sought quantifiable evidence on the impact of a reduction in
stake and prize limits for these machines. However, the
evidence  
<?notus-xml column=277?>received was inconclusive and the Government have been advised by the
Gambling Commission and the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board that a
precautionary reduction in stake and prize limits is currently
unsupported by the available evidence. Despite this, the Government
remain concerned about these machines and their potential association
with an elevated risk of gambling-related harm. The Government have
therefore made it clear that they will consider the future of the B2
machine to be unresolved. As the noble Baroness noted, the Prime
Minister confirmed the Government’s commitment to monitor these
machines to ensure a fair and decent approach that prevents problem
gambling, and that is exactly the course of action that the Government
are taking

to the £18,000 per hour loss rate sometimes cited for B2
machines, this is astronomically improbable, one might say. It is an
extreme calculation. However, the Government have acknowledged that it
is quite possible to lose or win several thousand pounds within an hour
within a normal range of behaviour on a machine. It is for these
reasons that the measures I have outlined are so important and why the
Government consider the future of these machines to be
unresolved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T13:41:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000142">On

I do not define sport as simply competitive sport, although that is
important. Sport is also about health-related fitness, which may
include walking, cycling, gym work, swimming, dance, yoga, pilates and
so on. Secondly, I do not wish to confine my remarks and concerns to
school sport, although I do have concerns about that. Sporting chances
in the inner city may be provided by outreach from clubs who play rugby
and soccer, for example, and in communities where dedicated parents and
other adults encourage young people to do sport. There is good evidence
that an active lifestyle can improve academic performance and health,
and that working in a group or team can foster co-operative learning
and endeavour. There is also good evidence that taking part in sport
can help to cut down crime and fight negative, anti-social
behaviour.</hs_para>

school sport, which is where many children begin to take part in
sports, particularly those from the inner cities. To have opportunities
to deliver sports programmes there must be a structure, particularly in
the inner cities. Will this Government restore fully the school sports
partnerships structure? I am aware that David Cameron has promised
£150 million to cover all of England’s 17,000
primary schools, which is about £8,823 a year each. Why was this
money not used to guarantee the school sports partnerships, which
worked so well at a cost of £162 million a year?
Those partnerships were developed under a Labour Government to rebuild
sport in state schools. That £162 million funded specialist
schools sport co-ordinators for two days a week and there were 450 such
partnerships, reaching across all schools. 
<?notus-xml column=279?>The results were that, in 2009-10, more than 90% of pupils had two hours
of PE a week and that 78% took part in competitive sport.</hs_para>

a national strategy with links to communities, health boards and the
media, I fear that inner-city sport will be at risk for schools and
their children. Not only will we be deprived of possible star sportsmen
and women, but young people’s health and well-being will suffer.
What is the Government’s strategy for young people and sport? Of
course, there are initiatives. One of my favourites for many years has
been the English cricket board’s Chance to Shine. I should
declare an interest as a Lady Taverner, like my friend across the Room,
the noble Baroness, Lady Heyhoe Flint, who, I hope, will build on what
I have to say. Chance to Shine works in a strategic way with all
39 county cricket boards to deliver coaching to boys and
girls in inner-city schools, not on vast playing fields but in school
playgrounds and halls. In 2005, fewer than 10% of state schools played
any form of cricket. Since then, Chance to Shine’s initial
target of reaching 2 million children in 6,500 schools has been
achieved. That is extraordinary. The programme has had structure,
dedicated staff and evaluation effectiveness. As I have said already,
structure and knowing what works is
vital.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111262000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111262000008">Chance
to Shine has extended its inner-city StreetChance programme, funded by
Sport England, to enable 11,000 16 to 24 year-olds in deprived areas to
take part in weekly community cricket over the next three years. That
includes the project Girls on the Front Foot, to empower girls through
cricket. It is important that, in addition to cricket, Chance to Shine
workshops also discuss with young people the dangers of gangs, gun and
knife crime and drug and alcohol abuse. Fifty-four per cent of
participants say that their attitude towards the police has changed for
the better; and 64% say that the project helped them to avoid getting
involved in local gangs. That is sport influencing and empowering
behaviour in a dramatic
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111262000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111262000009">Let me
mention one or two other initiatives. Noble Lords may recently have
seen news of the Ebony Horse Club in Brixton in south London, opened in
2011 by the Duchess of Cornwall. The Duchess and the Queen visited very

community riding club for 160 inner-city children a week, including
those with special needs and disabilities. It offers, as 
<?notus-xml column=280?>well as access to working with horses, mentoring for children with
challenges at home and school. It has nine horses, a paddock and
classroom facilities for horse care classes and group work. Again, that
is an example of sport going beyond the aim of fitness. The programme

work
collaboratively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111262000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111262000010">Sport

economic pressure is applied to local authority spending, discretionary
spend will always be the first to be squeezed. In England, sport and
recreation provision is discretionary spend. We should not forget that
local authorities have historically been the largest source of funding
for sport and recreation in this country. In educational terms; in
aiding the fight against obesity; in providing the only language
understood by some of our young people, who find the constraints of the
classroom difficult to grasp and would find themselves on an escalator
to crime without the medium of sport; in learning teamwork; in
realising the opportunity of a growing, multi-billion pound industry
with new media and global social networking access—in all these
areas many of these benefits will wither on the vine, because of
necessary local authority cost savings, unless discretionary spend
becomes mandatory. With these cuts, and the loss of playing fields and

seconds available to us, it is difficult to add much to this debate,
other than to say, like my noble friend Lord Moynihan, that when you
ask government to get involved in this you are asking all of government
to get involved, and to reorganise in a way that government seems to
find extremely difficult to do. Under any colour we have seen so far in
government, departments do not like to co-operate. Simply to make a
change that will help the country’s youth to take part in sport,
you have to cover half of Whitehall. I was just doodling here and have
written down Health, Education, DCMS and Ministry of Justice; all these

do not like the use of the term “non-competitive”,

record the scores on a board that sits there forever, or in a pile of
books that become dusty, along 
<?notus-xml column=282?>with photographs of people with—shall we say—outmoded
haircuts and unfashionable shorts, the essence of what is happening is
competition. The idea that you get a ball past somebody or move it into

that people can come in, try it and get accustomed to it has to be done
in conjunction with government and, as my noble friend has already
said, local government. Leaving this to a voluntary choice is bound to
leave it squeezed whenever times are at all hard or whenever you get
somebody who simply does not regard sport as a top priority. My noble
friend is, of course, right. Unless government takes on the
responsibility for encouraging people to access the great amount of
voluntary help outside and co-ordinate across the entirety of it, sport
will ultimately always have these peaks and troughs. Our challenge is
to make sure that when times are bad progress is not lost and that we
do slightly better than stand still. That is effectively all we can
hope for—to make it very difficult for somebody to say,
“No, that is not important”, because every time you do,

Billingham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady
Massey for initiating this debate and asking what steps Her
Majesty’s Government are taking to encourage children from inner
cities to take up sports. The short answer is that the steps are
backwards and miserably ineffective. It could have been so different.
From 2010, the coalition and Michael Gove, in particular, have
systematically demolished school sport, which is at the heart of how
and why children eventually love sport. From primary schools to
opportunities in communities, the Government have a crucial role to
play, and they have failed. They inherited a primary school system
which, for the first time, put PE centre stage. School sports
partnerships were an inspired and positive innovation. With qualified
staff and good ring-fenced funding, our children were at last given
proper grass-roots sports education in all our primary schools. As one
of its first actions, the coalition demolished that successful formula.
Only public outcry forced the Government into a U-turn, but one that
provided a very poor substitute for what they destroyed. Why they took
these actions is beyond all of us who see PE as an important right in
schools and the basis of future sports participation.</hs_para>

transformed public opinion, which became pro sport for all as never
before. Young and old and people with disabilities were inspired.
Volunteers came out in their thousands, and communities, including
those in inner city areas, demanded a renaissance. It never came. The
Government missed the favourable tide, held back from positive
initiatives and failed the unique opportunities that they were given.
They also failed to encourage the governing bodies of sport, many of
which are doing excellent work in grass-roots sport. They could have
had much greater public encouragement and better funding. The
volunteers 
<?notus-xml column=283?>were left wondering what the future held, yet they are the backbone of
sport in every club in the country. Where is the volunteers charter

a priority for them. An obvious key component of sports facilities is
to be found in our public parks. Virtually every sport can be catered
for, and at relatively low cost. We already have Tennis For Free, an
outstanding charity, successfully staffed by volunteers, which works in
local parks. Young and old can be helped to take up that sport, and the
same could be said of dozens of other sports which need open space
close to home. There has been nothing from this Government for this
valuable resource.</hs_para>

Government are making a promising start. My noble friend Lord Coe has a
10-year programme for developing the legacy. You cannot just push a
switch and hope that, by a miracle, everything is a box of birds, as
they say. Many national governing bodies of sport are developing
inner-city projects with government funding. They would not be able to
do so without it. We have heard about the wonderful “Chance to
Shine” programme involving 2 million schoolchildren and linking
schools to local clubs. There is government funding within that
project<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T14:09:43"></hs_TimeCode>. The
ECB—not the European Central Bank but the England and Wales
Cricket Board—has two other inner-city programmes funded by the
England and Wales Cricket Trust, the Government and the Lord’s
Taverners and Lady Taverners. The south Asia programme for inner cities
was funded for four years through Sport England’s whole sport
plan, while the cricket foundation StreetChance works in socially
deprived inner-city areas. These all have some

target some of the most disadvantaged areas in the country by engaging
youngsters of seven to 11 years old, with Sport England, the
Metropolitan Police and Premier League clubs committing £9

children being bored stiff, with few places to go or opportunities for
letting off steam, particularly for those living in inner-city
communities with peers whose woeful influence they may not be able to
avoid. Idle hands are not good news.</hs_para>

from what the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, said—that there was a
decrease in the number of children and young people who had been
motivated to do more sport—there was an increase. More than
4,000 days had been given by athletes themselves to community and
school sport since London 2012. Also, funded athletes will be required
to give five days a year—I hope that that is the least that they
will give—to inspire children to get involved in sport. It is

this field of experts and thank my noble friend Lady Massey for
enabling us to discuss this. There is a desperate need to engage women
and girls in sport. I am not at all convinced that the Olympic legacy
has fulfilled its obligation to women and girls—in particular,
those from minority backgrounds. I specifically draw your
Lordships’ attention to the low number of Muslim young girls and
women taking part in sports and physical activities. Obesity and heart
disease are causing concern. It is time that we addressed the issue of

grew up in Bangladesh, played cricket and badminton and climbed trees
in a mixed environment. I may be latching onto a bygone era or I was
just lucky that I grew up in a family where women and girls were not
restrained in the name of culture or faith. On the point about role
models, the Bangladesh women’s cricket team has already achieved
one-day status<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T14:17:11"></hs_TimeCode>.
That appears not to be the norm here in the UK, even for the second and
third generation of our young women and girls. One piece of research
shows that Muslim 
<?notus-xml column=287?>girls in the UK are more sceptical and reluctant about participating in
sports than girls in traditional Muslim countries. It is revealing that
Muslim girls in the UK appear to be more unwilling and more negative
towards engaging in sports to the extent that a significant number will
skip sports lessons.</hs_para>

barriers to their participation.

Governments influence behaviour change? This is a very difficult and to
some extent intractable problem wrapped up in our lifestyles. We know
why this epidemic of obesity is happening. It is because we are
sedentary, we eat far too many high-energy foods and drinks and there
are computers and games boxes. All those things contrive to make us
very much more sedentary, and our jobs are not as manual as they

noble friend referred to a marathon, and it is certainly a marathon we
are talking about here if we are trying to change people’s
lifestyle. We are trying to participate in partnership with any number
of organisations. Of course the Government are one, but there are youth
clubs, schools and parents. Parents are the key. Once you get parents
on side and get them to take seriously and insist on opportunities,
whether in school or youth clubs, you will get traction and momentum.
That is why when we looked at all the nudges and prods in the behaviour
report, we recognised that although labelling would play an important
part and any number of other nudges would be significant, ultimately,
if you want to change our attitude to sport, you start in the primary
school, get parents involved and make sure that we all change our
attitude to what is an acceptable lifestyle, not just for children but
for adults as well. I commend those schools which have drawn attention
in their policies to how they involve parents in promoting sport. When
Ofsted takes the more rigorous approach which we are promised it will
take, I am sure that this should be a very strong criterion on which
everything should be judged. Partnerships are important. I do not think
any one partnership or strategy is going to resolve this problem, but

Northbourne (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall take just one moment
to draw attention to the importance that sport can have for
disadvantaged children. I can probably do this best with a very small
story. Once, I was sitting with a very wise and experience head teacher
at a school near Eastbourne for children with emotional and behavioural
difficulties and I asked him, “How do you make contact with a
new boy when he arrives?”. He said, “I sit him down in my
study and I say ‘Tell me about yourself’, and the boy
starts and tells me all the awful things he’s done and all the
things he can’t do and how naughty he’s been, that he
doesn’t have any hope and so on. This usually goes on for about
half an hour, sometimes three-quarters of an hour. Eventually, when he
dries up, I say, ‘Right. Now you’ve told me all the
things you can’t do. Let’s talk about the things you can
do’”.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_12_PT_1/8C080391B149375A4C0A5FCC55BFA6513A1256D5" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 November 2013">Tuesday,

Jones of Whitchurch (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank very much my
noble friend Lady Massey for introducing what has been an authoritative
and very 
<?notus-xml column=289?>well informed debate. I also pay tribute to the House for establishing
the Olympic and Paralympic Legacy Select Committee, which has enabled a
powerful  body of knowledge and analysis to be assembled. I
very much look forward to debating its report in due course.</hs_para>

such an august list of contributors is that I cover both education and
DCMS from the Front Bench. I therefore know quite a bit about what has
been happening in schools since this Government came to power. As I am
sure we would all acknowledge, quality schools sport is essential in
addressing the participation of inner-city children, so in the short
time that I have I would like to make a few points about
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000205">Let us
face it: it has not been a very happy story. It seems that the
Secretary of State took the view that any initiative introduced by the
previous Government must, by its very origins, be flawed and should
therefore be scrapped. This was not the only initiative to have
suffered that fate but, as a number of noble Lords have said, one of
the starkest examples of this approach was what happened to school
sport. Funding for the well established and well respected school
sports partnerships was withdrawn, only to be partially reinstated
following massive protests but with nothing like the original coverage
and co-ordination, while the target of every child doing at least two
hours of PE a week was withdrawn. The latest research now shows that
half of children failed to do at least two hours of PE a week and that
one in seven teenagers did no sport at all in their last year of
school. Meanwhile, as we have heard, Michael Gove is continuing to
allow the sell-off of school sports fields, with 50 sold so far,
despite pledging to protect them in the coalition
agreement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000206">A
recent report by the Commons Education Select Committee—chaired,
incidentally, by a Conservative MP—reported that PE lessons are
still not good enough in almost one-third of primary schools. It also
identified that the Government’s new obsession with children
taking part in competitive team sports, such as football, rugby or
netball, was deterring many young people, particularly girls, taking
part in sport at all. That committee concluded that the Government
should reintroduce the target, scrapped by Michael Gove, requiring all
pupils to complete two hours of PE a week. It also called for targeted
measures for girls. As I say, it has not been a happy story in schools
and it feels very much as if there have been three wasted years of
dithering in school sport policy over the crucial Olympic period.
Obviously, in this respect I welcome the announcement made earlier this
year of new primary sport funding for coaches, but that is short-term
money and is in place for only two years, and
therefore risks failing to embed the training culture in the
school.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111258000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000207">It
feels as if we have had a realistic but rather depressing debate this
afternoon. I think we are all united in wanting sport to be a more
central part of young people’s lives so I hope that the Minister
is able to convince us that, belatedly, if nothing else, a credible
school sports strategy is being developed that will encourage all young
people to enjoy and maintain an active sporting life while going into
adulthood.</hs_para>

Bates (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a very well informed
debate and I will do my very best to convince the noble Baroness, Lady
Jones, about the Government’s policy on sport. It has been a
very high quality debate and I was thinking, as we were going through
it, that there is probably sufficient talent within this very Room to
start a House of Lords ladies cricket team, which would be quite a
strong team at that.</hs_para>

expertise and knowledge, which was particularly evident in the way that
the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, introduced the debate. There was great
passion and concern for the subject of sport in school, to which I
think people on all sides of this Committee are totally signed up. What
we are arguing about is purely the best way of achieving the ends that
we are all agreed on, and those ends are focused on ensuring that
people engage in sport beyond their school age. That is the objective
which we are aiming for. We know that the earlier people start, the
more likely they are to do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000210">The
movement towards competitive sport is not a thought or a passion based
on ideology: it is simply that our sporting clubs in the United Kingdom
are primarily competitive sporting clubs, as the noble Lord, Lord
Addington, said, and, therefore, if we want people to take part in
sport in later life, then probably it will be through competitive
sport.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000211">There
are two elements to this: the first is to go younger and younger to
reach people and inspire them to take part in sporting activity from a
young age; and then, secondly, to introduce them to competitive sport,
which will enable them to link up with sporting clubs and continue that
activity into later
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000212">With

turn, first, to the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, who
introduced the debate and referred to school sports partnerships. The
Government recognise that these were introduced with the objective of
increasing participation and that in a number of areas there were some
successful partnerships. However, the wider view was taken that they
were too bureaucratic, too top down and too expensive and were not
delivering the results we all sought. Therefore we decided to
distribute that additional funding at school level—and to focus
it particularly on primary schools through the primary school
premium—so that each school will receive
£8,000.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13111258000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000214">It was often felt that
some school sports partnerships were too large. Some of them worked
but, where you were talking about eight secondary schools and
40 primary schools linking up with an FE college, sometimes
it was difficult to get a sense of where things were tailored to a
particular school. The argument we put forward is that focusing on
individual schools—not only by writing a cheque but by ensuring
that the money is ring-fenced specifically for sport and by ensuring
that Ofsted has a responsibility from September 2013 to assess how
schools are doing in spending that money—is an important
part.</hs_para>

Massey, referred to the need for a strategy. I understand her argument
and where she is coming from but, as so many different organisations
are involved in this, the fear is that people are getting lost in the
gaps. I commend to her the Sport England youth and community sports
strategy which seeks to bring together the sporting clubs and schools.
This is not only backed by a strategy but by £1 billion, which
can make a real
difference.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000216">I
took the point of my noble friend Lord Moynihan—who of course
has immense expertise and knowledge in this area, particularly in
protecting the legacy of the Olympics—when he rightly said that
no school is an island. However, the school sports partnerships were
not abolished and it is still possible for individual schools to come
together if that is how they choose to spend their money.</hs_para>

mentioned the Get Set and Plan Your Legacy schemes. Get Set was a great
way of involving more than 22,000 schools in the Olympics and Plan Your
Legacy is a key part of ensuring that the progress that was made and
the inspirational performances that we saw in both the Olympics and
Paralympics are not
lost.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000218">The
noble Lord, Lord Addington, spoke about competitive sports, and this
is, like rugby, something about which he knows a great deal. We both
participated in the winning team—a rare winning team—in
the House of Lords versus House of Commons tug-of-war match on the only
time the House of Lords has actually won. He reminded us about
competitive sports. So this is not an ideological obsession, it is
simply trying to link together the satellite clubs—the sporting
clubs—with what is going on in schools.</hs_para>

School Games have transformed competitive sport in schools. More than
60% of schools are taking part in the School Games, offering every
pupil, regardless of ability or disability, more chances to compete in
sport, not only intra-school but also between schools and at county
festivals. More than 100,000 young people took part, 10,000 of whom
were children with disabilities. The national finals were held in
Sheffield, and next year they will be in Manchester. That is an example
of what we are doing in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000220" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000220">The
noble Baroness, Lady Billingham, spoke with immense passion and
knowledge. I know that as a distinguished spokesperson on this issue,
and with her involvement in various tennis organisations, she is
frustrated about school sports partnerships. I want to reassure her,
however, that this is not lost; it is part of a wider strategy. The
money is still going into schools. It is going in at a younger age and
it is being monitored. There are moves to bring in more sports clubs to
link with schools. Another concern she has is over the quality of
physical education teaching, particularly in primary schools. Secondary
schools have that, and that is why we are now funding extra places for
teachers to train in physical education particularly for primary
schools.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111258000221" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000221">The
noble Lord, Lord Krebs, spoke about the health benefits of sport. I
think we are all broadly agreed on that. I noticed a survey by the
Young Foundation which identified the health risks to the nation. It
found 
<?notus-xml column=292?>that while 20% of people were vulnerable to smoking, 61% to 70% were
vulnerable to inactivity, so it is a very substantial
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000222">I
know that there was some disagreement between the noble Lord, Lord
Krebs, and my noble friend Lady Hanham over the figures. There was a
slight decrease in overall activity from the 2008-09 baseline, from 91%
to 88%, but there was a significant increase in some sports, notably
cricket, dodgeball and rounders. We are committed to doing more to
promote this through the School
Games.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000223">The
noble Baroness, Lady Heyhoe Flint, reminisced interestingly about her
cricket career against the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, and talked very
positively about what is being done in schools. The Government believe
in the value of sport, and £500,000 has been put in place to
continue the legacy of the Olympic Games. Furthermore, physical
education remains an essential part of the national
curriculum.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000224" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000224">The
noble Baroness talked about particular schemes, and I was particularly
struck by many of the contributions, including that of my noble friend
Lady Hanham, who referred to the role of parents and volunteers in
delivering much of our sport around the country. It is important that
they continue to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000225">My noble
friend Lady Hanham referred to the competition between competitive
sport and computer games. Let me pay tribute to her. During her time as
Minister she did something substantial, which was to block the pathway
to the selling off of playing fields. I do not wish to make any
party-political points on this but under the previous Government
playing fields were sold off at a rate of 28 per year, and the rate has
fallen to 16 per year. Now, because an application goes directly to the
Secretary of State for Education, the only way that you can sell a
playing field is if you can show that all the proceeds of that sale are
going to go into new sporting facilities with other schools. That has
been done, and it is
welcome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000226">I
shall comment briefly on what the noble Baroness, Lady Uddin, said. I
was fascinated by her example of the London Tigers and I certainly want
to learn more about them. She talked about the importance of
encouraging girls into sport. There has been a growth in the number of
girls-only sporting clubs. One hundred of these clubs have started up
and an extra £1.7 million is going into them to
promote more opportunities for females. The noble Baroness is
absolutely right to say that we need to address that issue in
particular and I am grateful to her for raising it.</hs_para>

Selborne referred to behaviour change. This is a critical area where we
need to look more at how we change behaviour without legislating for
it. We have enough legislation and regulation on the books already. As
he said, it is critical that we inspire parents. Again, that speaks to
the importance of getting sport into primary schools to do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000228">I
particularly enjoyed the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord
Northbourne. It was brief, succinct and to the point and reminded us
that, in an age of pessimism, we have to focus on the positives.
Certainly the optimistic nature of sport teaches us always to think
about the future with optimism. That is something that I
have  
<?notus-xml column=293?>had to learn through nearly 50 years of following Newcastle United
Football Club. I am still struggling with it although we did slightly
better last

I come to the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch. She spoke, of
course, very passionately. She is concerned that we get this right. She
talked particularly about the two hours minimum of physical education.
It is important to recognise that it was never enforced or mandatory;
that it was always aspirational. It will now be covered by Ofsted and
primary school teachers will be encouraged to provide 
<?notus-xml column=294?>quality as well as quantity of sport, and to enhance that through the
school sport premium and the youth and community sport
initiatives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111258000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-gc0001.htm#13111258000230">I

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe) (Con):</Member></B> My Rt hon Friend the Secretary for Health
(Jeremy Hunt) has made the following written ministerial statement.
Today the Government has laid before Parliament the refreshed Mandate
to NHS England for 2014-15. The refreshed Mandate will come into effect
from 1 April 2014 and was developed following public consultation which
ran from 5 July to 27
September.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111253000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112-wms0001.htm#13111253000023">The
Mandate sets an ambitious agenda to transform patient care and we
expect NHS England to demonstrate significant progress against all the
objectives by March 2015. To provide stability and enable the NHS to
plan ahead, we have carried forward all existing 24 objectives. The
Government has kept changes to an essential minimum to ensure the
refreshed Mandate remains strategic, outcomes-focused and affordable
within NHS England’s budget which is also set out in the Mandate
for 2014-15.</hs_para>

has introduced changes, these focus on the priorities that will support
the successful transformation of health and care services to meet the
needs of an ageing population and the increasing prevalence of
long-term physical and mental health
conditions:</hs_para><hs_WAIndent>- the vulnerable older
people’s plan as a means for improving the health of the whole
population and to provide excellent care for older
people;</hs_WAIndent> <hs_WAIndent>- the addition of one new objective

recommendations; and</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>- taking forward actions

Government has included further ambitions on a limited number of areas
to deliver the quality of care and treatment people need and expect.
These areas are: reducing avoidable premature mortality; 
<?notus-xml column=40?>supporting people with dementia; improving patient experience (friends
and family test); and making better use of

the Mandate sets our vision over the long term, we also need to tackle
immediate pressures. The Government previously announced its plans to
handle pressures on A&amp;E this winter and the allocation of
£250 million funding to NHS England for distribution to the
areas that need it most. The additional allocation requires an increase
to the revenue budget for NHS England for 2013-14, and a revision to
the current Mandate for the current will been laid before Parliament
shortly reflecting this uplift in the budget only.</hs_para>

scientists report that glacial ice is being lost from several parts of
the Antarctic Ice Sheet, notably the Antarctic Peninsula and the
Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica. Loss from the Antarctic
Peninsula is probably a result of atmospheric warming in this region
(see below), while loss from the Amundsen Sea sector is thought to be
caused by changes in the coastal sea into which it flows. In East
Antarctica, only a few areas of ice loss have been identified, and
elsewhere the ice is slowly thickening. Overall, however, the Antarctic
ice sheet is losing glacial ice and making a significant contribution
(0.20 to 0.62 mm per year, 2002-2011) to observed rates of global
sea-level rise which has been 2.8 to 3.6 mm per year, 1993-2010.
Scientific advice is that in the future, it is very unlikely that
increases in snowfall could outweigh the increases in ice loss, and
there is thus a high likelihood that the Antarctic contribution to
global sea-level rise will increase in future decades and
centuries.</hs_para>

the Arctic, over the 35 years for which satellite records
are available, the extent of the seasonal sea ice (frozen sea water)
floating in the seas around Antarctica has increased—2013 saw
the largest extent on record. More than one mechanism is thought to be
contributing to this observed increase. First, sea ice drifts under the
influence of near-surface winds, and there has been an increase in the
northerly winds blowing sea ice away from the Antarctic continent.
Second, these increased winds carry more cold air off the continent,
freezing more ice. Third, changes in the temperature and salinity of
the coastal seas around Antarctica may have altered sea-ice production.
The increase in Antarctic sea-ice extent (1.2 to 1.8% per decade,
1979-2012) is statistically significant, but is considerably less than
the corresponding decrease in the Arctic sea ice (3.5 to 4.1% per
decade, 1979-2012). It is unknown whether the small Antarctic increase
is simply the result of natural variability or results from
anthropogenic effects.</hs_para>

years, temperatures on parts of the Antarctic Peninsula have
increased faster than anywhere else in the Southern Hemisphere, and
possibly anywhere on Earth. Meteorological records from
Faraday/Vernadsky Station show a warming of over 3.3°C.
Temperature changes measured at climate stations in East Antarctica
have generally been much smaller in amplitude and in recent decades
some have shown a cooling trend. Several studies suggest that the
pattern of warming and cooling was driven by changes in atmospheric
circulation linked to the Antarctic ozone hole. A paucity of long-term
meteorological records from West Antarctica means that changes in this
region can only be inferred from statistical temperature
reconstructions, which are not as robust as those based on direct
measurements. Such studies do, however, suggest decadal warming in this
region, again strongly linked to wider patterns of atmospheric
circulation.</hs_para>

diverse changes in the temperature, sea ice and glacial ice across

does not seek to regulate the press in any way and cannot interfere
with what they choose to publish. However, as a voluntary system, the
choice to seek recognition, as well as to sign up to self-regulation,
lies with the industry, and I would encourage them to look at that. The

already had a beneficial effect on admissions to hospital attributable
to smoking. As part of a Department funded study assessing trends in
key health outcomes, an analysis of Hospital Episode Statistics was
conducted to explore the impact of smokefree legislation on admissions
for myocardial infarction (MI). The study examined emergency admissions
from July 2002 to September 2008 and so included 15 months of data from
the period after smokefree legislation was implemented. The study found
a statistically significant reduction of 2.4% in the number of
admissions for MI following the implementation of smokefree
legislation. This was equivalent to 1,200 fewer emergency admissions
for heart attacks in the first year following the implementation of the
legislation. This study is referenced in the academic review of the
evidence of the impact of smokefree legislation that was published
alongside the Government's <I>Tobacco Control Plan for England</I> in

Gardiner of Kimble (Con):</Member> Consumers are protected from
telephone cold calling through the Privacy and Electronic
Communications Regulations (PECR) 2003, which prohibits unsolicited
marketing calls to numbers registered with the Telephone Preference
Service (TPS), or if a recipient has previously advised the calling
company that further calls should not made. The TPS is a
free service and more than 19.3 million numbers are currently
registered with them. The Information Commissioner’s Office
(ICO) considers complaints about breaches of the PECR and can issue a
monetary penalty of up to £500,000 for the most serious
breaches.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13111264000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112w0001.htm#13111264000081">We
outlined our future plans in our strategy paper Connectivity, Content
and Consumers: Britain's digital platform for growth, which was
published on 30 July. This includes enabling Ofcom to share information
more easily with the ICO in relation to organisations that make
unsolicited marketing calls, so more effective action can be taken. We
are also continuing to work with industry and regulators to ensure
better enforcement to target those that break the rules. Other measures
include supporting efforts to enable calls to be traced where a caller
conceals or withholds their number and considering the scope to lower
the legal threshold, which needs to be met before the ICO can issue a
monetary penalty. Further information about our proposals is set out
at:</hs_para><hs_para UID="13111264000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131112w0001.htm#13111264000082">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/connectivity-content-and-consumers-britains-digital-platform-for-growth.</hs_para>

plan was published in July by ICO and the Office of Communications
(Ofcom), which identifies steps they are taking to improve guidance,
pursue on-going targeted enforcement and improve call and message
tracing processes to track down those responsible for making calls.
Ofcom will also be conducting a review of the effectiveness of
the TPS and further details are available at:

further action can be taken to tackle nuisance
