Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the situation in Syria
is worsening. There are more than 2 million refugees in neighbouring
countries, which is creating a growing regional crisis. The UK’s
total funding for Syria and the region is now £500
million, the largest total sum the UK has ever committed to a single
humanitarian crisis. This reflects the scale, despair and brutality of
the situation. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary regularly
raise the issue with their counterparts from Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon
and Iraq, the four countries where refugees are now mainly to be found,
and they will continue to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T15:14:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110668000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Selkirk of Douglas" PimsId="639" UID="13110668000217" xid="1427" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000217">Lord
Selkirk of Douglas (Con):</Member></B> The Minister’s statement
is extremely welcome. Does he accept that using aid in a country such
as Jordan—for example, to improve water supplies and sanitation
and to supplement the very hard-pressed health provision, education and
other basic services—undoubtedly helps to reduce both tension
and the increasing scope for friction between the refugees and the
often vulnerable local communities who have so generously welcomed
them?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110668000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000005"><hs_speaker><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13110668000218" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000218">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, we do understand
that. The sheer scale of the number of refugees now in Lebanon and
Jordan in particular is such that it has the full potential to
destabilise their societies and, therefore, their political systems. Of
the £500 million that we have so far committed, £167
million is going to the neighbouring countries of Lebanon, Jordan,
Turkey, and Iraq and, in addition to humanitarian aid, Britain is
providing more than £15 million to support stability in Lebanon
and Jordan, including support for their police and armed forces. The UK
also recently announced an additional £12 million of support for
Jordan, aimed at keeping essential public services
running.</hs_para>

Bach (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, in relation to Jordan and what the
noble Lord has asked about, the Jordanian Government need particular
help because a substantial number of refugees in Jordan are actually
with host families rather than in refugee camps. This means that the
Jordanian Government need more help because UNHCR aid is not as
forthcoming as it would be in refugee camps. The Jordanian Government
need more money in order that those refugees with host families are
adequately looked after, particularly—here I repeat what the
noble Lord who asked the Question said—with regard to drinking
water and the price of it. What special help, beyond what
the Minister has already stated, is to be given to Jordan itself
because of the particular difficulties that that country has at the
present time and because of what we owe to that country
ourselves?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110668000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13110668000220" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000220">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I have already announced
that the Government are giving specific aid to the Jordanians to
support a number of activities. We are well aware that drinking water
is a particular problem. As the noble Lord rightly points out,
a number of refugees in Lebanon and Turkey, as well as in
Jordan, are not in refugee camps but have been taken in by local
families. That is a good thing in many ways but it does of course
increase the strain on local
communities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110668000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon" PimsId="3804" UID="13110668000221" xid="1643" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000221">Lord
Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an
interest as the president of UNICEF UK and in that capacity I thank the
Government for their generosity, not just to UNICEF but also to many
other charities in helping with the terrible suffering of children, who
of course suffer most in these circumstances. The last case of polio in
Syria was 14 years ago, in 1999, but this terrible disease is now
taking hold, especially among the children of the refugee population.
In past conflicts it has been possible to arrange agreements for
immunisation between the warring parties. I wonder whether the
Government have pursued this matter with both the Syrian Government,
who seem perfectly prepared to do this, and the rebels. Are the
Government pursuing this
opportunity?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110668000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13110668000222" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000222">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, as my noble friend will be
aware, alongside the United Nations Security Council resolution on
chemical weapons there was a United Nations Security Council
presidential statement on humanitarian access. That has not yet been
fully accepted by the Syrian regime. There are many difficulties for
humanitarian agencies and their staff in getting visas to enter the
country and, as he rightly said, there are also difficulties in some of
the rebel-held areas.</hs_para>

Jordan and the refugee camps, I ask the Minister, bearing in mind that
there are in excess of 2.5 million Palestinian and Syrian refugees in
Jordan alone and thanking the Government for the money and resources
they are putting in, whether there is anything further that we can do
in terms of influencing the European Union and United Nations to
improve the situation, particularly of refugees seeking to get out of

points out that some of the refugees in Jordan are Palestinians who
were living in the huge refugee camp in Damascus, which I have visited
myself, and who have now been forced, for the second time, to move out
to Jordan. The United Kingdom has lobbied very hard for other countries
to step up to the mark. We have currently provided more bilateral
assistance than any other member state of the European Union. At the
last G20, we put pressure on other members to produce more funds and a
further £1 billion was pledged. The Russians have contributed
only a very tiny amount of humanitarian aid. The amount they have
contributed in arms to assist the regime is a great deal

Of course, it is not just a matter of relief; it is also a matter of
long-term investment in children—their education and their
health—because they are going to be displaced for a long time to
come. What are the Government doing to face up to the immense regional
political implications of what has happened in the sense that almost a
third of the population in Jordan will soon be refugees? That is
acutely destabilising, and it is the same story in Lebanon, with all
kinds of dangers for the future in terms of extremism, political
disruption and the rest. Can we promote international discussions about
how to have a positive pre-emptive regional approach towards the
long-term political
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T15:20:55"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110668000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000017"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13110668000230" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000230">Lord

beyond the capabilities of the United Kingdom Government to resolve all
the problems of the Middle East. We are, however, now involved in a
range of multilateral discussions. Sadly, the Geneva II conference,
which we hoped would take place in November, is unlikely to take place
before towards the end of the year. As the noble Lord knows, tentative
dialogues with the Iranians are under way, and the Middle East peace
process between the Israelis and the Palestinians is, thank goodness,
also again getting slowly under way. We are engaged on a large number
of fronts but, as the noble Lord knows, the problems are extremely
complex and
long-standing.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_06_PT_1/E18CDB5D0625CC02E5E6CC10B81BDEB3871ECE82" __version__="1.15"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 November 2013">Wednesday,

fire and rescue services a statutory role in carbon monoxide safety,
regulation and enforcement, given their good track record on fire
alarms. I also ask the Government to consider how carbon monoxide
tracks in buildings. Some of the deaths have occurred among people who

She is right about the coroner’s Regulation 28 letter that we

currently considering its recommendations, which include some of those
that she has mentioned, and we will reply, as we are required to do. As
to the noble Baroness’s second question, she is right to
emphasise the risks to tenants in rented properties. In the wider

Gardner of Parkes (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, there is currently an
obligation for rental properties to have a gas safety certificate every
year. If the compulsory installation of carbon monoxide monitors is to
be introduced, would it not be practical for those monitors to be
tested at the same time, as people would then know that it had been
done? Further, is it not important to indicate on the carbon monoxide
monitor how long it will work satisfactorily? I have found great
variation in what people tell you when they come about the gas. One
will say that the battery just needs changing but another will say that
the sensor stops working after a certain number of years. I noticed
that whoever installed the carbon monoxide monitor in my home wrote on
it the date when it will definitely need
replacing.</hs_para>

open-ended working group that was set up to try to overcome the 17-year

that is still four months away, British officials have had
conversations in Mexico City, Geneva and New York about whether we may
attend. It remains 
<?notus-xml column=219?>very much an open question. Perhaps I may simply say
to the noble Baroness that there are a great many different, and in
some ways conflicting, bodies in which disarmament is now being
discussed. These include the Nuclear Security Summit which will meet
again in 2014, the UN Disarmament Commission and the Conference on
Disarmament. There have also been a number of discussions on
nuclear-weapon-free zones. The question of where one puts the priority
and where you think it is most worthwhile to push for development is
difficult We hold that the NPT review conference of 2015 should remain
one of our priorities. We also think that there is value in the P5
process, on which Britain has been one of the leaders, and in the
P5-plus process in which the P5 members discuss these issues with India
and
Pakistan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110668000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000035"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Browne of Ladyton" PimsId="5822" UID="13110668000249" xid="2084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000249">Lord

affordable and not at the expense of jobs. We recognise that these are
challenging times. We applaud companies that have chosen to pay higher
wages. We too are concerned with low pay. That is why we have frozen

and passionate points and I agree with the gist. However, I should say
that our key policy is to support the low-paid through the national
minimum wage. It is set at a level that helps as many low-paid workers
as possible, but without damaging their employment prospects. My right
honourable friend Vince Cable has asked the Low Pay Commission
to look at what economic conditions would be needed to allow
the national minimum wage to rise in the future by more than current
conditions allow, without having an adverse impact on

Unlike the national minimum wage, which aims to maximise support for
the low-paid without damaging their employment prospects, the living
wage is derived from an assessment of households’ living
standards. Although that is important, it focuses on household
expenditure rather than the income and affordability of

McFall of Alcluith (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, by
mismanaging the lobbying Bill, the Government are wrecking the work of
the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, which was set up to
reform the culture in the banking industry, by bringing forward this
Bill early—on 18 November. That is the unanimous view of all
members of the banking commission, who have said that they need until
the new year to study these government amendments for the simple reason
that this is an entirely new Bill. This is a Bill that left the House
of Commons 35 pages long. It is now more than 160 pages and the
government amendments are four times the size of their original Bill.
This morning I spoke to Andrew Tyrie MP, the chairman of the
commission, who said that if the Government go ahead before
due consideration to this increasingly complex and dense legislation,
the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards will not be able to
carry out the mandate that the Government gave it to reform
the banking industry. The collective efforts over one
year—almost 200 hours of public evidence and 10,000 questions
—will be wasted. The Government will not only be
betraying their promise when they established the commission, but it
will be seen and disowned by members of the commission for indulging in
cynical, low, political-level, sharp practice. I ask the Government to
think again and give due time to the Parliamentary Commission on
Banking Standards by bringing this Bill back in the New Year when it is
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110668000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000063"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lawson of Blaby" PimsId="1435" UID="13110668000278" xid="1513" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000278">Lord
Lawson of Blaby (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, as a fellow member of the
banking standards commission, I agree with the conclusion reached by
the noble Lord, Lord McFall, that the Leader of the House should think
again about this important matter. I have great sympathy with him. I
understand that the parliamentary timetable has been complicated by the
late change of plan on the lobbying Bill and that presents him with a
difficulty, but it would be wholly wrong to put Report of the banking
Bill in as a stopgap. This is a massively important Bill. It is a
completely different one from the Bill that emerged from the other
place. It is hugely larger—about five times—and extremely
complex. In Committee, a number of noble Lords asked for a particularly
long gap between Committee and Report, and I was under the impression

have to observe that many do and have a tremendous sense of duty to the
work they do in scrutinising legislation. It is not a part-time House;
we sit full time, but Members clearly have other expertise, which may
keep them elsewhere on occasion. It is because of that, in scheduling
business in this House, that we always take care to try to give advance

inevitable consequence of that was that I would have to make some

lobbying Bill which had to be vacated. I looked at all the available
legislative business. This House is justly proud of the scrutiny that
it gives to legislation. Of course, I looked at the availability of the
opposition Front Bench spokesmen for that business; I always do. What I

each of those options would either have been a worse use of time for

permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on the future
shipbuilding programme for the Royal Navy, and in particular the
aircraft carrier project. As the House will know, the previous
Government entered into a contract with the Aircraft Carrier Alliance,
an industrial consortium led by BAE Systems, to build two 65,000-tonne
aircraft carriers—the largest ships in the Royal Navy’s
history.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110668000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000083">In
SDSR 2010, the incoming Government, faced with the challenge of dealing
with a £38 billion black hole in the MoD budget, were advised
that under the terms of the contract it would cost more to cancel the
carriers than to build them. The Public Accounts Committee subsequently
described that contract as “not fit for purpose” and
identified in particular the misalignment of interests between the MoD
and the contractors, manifested in a sharing arrangement for cost
overruns that sees, at best, 90p of every £1 of additional cost
paid by the taxpayer and only 10p paid by the contractor as the root
cause of the
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110668000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000084">I
agree with the PAC’s analysis. In 2012 I instructed my
department to begin negotiations to restructure the contract to better
protect the interests of the taxpayer and to ensure the delivery of the
carriers to a clear time schedule and at a realistic and deliverable
cost. Following 18 months of complex negotiations with industry, I am
pleased to inform the House that we have now reached heads of terms

the revised agreement, the total capital cost to the Ministry of
Defence of procuring the carriers will be £6.2 billion, a figure
arrived at after a detailed analysis of costs already incurred and
future costs and risks over the remaining seven years to the end of the
project. Crucially, under the new agreement, any variation above or
below that price will be shared on a 50:50 basis between government and
industry until all the contractor’s profit is lost, meaning that
interests are now properly aligned, driving the behaviour change needed
to see this contract effectively delivered.</hs_para>

of this project does not come as a surprise. When I
announced in May last year that I had balanced the defence budget, I
did so having already made prudent provision in the equipment plan for
a cost increase in the carrier programme above the £5.46 billion
cost reported in the major projects review 2012, in recognition of the
inevitability of cost-drift in a contract that was so

much as £100 million. I am pleased to tell the House that they

National Audit Office of the provisions, and it is on that basis that
it reviewed and reported on our 10-year equipment plan in January this
year. I am therefore able to confirm to the House that the revised cost
of the carriers remains within the additional provision made in May
2012 in the equipment plan, and that as a result of this prudent
approach the defence budget remains in balance with the full cost of
the carriers provided for, and that the centrally held contingency of

reviewing the carrier project, we have also reviewed the wider
warship-building programme, within the context of the so-called terms

in 2009 by the previous Government. As the House will know, we remain
committed to the construction of the Type 26 global combat ship to
replace our current Type 23 frigates, but the main investment approval
for the Type 26 programme will not be made until the design is more
mature, towards the end of next year. There is, therefore, a challenge
in sustaining a skilled shipbuilding workforce in the United Kingdom
between the completion of construction of the blocks for the second
carrier and the beginning of construction of the Type 26 in
2016.</hs_para>

TOBA, without a shipbuilding order to fill that gap, the MoD would be
required to pay BAE Systems for shipyards and workers to stand idle,
producing nothing, while their skill levels faded. Such a course would
add significant risk to the effective delivery of the Type 26
programme, which assumes a skilled workforce and a working shipyard to
deliver it. Therefore, to make best use of the labour force and the
dockyard assets for which we would anyway be paying, I can announce
today that we have signed an agreement in principle with BAE Systems to
order three offshore patrol vessels for the Royal Navy, based on a more
capable variant of the River Class and including a landing deck able to
take a Merlin
helicopter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110668000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000093">Subject
to main gate approval in the coming months, these vessels will be

yards idle, is less than £100 million, which will be funded from
budget held within the equipment plan to support industrial
restructuring. The order is good news for the Clyde, sustaining around
1,000 jobs as the carrier construction work reaches completion,
securing the skills base there and ensuring the ability to build the
Type 26 frigates in due course, while turning the MoD’s
liabilities under the TOBA into valuable capability for the Royal

to the final part of this Statement, the House will be aware

shipbuilding business as the surge of work associated with the

job losses across Filton, the Clyde and Rosyth, and the
closure of the company’s shipbuilding yard in
Portsmouth. The loss of such a significant number of jobs is, of
course, regrettable, but was always going to be inevitable as the
workload associated with the carrier build comes to an end. I pay
tribute to the men and women on the Clyde and in Portsmouth who have
contributed so much to the construction of the Royal Navy’s
warships, including, of course, the Queen Elizabeth class carriers. BAE
Systems has assured me that every effort will be made to redeploy

would like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation of the
work and contribution made by all those in our shipbuilding industry.
My understanding is that there have already been extensive discussions

arisen. All too often that is not the approach adopted when reductions
in the size of a workforce have to be
considered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110668000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000102">The
news of the job losses will obviously be a major blow. Clearly, the
loss of the capacity at Portsmouth to build ships will be keenly felt,
although a repair and maintenance capability is being retained in the
city. It is vital that we keep the skills needed to sustain our United
Kingdom shipbuilding capacity, and the announcement of the decision to
build three offshore patrol vessels in the gap between the completion
of the major work on the two aircraft carriers and the build-up of work
on the Type 26 destroyers is welcome. The retention of our shipbuilding
capability is vital to our country, the defence of the United Kingdom

West of Spithead (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am saddened but not
surprised by the tone of this announcement. My main reason for that is
that there is not a single mention of strategic or operational
requirements. My noble friend Lord Rosser mentioned that the Statement
said that the Government looked at this and asked whether it would cost
more to cancel the carriers than to build them. I would absolutely hope
that the reason we build something like a carrier is that we need them
for our nation’s security, which we do. There is no reflection
of that anywhere in the Statement, or of the sovereign requirement for
a shipbuilding capability. We do not build ships for admirals to play
with in the bath; there is actually a requirement for them. That is why
we do it. Was there was any discussion in the National Security
Council, of any length—I would like to know how long, if the
Minister can tell me—about the strategic requirement for a
sovereign shipbuilding capability within this country? It is widely
understood that the 19 escorts, which is all we have, are too few in
number. Therefore, we will hopefully at some stage start to build more.
Is one building stream in Scotland enough to cover that? I do not think
that it is. Has this been debated and looked at? It certainly was not
touched upon in this

Palmer of Childs Hill (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, when the cost of
building two new aircraft carriers is set to rise by £800
million to £6.2 billion, Harry Truman’s adage,
“The buck stops here”, is bound to be inverted. We have
heard this in recent exchanges. The coalition Government blame the
previous Labour Government; 
<?notus-xml column=234?>indeed, the contracts in my view and that of many experts,
were flawed because the contractor only has to pick up 10% of the
overrun. The Ministry of Defence and the Secretary of State must be
complimented on negotiating for the overrun costs to be spread at 50/50
between both. However, I note in the repetition of the Secretary of
State’s speech that the arrangement is to go on until the
contractor’s profit is lost overall. I think we need some more
meat regarding how that profit is to be calculated, because there are
many ways of calculating what a profit is and not much was said about

quite the necessity that they have been in the past. My first question
to the Minister is whether the saga of carriers supports the
GOCO—government-owned contractor-operated—arrangements we
are suggesting should go into procurement. The Chief of the Defence
Staff gave an interview on 3 November in which he said he wants the
Armed Forces to be available in international crises such as striking

said to the noble Lord. On the question about GOCO, as the Statement
said, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee has described the
carrier programme as one of the most potent examples of what can go
wrong with big projects in the public sector. We need to change this
and we feel that a change of procurement is necessary. We will all have
a chance to discuss this when the Bill comes to this House later this
year. As for the operational use of the carriers, they are very

Reid of Cardowan (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the three
offshore patrol vessels. This is exactly what was envisaged when the
carrier contract was first negotiated, in order to ensure the
continuity of a strategic asset for this country. Thereafter, I cannot
be so generous. May I correct the misapprehension that has been put
about that the carrier cost doubled? The original cost was more than
£4 billion when the contract was signed. There was an additional
£1.8 billion because, quite correctly, the Government decided,
when the recession hit us, that it should be delayed for two years. So
when the coalition Government came in, the cost was actually
£5.9 billion. That has now risen to £6.2
billion, part of which was due to the Government’s mistaken
belief, under the last Secretary of State, that they could somehow fit
“cats and traps” over the weekend by some welder doing a
“homer” and getting it cheaply. Of course, it cost
£60 million.</hs_para>

and finally, the Statement is curiously bereft of any strategic sense
of what this country needs. The contract was signed to give continuity
and retention of skills so that this country would have not only jobs
but a major industrial and defence strategic asset. All I have to say
is, if the Government believe that they can constitute a future
strategic basis purely on the basis of the intrinsic contractual cost
of any given contract, I fear for the long
term<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:30:21"></hs_TimeCode>. If the
Government continue in that way we may well end up sending our

required if both carriers come into service and the three
OPVs are fully manned. I welcome that and I do not want to get into
that argument at all. However, the previous Government and the present
Government took major decisions which affected equipment and manpower
in the Armed Forces, and priority in big handful terms has been given
to equipment. Therefore where savings have had to be found they have
had to be found in manpower. Most of those savings have been found

our Army is striving very hard to meet the 20% reduction in its regular

point-scoring is, I suppose, inevitable in a forum like this, but it is

subscribe to these new vessels on the Clyde, but the Minister should
take it into account that all of us in Scotland are also heartbroken
about the decision to end shipbuilding in Portsmouth. It is a historic
dockyard and it is tragic that we are coming to this decision to end
shipbuilding there. Does the Minister agree with me that it is absurd

In other words, we have had overcapacity, sadly, in our naval yards for
years, and it still applies. I have three specific questions. First,
the Statement does not indicate the cost of the three offshore patrol
vessels; it is a rather shrouded figure. Will the Minister give the
cost of the three OPVs? Secondly, following the point raised by the

billion retention in the contingency reserve, would it not have made
sense to build one more Daring class Type 45 destroyer, as we are
desperately short of escort vessels?

Government have come to this a bit late, in any case. The first period
of this Government was a pretty disgraceful one, when they cut back on
efforts to help bring millions of households out of fuel poverty. The
Warm Front programme, which was taxpayer-funded and treated the homes
of 200,000 low-income households every year, was first cut and then
abolished, although parallel schemes still exist in Scotland, Wales and
Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:45:56"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government also cut back on the decent homes expenditure for improving
the stock in the social housing sector. They also made clear at a
pretty early stage that the aim to eliminate and eventually abolish
fuel poverty was being abandoned. This aim, set out originally in the
Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act, had been pursued by the
previous Government with growing difficulty over the past few years as
global oil and gas prices rose. Not until this Bill and the document to

Government also closed the CERT scheme—previously known as
EEC—which placed an obligation on the supply companies to
provide energy efficiency improvements and was skewed towards the fuel
poor. Admittedly, the Government have replaced that with the ECO
provision, which is reflected in this Bill and the earlier legislation,
but the ECO is supposed to do a multitude of things. It is supposed to
replace Warm Front and CERT, but actually the feedback we
get—and I am sure the Government get—from the ground is
that it is not achieving anywhere near its targets. The feedback from
the supply companies, the installation companies, the insulation
companies, consumer groups, fuel poverty campaigners and the
Government’s own fuel poverty advisory group is that what is
supposed to be conducted under the ECO is less in volume and more

the VAT consequences of introducing the carbon floor price. The

introduced a warm homes discount to override the tariff so that there

tackle the basic problem. The Government have not only dropped or

difficult to make a dent in fuel poverty. I know that Chris Huhne came
to government in the first instance wanting to look at a new strategy.
Indeed, it is no secret, because someone told the press that at one
point he approached me as a former Minister in this area to conduct an
assessment. I was flattered and surprised, and slightly tempted, by the

the group try to make sure that fuel poverty is up there with the other
objectives of energy policy in the Government’s statement of
policy. I cannot see how they can possibly object to that reference.
The third amendment relates to the strategy. It attempts to turn a very
woolly clause into one which has targets—and clarity of those
targets—that relate to the improvement and efficiency of the
dwellings of the fuel poor, as well as to the reduction and eventual
elimination of fuel poverty in this country. If the strategy does not

more specific on that in his amendments in this group. Either way, to
give any confidence to the millions of people who are in fuel poverty

O’Neill, or at least commit themselves to coming forward at
Third Reading with something very like it which gives a structure and a
framework for fuel poverty. As we know, fuel poverty is a terrible
curse on our country. It causes people to skimp on food, and to not buy
necessities for their children. It causes serious lung and heart
conditions in thousands of our citizens at an estimated cost of
£1.3 billion a year to the National Health Service. It causes
whole families to live in discomfort, in anxiety, in the cold, and in

bit of muscle and detail to the Government’s commitment. I will
talk about this more in my later remarks, but the rather late insertion
of concerns about fuel poverty into the Bill mean that it is rather
late in the day for some of the amendments that we put forward, which
are of a probing character. Therefore, one would hope that the spirit
of these amendments will be carried into secondary legislation: that

I regret is unable to be here today. All credit should be given to her

dubious about plucking a date out of the air. I know that the date was
the subject of some arm-wrestling between the then Labour Government
and the Back-Benchers. However, the fact is that it was an attempt. At
the time there was a degree of optimism because, as noble Lords will
recall, energy prices, particularly gas prices, were falling. We could
see households moving out of what was known at the time as fuel poverty
in quite considerable numbers. Not only were gas prices falling and
thus people’s disadvantage in the energy market diminishing,
there was also a sense that the general economic prosperity of the time
meant that the situation of the poor would become easier and, as the
Americans say, all the boats would rise together. Unfortunately, all
the boats did not rise but the price of energy subsequently did, and
the poor were left stranded in their inadequately insulated and poorly

with housing conditions in two steps. Priority would be given to the
homes that are hardest to heat, and where the household income is less
than 60% of median income after housing costs. That is the
Government’s own definition of poverty. The objective is for
those householders to be helped by 2020. Over the succeeding 10 years,
the remaining housing stock would be brought up to level B of the
energy efficiency ratings. Rating B is the level that a new house is
currently expected to meet when it is constructed. This is an ambitious
target that would take some 17 years to meet. We are told that 70% of
fuel-poor households are living in E, F and G-rated buildings, so we
are talking about improving something like 1.7 million homes over the

that houses with SAP ratings of E, F and G are where most of the fuel
poor live. Moreover, only 7% of them have, for example, a condensing
boiler. It is not just a question of insulating the houses; it is
equally important to have more efficient means of heating water and
providing central heating for these families. We know also that some 6
million households are not connected to the gas grid. These households
are the ones where the fuel poverty gap, where it exists, is likely to
be twice as wide as it is in households with gas boilers and central
heating. Much the same can be said for a number of houses solid-walled

point of using the SAP rating is that it is probably the most up to
date definition of disadvantage in respect of fuel costs. If you live
in a house with an E, F or G SAP rating, it is likely that your home is
very expensive to heat. The concept of low income, high cost is the
basis of the Hills report, which defines fuel poverty and the fuel
poverty gap. My noble friend has already referred to the fact that,
according to the Hills report, we have seen a reduction in the number
of households in fuel poverty from 4.5 million to 2.4
million. My colleague suggested, perhaps somewhat cynically, that this
was an easy way of massaging the statistics. Frankly, there is a bit
more to it than that, in so far as we now have a method of calculation
that is not as vulnerable to fluctuations in price, which was the kind
of problem that we had in the early part of the last decade. When gas
prices were falling, the problems seemed to be decreasing, but in fact
we know that the people who were living in these homes were not really
very much warmer because most of the heat that they were paying for was
still going out of the window or under the doors or not being properly

not unreasonable to use the SAP rating as the basis to do this, because
one of the things about heritable property is that you cannot hide it.
One of the things about local government taxes is that people do not
really like rates, as we used to call them, and they do not like
revaluation because you cannot hide property. The fact is that these
homes, which are inadequately constructed, will not disappear because

to Westminster more than 30 years ago, fuel poverty was not a given. It
was an item of dispute and debate. The conversation around the Hills
report suggested that the problem of fuel poverty was largely one of
definition. Of course it was a rough and ready definition that was
dreamt up by a young researcher in the 1970s who was doing work on
poverty in Kensington. He was a man called Malcolm Wicks who went on to
become a very distinguished Energy Minister in another place. Much of
his work was given over to looking at how we could address this
problem. Nearly 40 years after Malcolm wrote his first report—in
which he quite starkly laid down the choice of “eat or
heat” for the elderly of Kensington—we should
be dealing with this in a far more organised and
programmatic way than has been shown in the rather well intended but
often ill directed scattergun approach that successive Governments have
had.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110668000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000171">I like
to think that my amendments provide some milestones on a route that

they are in many respects of a probing character, and I know that on
Report we should be a bit further advanced than that, but I should like
some indication from the Minister of the Government’s thinking
on the specifics of handling this problem. The excuses that we had in

us use the inadequacy of our housing stock and the manner in which we
are currently grading that inadequacy, as the means whereby we set out
priorities which, over a period of 17 years, could probably eliminate
the best part of 70% to 80% of fuel poverty in this country by a
definition which, I think, is now accepted as being clearer, more
robust and more statistically sound than Malcolm Wicks’s figure
out of the air. If we could do that, we would do a great deal to
enhance the memory of a colleague of many of us for whom we had great
respect. One of his life’s causes was the resolution of that
problem. I am not saying that we should do it for Malcolm Wicks; I am

continuation of some of these efforts. It is turning out to be
incredibly expensive—much more expensive than the original

wholesale prices for primary hydrocarbons have risen as well. So on top

The leader of the Labour Party, an extremely able man, was, as
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, the architect of
these higher-price taxes—the green taxes which I shall come to
in detail in a moment. Now he has gone the other way; he has seen the
effect and is calling for a price freeze. It reminded me of the legend

this is regression on a grand scale. The poor and the vulnerable are,

there has been talk not only of freezing prices but of rolling back
green levies. However, one must understand that that is not the only
aspect. First, one of the reasons that the energy companies kept
indicating, when they were being given a going-over by the Select
Committee in the other place the other day, for raising their charges
and having to make a substantial profit—I think 5% is the figure
they all cited—is the need to finance extra plant to replace the
plant closed down because it was deemed to be higher-carbon or
unsuitable in accordance with EU regulations. We can accept that reason
or not accept it. However, even before we get to the green levies, that
is the first charge that arrives on the budget of the poor—on
the budget of everyone, of course, but for the poor it is 15% or more
of their disposable income. That is layer one of the challenge on
prices.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110668000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110668000182">Then,
of course, there are the levies themselves, which fall into two parts,
as we all know. One part is to finance and subsidise the new very
high-cost renewables and the draw-droppingly expensive electricity from
wind farms, which, as we know, is half as much again as the amount
being offered to EDF for Hinkley Point C for the next 35 years, which
in turn is half as much again as we are paying now, which is
considerably more than we used to. The other half, oddly enough, is for
good social and compassionate reasons: it is to redress the effects of
the first two levies. The effect of the social programmes and the
compensation is to 
<?notus-xml column=247?>offset the effects of the levies that finance the subsidies on the
investment required because the pace of decarbonisation is just too
fast and mishandled, and to offset the effect of the prices being
charged by energy companies. It is an odd situation where the total
cost is designed to offset some of the total costs that other measures

insulation is of course an excellent thing. There has been talk about
woolly jumpers and that may help the younger folk, but all I
can say for oldies —I think I can speak for them now; I used not
to be able to, but I can now—is that cold limbs in a cold room

a very grim outcome. There are chilling estimates of how

a house that had additional insulation. It had a thinner attic layer of
carbon fibre over it and an additional three or four inches was added
over the beams. I cannot say that it affected the bills very much but
it may have held the warmth in the house for a little while. However,
first you have to heat the house up before you can contain the heat
within it, and that costs money. Those are the good intentions, and we

Deben (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I think that, when we are making
these decisions, we ought to be particularly careful about the figures
that we use. We must also understand why we are decarbonising at this
rate. We are doing so because the economic advice from the best
economists that we have is that it is the cheapest way to decarbonise.
If we were to put it off, the cost would be considerably greater, so we
should do it at this pace. We can disagree with this, but to do so
would be to disagree with the best advice that we have been able to
get. I must say, on behalf of the climate change committee, that, if I
thought that there was a cheaper, more cost-effective way of doing it,
I would do that. I am proposing this and have been pressing it because
it is, by all the evidence, the best thing to do.</hs_para>

ought to get the figures right. The average cost of decarbonisation for
payers of the dual tariff—about 80% of users—is
£60 per year at the moment. I am not suggesting that £60
is an unimportant matter, but when the average payment for fuel bills
is £1,300, I think that we have to be careful about
overemphasising the influence of the one thing upon the other. By 2020,
the amount will be £100—and the figure will rise
accordingly between now and then. I do not know what the average fuel
bill will be in 2020, but the idea that £100 will be the major
reason why the fuel bills will be high is not true.</hs_para>

figures seriously. This is one of the problems that we are facing.
People are using figures that are clutched from the air. I have been
watching Twitter and I find that people—sometimes, I am afraid,
from my own party—are busy putting out tweets saying that if we
had had a decarbonisation target after 2020 it would have increased our
bills by £125 per year. This is totally untrue. The figure is
£20, and the climate change committee has spent a great deal of
time trying to get the best and most accurate figure possible. If the
TaxPayers’ Alliance or others want to pick a figure out of the

always say that this is not the moment to do this. However, I must say
to my noble friend, that in that case it will never be the moment to do
it, because that is always true at any given moment. However, if you
see that climate change is the most serious material threat to our
society, as happily this Government do—and it is a common view
across the House—the £60 being charged for the insurance
against it seems a reasonable
amount.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110678000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110678000005">There
is an argument, although it is not for the climate change committee to
make it, that we might change where the money comes from. However, I do
not think that there is an argument to say that we should not be
spending the money. Therefore I think that we ought to be very careful
when we are having these discussions that we do not talk in a way that
distorts the argument, either by the size of the price that we claim or
by forgetting that most people’s heating does not come from
electricity—it comes from gas and other sources—and
therefore they are not paying this. Neither ought we to forget that
other countries are doing more than we are. Germany is doing more than
we are and much of Europe is doing at least as much, as we can see by
looking at the Danes. The rest of the world is moving in this direction
in a very serious manner; whether it is today’s announcement
from Mexico or the changes in China, we can see that this is happening
all around the world. It is not that Britain is doing better than
others or is out of step, but that we are doing what the world is
doing, because the world recognises the threat. That means that we have
to be very considerate about the condition and situation of vulnerable
people.</hs_para>

if we want other, much less well-off people to follow, we have to set
an example. Thirdly, 11% of the emissions in the world are made by
organisations that are headquartered or sold on the London Stock

a carbon-intensity target towards a carbon-reduction target for the

world is changing. But if we stand aside and say, “After you,

total resources spent in 2010-11 at 2012 prices—these are common
prices all the way through—on fuel poverty spending was
£821 million. The current year has gone up, at
constant prices, to £841 million and the next year the estimate

My Lords, I start by thanking all noble Lords for a
very full and informed debate. I thank my noble friend Lord Jenkin for
reminding the House of the warm welcome from the opposite Benches for
us taking forward this measure. It is really important that we all
agree that something must be done. What has been done in the past has
not been enough. We need to be working far more constructively together
to get 
<?notus-xml column=251?>solutions, particularly for those who are most vulnerable and
least able to respond. I also thank my noble friend Lord Deben. He is
absolutely right: any measures that we take here will have an impact
somewhere else in the world. It is really important that we are mindful
that this Bill is in part there to help decarbonisation. The bigger
picture is to play our role in helping other countries, which can look
at how we are putting those measures in
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110678000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110678000017">I also
thank the noble Lords, Lord Whitty and Lord O’Neill, for their

that I made in Committee so that they feel reassured that this
Government really take seriously the issue of fuel poverty. We take the
issue no less seriously than the previous Government did, but the
measures that were put in place were not working well enough. We need
to make sure, therefore, that what we are doing gives better

Lords have rightly highlighted the seriousness of fuel poverty; it is
because of this that we are committed to tackling this. This is why we
made the amendments in Committee which will set a new target and put in

poverty beyond the current date of 2016. That concern needs to be set
out in legislation. However, the right balance must be struck between

in secondary legislation and what is included in the strategy, to

proposed setting the target through secondary legislation as we felt
that this struck the right balance between the certainty of legislative
targets and the need for flexibility in the future. The flexibility
will, for instance, be important to reflect changes in the way energy
efficiency is measured over time. The setting of the target, and any

taking are crucial to addressing concerns which he raised. I have

It may be very easy in opposition to say, “We want this
now”, but we have already had 13 years of proposals that have
not worked. We need proposals that have some meat—some
body—and work. That is why it is really important that we do not
get rushed into things because it makes a good political headline
tomorrow. It is in the interest of all 
<?notus-xml column=253?>those who are suffering in inefficient homes, with
the cost of energy going up, that we have a clear, proper strategy that
works and that addresses those with low incomes but high costs around
energy. I hope that noble Lords will be reassured that I, particularly,
take these issues very seriously. I look forward to working with noble
Lords to ensure that we put forward something that is not political but
is a remedy to help the most vulnerable in our country. I hope that, on

Whitty:</Member></B> I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in
this debate. It proved to be rather more wide-ranging than I had
anticipated, largely thanks to the first intervention by the noble
Lord, Lord Howell. I agreed with some of it, but he provoked a debate
we have already had several times in the course of the Bill. I disagree
with his central point and I think we need to take advice from the
noble Lord, Lord Deben. It serves nobody’s interest to trade off
the interests of the fuel poor against the objectives of reducing
carbon in our energy. We have to tackle both as far as we can: it is
not a trade-off. Indeed, many of the measures we are talking about to
help the fuel poor, in particular improving the energy efficiency of
homes, also help to reduce total demand for energy and reduce carbon.
There is no conflict: they are synergetic, if that is the word, in many
respects. It was a bit of an unfortunate diversion, but at least it
livened up the
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110678000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110678000028">The
noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and the Minister, to some extent, accused me
of a volte-face. Certainly when the Government—between
proceedings in the Commons and the Lords—came up with Clause
136, there was a sigh of relief, which I shared, that fuel poverty was
being addressed in this huge reorganisation of the electricity market
and energy policy generally. I have no doubt that other noble Lords on
this side shared the relief that fuel poverty was at least appearing in
the Bill. The problem is that it appeared at a rather late stage and
that, as I said and maintain, it is a rather thin clause. It refers to
the Government “setting out an objective” at some date
“for addressing” fuel poverty—it does not even say
“reducing fuel poverty”. We therefore want a little more
meat on the bone. Some of it can no doubt be done by secondary
regulation, but it would be better, frankly, if the Government were
open to strengthening Clause
136.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110678000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110678000029">The issue
immediately before us is slightly different. Amendments 92A and 92B
suggest that we should clearly signal within the statement of energy
policy that fuel poverty is one aspect. Indeed, the programme, the
policy and the strategy that the Government intend to bring forward
under Clause 136 should be seen as part of that. It needs specific
mention because it was not there for most of the Bill’s
existence, it does not appear in most of the Bill, it was not there at
all for the whole of the Commons procedure on the Bill and it needs to
be clear now. This is our last opportunity in consideration of the Bill

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I accept the Government’s good
faith—and certainly the Minister’s—in this
respect. Certainly, Clause 136 gives the Government the opportunity and
the requirement to do that. However, my point on these first two
amendments is that we cannot ghettoise fuel poverty into one clause of
the Bill and one aspect of government thinking. All approaches to
tariffs, investment and the source of energy, as well as to measures to
improve the energy efficiency of homes and other direct measures to
help the fuel poor, need to be seen in the totality of energy policy as
part of the Government’s obligation. That is why Amendment 98A
proposes that a reference to fuel poverty should be written clearly
into the policy statement. It is nothing more than that, but it is very
important that that is reflected. I would have thought that the
Government could have accepted it, but given that the Government are
clearly not prepared to accept it I wish to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13110678000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110678000069">5.52

Judd:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall also take the opportunity to speak
to Amendments 94, 95 and 96. I declare an interest as a vice-president
of the Campaign for National Parks, a patron of the Friends of the Lake
District, and a member and supporter of the Campaign to Protect Rural
England and other environmental agencies. In the context of this
amendment, I pay special tribute to the John Muir Trust, which has done
outstanding work in this area and with which I have been incredibly
fortunate to co-operate in the preparation of what I want to
say<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T18:05:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110678000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110678000034">We
must never forget that we are custodians of this planet for future
generations. Our responsibility to safeguard the environment,
especially those parts of it that our generation has not so far
severely damaged, must always be at the forefront of our minds and
policy-making. We must never fall victim to misguided, damaging and
unnecessary short-term measures, whatever our commitment to what is
regarded as essential growth. I fear that some government policies that
are intended to protect the environment are instead driving action that
is damaging it. In particular I think of the deployment of energy
infrastructure on our most precious and wild
landscapes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T18:06:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110678000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110678000035">My
amendments are certainly not intended to challenge the
Government’s climate change goals and their efforts to move to a
green energy system. As I made clear in 
<?notus-xml column=258?>Committee, I fully support these but I remain firmly of the view that,
in certain respects, we are losing sight of the purpose behind them. We
cannot safeguard the environment for future generations by targets
alone. Here and now—right now—we must give equal regard
to upholding and enhancing existing hard won protections for the
UK’s natural environment—its landscape, ecosystems,
habitats and biodiversity. Energy is not an end in itself; we need it
to have a society worth living in, but sadly we seem to be in an era of
public policy -making where protections for landscapes and the
environment are seen as an obstacle to growth and to keeping the lights
on. It should not—and indeed need not—be a case of having
to make a choice. The present Government pledged to be the
greenest ever but, in reality, safeguards for the
environment are being systematically
weakened.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110678000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0001.htm#13110678000036">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T18:08:29"></hs_TimeCode>
Bill, in its current form, is no exception. Energy infrastructure has
huge impacts on the environment. These amendments seek to prevent the
Bill eroding environmental safeguards and to ensure that they are
meaningful and effective. The first amendment would ensure that the
strategy and policy statement places a responsibility on Ofgem to
demonstrate compliance—and I emphasise those words—with
its general environmental duties. This includes duties to have regard
to the purposes of national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty
and the Norfolk and Suffolk

I put forward a similar amendment in Committee, the Minister sought to
reassure me that the strategy and policy statement would not override
Ofgem’s existing duties to contribute to sustainable
development, and that those duties would still apply. In the
Minister’s view, therefore, the amendment was unnecessary. I
understand her point and I also appreciate that she may wish to avoid a
detailed amendment listing all the various duties. However—noble
Lords must forgive me if I did not make this clear at an
earlier stage—that is really not the issue. The point is that,
while there are indeed existing legislative duties that would not
change, there is currently no explicit requirement in the Energy Bill
for Ofgem—again I underline these words—to demonstrate
compliance with them. The amendment would also require the authority to
demonstrate compliance with its obligations under the conservation of
wild birds and habitats directives, which is crucial given the perilous
state of the UK’s

Ofgem’s commercial responsibilities are clearly defined.

Electricity Act and Gas Act clauses will result in another

Currently, these clauses ensure that any guidance on social and
environmental matters issued by the Secretary of State is on an equal
footing with the principal objective duties: namely, the protection of
customers and the promotion of competition. However, once they are
repealed, any guidance that the Secretary of State deems it appropriate
to issue in future will be subordinate to the principal objective

afraid that the Minister’s responses in Committee failed to

from the Secretary of State on the meaning of “have regard

is left to the discretion of the regulator. Surely the interpretation
of this duty is not a matter to be left to the regulator; it is for the
Government to determine the social and environmental factors that
should be considered by the regulator and the value that should be
placed on them. The amendment would ensure that provision for the

my interests in various forms of energy as listed in the

Lord, Lord Judd, it has been drawn to my attention that when I spoke on
the Bill at Second Reading I perhaps should have declared a potential
interest. Having taken advice on the matter and satisfied myself that a
shareholding was declared in the register, I do not believe there is a
conflict. However, for the sake of good order, I am happy to declare
that I have a shareholding in a company called the Weir Group, one of
whose divisions supplies equipment to the oil and gas industry. I was
unaware of Weir Group’s activities in this area at the time but

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Judd, for his amendments. The Government recognise that energy
production and consumption should be sustainable. That is why Ofgem has
been given duties to contribute to the achievement of sustainable
development and to have regard to the effect on the environment of
activities connected with the conveyance of gas and the generation,
transmission, distribution and supply of
electricity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110683000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110683000018">Ofgem
can also consider sustainability implications when it carries out
impact assessments for important regulatory decisions. The amendments
before us would require Ofgem to demonstrate that it has complied with
its general environmental duties. We agree that Ofgem should be
accountable. It already has to produce an annual report on matters that
fall within the scope of its functions, including its environmental
obligations. This accountability will be reinforced by the strategy and
policy statement as Ofgem will be required to set out its strategy for
implementing the statement in forward work programming. It will also be
required to report annually on its contribution towards furthering the
delivery of the policy outcomes.</hs_para>

amendments would also require the Government to issue social and
environmental guidance. It may help here if I explain why the Bill
removes the guidance provision. The Ofgem review found that the
guidance has not achieved coherence between the Government’s
energy strategy and the regulatory regime. They recommended that it
should be replaced by a strategy and policy statement. This statement
will set out the Government’s strategic priorities, the main
considerations which have informed their energy policy and the policy
outcomes which are to be achieved to implement this policy.</hs_para>

to the strategic priorities when it carries out its regulatory
functions and it must carry out these functions in the way it considers
best calculated to further delivery of the policy outcomes. This is a
stronger requirement than applied in the guidance, to which Ofgem only
had to have regard. The Bill therefore goes further than the noble
Lord’s amendment and the statement will be a fitter mechanism
for achieving coherence between energy policy and regulation. The
strategy and policy statement can include material on social and
environmental matters. We will take the current guidance into account
as we develop its contents but keeping the guidance alongside would
dilute the value of the statement.</hs_para>

amendments would require the Secretary of State to publish guidance on
wider public engagement, which would apply before he decided either to
leave the strategy and policy statement unchanged or to
withdraw it after a review. The Bill already provides for the Secretary
of State to consult Ofgem, Scottish and Welsh Ministers and
such other persons as he deems appropriate. In practice, when the
Government review the statement, they will consult a range of
stakeholders before deciding how to proceed. Guidance on wider public
engagement, as proposed by this amendment, is therefore unnecessary. I
should also stress that the strategy and policy statement will not be
used to introduce new policies. It will reflect on established policy,
which would have been consulted upon previously, as
appropriate.</hs_para>

Judd asked whether the repeal of the social and

Judd:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank those who have spoken in
support of my amendments. I particularly welcome the strong support
from my Front Bench. The Minister certainly has reassured me that she
takes these issues seriously. I think that she is a civilised person
who sees the force of what I have been arguing. I just would like to
make several observations. First, we all bemoan, and English literature
is full of references, what happened in the Industrial Revolution.
Without in any way undermining the drive and everything that was so
important in the Industrial Revolution, with the benefit of hindsight
we can see that things could have been done much better. We would not
have seen the same degree of rape and misuse of valuable rural, scenic
assets in the country.</hs_para>

draws on the OECD report that has just been published. One of the
reasons why the UK apparently scores relatively highly as being a good
place to live is because of the environmental considerations of living
here. We should jealously preserve that quality in our life. I have no
doubt whatever that, in the context of what I have come to
regard a very ideological age with its total commitment to the market,
the quantative issues in forward policy will be very well put forward
and strenuously advocated. If we really take seriously the preservation
of our heritage, the landscape and all that makes for a wonderful
country in which to live, those arguments will not necessarily
automatically by market mechanisms come forward in the same way,
because these are public goods. Therefore, from this standpoint, a much
stronger argument about just what it means to take into account these
considerations and who should be involved in representing and
presenting them should be in the Bill. At the moment, because she is a
very reasonable person, I am sure that the Minister will
understand that however much aspiration there is in the drafting of the
Bill, it leaves an awful lot to the subjectivity of the regulator. To
be told that the regulator is going to have to report annually on the
fulfilment of the objectives is, again, a nice aspiration; it is full
of good intention, I am sure. But against which precise benchmarks is
he going to report? That is why the letter could be so important, and
why I hope—I am sorry, I should have stipulated this—that
it will be with us before Third
Reading.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110683000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110683000029">From
all the standpoints, it is important to recognise that we are talking
about what the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle expressed
so well, as put to us by the noble Viscount, Lord Ridley. We are
talking about our duty to the future. I am sure no noble Lords want
their children and grandchildren to grow up in an age in which we have
enshrined in law and legislation the need to know the price of
everything, but in which we have allowed the decline of knowing about
the value of things. That is why the considerations before us are of

noble friend the Minister agreed with the sentiment of the amendment
during Grand Committee, and said that she would consider it. I know how
grateful my noble friend Lady Maddock is that the Minister gave a great

to add our support to these amendments. It is very good that the

Grantchester (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the House is rightly wary of
allowing wide discretionary powers without being able to suitably
assess their application later. Your Lordships’ Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee expressed concern about the powers in
the Bill. In Committee, on 9 July, along with the noble Lord, Lord
Roper, we highlighted these concerns. At the time the Government agreed
to bring forward amendments to ensure that the Bill and the secondary
legislation would be complicit. While it has taken several iterations
between the Minister’s department and the Select Committee to
get it right, I am pleased to see that the Government finally listened
to the recommendations that were made and tabled these amendments.
Parliament must be able to scrutinise the Secretary of State’s
complicated power to make orders about domestic supply contracts. After
all, the power under Clause 130 would in effect enable the Secretary of
State to categorise the terms of domestic supply contracts as
“discretionary terms” or “principal terms”,
which is a significant power. We welcome the government amendments
because they will ensure that any such order is given appropriate
parliamentary scrutiny under the negative resolution procedure. There
will be a 40-day window during which Parliament can review the draft of
the proposed modifications.</hs_para>

preparing for this amendment, I looked at a selection of energy bills
from various providers. They are almost impossible to understand. Some
of them provide information about the amount that is being levied in
order to meet the Government’s green agenda, while some do not.
Some provide the information in the form of percentages. But surely an
absolutely basic example of justice for consumers is that they should
know what they are paying for. If you take your car into the garage to
be serviced, you expect to see what the items were that make up the
bill at the end of the day. What we have here, I am sorry to say, is a
kind of conspiracy within the political classes to load on to
people’s bills the cost of the green agenda in a way that is not
transparent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T18:52:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

the Government’s rhetoric is continually about the need for
transparency, as people go about their day-to-day business and receive
their electricity and gas bills, they are not able to see how much is
going on subsidising windmills and how much is being used to provide
for the transfer of electricity by building huge pylons and other
infrastructure programmes. For example, a line of pylons is being
erected all the way down the A9 in Scotland, going past Stirling
Castle, in order to deliver power from windmills which are themselves
being subsidised. I believe that most consumers in the country have no
idea that all this is being levied on their bills, and as such it is a
highly regressive tax that is being paid by the poorest. At the very
least, whichever side of the argument one is on, it is right that
people should know exactly how much of their bill is going towards
government environmental levies, how much is going towards wholesale
energy costs, how much relates to raw energy costs, and the various
other

what has been a frustrating day—I am most grateful to my noble
friend Lady Verma, her special adviser and her officials for discussing
this amendment with me—I have found it impossible to understand
why the Government are not prepared to ask Ofgem to ensure that all of
the providers of gas and electricity break down their bills in a way
that is consistent and comparable. It should not be done in percentage
terms, but in financial amounts. If the bill is £300 for the
quarter, it should show how much of that was spent on the various added
components but which are hidden in the bill at present. I have
a horrible feeling that there is, among those who are keen
on pursuing the green agenda, a desire to keep this quiet because of
the concern it would cause among the electorate and in the population;
namely, that we are asking some of the poorest people to pay what is a
highly regressive
tax<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T18:54:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

honourable friend the Prime Minister has promised to roll back these
green taxes on people’s bills, which were originally the idea of
the leader of the Opposition, Mr Miliband, when he was the environment
Secretary. I would respectfully suggest to my right honourable friend
the Prime Minister that if he wants to get any credit for rolling back
the green levies on people’s energy bills, it would be a good
idea to identify them before they are rolled back, because they are
likely to be subsumed into the price increases that are being brought
forward by the energy companies. Consumers will then be unaware of the
impact of the policy, which presumably would mean yet another burden
being placed on taxpayers. In the light of recent experience, that
actually means the people in the middle, who are bearing the brunt of
the additional tax burden which is already being levied by this
coalition

friend will feel able to accept this amendment. If she is unable to do
so, I hope that she will at least give us a clear statement of the
Government’s policy on this matter. Is it the
Government’s intention that every consumer of electricity and
gas in the country will receive a bill that is broken down in explicit
terms, showing how it is made up and what the costs of the
Government’s policies are? They should include the policies in
terms of insulation and the policies that are paying for additional,
expensive offshore and onshore wind generation. If the
Government’s position is that consumers should not have that
information, can they explain exactly why they feel that this should
not be a
priority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T18:56:56"></hs_TimeCode>? I know
that my noble friend will say that the Government are in favour of
transparency and that they would like to see less complex bills, but we
already know that the utility companies are capable of producing them.

consistent and comparable

friend the Prime Minister has also said that it is important that
people should be able to switch in order to get value for money. If you
do not know how much of your bill is being spent on, say, insulation
programmes—one energy provider may be more efficient than
another—how can you choose between different providers according
to their efficiency if that information is not made available to you? A
cursory scan of some of these bills reveals that the 
<?notus-xml column=271?>regulator requires all sorts of information to be
included. That may be of interest, but not, I suspect, to many
customers. What they want to know is how much is their bill and how
much of it actually relates to keeping the lights on in their homes and
how much relates to other desirable or undesirable policies. I hope
that my noble friend will feel able at the least to give a commitment
that this shambles, because shambles it is if one studies the way in
which these bills are presented, will be put right quickly. I beg to

Campbell-Savours (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, unlike the noble Lord,
Lord Forsyth, I am a strong supporter of the green agenda. This is an
amendment about transparency, and I like it. I like it a lot and I
strongly support it. It appeals to a belief that stands at the heart of
my politics: transparency shapes conduct, knowledge and understanding.
However, the current arrangements for utility billing make
understanding impossible in precisely the way the noble Lord, Lord
Forsyth, has set out in his speech—much of which I support but,
of course, much of which I do not.</hs_para>

I moved a whole series of amendments on a number of Bills. I call them

the right judgment. I believe that the issue of transparency will
dominate the politics of this century. It will transcend partisan,
party political debate. It is the principal driver behind justice,
fairness, honesty in administration and personal conduct, integrity in
politics, restraint in exploitation—which is what we are
considering here—and general enlightenment. It will help restore
public confidence in our public institutions and ultimately the private

response of my party should be a knee-jerk “yes” to this

component in the series of Miliband initiatives which are now regularly
being announced. The reality is that there has been a
undignified assault on the whole spectrum of environmental taxation,
much of it based on untruths. Those attacks need a response. We are not
winning the argument. The tabloids are slaughtering our case in the
absence of readily available information which the public understand.

Teverson:</Member></B> Normally when we have bills, either from
supermarkets or other places, we do not actually have a breakdown of
those costs but in an industry 
<?notus-xml column=272?>that is regulated as much as energy has become, I think this is a really
excellent idea. It is something that would become a myth-buster. My
noble friend Lord Forsyth is right that there has been an embarrassment
in terms of trying to shield some of these costs or sweep them under a
carpet. That has backfired because they have been used as an excuse by
energy companies to justify major increases when clearly they are not
the major cause of the increases. One way of breaking that myth about
the extent to which green taxes—or however they are
described—have contributed to the rise of energy bills would be
to have this level of
transparency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T19:03:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110686000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110686000012">Which?,
as noble Lords will know, is one of the major consumer campaign
organisations and puts the green tax at 5% of total electricity bills.
If you add in all the other government initiatives it comes to about 9%
of the total. I think that is the most trustworthy of organisations
because it is consumer-focused. I would also like to see on regulated
industries’ bills how much UK corporation tax they pay in
relation to their total turnover and profit. I am not saying the
electricity industry is particularly bad in that way, but such a scheme
would be particularly interesting in an industry which, through its
bills, receives a fair degree of public subsidy towards the generation
it undertakes.</hs_para>

Ridley:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment of the noble
Lord, Lord Forsyth. There is no doubt that the policy of putting green
subsidies on to consumer bills was designed to disguise and hide the
costs and hope that we would not notice. We can disagree about whether
the results are going to be pleasing or not, but we have noticed that
the consumer has rumbled the ruse, so it is time, as the noble Lord,
Lord Campbell-Savours, said, to be transparent and honest. It would
help to resolve some of the disagreements we have heard again this

is an infographic on the Government website that says that £286
will be added in 2020. The Department of Energy and Climate Change says
that the figure is £199. The Committee on Climate Change, as we
have heard this afternoon, says it is only £100. A lot of these
calculations leave out VAT, upgrades to the grid and system integration
costs. They often make unreliable assumptions about wholesale gas
prices and how they 
<?notus-xml column=273?>are going to change but above all these calculations
leave out the indirect bill—the cost of green levies that is
added to industrial and commercial users of electricity who then pass
it on to individual consumers through the cost of goods and services. A
pint of milk will be more expensive because of green levies paid by the
dairy and the supermarket. If you look at the quantums involved, this

country heat their homes with electricity and those include many of the
poorest people. Ideally we would remove these costs
altogether and put them into taxation. Then the rich would pay more of
them and the poor would pay less. If we cannot have that, then let us
break it out honestly and transparently and see what there is. To those
who say that it cannot be done and that it is too difficult, the noble

unnecessary to add to the avalanche of support for the amendment of the
noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, which I am sure that the Minister will
accept. Just in case she is still in any doubt, I will add my support
for the amendment, which is absolutely right. Of course, this is the
anti-hypocrisy amendment. It is much needed today, when we have spent a
lot of time discussing fuel poverty. One very good way to deal with
fuel poverty would be to keep prices down and finance environmental and
social objectives through general taxation. That would be socially wise
and would assist in dealing with the problem of fuel
poverty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110686000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110686000025">I

There is hypocrisy in the current criticism of the power companies,
given that this year sees the introduction of the Energy Companies

far better to have none of them and do all this through taxation. It is

can work it out company by company if you are very clever and use the

agree with the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. He and I might dispute what

get away from all the hypocrisy. I totally disagree with the noble

all have our own experience. I am currently resident in London. My gas

sounds too much. Some clarity would make clear whether it was too much
or too little. On the other hand—this is possibly the only

incorporated in the final price of the gas or electricity product

on any side of the House, and support on all sides, for this
transparency amendment. Indeed, support has come not merely from all
sides of the House but from all sides of the green debate. Everybody
agrees that there should be transparency. Everybody agrees, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T19:29:25"></hs_TimeCode> noble Lord,
Lord Kerr, suggested, that there should be no hypocrisy. There is no
argument against this amendment other than a desire for concealment. A
desire for concealment is not a very reputable position for the
Government to take. As a strong supporter of this Government, I regret
that they should be in the business of promoting concealment, for that

the amendment is not carried and the Government do not get the credit
for introducing this transparency, sooner or later—I suspect it
will be sooner rather than later—one of our great newspapers,

Government are concealing the position and that consumers should be
told. Eventually the Government will have to give in. It will be a
great triumph for the <I>Daily Mail</I>, or whichever newspaper it is,
and it will be a great defeat for the Government. It is very foolish
for the Government to go into this knowing they will get—I do
not know whether this is a parliamentary expression—a bloody
nose. So I ask my noble friend to think again. She is skilful and
politically aware. Her officials are not—that is not their job.

Campbell-Savours hoped to get a knee-jerk reaction from his Front Bench
in support of this, and that was my initial inclination. I am in favour
of transparency for consumers. I am not in favour of concealing any
costs which make up the bill, including those imposed by the
Government, 
<?notus-xml column=277?>whether the charges were started under the previous Government or were,
like the carbon floor price, started by this Government. The problem
all Governments have with this is that it is all very well to argue for
this all going onto direct taxation—intellectually that must be
the case and in terms of fairness one can argue it—but I am
afraid that there are those in government, one of whom is not unknown
to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, who would object to significant amounts
of money coming from direct taxation. To be frank, I do not think any
Government would easily be persuaded, having put these charges on
consumer bills, to move them back to direct taxation. However, that
option is always
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110686000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110686000036">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T19:29:25"></hs_TimeCode>

joining the surrounding of the Minister on this because, while it is
right to seek transparency, it is not right to do so in order to attack
the Government’s green or social charges. We should look at the

thought was the right thing to do.</hs_para>

Finlay of Llandaff (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment before
the House today is greatly simplified from the one that I tabled in
Committee. It is a regulation-making power, and that is all. It would
allow the Government time to gather information from the review that
was helpfully announced today. Northern Ireland and Scotland have
already introduced a requirement to fit carbon monoxide alarms when new
or replacement boilers or heating appliances are installed in a
dwelling. In England and Wales a domestic carbon monoxide alarm is
required only when a new or replacement solid fuel appliance is
installed, and does not apply to other types of fossil fuel.</hs_para>

there has never been a death from carbon monoxide in the UK when an
audible alarm has been present. The first part of the amendment
concerns a recommendation from the inquiry by the All-Party
Parliamentary Carbon Monoxide Group, which I chair, which recommended
that the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998 be amended
to require all rented properties to be fitted with an audible carbon
monoxide alarm, manufactured to European Standard EN 50921. The
amendment’s wording would ensure that any property, including
local authority housing, rented housing, holiday lets, rented static
caravans and other high-risk properties received attention around
carbon monoxide that they currently lack. All carbon fuels, including
biomass, are covered in the text of the amendment.</hs_para>

I said in Committee, recorded figures on carbon monoxide poisoning are
the tip of an iceberg. The true morbidity and mortality remain
unrecorded. The current increases in fuel prices, along with the
increased cost of living, mean that many are likely to forgo the annual
servicing of appliances. Initiatives to increase home insulation have
decreased draughts in houses, effectively making them sealed units, so
that if carbon monoxide is produced the concentration steadily rises
and thereby endangers life.</hs_para>

second part of the amendment relates to fire and rescue services, such

<?notus-xml column=281?>to address the national absence of carbon monoxide alarms. It would
allow others who fit or service fuel sources or appliances or meter
fuel usage to supply, sell and fit an alarm. A co-ordinated fire rescue
service response was shown with smoke detectors. Before the regulations
changed, about 8% of homes had smoke detectors; now over 80% of

Baroness, for many years I have been concerned about the lack of action
in relation to carbon monoxide poisoning. As she said, the official
figures disguise the true extent of the problem. Because the official
figures have not really reflected the size of the problem, various

particularly important that it gives the Government a regulation-making

the tip of the iceberg but there is a real concern at the moment about
the cost of servicing appliances. If people put that off, particularly
because of concerns about the cost of living at the moment, the risk to

both at Questions and by bringing forward this amendment this evening.

I mentioned at Questions today, there are now warnings on the sale of
disposable barbecues, for instance, and Ofgem has placed a requirement
on gas distribution network operators to ensure that they raise
awareness. One of the important reasons why they are the right people
to raise awareness, rather than the suppliers, is that the network
providers are constant in the supply of gas to people’s homes as
they are in charge of the pipes, while consumers are encouraged often
to switch between suppliers in order to get the best deal that they can

rented accommodation. As I said earlier today, I am pleased to announce
that we have decided to extend the scope of the review announced a
couple of weeks ago, so that it considers whether there is a need to
require the installation of carbon monoxide alarms in privately rented
housing. We are working on the matters to be covered in this review but

we think about regulation, we need to consider how any regulatory

we must take all the necessary steps so that it is done in a

housing groups and landlords, are properly consulted. The last thing
that we would want would be ineffective regulation that did not result
in the outcomes that we all want—reduction in deaths and in the

planning to become pregnant to ensure a voluntary input of folates,
either by supplement or by folate-rich foods, in that crucial period
covering conception and the first 12 weeks. However, this policy is
known to fall on deaf ears in some socioeconomic groups, and does not
cover the issue of unplanned or unintended pregnancies. In some
countries, where bread is part of the staple diet, it has been found
that fortifying bread flour with folic acid can cover both the issues

conference. My initial reaction was, “It’s mass
medication”. But I soon realised it was not then, and it is not
now. By 2007, Her Majesty’s Government had been advised by the
independent Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition and the Food

concerns to rest. The study analysed data on 49,621 individuals in 13
evenly randomised trials and found that there was no significant effect
of folic acid supplementation on the incidence of cancer of the large

best figures I have—they are a little old but I am advised they
are the best—are those used by SACN, the Scientific Advisory
Committee on Nutrition, in its report, drawn to my attention by the
Shine charity. In England and Wales, there were 178 neural tube
defect-affected births from 853 neural tube defect-affected
pregnancies. That means that there were 675 terminations. In
Northern Ireland, there were 11 affected births and no terminations. In
Scotland, there were 49 affected pregnancies with 50%
terminations. That means that there were more or less 238 neural tube
defect-affected births and 913 affected pregnancies, with around
700 terminations. These will be late, following the 20-week
scan, when neural tube defects show. In summary, therefore, there are
150 to 200 babies born with neural tube defects leading to spina bifida
and other conditions, with a total of 750 to 1,000 pregnancies. Eighty
per cent of the neural tube defect-affected pregnancies are

I say diminishes my life-long support for a woman's right to chose, but
it is self-evident that decisions for termination based on neural tube
defect-affected pregnancies would decline with folate increases. More
than one in 1,000 pregnancies in the UK is affected each year. Folic
fortification has been shown in the countries that have a mandatory
policy to have prevented between 27% and 50% of cases of neural tube
defects. Based on these figures, we have a potential to save 100-plus
neural tube defect-affected births per year in UK; and significantly we
could prevent hundreds of late terminations every year. Putting it
crudely, the current reduction in the number of babies born with neural
tube defects is actually brought about by the termination of
pregnancies. I do not like the idea that in the past some DoH officials

normal circumstances, I would prefer that young women should all have a
good balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and leafy vegetables,
regardless of whether or not they were considering pregnancy, to give
them sufficient folic acid to prevent neural tube defects and, come to
that, a very large number of other subclinical conditions linked with
folic acid deficiency. Unfortunately, life does not work like that.
Many young people—women and girls in particular—lead
rather frenetic lives and tend to eat on the hoof. Food which takes
little preparation and cooking is the easiest way for them to get their
calories. Many have little idea of the nutritional values of the food
they eat and cooking a good, balanced meal comes very low in their
order of priorities. Others simply cannot afford to buy fresh green
vegetables and fruit on a regular basis. While some cereal and snack
manufacturers fortify their products with folic acid, these too might
be out of range for those on benefits. No amount of education or health
promotion material can overcome these
problems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110689000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110689000003">As

decide whether they wish to continue with the pregnancy. She has the

have stalled. Few people realise that, as well as calcium, our white
flour is already fortified with thiamine, iron and niacin. They also
ask why they should have to have their products made with flour
fortified to prevent disease in a very small minority. I believe very
strongly that, in the case of folic acid, flour should be fortified.

prevalence of neural tube defects started to fall before folic acid

the cause of spina bifida. The prevalence fell quite steeply for about
20 years but it has remained stubbornly at between eight and 15 per
10,000 pregnancies since the 1990s. One possible reason could be that
nearly half of pregnancies are unplanned; by the time a woman finds she

substantial part of the diet of those who cannot afford fresh fruit and
vegetables or other foods rich in folic acid, such as offal and pulses.

are checked as there is concern that high prenatal levels of folic acid

fortification, such as fluoride in the water, mentioned by my noble

that should be taken. I came to realise that it is probably a
reasonable idea if it can be done in the right way and not cause any

parents were also given a whole host of reasons why I had spina bifida.
My mother was blamed. She was told that she had not eaten enough
vegetables, even though she was virtually a vegetarian. My father was
then blamed because of other family conditions or illnesses which were
then a precursor. The final reason we were given was that it was more
common in areas of coal mining or industry, so therefore the figures
were much higher for the Welsh mining valleys, Nottingham and
Newcastle. I grew up in Cardiff; I do not know whether that is good or

pleased that there is better knowledge today. Although everything I
have read says that spina bifida was not hereditary, I and other family
members were told that there could be a slightly higher incidence of
the condition, and I was advised to take a double dose of folic acid.
Obviously I was able to take it because my daughter was part of a
planned pregnancy, but we must consider unplanned pregnancies and,
indeed, women taking folic acid for the correct amount of time. When I
was pregnant, it was not made that clear that it was meant to be for 12
weeks of pregnancy. I know that, in my own case, I experienced dreadful
day sickness—I dreamed that it might just become morning
sickness—and, as a result, I was never entirely sure of the
amounts I had taken or whether it had remained in my body. I took
several pills a day, just hoping that some of it would benefit me. I
treated taking folic acid in the same way as I thought about my diet; I

with interest the documents produced by the British Medical Association

Bland, the chief executive of Shine—the charity for people with
spina bifida and hydrocephalus—she indicated that we might well
have a situation where it seems many of us are more comfortable

that spina bifida in its severe form is indeed a nasty disorder. It
affects one or two in every 1,000 pregnancies, causes paralysis of the
legs, problems with bladder and bowel control and, in some children,
learning difficulties. It can cause serious lifetime problems and
distress both for the children and their families. On top of all that,

we can prevent—according to my figures—about 70% of cases
with a simple dietary manoeuvre; that is, by increasing the intake of
folic acid in women before they become pregnant. It was in 1991, 22
years ago, that a study by the Medical Research Council was the first
to show that we could prevent these neural tube defects by giving
mothers 4 milligrams of folic acid a day, before and during their
pregnancy. The incidence went down by about 70% which was a remarkable
discovery first made here in the UK. Even much smaller doses
were shown to be equally effective. Since then, it has been more or
less routine practice to recommend that folic acid should be given to
all pregnant
women.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110689000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110689000027">However,
the problem that soon arose was that simply prescribing it to women who
were already pregnant did little or nothing to prevent the disorder. It
had to be given before they were pregnant, because 
<?notus-xml column=292?>the defect arises very early in pregnancy. The neural tube closes at 23
to 27 days after conception; that is before the first period is missed.
By the time a woman realises she is pregnant, it is usually too late.
She has to take the folic acid before she is pregnant for it to be
effective and that immediately eliminates all those women who do not
plan their pregnancies. That is particularly the case, for example, in
single women and it is exacerbated in those with poor dietary habits
whose intake of green vegetables, the natural source of folic acid, is
limited. In fact, there is a linear relationship between the level of
folic acid in the red cells and plasma and the incidence of neural tube
defects. The higher the folate level, the lower the
incidence—that is a clear relationship.</hs_para>

that all women take it before they become pregnant? We inevitably come
to the conclusion that we should fortify our food. The
Government’s own Expert Advisory Group and COMA, the Committee
on Medical Aspects of Nutrition, have been repeatedly recommending that
we fortify our flour with folic acid over many years. The idea is that
everyone eating average amounts of bread will take about 280
micrograms, about a quarter of a milligram, of folate per day. It is a
very small amount but sufficient to prevent spina bifida in a majority
of cases. We in the UK have unfortunately not taken that advice, even
though more than 70 other countries around the world, including the USA
and Canada, supplement their flour with folic
acid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110689000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110689000029">Of
course, there is always a reluctance to add things to the diet that
everyone is going to eat. Noble Lords have talked about this. Worries
about side-effects and unexpected adverse events are always raised and
it is usually wise to be cautious. In the case of folic acid there were
worries about the possibility of two sorts of danger: that it could
cause cancer; and that it might cause a peripheral neuropathy in those
elderly people who were also deficient in vitamin B12. This is a
disorder of the nerves going to the arms and legs, a condition caused
by a combination of B12 deficiency and folic acid excess. So delay in
taking up the recommendations of COMA was inevitable until these
dangers could be
eliminated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110689000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110689000030">Now
we know from a huge number of studies that they have indeed been
eliminated. In the meta-analysis that noble Lords have referred to of a
large number of trials by Vollset and his colleagues in the last year,
trials covered almost 50,000 individuals given a largish dose of 5
milligrams a day for five years or more and there was no sign of an
increase in the overall number of all cancers or of any individual
specific type of cancer. Incidentally, these trials were done largely
in the belief that folic acid might prevent coronary artery disease. It
did not show that, but it did show that cancers did not increase, which
was a useful side-effect. Nor has there been any sign that the B12
deficient neuropathy I mentioned has increased in the population of
America or Canada where they have been fortifying their flour since
1998, 15 years ago. Incidentally, the manufacturers of breakfast
cereals—All-Bran and the like—routinely fortify them with
a range of vitamins, including folic acid. Perhaps the noble Baroness,
Lady Grey-Thompson, could take breakfast cereals; that might help
her.</hs_para>

is hard now to refute the scientific evidence, gathered from huge
populations, that supplementing the diet of everyone by an average of
280 micrograms a day of this vitamin is harmless to the population at
large. It clearly reduces the incidence of this nasty and burdensome
disease in our children. It is more than 20 years since we
discovered that we could prevent neural tube defects by this simple
measure. The discovery was made here in the UK and it is high time we

am delighted again to applaud my noble friend for raising this matter

Minister. My noble friend Lord Turnberg explained the science and it is
clear that there is very credible support for my noble
friend’s position. The Scientific Advisory Committee
on Nutrition’s 2006 report recommended mandatory fortification
of flour to the Government. That was endorsed in 2007 by the
Food Standards Agency board. More recently we have all, I think, had a
briefing from the British Medical Association which also
supports folic acid fortification of flour. I thought that the BMA was
very much to the point when it argued that the current guidance to
women to take folic acid supplements has a number of limitations. As
the noble Countess, Lady Mar, said it does not take account of
unplanned pregnancies and, given that almost half of all pregnancies in
the UK are unplanned, it is clearly an inadequate response. It is also
a fact that poor compliance with the advice to take supplements means
that women planning a pregnancy only marginally increase their
compliance with folic acid supplement use. The noble Baroness, Lady
Grey-Thompson, made some very powerful points about this and
about the very hard decisions parents
subsequently have to
make.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110689000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110689000033">Noble
Lords have already dealt very effectively with the concerns that have
been raised about the links between folic acid and cancer. The
Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, which advises the Food
Standards Agency, said that the evidence in relation to bowel cancer
was insubstantial and that any increase in cases could be down to
improved screening. It recommended that those deemed to be at greater
risk of colon cancer should receive precautionary advice on taking
extra supplements containing folic acid and that the situation should
be monitored. The Chief Medical Officer then requested further
investigation by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition into
the potential link between folic acid and colorectal cancer.
The committee upheld its previous recommendation, with an amended
recommendation to clarify the advice on supplement use for particular

conclusion, I shall ask the Minister a rather more general question
coming back to the issue of advice given by health visitors and
midwives in relation to vitamins and minerals generally. The reason I
do so is that in September 2012 in another place my honourable friend
Kate Green secured a Westminster Hall debate about the rise in the
incidence of rickets. She talked about vitamin D deficiency across
large sections of the population and quoted a study by the Clinical
Effectiveness Unit at Stockport which found a surprising lack of
awareness among health professionals about vitamin D across eight acute
and six primary care trusts in the north-west. Only 24% of health
visitors and just 11% of midwives reported having had training in
vitamin D supplementation. I realise that this is a little distant from
folic acid, but since the Government now put such reliance on advice
given to women, does the Minister think that, as part of a wider
response to the issues raised by my noble friend tonight, more needs to
be done to ensure that midwives and health visitors are adequately

enough particularly matters. That is why, since the 1990s, the
Department of Health has advised women who can become pregnant to take
folic acid supplements before conception and for the first 12 weeks of
pregnancy, and to increase their intake of folate-rich foods. That
advice is promoted as strongly as possible through all the channels we
use to communicate with women and health professionals. 
<?notus-xml column=295?>NICE guidance ensures that health professionals are equipped with
comprehensive advice on folic acid and on action to take with women who
may become pregnant.</hs_para>

disseminated through a variety of sources such as the NHS Choices
website, which sets out why folic acid is important for pregnancy and
gives guidance on taking supplements. The Department of Health also
provides funds to the charity Tommy’s to produce <I>The Young
Woman’s Guide to Pregnancy</I>, which advises young women to
take folic acid. Start4Life, a campaign to give the best start in life
to nought to two year-olds, gives information on five key healthy
behaviours during pregnancy, one of which is taking folic acid and
vitamin D supplements. Their leaflets are written in a friendly and
accessible style and are very popular with healthcare professionals as
a tool to facilitate conversation with parents and expectant parents.
The NHS Information Service for Patients offers to send e-mails and

remind women to take their folic

pregnant women and new mothers in very low-income families throughout
the UK who are supported by the Healthy Start scheme. More than 150,000
pregnant women and new mothers are eligible to claim vitamins through

pregnancies, but that there was a potential risk to some population
groups, particularly older people, including a potential increased risk
of bowel cancer. In 2007, the then CMO asked SACN to further consider
the evidence in this regard. In 2009, SACN’s majority view was
that the new evidence did not provide a substantial basis for changing
the original recommendation. However, it recommended 
<?notus-xml column=296?>fortification only if accompanied by a number of
other actions, including restricting voluntary fortification of foods

redress element of Part 6. I approve of the increase in protection for
consumers in the redress provisions in the Bill and have supported them
throughout. However, there is a dimension that is not there, and there
is one that has been discussed with successive Governments but has
never been fully put into operation. The present Government, in their
consultation through BIS on consumer rights and protection in general,
mentioned the possibility of moving to a system of collective
redress.</hs_para>

history of the scandals in relation to consumers underline the need to

overcharging, the failure in billing and the wrong billing, right up
until the very recent case where Ofgem fined ScottishPower, you will
see that thousands, and in some cases tens of thousands, of consumers

or through the courts, the ombudsman’s agenda is going to get
cluttered up and the courts are going to lead to individual decisions,
which may be different in different parts of the country. A form of
collective redress for everybody who has suffered from what the
regulator will have found to be a mistake, or an error, or a breach of
the licence or other regulations, affecting tens of thousands of

Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for this

redress for energy consumers. I agree with the noble Lord that
consumers need to get the redress that they are due by the most

of collective redress in the energy sector would not achieve these
aims. My concerns centre mainly on the time and cost of

noble Lord has said previously that collective redress offered a

litigation in that investigations are initiated by Ofgem to benefit all
affected consumers, with no legal fees to pay. These powers benefit
consumers without the need for consideration of the relative merits of
an opt-in or opt-out, as orders can be made on behalf of all affected
consumers, whether they come forward or not, including many who may not
have been aware that they have suffered a loss. The powers are
proportionate, and build on the redress available to consumers through
the ombudsman and the power to impose penalties on energy companies

redress, on the other hand, cuts across the role of the ombudsman as
the most cost-effective and simplest form of agreeing redress when
things go wrong. Collective redress opens the prospect of court action
becoming the first route to redress. I ask: what is wrong with that as
an approach? It is true that some would be happy if this were the case,
as collective redress inevitably requires third parties or
intermediaries to take action on the consumers’ behalf.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T21:00:25"></hs_TimeCode> the event
that a case is successful, these parties will seek to recover their
costs from either the pay-outs due to individuals or from the energy

introduces an entirely new cost that these companies will pass on to 
<?notus-xml column=300?>consumers.
Permitting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T21:00:40"></hs_TimeCode>

I do not think that the Minister is right in the description of
consumer law. You could write the regulations so that you would have to
go to the ombudsman before going to such a system. The cost to
consumers of starting a process in the court is prohibitive but, were
it a collective provision and the ombudsman had found in a certain way,
that cost would fall on no one.</hs_para>

it is clear that the Government are not prepared to pursue this issue

that the Minister has is not entirely in parallel with what is being
discussed in BIS and in the consultation on consumer protection in

frequently than in the normal buying and selling and contractual
arrangements throughout the economy. That is because everyone has
similar Bills and similar charges whereas in other places there are
differentiations to be made. Therefore, this is a prime potential

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments
relate to the strategy which will be required under Clause
136. As I indicated earlier, the clause itself should be beefed up. At
the moment the Government clearly think it can all be done by secondary
legislation. But whatever the substantive content of the strategy, and
whatever definition of fuel poverty is adopted, careful and regular
reporting and monitoring of progress on improving the energy efficiency
of the houses in which low-income households live, and on reducing the
total numbers of the fuel poor in our economy, are important to hold
the Government and the supply companies to account. This reporting
would also ensure that the policies the Government intend are pursued,
whether they are the current ones via the ECO or, to some
extent, the Green Deal, or whether they are new policies that the
Government come up with at a later
stage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110693000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110693000002">Noble
Lords earlier argued for it to be a taxpayer-resourced intervention in
improving energy efficiency. As my noble friend Lord O’Neill
said earlier, we need to measure the success of that policy in terms of
the energy efficiency of buildings, and to look year by 
<?notus-xml column=302?>year—and in particular to set target years—at how the
energy efficiency of our dwellings is improving, as other
noble Lords have acknowledged. Even now, after nearly 20 years of
activity in trying to improve the quality of our buildings, we fall far
short of the northern European standard in terms of insulation and
warmth retention. We are therefore far more afflicted by the resultant
fuel poverty than other equivalent
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110693000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110693000003">One
problem is consistency of reporting. We need to report on the
achievement of the objectives: on energy efficiency, and on reductions
of the number of the fuel poor; but we also need to report on the
effects of fuel poverty, and how we are managing to reduce those. Some
of those are set out in the amendment. There are references to
mortality rates due to fuel poverty; to the cost of fuel
poverty-related diseases to the NHS; to debt; and to emissions of
carbon dioxide, because this is an energy efficiency and carbon
reduction policy as well as a fuel poverty and social policy. These
should all be monitored and reported on, and checked against the
milestone targets which I hope the Minister will eventually come up
with in the
strategy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110693000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110693000004">The
other point is consistency with past data. There is a problem here
because there is some cynicism that a change of definition of fuel
poverty has statistically got rid of nearly 2 million homes without
anybody actually being any better off. Some people should have been
excluded from the total, but most people would regard that the majority
of those are still fuel poor, and the run of statistics we have had
from the year 2000 or even earlier onwards would be discontinued if the
change of definition also led to an end of those historic statistics.
We also have the complication that in Scotland, Northern Ireland and, I
think, Wales, the old definition is to be retained. Therefore, when we
look at UK numbers for the fuel poor, there will be an
inconsistency between the adoption of Professor
Hills’s definition and the government monitoring and
tracking that, and what is happening in the devolved Administrations,
which would mean that we could not have an overall UK figure.</hs_para>

time, but all I am suggesting is that for a few years we mandate that
the old series should continue so that the old definition—as I
say, we already have a 15-year run with it—should be extended at
least to 2018 and be reviewed at that point. For the first few years of
the strategy, the two criteria could be judged. There would be the new
definition, which will have a starting point in, say, 2014 or 2015 and
is the Government’s preferred definition—for the moment I
accept that—and a comparison with the old, historic trend. We
would then be able to see whether the change in definition led to a
change in outcome statistically and whether that change actually meant
something real on the ground. In some ways, the two might diverge
significantly, because while the criticism of the old definition was
that it was too price sensitive, the criticism against the new
definition is that it is not quite sensitive enough. In the end, the
judgment of poverty is that someone cannot afford something because the
price is too high. I fear that the Government will find that even if
they have a relatively successful policy on energy efficiency, if
prices continue to go up, that will not show in the figures. It is my
subjective judgment that that will be a problem.</hs_para>

I am saying tonight is that the Government should accept, for a limited
period, that we should run the two series together to see if they
diverge and whether there are any policy or future
monitoring conclusions to be drawn from that. I hope that the
Government can accept that, and that there should be systematic
reporting of the level of fuel poverty, the success of energy
efficiency activity, and of its outcomes and impacts in the terms of
these provisions. I beg to move.</hs_para>

Jenkin of Roding (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, has made a sophisticated case for his amendment. When I read
it, my first reaction was to say, “We have all agreed that the
Hills proposed definition is likely to be more effective in dealing
with real fuel poverty than the existing one that was suggested under
the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act”. Indeed, as I said
earlier today, having reread the debate on this subject that we had in
Committee, I had the impression that there was very little disagreement
that the new would be a good deal more effective than the
old.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110693000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110693000008">The
noble Lord has now given two reasons for running on. One is to be able
to have a continuous process whereby the old one goes on while the new
one is being introduced so that there is no gap, and with that I have
some sympathy. But if he is saying that the second reason for running
the two in parallel is so that you can compare one with the other, I
would find that more difficult. I am not sure how the officials would
manage to do that. If the old definition has been established by
Professor Hills’s report as really not being an effective
measurement of fuel poverty and therefore providing the basis for
annual reports, it would seem that the less one relies on it the
better, and the quicker one can go on to the new one the better.
However, it may be that I have misunderstood the noble Lord. I do not
think it can be used to compare; the only possible reason should be for
continuity, which I am sure could be achieved in other ways.</hs_para>

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to thank the noble Lord,
Lord Whitty, for his amendment. It sets out the issues that must be
contained within the strategy that will set out how we are going to
meet the target. As I mentioned earlier, we will publish the
strategy for consultation next year and intend to use this opportunity
to set out our plans for how we will tackle fuel poverty. I agree with
noble Lords that there are clear links between fuel poverty and health,
and a clear health benefit to the NHS by acting in this area. That is
why we already include excess winter death rates as part of the annual
statistics we publish on fuel poverty. We are working to better
understand the costs and benefits to the NHS and we will be building on
this within the strategy.</hs_para>

also suggests that the strategy covers a number of other issues such as
debt, the depth of fuel poverty and the number of children who are
living in fuel-poor households. These are all very important concerns.
It is for this reason that we already report widely within the annual
fuel poverty 
<?notus-xml column=304?>statistics and these issues are included. In
reference to the noble Lord’s query about the old and the new
definitions, I confirm that we will continue to include fuel poverty
numbers under the 10% definition. This is something to which we are
already committed, and it will continue to appear in the annual fuel
poverty statistics. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, is
reassured that the fuel poverty strategy will be a comprehensive one
and that it is not necessary or appropriate to set out the issues that
it will cover within the primary legislation. I trust that he will feel
reassured enough to withdraw his

saying that the method of reporting and the issues which we cover in
those reports will continue, I certainly welcome that. On the issue of
the measurement, I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and to
the House that I do not think Professor Hills’s definition is
necessarily a better one. I agree that there are defects in the old one
but I think there are also defects in the new one. Professor
Hills’s proposal of measuring the depth of fuel poverty as well
as the absolute numbers of fuel poverty is a very useful tool and I
strongly support it, but time will tell as to whether or not his
definition is better than the old
one.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110693000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0002.htm#13110693000012">I am
gratified that the Minister is saying that the series will be
continued, at least for some time. By implication she may have meant
for longer than is provided for in this amendment. That will give
continuity and time for the new series to build up because the new
definition will start from next year. We will not have much of a series
for very long. That will greatly help those who have campaigned long on
the basis of the 10% definition to understand how the policies are
impacting that, and to see whether or not the new definition is robust.
I am reasonably assured by the Minister, rather more than I expected to
be, and so I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

could be priced at less than block C, the premium tariff: discount
tariff over standard tariff over premium tariff. The block A tariff
would be universally available to all consumers and set at a level that
maximised the benefit to low-income households in blocks A and B. A

Worthington (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friend for tabling this amendment and for his pursuit of this issue in
other fora. It is correct that the way that electricity is priced at
the moment is illogical: the more we consume as a whole, the higher the
cost of producing the electricity. Once our demand rises, we have to
bring on marginal plant, which is less efficient and more costly,
pushing up the wholesale price for everyone. The people who consume the
most therefore cause us to carry a cost that we should not have to
bear.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110693000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0003.htm#13110693000032">It
should therefore be logical that we disincentivise the bringing on of
marginal plant by tariff pricing and tariff structures. However,
although the idea has been raised on many occasions, the moment has
never been found to make it a reality. I hope—and I think that
this will be the case—that once smart metering comes into play,
this will become an absolute no-brainer. At that point, when we have
detailed information about each individual household’s demand
across a given period of time, this will become enabled. At present,

Lords have touched on some of the issues. One of them is the question
of the variance in demand between households. It can be perfectly true
that you have two identical semi-detached houses with very different
energy bills, because of different socioeconomic circumstances. Someone
who is at home all day will have the heating on and that will increase
their bills. If you have a high occupancy rate—if you have
children, for example—your energy bills will go up. It is quite
difficult to identify the right point at which to say, “This is
a fair use of electricity and after this we are going to increase the
price”.</hs_para>

is not impossible. It should not be the case that electricity companies
incentivise greater usage and reduce the rate of tariffs after a
certain point of consumption. If we are not yet able to get to a fully
comprehensive rising block tariff system, then at least the Government
could perhaps make it clear that tariffs should not have such a
regressive effect that the highest price would be for the first units
of consumption and then there would be a reduction in the unit
price—that should be ruled out. The Prime Minister has indicated
that he has a desire to make tariffs simpler. The simplest thing would
be to have one unit price for everyone and for everything. Let us start
there, and if we can establish that principle and stop the
incentivisation of greater consumption, that will be a step in the
right direction.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord Forsyth, that would have been the case. In reality, there
will be very little difference in the way that billing is presented,
and certainly in the ability of the public to comprehend
billing.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110693000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0003.htm#13110693000042">I

to a decision made only a few weeks ago concerning Viking Energy, which
was looking to obtain a consent under Section 36 of the 1989 Act for a
wind farm in Shetland. There was a judicial review of that decision,
which was upheld by the Outer House of the Court of Session. That
has done something that this Energy Bill is trying to
prevent —that is, it has increased uncertainty for
investors—and changed completely the view within Scotland of
what is needed to obtain a Section 36 consent for a major 
<?notus-xml column=311?>power project over 50 megawatts. The judgment laid
down that the people who were applying needed a generating licence
before they could obtain that consent. That is not always the case and
I suggest that it should not necessarily be the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110696000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0003.htm#13110696000003">These
schemes tend to be joint ventures involving generating companies that
already have licences—in this case, Scottish and Southern Energy
was one of the major shareholders of Viking—which try to obtain
their Section 36 permission for the generating station to go ahead; it
could be wind power or any form of power. But clearly there has to be a
licence to operate before the project can go ahead and generate
electricity, so there is no question about the organisation that gets
the consent being competent and being able to move forward. Indeed,
given the amount of investment that is required for these projects over
50 megawatts—in this case, one-third of a
gigawatt—clearly there would be no financial backing if the
organisations were not seen as competent.</hs_para>

the border has introduced a great deal of uncertainty into the system
and made the progress towards investment in power generation far more
difficult. It has also put into question those Section 36 consents that
perhaps have already been granted at a time when the operator did not
have a licence. I would be very interested to hear how my noble friend

understand that the Scottish Government have appealed against that
decision to the Inner House of the Court of Session, and that the
appeal will take place in February and March. Once again, that causes a
hiatus in investment. It means that there is great uncertainty over
future investment in power in what is a particularly important part of
the UK for renewables. Therefore, I have tabled this amendment in order
to bring clarity and ensure that the way in which this system was
always thought to operate is reinstated. I should add that within
England and Wales this is not an issue, as I understand it, because
there has been consequent legislation, either primary or secondary

of the matter is that this whole saga arose because of the Viking
project in Shetland, with over 100 turbines, where there was
considerable local opposition. The project is being promoted by the
Shetland Islands trust, which has got the oil money—and a large
number of the trustees are councillors in Shetland—together with
Scottish and Southern Energy. They are the people who are promoting
this project. There was very considerable local opposition to this
project, but the council decided that it was not conflicted, even
though the Shetland trust was a party to the development. As a result,
there was no public inquiry. The Scottish Ministers in the Scottish
Government gave the project the go-ahead. Some local opposition sought
judicial review of that decision, which went to the Court of Session,
which is the equivalent of the High Court in
England.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311072000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0003.htm#1311072000003">Former

anyone who is planning on producing a power plant which includes a wind
farm should have a licence from Ofgem before planning approval can be
granted. When the judge asked the parties to the development who had

can think of no other case. The normal practice would be to stay any
development until such time as an appeal had been considered. What I
very strongly object to about the amendment is that it would take away
the legal position that has been established for many years, and which
has been confirmed by the court, in a retrospective manner. It would
create a situation in which any Tom, Dick or Harry could apply for
permission to establish a wind farm—or, I guess, any other form
of generation. Those tests about their ability to meet environmental

them.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="1311072000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0003.htm#1311072000005">This

continue in this way. If you look at it from the point of view of the
objectors, they have gone to a judicial review, won their
case—and everyone knows how difficult it is to win a case on
judicial review—and the Scottish Government are just saying that
they are going to ignore that. Should this House to seek to overturn
the effect of that judgment, when people are talking in terms of the
need to support “our renewable energy ambitions”? Our
renewable energy ambitions must carry public consent. This is no way in

Mackay of Clashfern (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is some little

your Lordships know, in order to generate, transmit or supply
electricity you must have a licence and there is a pretty good reason
for that. Section 36, which my noble friend mentioned, provides for an
application for consent to construct or operate a power 
<?notus-xml column=314?>station. Of course, a wind farm is a generation system which amounts to
a power station. In order to operate that you must have a licence, or
have an exemption from a licence, usually because the power station you
want to operate is very small. It does not seem very strange to require
that as a condition for applying for a station. It would seem a little
odd that the relevant authorities could grant consent for a station if
you were not authorised to operate it. It could happen, I suppose, but
it seems a little unlikely. Therefore it is not at all surprising that
it is assumed in the definition of the conditions for consent that that
would be
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311072000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0003.htm#1311072000010">Schedule 9
of the Electricity Act 1989 is a set of requirements for the protection
of the environment, basically, which a person—it is described in
the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson—who is either a
licence holder or exempt for a licence must take account of in his
proposals. It is pretty obvious that the proposals are for the
construction of a generating station and that you would therefore be a
person who would have a licence to operate the generating station if,
in fact, it is agreed and consented to by the relevant
authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311072000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0003.htm#1311072000011">The
judgment of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Clark, which is well
reasoned and a little longer than my speech so far, is just to that
effect. Schedule 9 starts with the condition that you are either a
licence holder or exempt and then you have to ensure that your
proposals, in effect, do not damage the amenity, or the environment.
That is the crux of this and I find her reasoning rather convincing. In
fact, it is what I always understood. As I say, it is a long time since
I understood it, but it was my understanding at
the time. The last application I made, as it happens, was
for Torness power station, which was the last nuclear power
station to be built in Scotland and is now coming near its
decommissioning. I was under the instruction of the noble Lord, Lord
Tombs, who was at that time the chairman of the South of Scotland
Electricity Board whose station it was. Anyway, so far as I have
an interest in this matter it is a very aged interest and it
has nothing to do with finance or anything of that
sort.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311072000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-0003.htm#1311072000012">In my
submission, it seems that what the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Clark, who was a law officer in the previous Government, has decided is
right. However, it is, of course, subject to appeal and as the noble
Lord, Lord Teverson, said, the appeal is to be a reclaiming motion,
strictly speaking, in the Scottish terminology, and to be heard by the
Inner House of the Court of Session in February. The rule in relation
to sub judice does not apply when we are discussing legislation, so we
are free to discuss this matter, but I think that the judgment of the
noble and learned Baroness, Lady Clark, is extremely cogent and I will
look forward to hearing what happens on appeal. In the mean time, that
is the highest assertion of what the law of Scotland is, and, indeed,
for that matter, anywhere else where the same rules apply. In the law
of Scotland the Supreme Court of Scotland, the Court of Session, has
decided that to be the fact. Therefore it is highly undesirable for
this House to alter that position at this moment. It seems pretty
sensible that before you get consent to erect a power station you
should be qualified to operate it. As I said, that is the crux of the
decision.

the judgment says and my noble friend Lord Forsyth has made his view
known about how the Scottish Government approach these matters. I do
not particularly wish to comment on what they have done so far as I do
not know fully enough the facts about these other applications.
However, certainly in so far as the application from Shetland is
concerned, there is no doubt that the decision of the Court of Session
until reversed will set that consent aside. There is no question at all
of going ahead to erect the station in Shetland at present. That would
be completely without sanction, because the judge has set aside the
consent as being unlawful. The rule of law will certainly be applied in
Shetland, so far as that is concerned; the noble Lord has said whether
the Shetland law applies more generally, and I will leave it with what

However, when I saw that my noble friend Lord Forsyth had tabled an
amendment that seemed to be almost in diametric opposition to the
preceding amendment—we have not yet reached my noble
friend’s amendment—it seemed that there was probably
something of interest to be debated. Having heard what has been said, I
am glad that I was here to hear it, and I am appalled at what I have

own views on windmills, which I first made clear in this House some 12

do not deliver power when the wind is too strong or when there is no
wind at all; and when they do deliver power, there is so little of it
that it is completely worthless and has to be backed up by other forms
of energy. I will not repeat all those views again to the House

cheerfully setting aside a judgment in the High Court in anticipation

referred to his time in the Scottish Office, and my noble and learned
friend Lord Mackay referred to his experience many years back. I was
present at the opening of the Torness power station, although I had no
hand in its design or in the legalities behind it. However, I served in

That is the fundamental issue that we are addressing underneath these
two amendments. The issue of the licence is fundamental, and this
amendment seems to set aside one of the few controls that are in place
to try to impose some kind of discipline and proper judgment on the
relevant importance of windmills in Scotland. We read every day of how
the country is being covered with them like a rash, ruining the
environment and all attraction to tourism, with no regard to the future
or to the value of these excrescences. Therefore, setting aside my

Mackay of Clashfern, as he laid out very clearly the position of the
law without referring to windmills or any other type of energy source.
The judgment referring to planning consent under Section 36 of the
Electricity Act 1989 can be made only when the applicant, at the time
of making the application, holds a licence to generate electricity
under the Act or holds an exemption from this requirement, as my noble
friend Lord Teverson pointed out. This judgment is being appealed and
we are monitoring the position carefully. Given that the appeal is
under way it would be premature, and indeed inappropriate, at this
stage to adopt a legislative amendment without knowing what the
outcomes were. Any legislative change would need
to be considered in the full light of the outcomes of this
case and it would be a mistake to assume that the judgment of the Outer

Teverson:</Member></B> My Lords, this was tabled as rather a probing
amendment, given the situation that has arisen, and I am grateful to
noble Lords for their 
<?notus-xml column=317?>contributions. I do not wish to detain the House on this for too long
but I will say that this has nothing to do with retrospection; I
absolutely disagree that someone who develops a wind farm or any other
energy-generating station over 50 megawatts is necessarily going to be
the operator. It is a fact in industry in Britain and worldwide that
the developer is often not the operator, in whatever industry we may
talk about—they are two entirely separate processes. If you took
the view that they had to be the same legal person then you would
probably have to go back to 17th-century economics, let alone
21st-century ones. It does not work that way any more. It would also
bring the practicalities back into line with the English and Welsh
situation. In no way does this amendment make any judgment about
whether people should be able to judicially review such decisions;
clearly they should be able to do so. I would hope that such actions
would not be vexatious, and I am sure that this one was not. Indeed,
there was a judgment parallel to the licensing one concerning the
wildlife directives, on which I make no judgment at all. It might have
been completely valid in terms of their
application<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T22:08:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

was simply trying to bring the situation back to some certainty and to
the situation that was understood prior to this judgment. That is not
in itself retrospective. However, I am persuaded by the Minister that
perhaps the right course is for this to go through the appeal
process—I certainly do not think that it is a good idea for
Parliament to interfere with that—and then the situation should
be looked at. I am highly persuaded by the argument put
forward by my noble friend Lord Forsyth about the
reaction of the Scottish Government, in that clearly the rule of law is
the rule of law wherever we are within the United Kingdom, and I would
never wish 
<?notus-xml column=318?>to pull the carpet from under that important principle in how we live
our public life. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

Storey (LD):</Member></B> I will be quite brief; I do not have all my
papers together. I feel that all of us in this Room realise the
importance of this piece of legislation. We are looking to support the
work that has been going on. The needs of children with special
educational needs are not purely educational, or purely to do with
health or social care; a combination of provision might be needed. For
the first time, as it says on the label, parents will be supported by
this legislation and will not have to go through a great difficult
bureaucratic system. Their children will have a plan that will clearly
spell out their needs. I say again how much I appreciate the revised
code of practice, which is excellent and shows clearly the steps that
need to be taken.</hs_para>

appeal against the fact that they have not succeeded in gaining a plan,
or if there are aspects of the plan that they are not happy about, we
should make it as easy as possible. As it says, this legislation
concerns children and families; it is family-friendly and
children-friendly. The notion that parents and the child or young
person then have to go through a labyrinthine method to resolve issues
seems to go against the grain of what we are trying to achieve. As the
document says, we are supporting parents all the way through. When
there is an appeal, the code of conduct rightly refers to arbitration
and how it can be resolved. However, if you then have to take your
“complaint” somewhere, you do not want to have to go to
three different bodies. You want to be able to take it to one person or
one body who can sort it out for you one way or another. That seems to
be in the whole spirit of this
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110666000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110666000006">Without
pre-empting what the Minister will say, I guess that he will point out
that we are talking about very different animals here. Health people
are very different from education people and local authorities. I
understand that, and that it might cause problems in 
<?notus-xml column=62?>trying to have that single point of appeal. My preference is to have a
single point of appeal so that parents know where they are going and
for it to be included in the code of conduct. If that is not possible,

Hughes of Stretford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I support Amendment
181, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Storey, to which I have added my
name. I shall also speak to Amendments 182 and 272. To some extent, we
are rehearsing today, in these amendments, some of the arguments that
we had earlier this week about social care. They concern the
fundamental question of how serious the Government are about
instigating a new system that is integrated right through from the
point of early identification, assessment, provision and
appeal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110666000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110666000008">As the
Bill stands, we have integrated assessment, at least in the EHC plans,
but we do not have equal accountability in terms of integration of
provision because of the social care situation. Here we do not have
integration from the very important perspective of parents’ and
children’s experience in relation to appeals. Therefore, I
strongly support Amendment 181, which would add social care
and healthcare provision specified in EHC plans to the First-tier
Tribunal as a mechanism of appeal. I would be grateful if, in his
reply, the Minister would go beyond what he has already said to us,
which is that there are established routes of complaint about social
care through local authority complaints procedures and the Local
Government Ombudsman, and clear and specific routes of redress within
the NHS, its complaints processes and the health
ombudsman<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T15:51:04"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T15:51:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110666000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110666000009">Anybody
who has tried to help a family to negotiate those two avenues of appeal
will know how complicated they are. In addition, it is very important
that, in relation to the substance of the complaint—as opposed
to maladministration—they do not end up with an independent
adjudication between the views of the complainant and the views of the
service provider. The parents in this case would have to, for example,
fully exhaust the local authority’s own complaints procedures as
a first step; that could take many months. Of course, that adjudication
is not independent; it is the local authority adjudicating on the
complaint. They can then go to the Local Government Ombudsman, but that
person will adjudicate only on the principle of
maladministration—that is, on whether the authority has not
followed the proper procedure. He will obviously not adjudicate on the
substance of the
complaint<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T15:52:15"></hs_TimeCode>. It is

parent has to negotiate those two systems, it can take a very long
time. Many noble Lords will have had a number of pieces of
correspondence from Jane Raca, who is a lawyer and author and has a 13
year-old, very disabled son. She outlines the detail of the Local
Government Ombudsman procedure and shows that it takes months and
sometimes years. I know from my previous constituency experience that
that is the case and, furthermore, it does not actually judge

point is the one made by the noble Lord, Lord Storey, that—by
their nature, and this is very welcome—EHC plans are meant to
integrate an assessment around social care, health and special
educational needs. A severely disabled child is likely to have needs in
all three categories, so a parent might have concerns or complaints
about all three categories of need. Under the current arrangements, as
the noble Lord, Lord Storey, said very clearly, they would be faced
with the almost impossible task of appealing through three different
systems at once, at the same time as coping with a very disabled child
and probably other children in the family. That is just not reasonable.
If we came at this through the vision of the parent contemplating that
system, it would look
impossible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T15:53:54"></hs_TimeCode>. It

a more detailed point. It is clear that the parent can appeal to the
Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal, or SENDIST, about
the educational provision. As for health, the local authority must
include in the EHC plan, health provision reasonably required by the
learning difficulty or disability that causes the special educational
needs, and health commissioners must secure that provision. However, it
appears that the health commissioner has a veto. The draft regulations
say that the health commissioner must agree the health provision. This
raises the question: what recourse has the parent if the local
authority does not include the health provision in the plan or the
health commissioner does not agree
it?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110666000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110666000017">If the
health provision is directly related to and supports the educational
provision—for example, speech and language therapy delivered at
school—the parent can appeal to SENDIST. However, if it is
purely health provision—for example, if it is delivered at
home—what opportunity does a parent have? I ask the Minister:
what opportunities do parents have to challenge its non-provision or
non-inclusion in the plan? The Government may answer by referring to
the NHS complaints procedure but, quite apart from the point that this
involves the parent pursuing a second and separate challenge, I am not
sure that a complaints procedure is really the most effective way of
enforcing the provision of something to which they feel they are
entitled.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110666000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110666000018">Similar

noble<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:04:40"></hs_TimeCode> Lords will
know that the Bill is designed to bring education, health and social
care together, for the first time, in a joint enterprise to commission
and make appropriate provision for children and young people with
special educational needs. The child or young person and their family
will be at the centre of the new arrangements and have an enhanced role
in deciding what is in the EHC plan. That will improve the experience
of children, their parents and young people, and the Bill will give
them a more active role in agreeing the provision that should be made
and ensuring that it is made. This is the joined-up system that the
Green Paper talked about creating. We believe—and certainly
hope—that this will make the system less adversarial and mean
that fewer people will want to appeal to the tribunal.</hs_para>

parents’ experience of the system is being borne out in the
pathfinders. For example, in Hartlepool, the new process of assessment
is wholly transparent, with children, parents and young people fully
involved at all stages and able to contribute to the content of the EHC
plan alongside professionals. It also includes a simplified complaints
and comments procedure to help parents and young people seek redress
across all areas of the process locally, if it should become necessary.
That is just the sort of innovative local arrangement that we want to
see, improving the relationships between parents, young people and
local authorities, and facilitating local resolution of disputes.
However, it would be silly to deny that, despite the improvements the
Bill will bring, there will continue to be people who are unhappy about
the provision set out in EHC plans. I quite understand that for those
among that cohort who want to complain about two or more elements in
the 
<?notus-xml column=66?>EHC plan, it would seem simpler to be able to appeal to one place, the
tribunal, so having the tribunal as a single point of redress initially
sounds attractive. However, there are reasons why I think this would be
the wrong course to
take.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110666000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110666000027">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:05:15"></hs_TimeCode>
would not be right to expand the tribunal’s remit to cover all
health and social care provision set out in EHC plans. We have already
debated at some length, when dealing with earlier clauses, why it would
not be right to create an individually owed duty for the social care
provision in a plan. That could lead to the marginalisation of other
children in need under Section 17 of the Children Act and harmfully
affect local authorities’ ability to make the necessary social
care provision across all children in their areas. Extending the
tribunal’s remit so that it could deal with social care appeals
could potentially mirror that unwanted consequence even if there was
not an individually owed duty. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes,
said, we have rehearsed these arguments and I do not wish to go over
them again, but I am sure that we will return to this issue on Report
and I am very happy to discuss it further with noble Lords in the mean
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110666000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110666000028">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:06:12"></hs_TimeCode>
say that it would “potentially” mirror that unwanted
consequence because including appeals about social care in the
tribunal’s remit as the Bill is currently drafted would change
the nature of the decisions the tribunal could take. Whereas the
tribunal would be able to tell local authorities what special
educational provision must be set out in a plan, without an
individually owed social care duty the tribunal would be able to take
judicial review-type decisions only about social care provision. That
is, the tribunal would have jurisdiction to review only the local
authority’s decision, with powers to quash and remit it for
further consideration—consideration which might result in the
local authority making the same
decision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110666000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110666000029">Your<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:06:58"></hs_TimeCode>
Lordships may well be saying to yourselves, “There’s an
individually owed duty in health under this Bill, so at least you
should extend the tribunal’s remit to cover health”.
However, that individually owed duty in health is a duty to make the
health provision set out in a plan following clinical judgments taken
in the light of the wider duties of clinical commissioning groups and
the NHS to secure services to meet all the reasonable health needs of
all children. Widening the tribunal’s remit to cover health
would undermine these commissioning arrangements. It would establish
unequal treatment of children with serious health needs by giving a
privileged position to those with SEN. It would be difficult to justify
children with SEN and health difficulties having stronger rights of
redress than, say, children with cancer, neurological conditions,
long-term conditions such as epilepsy or diabetes and mental health
conditions who do not have SEN. To avoid creating these inequalities
between children and young people, it would be better if the existing
and well established routes of complaint in health and social care were
used rather than the
tribunal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:08:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110666000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110666000030">In
social care, Section 26 of the Children Act 1989 provides the framework
for the complaints procedure for those under 18 which local authorities
must establish. In health, the relevant legislation prescribes that a
responsible body must acknowledge the complaint 
<?notus-xml column=67?>within three days and they must offer the complainant the opportunity to
discuss the timing and procedure for resolving the complaint. Once that
has been agreed, the complaint must be investigated and, “as
soon as possible” after completing the investigation, a written
report must be sent to the complainant explaining how the complaint has
been considered, the conclusions of the report and any remedial action
which has been taken or is proposed to be taken. This procedure could
cover both what provision is set out in a plan and complaints about
delivery of the plan. Of course, it is vital that the parents of
children with EHC plans and young people with plans, particularly the
smaller group who want to complain about more than one area of the
plan, know how to do so. The Bill makes provision for parents and young
people to be given information about the routes of complaint that are
open to them. Clause 26, headed “Joint commissioning
arrangements”, requires local authorities and clinical
commissioning groups to work together to offer joined-up advice,
information and responses to families and to establish a clear
complaints procedure relating to education, health and care provision.
The outcome of that work will be available through the local
offer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110666000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110666000031">The new
code of practice will require that impartial information, advice and
support should be commissioned through joint arrangements and should be
available through a single point of access with the capacity to handle
initial phone, electronic or face-to-face inquiries. It will also
encourage clinical commissioning groups to ensure that relevant
information is available at this single point of access as well as to
include information on their local health offer on their own website. A
one-stop shop will be simpler and much more parent and young
person-friendly than potentially having to go to more than one place
for advice on a range of issues, including how to complain.</hs_para>

that we are looking carefully at the best ways of achieving a single

tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady Jones. When this
amendment was debated in another place, it was pointed out that some of
the information requested by it is already published by the Ministry of

information that is being asked for by this amendment, such as the
amount local authorities spend on defending each case, would just
increase contention in the system rather than reduce it. Highlighting
how much money was spent on legal representation could create real
tension between parents and local authorities. We know, anecdotally,
that each party often says that they engaged legal  
<?notus-xml column=68?>representation only because the other side did. If this amendment is
designed to highlight poor practice by local authorities and to provide
a basis for improving it, I believe the Bill already provides other
avenues for doing so. Children, parents and young people will be able
to highlight what they feel is inadequate provision through their role
in the local offer. Local authorities will be jointly commissioning
services with clinical commissioning groups to make sure that the right
provision is available. The Bill is promoting better assessment
arrangements, which, as I say, will mean that fewer parents and young
people will want to appeal to the tribunal and the mediation will offer
the chance to resolve differences before appeals are registered. In
view of what I have said, I urge the noble Baronesses not to move the

by the noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady Jones, relates to a
recommendation from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee. I reassure noble Lords who may be concerned that we have
preserved the grounds for appeal and extended them to young people over
compulsory school age. The appeal regulations set out clearly and in
one place for the first time the mechanics for notices related to
appeals, the powers the tribunal has when deciding appeals, time limits
for compliance with tribunal decisions and what happens with unopposed
appeals. We are currently consulting on these regulations and will take
account of responses when we finalise them. They will be laid in the
House for approval by negative procedure.</hs_para>

and Regulatory Reform Committee recommended that the tribunal’s
powers when deciding appeals should be in the Bill rather than in
secondary legislation and asked for an explanation of why this approach
is being taken. Alternatively, it suggested that the regulations should
be subject to the affirmative procedure, as Amendment 272 seeks. We
have put the tribunal’s powers in regulations to make them
simpler for the reader of this legislation. Instead of having the
tribunal’s powers to determine appeals scattered over the
legislation, as they are in the Education Act 1996, we want to bring
them together in one place, along with the mechanics for how we expect
an appeal to proceed. Given that this is what we are seeking to achieve
by these regulations, I believe that the negative resolution procedure
is proportionate.</hs_para>

183 and 184, regarding mediation, are in this group. It is important
that the whole of the mediation process set out in the Bill is seen by
parents and young people to be independent of the local authorities.
There are two stages to the mediation process. First, the parents or
young people contact a mediation adviser to be given information about
the mediation process. Currently, the Bill makes clear that the
mediation adviser cannot be someone who is employed by a local
authority. If the parent or young person decides to go to mediation,
the local authority must arrange it within 30 days. Currently there is
no parallel provision in the Bill to make clear that the person who
conducts the mediation must also be independent of the local authority.
These amendments make the necessary changes to the Bill to ensure that
mediators will be independent.</hs_para>

the difficulties of parents in accessing more than one tribunal. That
is right. Has the Minister reflected on the message it gives to those
people we are asking to integrate a service? A lot of people doubt that
that can happen and will not take the Government seriously on this. If
you really want to change the culture of three separate public
services, you must not give them an excuse not to make the change.
Throughout the discussion of this Bill, we have said that it is not
about passing a law but about changing the culture. Having such a
pivotal part of the whole procedure still split into three separate
parts is actually saying, “At the end of day, we could not do
it. We wanted to integrate, but when it got to the tough bit, the bit
about the appeal, we, the Government, could not do it”. The
naysayers will say, “There you are. We told you it
couldn’t be done”. I know it is not the Minister’s
intention, but what will happen is that that will ripple down the
system, and people will say there that there is another inconsistency
in what the Government say and that they say one thing and then do a
different thing. The bit of the process that is the Government’s
responsibility is the appeal. If we cannot change government culture
and get it integrated, we are undermining genuine attempts by the
Government to change the culture further along the

amendment is to specify the territorial limits to where councils are
expected to fund arrangements. I declare an interest as a
vice-president of the Local Government Association. Protecting children
and helping to provide for their future is, I am sure we all agree, one
of the most important things that councils do. I therefore
wholeheartedly welcome most of the provisions in the Bill, but I am
concerned about certain measures in Clause 58 that would enable local
authorities to arrange special educational provision for a young person
with an EHC plan outside England and Wales. This clause enables local
authorities to make provision in an institution that specialises in
providing for special educational needs and gives them power to pay for
or contribute to the costs of the child or young person who attends
such an institution, which might, quite rightly, include travelling and
accommodation costs for someone to accompany the child or young
person.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110674000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110674000002">This
clause gives local authorities the power—not a duty—to
make this provision, but demands on resources at the moment, as we all
know, make it difficult to envisage the circumstances when local
authorities would 
<?notus-xml column=72?>realistically be able to arrange special educational provision outside
the UK. I am concerned that, without the extent of this clause being
specified, local authorities might be expected to arrange provision in
countries outside the United Kingdom. It might well be in the United
States, for example, or in the Middle East, and this would be extremely
expensive for a local authority to provide. It would certainly raise
expectations that the local authority would do so. Parents may take
cases to appeal if my amendment is not accepted. The amendment would
provide for special educational needs provision to be arranged
elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but not in other countries. I think
this is reasonable, and I beg to

Attlee (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Baroness, Lady Greengross, for moving her amendment, although initially
I thought it did not have the effect that she desired. Children and
young people should be placed in the right setting to meet their needs.
It is right that if the appropriate setting is in either Scotland or
Northern Ireland, local authorities should have the power to place
children and young people there and meet or contribute to the costs of
the placement. The Bill as drafted would allow for such
placements.</hs_para>

line with what the noble Baroness said, Clause 58 is drafted
in the way it is, mentioning England and Wales in particular, because
the Bill covers England and Wales. Clause 58 allows local authorities
to place children and young people with EHC plans anywhere else in the
world, including Scotland and Northern Ireland, and to meet or
contribute to the costs of the placement. I acknowledge the noble
Baroness’s point about the costs, but they can still do it.
There are a very few cases where children have been placed outside the
UK. Unfortunately, the effect of the noble Baroness’ amendment
would be that local authorities would still be able to place children
and young people in schools or colleges in Scotland and Northern
Ireland but they would not be able to pay or contribute towards the
costs.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110674000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110674000005">On the
noble Baroness’s aim of specifying the limits of what local
authorities are expected to provide, she is right to seek to clarify
the extent of local authorities’ responsibilities for arranging
provision outside the UK. As she said, this is a power, not a duty. It
replicates the current arrangement and does not place a demand on local
authorities. I hope, with that explanation, the noble Baroness will
feel able to withdraw her amendment in due

Eaton (Con):</Member></B> I found it interesting that the Minister said
that very few people use the opportunity to be placed abroad. If it is
on the face of the Bill to this extent, it might become more attractive
to want to go further afield. It might become a fashion to seek support
from other countries, where sometimes we hear of innovative things that
are not necessarily proven. I would be seriously
concerned—knowing that local authorities could potentially have
huge black holes in years to come—about how on earth this will
be funded. Even if it involves only a few children, it will be a
sizeable bill. When local authorities are in 
<?notus-xml column=73?>danger of going bankrupt in some places, it is inappropriate to impose
an open-ended commitment on them. I realise that it is an
option—it is not something that is being forced on local

Addington (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I draw my attention and that of
the Committee to the subject of apprenticeships and dyslexia and
special educational needs generally. In doing so, I return to a subject
which I feel I have imposed on Members of this House rather too often
over the past few years. Although I suspect that one or two noble Lords
present will have heard everything about it, most have heard some of it
and some have heard most, so I apologise for going over the ground
again. However, it all goes back to the 2009 Act, brought in by the
previous Government, and the principle that people should be able to
pass a qualification in English and maths. At the time, I said that
that requirement would make things extremely difficult for those in the
dyslexic spectrum, and received a degree of assurance that it would not
be used as a
barrier.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110674000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110674000014">I
then said, “Oh, that’s done” and forgot about it.
Just over a year later, I received the first of a series of
communications from Lynn McCann about her son David, who had passed all
the components of a carpentry course, except for the English
requirement because he was dyslexic. The normal way of getting through
an exam if you have a problem with dyslexia is—we touched on
this earlier with my assistive technology amendment—to dictate
the exam to someone. It is nice and simple; it is easy for a person to
programme. This cannot be done for this qualification for the simple
reason that you have to pass it yourself.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110674000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110674000015">The logic behind it
seemed quite overwhelming at the time. The big employers had said that
they wanted people who were good at certain things, such as basic
skills in English and maths. When you think about that for a few
seconds it starts to fall apart because employers also want people who
do not get sick, who do not have children who get sick and who do not
ask for pay rises. These are all attractive things to
employers.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110674000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110674000016">So<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:35:51"></hs_TimeCode>
far, we have a situation where people cannot take the exam. When I
first raised this—it was more than three years ago so I
apologise for the brief history lesson—I was told,
“Let’s go and meet the Minister”. The Minister
said, “That’s ridiculous, let’s sort it
out”. I then went to my first big meeting, where I was told that
there was a problem, and then to another meeting 
<?notus-xml column=75?>where I was told that the legislation states that the candidate has to
pass the exam, we cannot do anything about it and assistive technology
cannot be used because it is a test of their skills. I have since
discovered that that is rubbish. It can be done and the main area of
concern is apparently the formatting of the exam; that is, the way that
it is written down in the computer language is not compatible with
assistive technology. Therefore, it does not read it back properly and
the types of communication get into
trouble.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110674000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110674000017">In
the course of this debate I may hear that this has changed. If I hear
that it has all changed, is all wonderful and tomorrow we can go away
and forget about this, nobody will be quicker out of the door than me.
However, I suspect that that will not be the case. We ask ourselves:
why is this important? I have heard some pretty dreadful things from
officials in this case. One which I played for a laugh last
time—I do not think I will do it again—was somebody who
said, “Well, nobody’s complained about it so it
can’t be a big problem”. I said, “You mean nobody
has written to you or sent you a long e-mail”. It is good; it
still works. At the time, his face went through an interesting change
of colour as he realised what he had said. Before that, I had heard
that nobody would lose their job. To go back to David McCann, no, he
would not lose his job because he works for his father. I suggest that
changing his job without this qualification is like stamping
“NEET” across his forehead and sending him out
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110674000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110674000018">I
realise that I have done the classic thing that everyone with dyslexia,
or on any disability spectrum, does and used myself as too much of an
example. Many dyslexics might get by with support, even taking a
written, or in this case a keyboard-based, examination. However, my
Amendments 190 and 194 suggest that support should be provided for
apprenticeships within the college structure. At the moment, there is
not much teaching done by qualified teachers, and there is no desire or
embracement. As the noble Baroness,
Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:38:36"></hs_TimeCode> Morris,
said, the culture for providing assistance is not there. The amendment
makes it
explicit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110674000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110674000019">Amendment
192A makes it explicit that the technical support should be included. I
am sorry to jump around a bit—we dyslexics do that—but
the argument against technical support is an interesting one. I have
subsequently heard that to reformat and include it would be against the
security of the examination. You would think this was so serious that a
nuclear launch code was intrinsic to this English assessment exam. A
dyslexic who could memorise and do the exact test for this examination
is not a dyslexic. Spellings cannot be restored and sequential thought
in the areas of the brain that handle language do not work well enough
for that. So that is one group who could not cheat at this, and I
suspect that there are a few others who could not do the English
language test
either<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:39:48"></hs_TimeCode>. The
maths test is also a problem, especially as I have it on good authority
that anyone who uses strange language to describe the information and,
if it is written down, does not understand the words, cannot work with
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:40:02"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:40:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

for apprenticeships, a system for saying that you have acquired a
practical skill should be accessible to those who have disabilities. 
<?notus-xml column=76?>I started with dyslexia, but I discovered that that is not
the only group affected. The Alliance for Inclusive Education, known as
ALLFIE, a group that I do not always agree with, says that it has found
similar problems for those with learning

this matter. I should not have had to in the first place. I accept that
the cock-up school of history has got in there somewhere. I do not
think that anyone seriously intended this to happen. But we should
surely take the opportunity in this Bill to change it. To go back to
the first meeting I had when an official told me that it was in the
legislation, my reply was, “We change legislation in Parliament,
don’t we? We do it all the time”. I did not think I would
have to wait this long and I thought it was a stalling action at the
time. Can we have some final

I am offered a meeting, may I draw on another fact? The British
Dyslexia Association has had a series of 60 meetings on this. I have
come to the conclusion that the lead negotiator, the person who has
taken on the role of saint and poor bloody infantry in this, one Sue
Flohr, probably has a secret admirer in one of the departments who
wants to keep on meeting her. If you have had 60 meetings, something is
very wrong. With one you accept that there is a problem but two means
you have not come up with an answer. I suggest that somebody somewhere
has to start making sure that a practical change is made. This has gone
on for too long and has affected too many people, and I have not even
gone on about all those who have
failed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:42:35"></hs_TimeCode>. Lots of
people have failed; what has happened to them? There may be a case for
that later in the Bill. Something has to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:42:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110674000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110674000023">I
leave with one example. The British Dyslexia Association has a series
of examples through its helpline. You have to be pretty lucky or
desperate to find your way to the helpline of that small charity on
this subject. A girl called Sophie was doing a visual merchandising
apprenticeship. I will not go into the details, but her college
basically said, “You ain’t going to pass, so we
ain’t entering you”. That is the worst condemnation of
this situation that I have come across: “You ain’t going
to pass, so we're not interested”. I suggest that colleges are
probably getting wise to the fact that if you are dyslexic you will
have a problem, but “We ain’t going to take you”
is only one step away from that background knowledge. To go back to the
culture and experience raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, we
must do something that makes this explicit now. It must be something
that has an end game attached to it. I beg to

Walmsley (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I wholeheartedly support the
passionate plea of my noble friend. I do not believe that, when the
Labour Government brought in the original Bill, their intention was to
totally exclude young people with dyslexia from the possibility 
<?notus-xml column=77?>of ever completing an apprenticeship. I do not believe that it is the
intention of this Government either. I accept that it may be a little
tricky to sort this out and that this is probably the first legislative
opportunity to change the legislation that inadvertently produced this
situation, so we must make use of it.</hs_para>

Government’s record on apprenticeships but they must not exclude
talented young people who are able to get through all the practical
side of the apprenticeship, often with flying colours, and show
tremendous commitment, hard work, conscientiousness and all those
qualities that we are looking for, but simply need a little help with
written material. That help, once given, will enable them not just to
get through the exam but to move on into a career. If we can sort this
out, it will also send a message to employers that says, “There
are a lot of talented people here who have gone through their
apprenticeships with a little bit of help and they will prove to be
very worthwhile employees to you if you take them on,
post-apprenticeship, as long as you give them a little help”. I
think that many local authorities can help employers to do that. What
is the alternative? As my noble friend said, they end up with
“NEET” on their foreheads. That is what we do not want.
It causes the young people and their families a great deal of distress
and, in the end, there can be long-term costs to young people from not
being in employment, education or training.</hs_para>

young people have a chance and we must make sure that they get it. It

the rest of it, and then find that they cannot complete it and get that

have varying degrees of dyslexia. All are able and intelligent, and
have talents. My daughter-in-law, who has moderate dyslexia, has an
excellent degree from the University of Bristol. It can be done but
these people must have extra. That group of young people who want
apprenticeships will be a loss to the country if they cannot get
through the necessary exams. It is a major advantage for the country to
make sure that they get through. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, and
the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, have put this case extremely well.
It is a relatively simple matter and I endorse the excellent work done
by this Government in many respects, particularly on apprenticeships,
but we should not leave out this important group. The funny thing about
this is that it is often not properly appreciated that an enormous
number of young people are dyslexic. Let us get out there, find them,
help them and make them really useful members of

anything connected with assessment and further work, which, as my

getting “ones” right across the board because she is

we not do it with apprenticeships? It seems ridiculous that we are
putting these kids on the scrapheap. We criticise young people for not
going out to work, and when they try to get qualifications, we fail

shall speak to Amendment 192 in this group, which is tabled in my name
and the names of the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, and the noble Baroness,
Lady Sharp. It is a probing amendment which would require schools to
retain the current system of school action and school action plus. We
may not have formulated the amendment perfectly, and I am sure there is
room for plenty of discussion about how it might be focused or targeted
more precisely. I am anxious to learn more about the
Government’s thinking in seeking to abolish the current stages
of school action and school action plus. As we know, the Government are
replacing that graduated approach with a single SEN category. The
amendment refers to schools, but my concerns also relate to how early
years settings and post-16 institutions will meet the needs of children
and young people with SEN.</hs_para>

this amendment is that, like the Government, I believe that policy
should be developed on the basis of robust evidence. Changing the way
the SEN system operates in every English school and early years setting
could be very disruptive. We need to be sure that any change will
genuinely improve outcomes for children and young people before we
embark on what is quite a major change. From what we have heard so far,
it seems that the Government’s intention here is to improve the
identification of special educational needs. The Ofsted report, <I>A
</I><I>S</I><I>tatement</I> <I>is not </I><I>E</I><I>nough</I>,
published in 2010, suggested that some children and young people were
being wrongly identified as having special educational needs.</hs_para>

the identification of special educational needs is a goal everyone
would support. However, my understanding is that the Ofsted report did
not in any way indicate that the problem resided in the graduated
approach of school action and school action plus. The same is true of
the Lamb inquiry, which also picked up on the issue of identification,
but did not indicate in any of its 51 recommendations that the problem
arose from school action and school action plus. Neither of these
important investigations proposed the removal of the current system, so
I wonder on what evidence the Government are basing their decision to
move to a single category of
SEN<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:55:49"></hs_TimeCode>. Everyone
has been encouraged by the reference in the recently published draft
code of practice to “a graduated response”. Since the
Government remain committed to a graduated response, which is provided
by school action and school action plus, one wonders why they are so
insistent on the need for this
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:56:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110685000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110685000013">I
should also like to pick up on the fact that the draft code of practice
removes guidance on the use of individual education plans. IEPs were a
key feature of the school action and school action plus system. They
set out educational targets, the agreed SEN support and how progress
would be measured. They require schools to involve children, young
people and their parents in the process and are vital for parents when
holding schools to account. When used properly, IEPs 

<?notus-xml column=80?>are a simple and effective way of recording targets, putting support in
place and tracking the child’s progress. While they might not
always be used as effectively as they might be, would it not be better
to seek to improve the way IEPs are used than to scrap them
altogether<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:57:18"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

opposed to schools retaining these types of records. The draft code
says that schools should keep records and that these can be shared with
parents. Again, therefore, one is prompted to ask why the Government
are getting rid of something so valued by parents when they continue to
support the principles behind it. I would be extremely grateful if,
when he responds to the debate, the Minister could set out the
Government’s thinking and give us the rationale for these
changes and, in particular, the evidence on which they are based. It
seems that the Government still support the principles of a graduated
approach and keeping good records, so it is important that we
understand why we need what is really quite a major
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:58:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110685000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110685000015"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Perry of Southwark" PimsId="158" UID="13110685000025" xid="1386" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110685000025">Baroness
Perry of Southwark:</Member></B> I have no wish to continue this debate
for too long. I first declare the interest that I, too, have a very
dyslexic granddaughter. The fact that so many of us are able to point
to younger family members with dyslexia marks how much better diagnoses
have got in the past 20 or 30 years. Previously, people were
very often thought to be rather stupid, so the diagnosis has greatly
improved things. We have come a very long way in providing good
diagnoses and excellent treatment at school level. Dyslexic boys and
girls get a tremendous amount of help in school: they get more time for
their examinations, technological help and so on. In the university
world, there is enormous help: large numbers of dyslexic young people
taking final examinations get special help, extra time and all that is
necessary. It seems absurdly wrong that, at a time when we have
expanded apprenticeships—and like the noble Baroness, Lady
Walmsley, I am immensely proud of what this Government have done about
apprenticeships—we have left this lacuna in the middle of the
provisions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T16:59:47"></hs_TimeCode>.
Schools do well and universities do well, yet when it comes to
apprenticeships we have this absurd drafting of
legislation—probably a slip of the pen—which makes it
impossible for dyslexics, and people who have other handicaps to do
with writing and speaking, to get through. I hope that the Minister
will not just say that it is all okay and that nothing needs to be
done. I really believe that something could so easily be done in this
legislation now, and this is a good opportunity to do
it.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_06_PT_1/6476A4F4989466C58A8CFCC994186F45457FF8FD" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 November 2013">Wednesday,

words in support of Amendment 192. Clause 62 refers to using
the best endeavours to secure special educational provision, and
Amendment 192 would reinsert the graduated response. The key is
ensuring that children get the support that they need to access the
curriculum, whether this is through a single category or a more
graduated response. The system that we are losing is popular and is
understood and trusted by parents and educators. It ensures that
children and young people get the support that they need. As I
understand it, the draft code of practice replaces school action and
school action plus with a single SEN, the SEN support. As I understand
the Government’s argument, they see the creation of a single SEN
category as a way of improving the identification of SEN youngsters. If
we accept that, will the Minister explain how this will improve the
educational outcomes for children and young people with
SEN?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110690000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110690000003">The

the new draft code of practice certainly indicates that the

is particular concern about the readiness of SENCOs within schools to
take on the role of the outside specialist. Schools can still pull in

the development of these technologies. But if we were to introduce an
additional duty, it would increase the regulatory burden on many
hundreds of private businesses, which goes directly against the
considerable efforts of the Government to reduce red tape for
businesses. Finally, good practice guidance from the 16 Diversity in
Apprenticeship pilots is now available on the National Apprenticeship
Service website. The Government commissioned an independent report on
creating an inclusive apprenticeship offer, and their response, the
apprenticeships action plan for learners with learning difficulties
and/or disabilities, is currently being implemented. Action includes:
use of the Equality Act definition of “disabled” for the
apprenticeship offer, employers being able to signal willingness to
recruit more disabled apprentices on apprenticeship vacancies online
using the “two ticks” scheme, which guarantees disabled
applicants an interview if they meet the basic requirements for the

given a very long brief by officials but I can probably say that the
Committee is not bamboozled by it. I do not think that that was the
intention and I have been reassured by hearing about how much support
can be given to young people with dyslexia as they go through their

all this is to no avail if they cannot get that piece of paper at the

is that without some technical help with their written English to
enable them to express what they have learnt, those young people cannot
get that piece of paper, and that means they cannot move on. It really
is as narrow as that. All that good stuff that the Minister has been
talking about is welcome but does not cover getting the piece of
paper—in other words, passing the functional skills test. That
is the problem. There have been lots of meetings but no progress has
been made. I appeal to my noble friend to have further meetings with
those of us who are concerned about this, if that is what is needed,
but something has to be done. This issue is much narrower than what is

a rugby analogy—good players catch bad balls and take the
tackle. The noble Earl has been tackled, stood on and everything
else—it has all happened—but I congratulate him on being
man enough to stand up to it in the first place. The subtext that I
take from the response is, “Oh, it can happen but it does
not”. I am afraid that that is not good enough; it is more of
the same with regard to what I have already spoken about. Technical
assistance is provided in the Access to Work programme; it is not just
a question of DSAs. The thinking appears to be that we help dyslexics
by providing them with a government grant from another department to
enable them to go to work but we do not let them take a qualification.
We provide that metal box with those little gadgets on the side of it
to allow someone to function after they have obtained a qualification,
but not before. The point about English and maths just does not stand
up for anybody who requires minor assistance, and never did. I will, of
course, withdraw the amendment but I do not want to come back in two or

this issue, which concerns the training of those who deal with pupils
with disabilities, or hidden disabilities, such as dyslexia. I
apologise to the Committee for having rather overdone the

Unless a teacher is trained to deal with pupils with very different
learning patterns, he or she will not be able to teach them well. That
is the underlying philosophy running through these two

great deal of work has been done. Indeed, under the previous
Government, a lot of the foundation stones for this approach were put
down, and we had Rose and Lamb looking at this issue. If teachers do
not know how to spot why somebody is failing to learn, or is learning
in a different and slower way, they cannot give the appropriate
assistance. Why is dyslexia mentioned here? It is the most frequently
occurring condition. It may not be the biggest educational problem,
but—the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, is not in the
Room—with certain aspects of speech and language, I will bet
that there is a high degree of
comorbidity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000020">If
we are dealing with something this important, then we have got to make
sure that a degree of training is instilled in those people who have
got to deal with it on a day-to-day basis. The people who will start to
notice that somebody is working differently will also be able to go to
that person and say, “This is why you are not learning
quickly”. One of the most standard conversations in dyslexia is
this: a parent comes in and 
<?notus-xml column=91?>says, “My child needs help” and it is then discovered that
the parent is also dyslexic but has manfully struggled through without
assistance. We have got to try to get the identification going
properly. One, help the child; two, enable them to open up and access
assistance so that the coping strategies that we have just discussed
can be put in

it comes to making sure SENCOs get better training, it is a no-brainer.
If the administrative structure of a SENCO is fine and everybody
teaching is fine, they should also know what they are talking about.
Dyslexia is the most common but there are other conditions out there. I
am merely saying that this is where we are coming from but that we are
not the whole story. Please will the Government give me an idea about
what they are going to do to make sure that there is better training
and awareness among teaching staff so that those with these needs can
get into the school population and open themselves up to receive the
help that is there? We end up doing it slowly, later on and then

196 goes further and suggests that all teachers in their initial
teacher training should have some proper training in how to identify
special educational needs. The fact is that all teachers know that they
are teachers of SEN because in every class there are children with
special needs. It is crucial that every teacher has some idea of how to
spot that and make sure that the appropriate, additional and more
specialist skills and provision are made for them if the teacher cannot
give it themselves. There is something in these two amendments which
requires a little more reassurance and explanation from the

Storey:</Member></B> My very first Oral Question was on dyslexia. I
have raised the issue on a number of occasions and the
Government’s response has always been positive in the sense that
they say they have made more money available to universities for
courses that they run. It seems very simple and yet very important,
first, to ensure that all teachers—not just some—have an
understanding of special educational needs and how to identify
problems. To have early intervention, you have to be able to identify
the problem, otherwise it does not work. Where a classroom teacher sees
an issue, they need to be able to understand it and then refer it to
the SENCO. The best way of doing that is through training our teachers.
It is almost a no-brainer: it is very simple and easy to do and lots of
universities and training institutions currently do it. If some do it,
why can all not do
it?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000028">The
second issue, as has been pointed out, is something that we have
already put in the code of conduct, where it is very clearly spelled
out. We must congratulate the Government on taking the next step and
saying that not only should SENCOs be qualified teachers but that,
furthermore, newly appointed SENCOs should have the relevant
qualification. That is very important—it was not mandatory
before and now it is. They are the people who can then deal with all
the other issues we have talked about. I would take it a step further
and say that existing SENCOs, who are not newly appointed to the SENCO

obtain this qualification. They might be doing it for the next 20
years, so should also have that qualification. We should perhaps give
them a period of several years’ latitude to take the
qualification, but we want to see a situation where teachers, through
their training, know the issues and where there is a qualified person
in every school to deal with these issues. That way, the excellent work
that is suggested in the code of practice will actually happen, because
there are people who know what they are talking about and know what to

Jones of Whitchurch (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I will comment
briefly on the amendments and support the noble Lord, Lord Addington,
and other noble Lords who have spoken this afternoon. As ever, the
noble Lord, Lord Addington, made a very powerful case for quality
teaching to identify children with dyslexia and all other specific
learning difficulties.  It is important that we broaden it and
do not just concentrate on the—very
important—needs of children with
dyslexia<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T17:48:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000030">In
earlier debates on the Bill, and again this afternoon, we have stressed
the importance of earlier intervention. The noble Lord, Lord Storey,
has just done that again. It is important that we identify children at
the earliest opportunity so that we can give them the support they need
to maximise the opportunities that their education can give them. These
amendments clearly build on that theme. However, for early intervention
to take place consistently, all teachers should be trained in the
technique of spotting where it might be necessary. They need to be
aware of the range of support mechanisms that are effective and can
make a difference.  
<?notus-xml column=93?>This cannot be left to chance or to some teachers developing a personal
interest in SEN, which is, all too often, what happens at the
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000031">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T17:49:10"></hs_TimeCode>
each teacher who is unaware, or fails to act, another child’s
life chances are blighted. We very much agree with the mandatory module
in teacher training. Leaving it to individual schools to provide the
knowledge and skills for teaching staff will leave it too late, and we
believe it will result in piecemeal provision if we proceed on that
basis. Sorting this provision out is crucial to the success of all
other aspects of the Bill when it comes to SEN. If we do not get
teacher training right, all the other aspects of support that we are
talking about here will fall at the very first
hurdle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000032">We
also agree with the proposal that the SEN co-ordinator should be a
qualified teacher who has been trained in SEN and specific learning
difficulties, and we were pleased that the Minister has now
acknowledged that the co-ordinator should be a qualified teacher. These
high-level skills are crucial to ensure that the school properly
focuses attention on the needs of specific groups of pupils, as
specified in the new Ofsted framework. It is an interesting development
that, with the Government’s new-found faith in unqualified
teachers, special educational needs co-ordinators will be the only
posts in a school required to be qualified teachers, but I slightly
digress.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000033">This
leads to another issue, which is that if the Minister agrees with the
amendments with regard to teacher training modules and the status of
school SENCOs, we are faced with a considerable knowledge deficit among
existing teachers, both qualified and unqualified. What further steps
do the Government intend to take to ensure that training for existing
teachers and, indeed, existing SENCOs can meet our expectation of early
intervention and action? How can we be confident that their knowledge
of the latest physical and technical equipment is kept up to date if we
are focusing just on newly qualified teachers and new training for SEN
teachers? I am echoing the points made by other noble Lords, and I hope
that the Minister will be able to address the
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T17:51:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in north London, Eleanor Palmer Primary School, for which I have the
highest respect. I wonder how many schools, if they had a dyslexic

will first speak to Amendment 195, which would require the SENCO to be
a qualified teacher and to complete mandatory training on SEN. I
entirely agree with my noble friends that this should be the case.
The draft Education (Special Educational Needs
Co-ordinators) (England) Regulations for Clause 63 were published on 4
October. They require the SENCO to be a qualified teacher or, indeed,
the head teacher of the school. In addition, schools must ensure that
SENCOs who are new to that role obtain the master’s-level
National Award for SEN Co-ordination within three years of being
appointed. That is mandatory, as my noble friend Lord Storey said.
Since 2009, we have funded 10,500 new SENCOs to complete this award.
These requirements mean that SENCOs are often among the most highly
qualified and experienced teachers within a school, which is absolutely
fitting for the importance of the role that they
fulfil.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000038">The
current specification for the national SENCO award requires SENCOs to
cover approaches to assessment and teaching for pupils with special
educational needs. They must demonstrate that they understand the four
areas of need as set out in the code of practice as well as
implications of these for teaching practice. They should specifically
demonstrate that they know and understand about high-frequency special
educational needs, such as dyslexia, and know how to draw on expert
external services to meet these
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000039">Amendment
196, tabled by my noble friends Lord Addington and Lady Walmsley, would
impose mandatory training in SEN and specific learning difficulties for
all new teachers. There are no mandatory modules and no required
curriculum for initial teacher training. Instead, ITT providers must
ensure that their courses enable trainee teachers to meet the
Teachers’ Standards. No trainee should be recommended for
qualified teacher status unless they have met the standards. The
Teachers’ Standards already state that teachers must,</hs_para>

able to adapt teaching to the needs of all pupils and have an
understanding of the factors that can inhibit learning and of how to
overcome them. Anybody who works in a school today knows that the
identification of SEN is at the core of a school’s life. Ofsted
inspects both the quality of initial teacher training and the quality
of teaching in our schools. These standards, and the ability to adapt
teaching to meet special educational needs, are central to these
inspections.</hs_parafo>

knows, we are focusing more teacher training on training in schools.
Ofsted reports that 31% of SCIIT training was rated good or
outstanding, compared with 13% for higher education institutions. NQTs
trained through School Direct rate the quality of their SEN training
more highly than other trainees. New teachers report that the quality
of training in 
<?notus-xml column=95?>SEN has improved. In fact, it is the best ever reported. A DfE survey of
12,000 newly qualified teachers in 2012 found that just 7% of them
rated their training in SEN as poor, and that 59% of primary and 66% of
secondary teachers rated their training as good or very good in helping
them to teach pupils with SEN. That compares to as few as 45% in 2008.
The 2013 survey of NQTs on the same subject will be published on
Friday. For reasons I cannot entirely fathom, I am not allowed to
reveal the results today, but I will tell noble Lords—probably
breaching some rule—that they are going to show a considerably
improved
picture.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000041">Taking
the slight digression, as she called it, of the noble Baroness, Lady
Jones, about unqualified teachers’ SEN training and her general
point about unqualified teachers, I shall make two points. Although I
entirely acknowledge that the previous Government invested heavily in
teacher training, they did not go as far as making SEN training
mandatory for all teachers, so there is a slight inconsistency in her
position. That is as nothing compared with the inconsistency in the
shadow Secretary of State for Education’s position the other
night, when nine times he declined to answer a question from Jeremy
Paxman about whether he would send his children to a school with
unqualified teachers, but let us not digress any further.</hs_para>

concerns put forward in another place, we have also strengthened the
expectations on schools as set out in the SEN code of practice. The new

Addington:</Member></B> My Lords, I listened to my noble friend and he
seemed to be saying that more or less everything other than making my
proposal compulsory for teacher training is fine. That might be
understandable but provision has been made in Scotland, which has a 
<?notus-xml column=96?>compulsory unit that was agreed among the universities that carry out
teacher training. I had a conversation with Dyslexia Scotland, which
was of the opinion that Edinburgh had the best provision at that
time—but all such universities have a unit. It does not hurt
anyone and I ask my noble friend to have another look at this. Will he
consider what can be provided to make sure that the average teacher has
every incentive and opportunity to at least get a basic awareness
component into their knowledge base? I am assured that units have been
prepared by numerous people and other bodies in relation to conditions
such as autism. There should be an awareness programme that means that
classic mistakes are not made; in dyslexia, the one I know best is,
“Just work harder”. That will not work. Even if you do
synthetic phonics, you will still learn at a slower rate. It is a
little like making a small man carry large sacks of coal; regardless of
how well he does and how he builds himself up he will never match the
bigger guy and will always be at a huge disadvantage. He will be more
tired, slower and learn less
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000046">The
standard response to, “Let’s not forget the rest of the
class” is either to disappear into the middle of it or to
disrupt at the back, so they are not exposed to something unpleasant.
If you can get to that pupil and give them some support and help, they
are less likely to make life difficult in the classroom and for those
around them. On average, three people in every class being taught will
be on the dyslexia spectrum. You could probably stick a couple of other
hidden disabilities in there as well. So an awareness package is
something that we should look at. My noble friend does not look like he
wants to respond now but we need to look at this later
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000047">I shall

Greengross:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendments 198 to
205, that is, all the amendments in this group. One of the reasons I am
particularly interested in this issue is because I have been heavily 
<?notus-xml column=97?>involved in the Care Bill from the pre-legislative scrutiny stage to the
present. One of our concerns throughout that consideration was for
children and young people who are just emerging from childhood, so to
speak, and get caught in the not quite adult/not quite child time of
life when the system sometimes fails them. Therefore, it is important
to ensure that we get things right, in particular in relation to
special educational needs and education, health and care
plans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000049">These
amendments would ensure that other organisations that might need to be
involved in this area would be responsible for delivering the services
described in the plans and for making sure that they actually do what
they say. For many, schools will be the main day-to-day contact point
but colleges will often be involved as well. At present, a number of
provisions apply to schools but not to colleges, all types of
alternative provision and pupil referral units. My amendment would
place the same duty on FE colleges as on all types of maintained school
settings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000050">Clause
64 places a duty on schools to inform the parents of a child without an
EHC plan and/or the young person without an EHC plan when special
education provision is being made for them. Without these amendments,
young people up to the age of 18 who do not have EHC plans who attend
school and/or their parents will be entitled to be informed, but young
people of the same age who are students at FE colleges will not. We
have to remember that from September 2013 young people will be able to
attend FE colleges from the age of 14, so this issue applies to a
number of young
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000051">I
understand that the Government are somewhat reluctant to place any
additional duties on FE colleges, but my concern is primarily with the
children and young people concerned rather than with the colleges, I am
afraid. If they are to be at the heart of the new system, the
information provided should not vary in this way according to the type
of institution that they happen to
attend.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000052">Clause
65 places a duty on schools to prepare a report containing special
educational needs information. This information concerns the
implementation of the governing body’s or proprietor’s
policy for pupils at the school with special educational needs, the
arrangements for the admission of disabled pupils to the school, the
steps taken to prevent less favourable treatment of disabled pupils,
the facilities provided to assist access to the school by disabled
pupils and the accessibility plan which schools must publish under the
Equality Act 2010. In a similar way to Clause 64, the amendments, which

turn first to Amendments 198, 199, 200 and 201 which would place a new
duty on FE institutions to tell young people if they are receiving
special educational provision. It might be helpful to clarify for the
Committee that the duty on schools in Clause 64 was originally put in
place to ensure that parents were made aware when their child was in
receipt of special educational provision. As noble Lords will know,
this Bill gives new rights to young people once they are over
compulsory school age—generally speaking those who are 16 and
over—rather than their parents. Any new duty on colleges would
therefore require them to inform the young person that they are in
receipt of special educational provision and not their
parents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000057">Young

opportunity for a fresh start, particularly if they felt a failure at

suggested that Clause 64 creates an anomaly. Young people in FE
colleges do not need to be told that they are receiving SEN provision,
but young people in sixth form must be told. She suggested that that
was unfair. I understand the noble Baroness’s point in that
regard. The Bill creates a distinction between young people in school
and young people in college. There are two reasons why that is so.
First, in the further education environment, a young person is more
likely to find the label “SEN” unhelpful, and colleges
are used to using their professional judgment about labelling
support.</hs_para>

replaces Sections 317(5) and 317(6) of the Education Act 1996 and is a
well established duty on schools, but there are no existing similar
legal duties on colleges, and we do not believe it is necessary to
legislate for a new duty in this area. As the Association of Colleges
points out, this information is readily available, as colleges already
produce it for their websites and prospectuses. It is also the case
that colleges will have to produce this information as part of their
local offer. Colleges are under a duty in this Bill to co-operate with
local authorities to produce a local offer. This includes details of
their approach to teaching young people with SEN, how they adapt their
curriculum and learning environment, how facilities can be accessed and
what support is available to young people with SEN. More detail is set

first to Amendment 206, it would require that a plain English version
of the code of practice should be made available. Much of the detail of
the reforms contained in this Bill will be enshrined in the code of
practice. Indeed, the code of practice will be the Bible, both for
providers and users of the system. I recall an experience I had when I
was one of the founder members of the Special Educational Needs
Tribunal back in 1994. We attended a training session and somebody came
along to brief us on the old code of practice. She said, “Well,
I expect that you would like me to tell you what are the most important
parts of this code of practice that you need to be most familiar with.
What I am here to tell you is that you need to be fully familiar with
it all”, so it is obviously a crucial document. The new code of
practice will be the same as the old one in that respect. It
was—and the new one will be—a crucial document, and I am
sure that we are all most grateful to the Government for making the
latest draft available in time for the Committee. That shows just what
a crucial document it
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000069">It is also
a very lengthy document—more than 170
pages—and although it will no doubt be subject to change over
time, it will remain quite a complex document, so it is incumbent on us
to ensure that the document is made as accessible as possible to young
people and their families. A version of the code that provided clarity
about a person’s rights and choices, made readily accessible in
plain English, would be extremely valuable. As the Plain English

to Amendments 206 to 209, at first sight, the Government, with their
Amendments 210 and 211, have gone a long way to meeting what these
amendments were asking for. Indeed, I readily acknowledge that the
Government’s amendments are very helpful, but they do not take
us all the way. In two respects they do not take us all the way.
Amendment 207 specifies a 90-day consultation period, which I think is
perhaps more in accord with usual practice. The Government’s
Amendments 210 and 211 seem, at first sight, to concede all that the
amendments are asking for in terms of the code needing to be approved
by the affirmative procedure in both Houses of Parliament. The wording
of these amendments is a bit opaque but, when you unravel it, it
becomes clear that the affirmative procedure is being conceded in
relation to the first iteration of the new code, but not in relation to
subsequent iterations which are simply subject to the negative
procedure. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee pointed
this out in its report last week, I think, and said that if the
Government are conceding the affirmative procedure in relation to the
first iteration of the code of practice, they are effectively conceding
that any subsequent iteration of the code needs the affirmative
procedure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000072">I
therefore think we will want to continue to push Amendments 207 to 209.
While expressing gratitude to the Government for the distance that they
have moved with their Amendments 210 and 211, I express a little
disappointment that they have not moved all the way and, indeed, made
the further concession that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee has suggested is essentially implied by their concession of

clear that the code of practice is a very important document, as the

consultation with those whom the Secretary of State thinks appropriate,

Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to this group of amendments
on the SEN code of practice for 0 to 25 year-olds. I thank
the noble Lord, Lord Low, the noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady
Jones, and my noble friend Lady Sharp for tabling these amendments and
raising this important matter. I am also grateful to all noble Lords
who have spoken. I have listened carefully, and it is important that we
ensure that there is a good understanding of and confidence in the code
of practice. It is vital to the success of the new system. I hope I can
reassure noble Lords in my response.</hs_para>

Amendment 206 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Low, we are in complete
agreement with the intention behind it. I think all noble Lords would
agree that if the new code of practice is going to be a useful document
and one which parents, young people and professionals can work with it
needs to communicate its meaning clearly and be readily available.
While any document which has to describe the law accurately may contain
some text which has to be read twice, the department has striven to
make the draft code as easy to read as possible.</hs_para>

abided by the principles of plain English as much as possible, and I am
grateful to my noble friend Lady Sharp for her comments, which I will
pass on to all officials who have been involved in its drafting.
However the draft code is currently out to 
<?notus-xml column=103?>consultation, and we are keen to receive suggestions for making any
parts of the text easier to understand and will look carefully at any
text which readers say they find difficult. Noble Lords may be aware
that the current code of practice is accompanied by a Plain English
Campaign Crystal Mark publication <I>Special Educational Needs

publish a similar document for parents and young people along with the
new SEN code of

to the second element of this amendment regarding the availability of
the code on the internet, publication on the internet is now the
department’s main method of publication, and I can reassure
noble Lords that the new code will be available on the internet. We
will also make sure that the code, like the consultation draft, is
published in a web-accessible format, so that, for example, readers
with visual impairments will have access to it.</hs_para>

practice is fundamental to the SEN framework and the noble Lord, Lord
Low, is right to raise the issue of its approval, an issue which I know
is of great importance to SEN organisations and many noble Lords. As
noble Lords will be aware, ahead of the introduction of this Bill into
the other place, the Education Select Committee carried out
pre-legislative scrutiny on Part 3. One of the recommendations of the
committee was that the code should be approved by Parliament through
the negative procedure. We were in agreement, fully recognising the
importance of parliamentary scrutiny of the code of practice, and we
accepted the Select Committee’s recommendation. Indeed, we are
now going further in response to a recommendation from the Delegated
Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. We have tabled Amendments 210
and 211 to ensure that on the first occasion the new code is approved,
it will be through the affirmative procedure, and for subsequent
revisions, it will be through the negative procedure, recognising the
significance of the new code in reflecting the new legal framework we

want the new code to be kept up to date, in contrast to the current
code which has not been changed since it was published in 2001. In our
view, this is critical to its usefulness to those interacting with the
SEN system. One of the main reasons why the current code is so out of
date is because the affirmative procedure process applies to any
revisions of the code. This requires time to be found for debates in
both Houses, no matter how small the change.</hs_para>

particular example, the Learning and Skills Council closed on 31 March
2010 and was replaced by the Skills Funding Agency and the Young
People’s Learning Agency. However, three years later, the code
still refers to the Learning and Skills Council, which could be
extremely confusing to anyone looking to use this part of the code. To
have changed the references to the Learning and Skills Council in the
current code of practice to keep it up to date would have required the
Secretary of State to lay a revised draft of the code before both
Houses of Parliament and for parliamentary time to be found to enable
both Houses to debate the changed references.</hs_para>

also examples where legislative changes have taken place and are not
reflected in the code: the early years foundation stage came into force
in 2008; the Academies Act 2010 imposed the same SEN obligations on
academies as apply to local authority maintained schools; the Children,
Schools and Families Act 2010 gave new rights to parents to appeal to
the tribunal following the annual review of a statement; and the
Equality Act 2010 imposed a duty on schools to make reasonable
adjustments through providing auxiliary aids and services. None of
these rights, duties and obligations is covered in the current
code.</hs_para>

Government believe in thorough parliamentary scrutiny. However, debates
under the affirmative procedure would not have been able to change the
legislation to which the revisions in the code referred. Any concerns
noble Lords or Members in the other place had about the legislation
itself would have been debated and, hopefully, noble Lords or Members
would have been reassured as the relevant primary legislation was going
through.</hs_para>

current code has remained out of date, through different
Administrations. There is not just one reason for this, but it is
natural for those with the difficult task of finding time for
parliamentary debates to hold off for now as there will probably need
to be another change in six months, and so the code never gets revised.
That, with the best will in the world, is exactly what I fear will
happen if the new code has to be approved through the affirmative
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000091">In
addition, in terms of procedure, there are other codes which are
important to parents which do not go through these approval
arrangements. To take one example, the admissions code, which is of
great importance to parents seeking a school place for their child,
is  
<?notus-xml column=105?>approved by negative procedure, and there does not appear to be any
difficulty with that. Codes in other areas, such as those under the
Mental Capacity Act and the Equality Act, are also approved by negative
procedure. We are not proposing that revised versions of the code after
the first are approved by negative procedure just because other codes
are, but I hope some comparisons to other similar documents are helpful
and provide some
reassurance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000092">I
believe that the negative procedure would allow for small and
uncontroversial changes to be made to the code, which are important to
keeping it up to date, while still allowing Members of both Houses to
call for a debate if they are concerned about proposed changes. I hope
noble Lords are reassured that this is an appropriate
balance.</hs_para>

Lords have spoken about the consultation arrangements for the code.
Clause 68(2) provides for the Secretary of State to carry out sensible
and proper consultation on the code. When smaller changes to the code
are made, the consultation will be focused on those who the changes
affect. For example, if a change to early years provision is made, we
would consult representatives of early years providers and parent
groups with a particular interest in early years provision, rather than
including further education providers and young people in the
consultation about such a change. I hope noble Lords agree that this is
proportionate and are reassured by Clause 68(2).</hs_para>

Low of Dalston:</Member></B> I am very grateful to the Minister for his
careful response and the way in which he dealt with the arguments and
to all other noble Lords who have spoken in support of my amendments.
As I say, I am very grateful to the noble Lord but I am not entirely
persuaded. I think he said that the previous code had been introduced
in 2001 and that, because of the pressure on parliamentary time, it had
not been possible to find any time to update it between then and now. I
cannot believe that it would not be possible to find any parliamentary
time—not a lot is required—for a debate on the
affirmative procedure. I find it hard to believe that one could not
find any time in 12 years, so I was not entirely persuaded there, nor,
it seems, was the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee.
However, I will not press the point any further at this stage, so I beg
leave to withdraw the

Addington:</Member></B> My Lords, for me this is a case of
“three times pay for all” when it comes to dyslexia. The
reason I have tabled this amendment is because you find abundant
evidence of special educational needs among our prison population. The
estimates for the number of prisoners on the dyslexia spectrum range
from 20% to 50%, the higher figure being the more frequently occurring.
It is generally accepted now that every problem to do with literacy and
educational attainment occurs in abundance throughout our prison
population. I have singled out dyslexia for screening because of my
interest in it and because it will probably be the most frequently
occurring
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T18:53:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000097">Why
do we need to conduct screening for dyslexia? A few years ago I became
familiar with a project in Chelmsford Prison under the leadership of
Jackie Hewitt-Main. She discovered that lots of dyslexics would go
nowhere near the education department. One realises in three seconds
that they go nowhere near it because it constitutes a bad experience
for them. Most prisoners are no longer in school by the age of 14. If
someone has not been attaining in the education system, it is an
unpleasant experience and they often find themselves getting into
enough trouble to send them to prison. It is as if they are saying,
“Let us go in there and go through a bad experience in the
classroom”. Suddenly, it becomes obvious that they 
<?notus-xml column=107?>will try to avoid
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T18:53:37"></hs_TimeCode>. The
redoubtable individual I mentioned was originally looking at head
injuries, of which she found many. She did a survey of prisoners who
would not go into the education block. She found that once you had
established that link to their previous experience these prisoners
became much more open to training and to assistance in changing their
lives. The incidence of violence on the wing in question dropped and
the prisoners stopped hitting one another quite so much—perhaps
they had something to talk about. It was subsequently discovered that
half the prison warders were in the same
boat<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T18:54:25"></hs_TimeCode>. As an
aside, dyslexics tend to like regular hours and regular forms et
cetera. They do not like promotion when they have to change the form,
but that is an aside for another
day<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T18:54:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_06_PT_1/1B0EC4C91E6947BD6AD09BD89D9D219DB91AA7BA" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 November 2013">Wednesday,

having a form of assessment on entrance into the system would seem to
be sensible idea. Once again, I have one caveat, which I
have given before: you should probably extend this to a list of other
conditions. For example, I discovered that Asperger’s is
overrepresented as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T18:54:54"></hs_TimeCode>. If you
have problems with communication and you have problems with the
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T18:54:58"></hs_TimeCode>, once again
it becomes quite obvious how that could happen and you go down the

we come to another thing that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has

press this if the Minister can tell us that the Ministry of Justice has
a specially constructed programme that will address the needs of its
client base that goes beyond, and is more appropriate than, that
provided outside. That would be a good reason for not removing the
clause because—nobody disputes this —we have a very high
need base. If there is something that it is appropriate for adults or
young people disaffected with the education system and is especially

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to speak to
Amendment 214. My name is attached to it and I particularly wanted to
speak to it because it is the continuation of an old story of detained
young people missing out on all the privileges that other young people
have. In particular, when they have been in care and then find
themselves detained, the local authority no longer continues to look
after them in the new institution in which they find themselves. In the
past, we tried very hard to ensure that that care continued, but as the
noble Lord, Lord Storey, has pointed out, that has not really been
carried forward and certainly is not working at
present.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000109">We
should remind ourselves that children who are detained are the most
vulnerable in our society, particularly if they have a range of special
needs resulting in an EHC plan. We all know the statistics for children
who have been in care, so I will not repeat them, and those for the
most troubled families and young people with mental health problems who
find themselves in some kind of detention. Because there is a plan in
place, and because of the difficulties faced by these young people,
they are probably known to their local authority, and are likely to
have a social worker and an existing programme to meet their needs. It
is therefore absolutely essential that the plan is maintained and for
the child or young person with special needs to have the services in
that plan
continued.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0001.htm#13110692000110">Anyone
who has been to any of these institutions, or talked to any young
people from care who have found themselves dropping out of the care
system and into the offender system, will know that they lack that
continuity and their education ceases. How much more difficult it is
for children with special needs whose families have often struggled
anyway to get them the services that they need so far. It seems
perverse, therefore, that they are deprived of this continuity. Often
they are detained due to behaviour that has stemmed from their learning
difficulties: the fact they do not always comprehend what is going on
around them; the fact that they cannot read instructions; or the fact
that they are sometimes easily led because they do not have the same
intellectual grasp of what is going on as others. Those young people
who are seen as the offenders and the difficult young people in our

opposite should be true. Having already been failed by their family,
often by their education and usually by social care, what these young

They need a programme to take them through their detention and

continued—and their education and health plans, as they often
have complex health needs—then it is clear to me that they would

I will just make a couple of short points. I, too, am familiar with the
work of Jackie Hewitt-Main and have read her very inspiring book. I am
a great admirer of the work that she has done in prisons. One story
that she told really struck me: some young people in custody were not
getting the help they needed with their dyslexia for the following
reason. When they went in, they were given a form to fill in to say
what sort of educational provision they wanted. They could not read
it—it is a simple thing, is it not?—so they did not get
any help at all. They did not get any courses because they had not
ticked any of the boxes because they could not read what it said next
to them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T19:08:23"></hs_TimeCode>. It has

great disadvantage. In the current economic situation, we have to
ensure that money is spent as wisely as possible. I can think of no

legislation exists in Section 562C of the Education Act 1996 setting
out how education and support for those with special educational needs
is delivered in custody. That legislation places clear duties on local
authorities to use their best endeavours to deliver the special
educational provision that is set out in a statement of special

discussed with the noble Lord, this new clause does not achieve all
that we might want. For example, it is important to ensure that duties
are on relevant health bodies rather than local authorities. Concerning
the point my noble friend Lord Storey raised on behalf of the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, it is essential that we properly consider what
the role of the home local authority should be as well as that of the
host local authority. As many in this debate have said, this is a great
opportunity to make a difference, and it is important that home local
authorities maintain their involvement with children and young people
who are in custody so they are aware of progress and can make sure that
appropriate provision and support is available when a young offender
returns home on release. This is important if we are to reduce further
the risk of
reoffending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110692000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0002.htm#13110692000129">I

to Amendment 212 and the issue of screening those in custody for
dyslexia. I agree with my noble friends Lord Addington and Lady
Walmsley that we must support young offenders who have hidden
disabilities such as dyslexia. I should like to assure my noble friends
that assessments to identify such needs already take place in the youth
secure estate. Education providers assess all young offenders’
levels of literacy, language and numeracy on entry to custody. They
also use a variety of tests such as the hidden disabilities
questionnaire developed by Dyslexia Action to screen all young
offenders who show signs of having a learning difficulty or disability.
These assessments are extremely important because they allow providers
to identify a range of learning difficulties, including dyslexia. Once
their needs have been assessed, all young offenders in custody receive
an individual learning plan that follows them through the course of
their sentence. Of course, if we are able to ensure continuity of
EHC-plan support, then young offenders with plans will already have had
such needs and relevant support identified. Education providers in
young offender institutions are also contractually required to have a
workforce trained to identify and support a young person’s
individual learning needs.</hs_para>

self-discipline they need to stop offending and lead productive lives

young offenders with special educational needs. The consultation ended

However, it is certainly reassuring to know that people are thinking
about this problem. I should also say to my noble friend that there is
a lot of cross-party consensus on this. I do not think that anyone has
any idea other than to try and improve this Bill, so I encourage him to
make sure that we are all engaged in this. The continuation of
political support on this issue can, on this occasion, be added to and
built on. All of us want to find a sustainable and improving way to

Walmsley talked about the problems that someone who cannot read has in
accessing help. To take that one step further: try accessing the
benefits system without being able to fill in a form, and then have the
fear of humiliation in admitting that you cannot read. I encourage my

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government argue that the local
offer will improve transparency. However, in one area there is
virtually no information available to parents: that is, information on
the quality of specialist SEN support services. As drafted, the Bill
misses an opportunity to improve outcomes for children with SEN by
requiring Ofsted to inspect specialist SEN support services. We believe
that this move would improve the overall accountability of the

another area in which the SEN Green Paper recognised the vital role
that specialist SEN services have to play. Parents are therefore often
surprised that these same SEN educational services are subject to no
real formal scrutiny in the same way that schools are. The absence of
any reliable data on the number of children with sensory impairments
and the outcomes they achieve also means that parents have no way of
comparing local offers and SEN provision. Let me illustrate this with

There is already a strong and clear case for inspection of specialist

especially 
<?notus-xml column=116?>strong for low-incidence SEN, including sensory impairments, because
many local authorities and schools are unlikely to be as familiar with

I ask the Minister the following questions. First, will he set out in
more detail the terms of reference and timescales for Ofsted’s

Ofsted’s inspection framework for schools already has an SEN
focus, does he accept that Ofsted inspectors are unlikely to pick up on
issues on the quality of support being received by a school from
specialist support services for children with sensory impairment as
there is often only one child with that need in the

Clinical commissioning groups are held accountable by NHS England,

authorities must consult on the local offer and publish comments

population to hold their local authorities to account for implementing
the local offer. It is important for noble Lords to note that local
authorities and clinical commissioning groups can already be held to
account for their actions through individual complaints. The local

understand the case for inspection, given the importance of these

friend, 
<?notus-xml column=117?>requires Ofsted to inspect local authorities on their commissioning and
delivery of specialist SEN services. The SEN reforms are new. We
therefore need to baseline best practice and use that analysis to
identify whether a full inspection regime is necessary. On that basis,
as my noble friend Lady Northover said in a previous debate, we asked
Ofsted to undertake a study of how local authorities are preparing to
implement the SEN reforms, working with the Care Quality Commission as
they need. The work will consider how effectively local authorities and
clinical commissioning groups will fulfil their responsibilities and
how they will monitor improved outcomes for children and young people
who have special educational needs. This study will help us to identify
whether a new inspection framework would add value, and I or my noble
friend would be content to discuss this further with noble Lords, if
that would be useful. I think my noble friend Lady Northover has
already made that offer. On that basis, I hope that my noble friend

Obviously, we all look forward with great anticipation to the study

low-incidence needs and how they will be covered. I accept that it is a

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment would insert a
new clause imposing a duty to secure sufficient communication support
for parents of children with hearing loss. The amendment would create a
new duty on local authorities to ensure that families with deaf
children have access to communication courses on communicating with
their children. Some 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents,
many of whom have little or no prior experience of deafness. As well as
the usual emotions that parents face when 
<?notus-xml column=118?>they learn that their child is disabled, parents of deaf children face a
battle in learning how best to communicate with that child,
particularly if they need to learn sign
language.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-06T19:35:31"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

course, sign language will not be appropriate for all families and
children, but that option must be there if parents are to be able to
play their important role in developing their children’s
language and communication skills. I do not need to stress to the
Minister how important and fundamental communication within the family
is. It is the strongest influence on language development at age two.
Money spent here to achieve those skills can be an absolutely
invaluable investment. Indeed, failure to support communication within
the family is a false economy. It condemns deaf children to a life of
frustrated potential. We already know that by the time they start
school, four out of five deaf children have failed to achieve a good
level of development within the early years foundation

National Deaf Children’s Society believes that supporting
families with deaf children on communication is more than just common
sense and should be regarded as a basic human right. We must do more to
ensure that families with deaf children can communicate with those
children. Sadly, at present, I do not believe that we are doing enough.
In a survey in 2011, the NDCS found that more than
half—56%—of local authorities did not provide any support
to families who needed to learn sign language to communicate with their
children. The other half were found to be patchy and uneven in terms of
exactly what they
provided.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110697000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0002.htm#13110697000005">Some
families have faced an agonising choice of deciding whether the mother
or the father would be able to learn sign language, because local
authorities have made funding available for only one person or because
there is no childcare funding available. When this matter was raised
elsewhere, the Government, alas, left it to the local authorities,
saying that it was a matter to them to decide. Is the Minister
confident that local authorities understand how important communication
support for families is? Is he as concerned as I am, and as many others
are, that more local authorities do not already make it
available?</hs_para>

improve sign language provision to families, including the I-Sign

acknowledge the department’s hope that the Bill will address
some of these difficulties, particularly through local offers and
personal budgets. However, I would welcome the Minister’s views

offers? Is he confident that courses would even be available to
families should they wish to use their personal budgets for this
purpose? Is he confident that local authorities will engage with, and
listen to, families with deaf children on this matter? We must remember
that deafness, as we have already heard from the noble Baroness, Lady
Walmsley, is a low-incidence disability. Many local authorities are
unlikely to be familiar with the needs of deaf children, 
<?notus-xml column=119?>who will always be one of a range of competing needs. Therefore, without
a clear duty on local authorities, I and many others are concerned that
sign language provision for families will continue to be patchy and
progress will continue to be piecemeal. Surely, deaf children and their
families deserve better and I hope that the Minister will seriously
consider this amendment and its implications. I beg to

amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. She has made a strong
and clear case for action. This issue has been raised elsewhere several
times and the fact that it continues to be raised must show the
Minister the strength of feeling on it. The current approach of asking
voluntary bodies to support improvements in individual local areas is
just too piecemeal. The progress being made is far too slow, and deaf
children are suffering because of it. Access to communication support
for families with deaf children and young people is fundamentally
important; the Government must send a clear signal to local authorities
that it should be provided where needed. Otherwise, we will be here in

scheme that the Prime Minister was referring to was the I-Sign

regions. NDCS, with support from the Department for Education,
continues to work to support the development of sign language courses.
However, local authorities cannot be compelled to provide sign language
support because there is no duty to do so. As has already been
outlined, a very high percentage of deaf children are born into hearing
families who have no previous first-hand experience of deafness. These
families really need support to communicate with their child,

has been estimated that where deaf children need to communicate in sign
language, eight out of 10 parents of deaf children never

Without the right support from the start, deaf children and young

and low levels of attainment. We have already heard from the noble

questions. I support it particularly because of the work done by the
right honourable Iain Duncan Smith MP and Graham Allen MP, among
others, on the importance of early attachment between infants and
parents. Clearly, it is crucial that parents can communicate with their

emphasise the importance of that. We may have already covered this
elsewhere in the Bill, but the two questions are: how is assisting
parents to communicate with their blind children dealt with and, on the
broader point about all children with some disability or another, how
are parents enabled to communicate with them, for instance, those with
dyslexia? There may be less of an issue in those particular
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110697000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-gc0002.htm#13110697000014">The
point that I would like some clarity on, and the Minister is welcome to
write to me on these points if he thinks that would be appropriate, is
that we do not see children on their own; we see them as part of a
family and a set of relationships. I imagine that has probably been
dealt with elsewhere in the Bill, and I probably have not followed that

tabling this amendment, she is highlighting a specific need for local
authorities to secure provision to support parents of children with a
hearing loss. I think that the noble Baroness spoke in a recent debate
in the Chamber when I was supporting my noble friend Lady Jolly. I
agree that where there are identified needs, local authorities should
provide communication support for parents of children with hearing

local authorities to set out a local offer of the support that is

Clause 32 requires local authorities to provide parents of

that they provide to deaf children and to access tools and information
on the most effective approaches. In particular, we are funding the
National Sensory Impairment Partnership, NatSIP, to carry out a
benchmarking exercise and develop an outcome framework for local
authorities to assess how well they are supporting deaf pupils. They

Statement:</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110669000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-wms0001.htm#13110669000006">I,

(GA) Red Tape Challenge ran from 11th April to 16th May 2013. It
received nearly 500 responses, including 298 via e-mail, three times as
many as any other theme to date. These responses identified many areas
where improvements are needed and highlighted the need for a change in
approach to regulating GA. As a result of this, the government is
launching a substantial programme of reform that will help support a
vibrant GA sector. The GA sector currently supports around 50,000 jobs
in the UK and makes an overall economic contribution to the UK economy
of £1.4 billion per annum. It could and should be able to
contribute
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110669000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-wms0001.htm#13110669000008">The
Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the independent regulator of civil
aviation in the UK, recognises the need to create a culture change in
the regulation of the GA sector. As part of this culture change the CAA
is setting up a new GA unit within its current structure. This is firm
recognition that general aviation requires different, and less onerous,
regulation to that of commercial air transport. The CAA’s GA
unit will be dedicated to effective and proportionate regulation that
supports and encourages growth of the GA sector. The unit will also
work with government to identify potential funding for new technologies
to support the sector. It will be fully set up within the CAA by April
2014.</hs_para>

the findings of the GA Red Tape Challenge into its own internal review
to produce a comprehensive GA Reform Programme. This will support a
programme of deregulation and self-regulation for the GA sector. It
will also remove complexity, look to deregulate where possible and
where not, consider how to allow the GA sector to take on more
responsibility and accountability for its own safety where possible and
appropriate. This has already started with the launch in September 2013
of a consultation on deregulating for airworthiness purposes all
UK-registered single-seat microlights. Starting in November, the CAA
will lead a series of workshops with the GA sector to identify other
areas that would benefit most from deregulation or self-regulation.
These moves represent the start of an ambitious programme of work to
follow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110669000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-wms0001.htm#13110669000010">The
Government has successfully lobbied for an evaluation of the
application of commercial aviation safety requirements to
non-commercial aviation to be included in the EU Regulatory Fitness and
Performance (REFIT) Programme and welcomes the European Aviation Safety
Agency (EASA) Roadmap for General Aviation. Both the Government and the
CAA will engage with the GA community over the coming months to
identify priorities for reform and take these forward within the
EU’s reform programme.</hs_para>

its engagement with the sector to improve consultative arrangements and
ensure effective representation. The CAA is committed to being open and
transparent in its engagement and collaboration with the GA community.
It will work with a firm objective to support education and compliance
rather than regulation and enforcement, using legal instruments and
powers only as a last resort.</hs_para>

the GA sector in the development of a new regulatory framework and its
associated policies; there will be opportunities for the sector to
challenge the CAA when it believes regulation is unduly burdensome;
there will be more scrutiny of the CAA’s fees and charges to
provide greater transparency; and the CAA will improve the quality of
information it provides. From the responses to the Red Tape Challenge
it is clear that regulatory complexity has led to misunderstandings. To
address this, the CAA will run a ‘myth-busting’
initiative to clarify what exactly regulations require. For example, it
will debunk the myth that the CAA requires all aircraft movements
within the UK to be
logged.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110669000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-wms0001.htm#13110669000013">To
facilitate the effective and timely implementation of these measures,
the Government is appointing an independent ‘Challenge
Panel’ including GA industry representatives. This panel will
report directly to ministers. It will provide a ‘critical
friend’ function to the CAA. The Challenge Panel will run
initially for six months until April 2014. During this time the Panel
will monitor and support the implementation of the CAA’s
deregulatory programme. It will also be asked to identify further
opportunities to deregulate and to promote growth of the sector. It
will provide to ministers an interim report in January and a final
report in
April.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110669000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-wms0001.htm#13110669000014">We will
task the Challenge Panel to propose ideas, and will also encourage the
CAA and Government Departments such as the Department for Business, 
<?notus-xml column=19?>Innovation and Skills and the Home Office, to consider where projects
might support and encourage an innovative and dynamic GA sector. For
example, how best to support a dynamic leisure and training sector, and
how to remove outdated paperwork which serves little

announcing these measures we are announcing the launch of a
“right to reply” consultation by the CAA into its
response to the GA Red Tape Challenge. This consultation will run until
6th December and is a good opportunity for the GA sector to make its
own assessment of the CAA’s detailed response. The responses to
this consultation will be available to the Challenge Panel, which will
be able to submit its own views on the CAA response within its January
interim report. These reforms mark an important and significant
step-change in the approach to GA regulation. The new regulatory regime
will be founded on risk-based intervention, proportionate to the safety
needs of informed participants whilst protecting uninvolved third
parties and supporting and encouraging a flourishing GA sector. We will
work closely with the General Aviation sector and the GA representative
bodies in particular in taking this
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110669000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131106-wms0001.htm#13110669000016">General

provide an unprecedented level of certainty on almost all the NHS
branded medicines bill. The bill will stay flat over the next two years
and will grow slowly after that. The industry will make compensating
payments to the Department of Health if NHS spending on branded
medicines exceeds the agreed growth rate. The agreement therefore
provides stability and predictability to both the Government and the UK
pharmaceutical industry, supporting the industry’s global
competitiveness. It will encourage the use of innovative and effective
new medicines in the NHS.</hs_para>

arrangements, the National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) will continue its work to introduce the broader
value assessment for new medicines covered by value-based pricing. We
have listened to feedback from patients’ groups that they would
welcome further opportunities to feed into the development of the new
arrangements for value assessment and have agreed that NICE will carry
out a full public consultation before implementing the methods for
wider value assessment in autumn 2014. Publication of the complete 2014
PPRS is expected later in the

addition to the agreement, I am also publishing today the Government
response to the consultation on the Statutory Pharmaceutical Pricing
Scheme, which contained proposals to strengthen the scheme, and align
it more closely to the PPRS. This scheme provides an important
safeguard for the NHS, controlling the prices of branded medicines sold
to the NHS by pharmaceutical companies that decide not to join the
voluntary PPRS. Through this response document, we are setting out the
changes we will be making, including introducing a 15 per cent price
cut on branded medicines sold by statutory scheme companies. We will

assessment. It is for the police to investigate and submit to the Crown
Prosecution Service (CPS) appropriate cases where there is evidence of
a contravention of Section 1 of the Dealing in Cultural Objects
(Offences) Act 2003, which makes it an offence to deal dishonestly in
tainted cultural objects. (Border Force officers also have enforcement
powers in cases involving import and export). It is anticipated that
any such case would be drawn to the attention of the Secretary of State
in the event that an application was made to export such an object. The
Government takes the issue of illicit trafficking in cultural objects
very seriously and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the
