about care companies that do not pay the minimum wage. All care
companies should meet their obligations in law to pay the minimum wage.
HMRC has done a lot of work, focusing on the care sector, and I have
been absolutely clear that there is an obligation for those care
companies to meet their requirements under the national minimum wage
legislation. We cannot get good care on the back of exploiting low-paid

£1.1 billion next year to support social care services with a
health benefit and to promote joint working. In 2015-16, we will
introduce a £3.8 billion pooled budget for health and social

an increase in the number of frail elderly people in our society living
with chronic conditions and that that is putting additional pressure on
accident and emergency departments. The numbers have increased by over
a million a year since 2010. However, the fact that there has been a
reduction of 50,000 in the number of delayed discharges demonstrates

that these are local decisions that need to be made by local

different from the needs in Bradford. That was the very reason that
underpinned the previous Government’s decision to transfer
responsibility for these services to local commissioners, but we often
need more co-located services, because the Monitor survey picked up the
fact that in the past, far too often, walk-in centres were isolated in
the community; people 
<?notus-xml column=154?>did not know how to access them, or when they could do so. Monitor also

Across the world, the life sciences industry is radically

the most important asset of all—the ability to work with

model of targeted medicine unlocks the biggest prize of all—a
new model of reimbursement where, instead of sitting in smoke-filled
rooms every five years to negotiate prices for one-size-fits-all
blockbuster drugs which neither we nor the industry can afford, we get
to be the country getting drugs at reduced prices, reflecting the value
we have delivered through our NHS infrastructure. That is why the Prime
Minister’s leadership in grasping this opportunity through the
life sciences strategy matters so much, as do the vision and the
measures contained within it—the £1 billion a year
investment in the National Institute for Health Research, the catalyst
fund, the patent box, the NHS open data initiatives, and now the
£100 million Genomics England project.

linking clinical and genomic data and using the power of modern

reassure patients by establishing in law that ultimate control lies
with us, the patients—that these are our data and we are clear
that they belong to and are controlled by us, not the Government or the
European Union, whose latest data protection laws risk holding back
this revolution in medicine. We need to raise awareness of the power of
patients to access our own data. We need to change the culture inside
the NHS so that patients who request data are not sneered at or
resented as troublesome but treated as enlightened health care citizens
taking an interest in and responsibility for our own or our loved
ones’ life

Bill would allow us to log on and check our medical histories,
including prescriptions, dates of when we saw who, and key medical
information—or to check for a loved one using their NHS
number—and to check and submit any changes or additional
information, any side effects or symptoms, and our compliance. This is
crucial information lying at the heart of modern medicine. We could use
our EPR—electronic patient record—to plug into the
exploding world of online health apps, which are transforming health
care with devices such as in-house diagnostics and watchstrap heart and
blood pressure monitors that can automatically upload data to our
electronic health record and transmit it to our clinician. We could use
the EPR to give permission for our data to be used in any NHS medical
research and/or to enter clinical trials. Ninety-nine per cent. of
patients say, when asked, that they would not only be happy for their
data to be used in trials but are amazed that they are not
already.</hs_Para>

the health care side, the Bill would mean that every health care
professional would have a duty to use the EPR system and keep our
records up to date, and to record treatment and ensure that the records
are passed on to the next person on the care pathway. Thus the EPR
becomes not a boring chore but the central tool for ensuring continuity
of care. If a person or their loved one, or a constituent, passes from
GP to hospital to community care sector and back again, as do an
increasing number of elderly patients, in particular, it would be easy
for them, their loved ones and their doctors and carers instantly to
track and monitor their status, condition, diagnosis and treatment, and
whose care they are in.</hs_Para>

gambling Bill in the next two years or even longer. It has taken 
<?notus-xml column=171?>three years for this small Bill to reach this stage. Although I accept
that the Government do not want to widen the Bill’s remit, it is
important to put things right that have been wrong. The Government want
better regulation and to help businesses to create more jobs. The hon.
Gentleman was right to point to the impact that the casino industry and
the gambling industry in general have on the economy and on jobs.
Gambling is an important industry, but it attracts unwelcome attention
from the likes of the <I>Daily Mail</I>, who do not want to see people
enjoying gambling. Gambling is an integral part of our way of life. One
need only look at the people who bet on the national lottery and at how
people enjoy horse racing and sports betting in

clause 1 sets out what needs to happen in casinos. Casinos are the most
regulated and, I would argue, the safest environments in the gambling
sector. I hope that the all-party support for new clause 1 will give
the Minister some cover in arguing elsewhere that it is important to
put this anomaly right.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T12:57:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

clause today, but there is a strong feeling among Members that
something must happen during the passage of the Bill. That is a strong

the case. I know that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T12:58:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

is an important relationship between sports and the betting industry.
That is why I support new clause 5, which was tabled by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T12:58:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford). It relates to the reporting of
suspicious activity and the power to obtain financial information. The
relationship between sports and gambling is unique. The problem is that
there is no sports betting right. Sports governing bodies have no
control over the bets that gambling companies offer on their sports.
For instance, in football, there might be betting on the number of
times the ball goes out of play or on the number of corners. The
concern is that such bets can lead to match fixing and betting
irregularities. The Government need to consider this issue, with regard
to the scandals in cricket and football that have emerged in recent
months and
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112643000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0001.htm#13112643000008">New
clause 7 relates to dormant accounts. The Minister heard
people’s feelings on that matter loudly and clearly in

that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112643000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0001.htm#13112643000009">I
also wish to consider the advertising watershed. I was the Minister
responsible for introducing the clauses on advertising and advice about
betting and gambling, and our view was that such advertising would be
shown around horse races and sports matches. We did not envisage so
much advertising for sports betting before the 9 pm watershed. As I
said in Committee, I am a big 
<?notus-xml column=172?>fan of Ray Winstone, but he almost pressures people into betting in
those adverts. There is a need to consider advertising in terms of the
watershed and gambling, as in new clause 9.</hs_Para>

the most important provisions for the sector are new clauses 10 and 11
on the horserace betting levy, and the British Horseracing Authority is
keen to ensure that we address that issue in the Bill. I was impressed
that both sides of the equation—the betting and horse racing
industries—came together, and we have a new four-year
arrangement on the levy. However, when the Bill is enacted it will be a
nonsense if people offshore do not contribute to that levy, and it is
important to pursue that issue. Now that there is an agreement for the
next four years, there will be a tendency to put the issue to one side,
but I think that would be a grave mistake for both racing and betting.
We have an important opportunity to try and put things right, and those
who are offshore should certainly contribute to the horserace betting
levy when they come onshore. That levy maintains support for the horse
racing industry, which is important to many Members of the House,
whether they have a race course in their constituency or are involved
in promoting horse racing through a variety of support
mechanisms.</hs_Para>

will not contribute until the end of December next year, so there is an

understand why some might think that idea superficially attractive, but
my view is that the new clause is completely pointless. A kitemark does
not attract people to a particular gambling website or
company—it tends to be the odds being offered that attract
people to those websites or companies. I admire the naivety, I suppose,
of the shadow Minister who thinks that if we put a kitemark on the
bottom of every licensed website, every punter in the country will
ignore all better odds available and just bet blindly because of the

got the gambling companies to agree to the voluntary levy, which raises
around £5 million or £6 million a year. It was
he who said that if they did not do it voluntarily, he would legislate
to ensure that they did it. How voluntary that would have made it is a
different matter; we can debate the definition of
“voluntary”. The upshot is that the companies are doing
this and are doing so on a voluntary basis. The hon. Gentleman is
absolutely right; not every single gambling company contributes and it
relies on some of the larger ones—such as Ladbrokes and William
Hill—to make what might be considered a disproportionate
contribution to raise the required amount. But the money that is being
requested is being raised each year. We do not really need new clause
4; the money that people are seeking, properly, for the treatment of
problem gamblers and

new clause undesirable as well. The first thing, which never comes out,
is that bookmakers are the victims of match fixing, not the cause of
it. It is usually people involved in a particular sport, or referees or
umpires, who conspire in effect to defraud bookmakers. On the principle
that the polluter should pay, it seems bizarre to say that the
bookmakers are being ripped off by people involved in sport and that we
should therefore penalise bookmakers for being the victims of the
crime. The people who should be paying to clean up their sports are the
sports. It is the participants, umpires or referees who are causing the
problem and causing a cost to the
bookmaker.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112643000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0001.htm#13112643000031"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Sutcliffe" PimsId="4180" UID="13112643000129" xid="575" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0001.htm#13112643000129">Mr
Sutcliffe:</Member></B> I am with the hon. Gentleman most of the way,
but part of the problem is that the sports are not in control of the
types of bet that can be put on their sport. That is how
players—particularly young players—can be corrupted.
There is an issue in terms of the relationship between betting and
sports and it would be better if the sports had control over what could
be bet upon.</hs_Para>

not least because he is a constituent of mine and it might

point on match fixing—for example, all the issues recently in
cricket, with no-balls being bowled and issues related to the Pakistan
team—is that much of the money gambled was not with legitimate
bookmakers in the UK but with illegal bookmakers in the far
east. All the proposals in new clause 5 will not make a

these issues are important, the Minister will be consulting the

these new clauses should seek to put into a Bill a statutory obligation

I think the Minister will confirm that extending the Bill to include a

I mentioned on Second Reading, it seems to me as an onlooker that what
tends to happen if any Government have to determine the levy—let
us hope that we keep the current position of an agreement being reached

Ministers—is that they look to produce a certain figure that
they think should be raised by the gambling industry to pay towards the
levy. Most Ministers would think £75 million was a roughly
appropriate sum. The formula for the levy is then worked out to
generate the £75 that the Government think should go to the
industry.</hs_Para>

that will happen by forcing through these new clauses is that the

do not think they will generate an extra penny piece for racing and the

concerned at the time. We are not in a position to be clear about what
the result of any legal challenge would be. All we could be clear about

clause 12 is about financial blocking for illegal sites. Superficially,
it seems attractive that measures should be taken to try to
stop people gambling through sites that are not properly

however, is that other countries have shown that financial
blocking does not work. Other countries have tried to
restrict online gambling and tried to make licences available only to a
few operators, but this has failed in every single country that has
tried it. It fails because there are ways around financial
blocking—by 
<?notus-xml column=178?>using PayPal and other methods, for example, which cannot be blocked by

Members have suggested that the Government’s basic objective is
to close a the tax loophole that led numerous online gambling companies
to relocate from the United Kingdom to white-listed or European
economic area jurisdictions back in 2007. However, the Government have
made clear that that is not the case, arguing that the Bill is actually
all about consumer protection, and I am very pleased that they are
focusing on that issue.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112643000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112643000060">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:33:56"></hs_TimeCode>
the face of it, the Bill requires all online gambling providers that
are located beyond the UK but are accessed by the UK market to have UK
licences. That too is good news, but it seems to me that the
Government’s good intention breaks down on two bases. It is all
very well to have good intentions, but those good intentions must be
translated into specific rules and legislation if we are to help
problem gamblers, who are vulnerable people. I had the impression in
Committee that both Government and Opposition were in favour of that,
and I therefore think that all Members should feel able to support new
clause
14<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:34:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112643000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112643000061">First,
as has been said in earlier debates, although the Bill presents
companies outside the UK with a carrot in the form of the offer of
advertising, it does not provide any kind of stick. There is nothing to
prevent companies without licences from continuing to access the UK
market; they just cannot advertise. That first failing feeds directly
into the second. If there is nothing to prevent companies without
licences from accessing the UK market, the primary practical
implication of the Bill will be that there is more advertising for
online gambling, which has increased hugely in recent years in any
event. There is a risk that a Bill that was supposed to be about better
consumer protection will quickly become, to a significant extent, the
“Liberalisation of Gambling Advertising Bill”, although I
am sure that that is not the
intention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:35:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112643000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112643000062">The
prospect of further advertising liberalisation for online gambling is
particularly worrying, because online gambling has one of the highest
“problem prevalence” figures. To understand the basis for
public concern about that prospect, we need to have an understanding of
the very real issue of problem gambling, which is a profoundly
destructive addiction that ruins lives and, on occasion, ends in
suicide. According to the gambling prevalence survey of 2010, there are
approximately 450,000 problem gamblers in the UK today. However, if we
are to understand that problem fully, we must remember that no
man—or woman—is an island, and that each of those people
is likely to be connected to family members who feel the destructive
impact of problem gambling on 
<?notus-xml column=181?>their lives as well. Problem gambling goes beyond the problem gamblers
themselves; it affects their families too, which means that the 450,000
figure can quickly increase to some 2
million<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:36:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112643000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112643000063">In
Committee, the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:36:35"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Bradford South (Mr Sutcliffe) expressed concern about
those with gambling addictions, and suggested that the Secretary of
State for Health should look into the possibility of money from the
gambling profession being set aside to help people with addictions. I
am sure that many of us agree with that valuable suggestion, which
served as another indication of the concern about the Bill that was
felt by all members of the
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:37:06"></hs_TimeCode>. When
we focus on remote gambling, we discover that while the average problem
prevalence figure is 0.9%, the figure relating to online slot machines
is over 9%. On a monthly basis, it shoots up even further, to over 17%.
That problem will continue unless we establish robust legislation to
deal with it.</hs_Para>

the Bill was published, concern had already been expressed about
discrimination in the provision of less credible care for online
problem gamblers than for terrestrial online gamblers with respect to
“self-exclusion”, which is one of the key measures to
help problem gamblers. Problem gamblers have the option of going to a
gambling provider and excluding themselves from the services of that
provider for a fixed period such as six months. That works in practice,
because, as with other addictions, while people have weak days, they
also have strong days. On a strong day, problem gamblers will be able
to get around the five betting shops in their town to exclude
themselves and thus ensure that they are protected from accessing
gambling from the place where they live for a full six months, during
which time they can build up their defences, obtain help, and decide
what they want to do when the self-imposed period of exclusion
ends<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:38:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112643000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112643000065">What
is the problem with that? The key problem is that, while in an offline
context there is a credible opportunity for problem gamblers to benefit
from a key tool that has been developed for them, there is no such
credible opportunity online. As I have said, it is quite possible for a
problem gambler to self-exclude from all five betting shops in his town
on a strong day, but the same is not true online. The problem gambler
could self-exclude from five online gambling sites that he can access
from his or her bedroom, but could still have access to hundreds of
other sites from that bedroom. It would be physically impossible for
the online gambler to self-exclude from all online gambling
opportunities that are accessible to him in his bedroom.</hs_Para>

offer the offline problem gambler a credible form of protection through
self-exclusion, but deny it to the online gambler. I believe that that
anomaly must be addressed, because it is not just at a time when
providing a credible one-stop shop is technologically possible. A
one-stop shop self-exclusion mechanism, as set out in new clause 14,
would mean that people have only to self-exclude from online gambling
once by registering with the Gambling Commission. The commission would
keep a list of all those who had self-excluded, and all those in
receipt of an online gambling licence from the commission would be
required to respect the list.

hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) referred to due diligence and
the support across the House on this subject. I believe we have to
start somewhere, and we should start here today. The bones might come
from the House of Lords, but new clause 14 would give this House the
opportunity to decide in what direction we want to go, and if we want
to go in the direction of helping these problem gamblers and vulnerable
people, new clause 14 would be a step in the right direction. The Bet
Buddy system enables operators to check whether someone is on a
centralised list of players who have self-excluded. Dr Gainsbury argues
that collaborative efforts would help strengthen self-exclusion, and
research presented to the Canadian-based Responsible Gambling Council
in 2011 by British-based GamCare and the university of Salford, along
with Bet Buddy, endorsed the proposal—further examples of
support from within the gambling sector and also, I hope, from the
Gambling
Commission<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:42:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112643000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112643000070">The
arguments I have made for a one-stop shop in terms of
non-discrimination hold at the moment, but with the proposal in the
Bill to make people in the UK—and therefore problem gamblers in
the UK—more aware of online gambling opportunities, the failure
to provide a credible model of self-exclusion for those gambling online
becomes much more serious. We already effectively discriminate against
online problem gamblers in the care that we offer by providing them
with a far weaker self-exclusion opportunity than that afforded to
other problem gamblers. The Bill not only gives us an opportunity to
put that right, but massively compounds the imperative for us to do so
by introducing new arrangements that will make problem gamblers more
aware of online gambling
opportunities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:42:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112643000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112643000071">Given
that online problem gambling has one of the higher problem prevalence
figures, that one of the key accepted tools to help problem
gamblers—self-exclusion —does not work as effectively
online as it does in a terrestrial context, and that it is
technologically possible to make good this shortcoming through the
provision of a one-stop shop self-exclusion mechanism, the only
possible reason for inaction can be a lack of political will within the
House. I am sure that that is not the case. Given that we are proposing
to make life even more difficult for online problem gamblers by making
them more aware of online gambling opportunities and that we have the
opportunity to introduce new compensatory measures to help them, a
failure to act could only be the result of a terrible failure of moral
will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:43:40"></hs_TimeCode>. Why is
there a 
<?notus-xml column=183?>political and moral will to address online safety challenges in other
contexts, but not in this context? Given that doing so would help
thousands of online problem gamblers, what possible justification can
there be for not backing new clause 14 as a step in that
direction?</hs_Para>

this issue was discussed in Committee, the Minister’s response
seemed to be twofold. First, she said that the matter was
“complicated”, and secondly she said the industry was
working hard and that she wanted to give it more time. First, I know it
is complicated —online regulation is complicated—but it
is also technologically possible, for the reasons I have explained. The
question is not whether it is complicated, but whether we care about,
and can we be bothered to help, the thousands of problem gamblers in
this country and their families whose lives are being ruined by online
gambling and to whom we currently do not afford the same protections as
terrestrial gamblers. Like others Members, I see people in my surgeries
who have addictions, whether it be to alcohol, gambling or something
else. Whenever someone takes a stand and says, “I’ve got
a problem”, that is the first stage, but they cannot beat it on
their own; they need help, and all of us—Government bodies and
ourselves—have to gather around and help. That is what I am
trying to do with new clause
14.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:45:11"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

what is the industry doing specifically about a one-stop shop for
self-exclusion? That is a direct question to the Minister. I am not
aware of any one-stop shop initiatives, so I would be delighted if she
could tell me of some. At the end of the day, our response to new
clause 14 will depend simply on whether we care about online problem
gamblers, with their higher online problem prevalence
figure—about the fact that they are currently denied access to a
form of self-exclusion that is as robust as terrestrial
self-exclusion, and that the Bill proposes to make them more aware of
online gambling opportunities. If we care, mindful of the technological
possibility of what new clause 14 proposes, we should find the
political will and make it happen, as we have in other efforts to
promote online safety. If we do not care, we will make excuses and move
on. I hope the Government will support the new clause, and I
look forward to the Minister’s response. I intend to press new
clause 14 to a vote.</hs_Para>

remote machines allowable in a casino. On Second Reading, the Minister
argued that the proposed change would undermine existing regulatory
controls on gaming machine provisions, but the new clause would ensure
that the effective size of the virtual part of the casino remained

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:48:15"></hs_TimeCode>I understand why
the Government might be reluctant to support the new clause, because
there is a danger that casinos could be encouraged to promote the

hand with the introduction of a tax regime that creates a level playing

lawful, enjoyable activities but, because they can hold some risk for
certain vulnerable people, society accepts that it is reasonable that
they should be used or engaged in under certain controls and in
controlled environments. Throughout my time as pubs Minister, I
actively promoted the value of the public house as a safe place in
which to enjoy alcohol. My hon. Friend’s new clause adopts the
same principle; if someone is gambling using a tablet, a casino will
offer a more controlled environment in which to do so than their home.

into the UK jurisdiction and the UK’s Gambling Commission will
have responsibility for it. We need to ensure that there is no

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:56:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Shipley (Philip Davies), the new clauses and amendments have
allowed us to have a wide-ranging debate on gambling, and to explore
concerns about this area of regulation. That is only fit and proper.
The hon. Gentleman’s amendment 1 is a sensible proposition; I
have no objection to his proposal for a report that would give us an
opportunity to keep an eye on what was going on. We often pass
legislation that simply drifts off into the ether and seldom comes back
to us, and we rarely have the chance to see how our work is functioning
out there. I therefore welcome his sensible suggestion.</hs_Para>

I cannot say the same about new clause 1. I will listen carefully to
what the Minister says about it, and I entirely respect the views of
the Select Committee. I understand its point about the anomaly of
someone being able to gamble on a hand-held device outside a casino but
unable to do so perhaps only a few paces away inside the building. I
have looked at some of the websites and seen the sums of prize money
increasing at an alarming rate. Sometimes, total prizes of £8
million are advertised. The proposed change for casinos would therefore
represent a very big step. If there is a case for such a change, we
should consider it in more

Sutcliffe:</Member></B> Has my hon. Friend had a chance to read the
briefing from the National Casino Industry Forum? It deals with the way
in which casinos would implement and monitor the proposed change, if
new clause 1 were to be accepted. It has been stated that our casino
industry is the most regulated of the lot, and I would say it is also
the safest of the lot. I understand my hon. Friend’s fears about
new clause 1, but because of the way in which the industry is regulated
and the way in which it protects people with gambling
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T13:58:55"></hs_TimeCode>, I do
not share his concerns.</hs_Para>

Efford:</Member></B> I have seen that document. I agree with my hon.
Friend: the UK gambling industry is highly regulated and highly
regarded. I have a great deal of respect for the way in which it
conducts its affairs, and I would not suggest for a minute that it
would not deal with this new area of the market in a responsible way,
were the new clause to be accepted. The proposal does, however,
represent a major step forward, because unlimited prizes would be
offered on machines—albeit remote gambling
machines—inside casinos. We have regulated 
<?notus-xml column=187?>on that cautiously in the past. If we are to take that step, it would
need consideration in separate legislation or a change in the licensing
rules, whichever is required. Having looked at these websites, I think
that we need to consider the matter further and that it would not be
appropriate to take this step in this Bill.</hs_Para>

listened to what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T14:01:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Shipley said about spread betting, but I fundamentally disagree
with him. There is a gaping anomaly in the current regulations: licence
condition 15.1 simply does not apply to spread betting operators. That
is a very important area of the regulation, because it requires the
operator to share information about any suspicious activity with the
national governing body for the relevant sport. This is an important
area of activity because it allows the governing bodies to have some
influence over how their sport is being policed and what is being done
to address things, and to share information where they suspect that
fixed betting may be taking place.</hs_Para>

for Rochford and Southend East (James Duddridge), whose eagle eye
spotted a possible defect in the drafting of the earlier proposal. New
clause 5 therefore makes specific reference to schedule 6 to the
Gambling Act 2005, which defines what a sport’s governing body
is and what sports would be covered by this new clause. Schedule 6
defines the governing bodies of sport, national and international, that
the Gambling Commission is committed to sharing information with. It
also allows for the transfer of betting data and customer information
between the Gambling Commission and sports bodies without the need to
worry about issues such as data protection. Schedule 6 was updated by
the Government ahead of the London Olympics, when the Government did a
lot of work in establishing an anti-corruption betting framework and
wanted to be able to share information with the International Olympic
Committee.</hs_Para>

for Shipley that if he were to look on the websites, he would have to
accept, as the Gambling Commission does, that what is on them at the
moment is a mess. We are talking about tiny writing that is confused
with a lot of other information at the bottom of the sites. He
undersold my new clause, because I was not suggesting that the kitemark
should be at the bottom; I suggested it should be in a prominent
position at the top of the websites, where people can find it easily.
It should not just be a symbol. It will be a tool that will connect
people with the Gambling Commission and all sorts of information about
what to do if they are not happy with the service they have been
provided with; who regulates and on what basis; and how to get help if
they have problems with gambling. There will be a link to all other
sorts of sites that will assist people. Having a common feature such as
a symbol that is used regularly on all websites and that regular
punters will recognise will be an important tool for consumers, so I

another such opportunity may be many moons away. In the meantime, the
horse racing industry is missing out on vital income. The Minister has
an opportunity in the legislation to

Committee, the FCA clearly said that it would consider publishing
further guidance to the two spread betting operators that it regulates.
The FCA has come back since then and said that it will do that. I am
sure that the shadow Minister is aware of the teeth that such guidance
has, particularly if it is specific. If there is a breach of
guidance, that will clearly have serious consequences for those who
have breached it. In my opinion, this is a highly proportionate
response to an issue that, although important, does not require
intervention through primary legislation. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman agrees that there is absolutely no evidence that the
regulation of sports spread betting by the FCA has compromised sporting
integrity. I do not believe there is a case for a fundamental change to
the arrangements and it is right to allow the FCA, which is an
independent regulator, to get on with issuing the guidance. If
appropriate, the FCA will, of course, assess its effectiveness in due
course. I encourage the authority to do that very
quickly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112645000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112645000029">New

Eltham in Committee and today that providing clarity for consumers that
they are using a Gambling Commission-regulated site is an important
element of consumer protection. I hope that it would provide a strong
element of promotional advantage to the operators licensed by the
Gambling Commission. As I said in Committee, I will follow through on
my intention to see progress on the work that the commission has
already commenced to ensure that consumers can quickly and clearly
establish that they are transacting with a GB-licensed site. I
certainly do not intend to get involved in clarifying with the

the requirement for remote licensees to put into effect procedures for

co-operating and working together to help players self-exclude from
local gambling premises and online sites, but the industry is already
taking steps. A good example is the imminent harm minimisation
conference being organised by the Responsible Gambling Trust. I expect
to see progress on player protection over the coming months, including
the development of better tools to help players to gamble safely. If we

clause 14, tabled by the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon),
would enshrine in statute the requirement for the Gambling Commission

condition of the remote operating licence that individuals on the list
must be excluded. A one-stop shop might be an appropriate goal and I
know that it would do considerable good, but I do not wish to make a
commitment to pursue that option alone—given the complexities
and practicalities involved—when other elements of harm
minimisation might be even more significant, such as player feedback
and information on betting habits as well as in-play alerts on losses.
We should also not lose sight of the fact that self-exclusion is just
one tool in a suite of player protections. I urge the industry to make
the fastest possible progress. The shadow Minister pressed me on this
point in Committee and has done so again today, and I am prepared to

thank the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T14:30:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Bradford South for highlighting the subject of gambling
advertising in new clause 9. The Government acknowledge the growth of
gambling advertising since 2007, following the introduction of greater
freedoms. As I made clear in Committee, I am already examining what
impact that might be having on the licensing objectives of the Gambling
Act 2005 and whether the current arrangements, including the
9 pm watershed, remain
adequate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T14:31:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112645000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112645000041">The
research that I mentioned in Committee, which was published by Ofcom
last week, is an important step in clarifying the extent to which
advertising has grown and where that growth has been concentrated. It
also reveals the extent to which children and adults are exposed to
gambling advertising. The research also shows that, while advertising
has increased, the scheduling restrictions have been effective in
limiting the exposure of children to gambling advertising, and that the
vast majority of sports betting advertising is after the
watershed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T14:31:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112645000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112645000042">While
I find it reassuring that the scheduling restrictions have limited the
exposure of children to gambling advertising, the Government continue
to pay close attention to developments in the gambling advertising
market and are working closely with Ofcom, the Gambling Commission and
the Advertising Standards Authority. The Secretary of State and I met
last month with my officials and several of those organisations to
discuss the

can assure hon. Members that the Government take the issue very
seriously indeed and are already working to assess the adequacy of the
current arrangements. For this reason, there is no need to accept new
clause 9, but I will ensure that Parliament is kept informed of our
assessment of the impact of gambling advertising and, 
<?notus-xml column=195?>should I uncover evidence in the course of this work that suggests that
advertising codes no longer provide effective protections, I will not

but not least, new clauses 10 and 11 would extend liability

remote gambling operating licence from the Gambling Commission. I have

repeat yet again that I want to take the
opportunity—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T14:33:35"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Bradford South used the word
“opportunity”—that has been created
by the financial stability of the four-year voluntary
arrangement to take a proper look at levy reform and consult widely on
the sustainable, enforceable and legally sound options that emerge. We
must look beyond extending a system that is agreed to be out of date

am resisting the new clauses for two principal reasons. First, I do not
believe that we should assume that genuine levy reform lies in merely
extending the existing levy scheme. No one has disputed the view that
it no longer reflects the modern betting and racing industries. The new
clauses would not achieve genuine levy reform; they would merely extend
the current system. Secondly, as I have said previously, any extension
of the levy to offshore bookmakers as a result of the new clauses would
require EU Commission approval because the levy is a state aid scheme.
I will not implement the proposals, for which we do not have EU
approval in respect of state aid. Nor am I convinced that we should
seek EU approval for an extension of the current levy when we do not
know that it will satisfy the need for proper
reform<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T14:34:54"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T14:34:55"></hs_TimeCode>.

have also been urged to take a power to extend the levy at a future
point, but that assumes that all that we might wish to do is extend the
existing system, and that would not be genuine levy reform. Even if we
took such a power, we could find that it was too narrowly scoped to
enable us to achieve what we wanted—for example, to meet the EC

Government have not accepted any amendments on these matters, as we do
not believe the Bill is the right vehicle for such changes, we have

questions that we have raised will be tested by how well the Gambling
Commission enforces the requirements that are laid out in the Bill and
implicit in the licence. Aspects such as research, treatment, the
protection or self-exclusion of individuals, enforcement tools using IP
blocking, financial blocking, and possible change to the watershed will
all be subject to enforcement by the Gambling Commission. We will have
to remain vigilant and see how that is implemented to ensure that the

Davies:</Member></B> I, too, rise to support the Bill, although not
necessarily for the reasons it was introduced. The Government
introduced the Bill—if we believe what they say—for the
purposes of regulation, but it seems to me that for the purposes of
regulation it is completely unnecessary. In fact, it will probably make
the regulatory system worse, because although virtually every gambling
operator used by UK consumers is currently properly regulated, either
here or in other places such as Gibraltar, the chances are—the
Treasury’s own forecasts show this—that as a result of
the Bill around 20% of betting will take place with unlicensed and
unregulated operators. As far as the regulation of gambling is
concerned, the Bill represents a step backwards, rather than a step
forwards.</hs_Para>

perfectly legitimate thing for the Government to do, but I understand
that for legal reasons within the EU they do not want to say it. I am

useful in paying down our debts. The success or failure of the Bill
will depend not on the legislation, but on the rates of taxation the
Treasury places on the gambling industry as a consequence of it. The
Treasury—I hope that the Minister will take this message
back—must not stifle some of the smaller niche
gambling companies, which employ many people in this country, because
they would be finished off by a rate of 15%. The big
gambling companies can look after themselves, but the smaller ones need
a competitive rate. Otherwise, they will go out of business and we will
end up losing jobs and tax revenue. Notwithstanding those concerns, I

Media and Sport, because it is important that they work with the

to discuss the gambling industry in the House are few and far between.
One of the difficulties is that some people take a blanket approach to
gambling and oppose anything to do with it because they think that it
is alien to our country, but in reality that is not the
case. As we have seen with the success of the national lottery and
national institutions such as the derby, the grand national and many
other racing events, sport and gambling are interlinked.</hs_Para>

important thing about the Bill is that it offers a consumer safeguard,

Gambling Act 2005. However, we have put a lot of trust in the Minister
today—I do not doubt that it will be honoured—to do
things we have asked her to do. We have asked her to look at
the casino industry and, outside the scope of the Bill, the

country. The problem is that if it takes four years to reach a
conclusion for the next negotiations, some race courses and parts of
the industry might not survive. I hope that she can give some momentum
to that. I referred in Committee to the other place, and I am sure that
when the Bill goes to the other place its Members who are even more

period in 1991, ever since the first London local authorities Bill was
deposited in November 1988 there has been at least one such Bill before
Parliament. When this Bill obtains Royal Assent, as I trust
it now will, that continuous record will end. The torch is being
carried on to some extent by TfL with a Bill that is currently in the
Lords, but for the London boroughs, for the moment, that is it. As
it happens, tomorrow is the day by which private Bills must
be deposited in Parliament. I have it on very good authority that a
London local authorities Bill will not be deposited.</hs_Para>

in a Bill but only what is left in it. However, it is important to put
it on record that all the provisions relating to pedicabs, for example,
which were very controversial, have been completely removed. As I

have noticed a distinct drying up of the number of private Bills being

they have been subject has become part of a deterrent process whereby
people realise that one cannot just dream up some idea, put it in the

order can continue for longer. As he has said, notice of a film notice
has to be given at least 24 hours before it comes into effect. The

television industry, quite a few of whom live in my constituency. Film
and television productions are facilitated if film makers are able to
use out-of-studio locations in the many picturesque locations in

take part. When a road is closed for the making of a film, however, the
film director will not want the public to be present, because they will

if one watches those films, one can see Shenley road as it was then,

some inconvenience is associated with attracting to Hertfordshire, and
in particular to my constituency, important productions that are of so
much general benefit to the public and the local economy. As far as I

about it—there is a general acceptance of that in my

the issue is: what is proportionate and reasonable? At the moment,
national legislation enables activities to take place on the highway
for a maximum of three days and ensures that no piece of road may be
affected more often than once a year. As I made clear in an
intervention, the Bill would make it possible for an individual piece
of highway to be closed for as long as 42 days a year, without any
compensation for businesses or residents who were inconvenienced or
suffered a loss as a result. The question is whether this House needs
to give such wide powers to a local authority through private
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:51:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112645001165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112645001165">One
can envisage what would happen if Westminster bridge was closed for 42
days a year for filming. One could make any number of
arguments as to why it would be a wonderful location for filming. If it
was closed for 42 days a year, one can imagine what the
consequences would be for local residents and other users of that
highway. I venture to suggest that the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984
was drafted in the way it was to maintain a balance between the
interests and needs of local residents and the wider interests that
might be served by closing a road for a particular purpose on a
particular
occasion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:52:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112645001166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112645001166">A
lot of films are made in Hertfordshire, so the county council feels it
needs to increase the powers that are available to it or, as my hon.

clarifying the wording of the 1984 Act. A clarification could be 
<?notus-xml column=219?>made by adding one or two words to that Act and without changing the
amount of time for which a road may be blocked. It is a
misrepresentation to suggest that the Bill merely seeks to clarify an
ambiguity in the existing legislation. It goes far beyond that and I
hope that in
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:53:13"></hs_TimeCode> it
will be given a degree of scrutiny commensurate with those extra

have been approached by Buckinghamshire county council. I do not know
why it thought it necessary to write to me for advice on introducing a
private Bill, but it had the courtesy of so doing. I wrote back to the
council leader and said that the Bill that he was seeking to bring
forward was very similar, if not identical, to this one. If it is
presented tomorrow, as we heard it might be, we will see. I suggested
that rather than his county council bringing forward a separate Bill,
it might get together with Hertfordshire and any other county council

the Minister wishes to intervene, I shall be happy to hear his answer.
Perhaps we will hear in due course whether he thinks it would be
appropriate for the national framework legislation to be changed so
that instead of having the rather unhealthy competition between rival
councils that are vying to present neighbouring towns as the most
friendly to film-makers, which ultimately comes at the expense of the
convenience of local people, there would be a more objective way of
assessing what is reasonable and what is
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112645001169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112645001169">There
is another point that concerns me about the Bill. When I am not in my
constituency, I live in a part of London that has a network of streets
that were constructed largely in the late-Georgian period. The streets
have retained their character and are often used for film sets. To
compensate residents for the inconvenience associated with the use of
local roads for film sets, which involves not being allowed to park and
sometimes having access impeded by film crews, film companies pay a
significant sum to the local residents association. It means that the
association can function and hold Christmas parties and such things
that it might not otherwise be able to afford. In a sense, there is a
quid pro quo. Film companies are not acting for charity but to make
money for themselves, so why should there not be a system for
compensating those who are inconvenienced as a result of those
activities? I would be interested if at some stage the promoters of the
Bill considered whether some provision could be included to ensure that
residents and businesses that are unduly inconvenienced, or perhaps
inconvenienced on more than one occasion each year, are entitled to
some compensation or recognition in monetary terms that they are making
a contribution that should be recognised by the film
company.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112645001170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0002.htm#13112645001170">Like

including the London Local Authorities and Transport for London Act
2008 and the Kent County Council (Filming on Highways) Act 2010, but we
had some initial reservations about the limited procedural protection
offered to property owners and the travelling public. These are similar

Hertfordshire county council. We are grateful that the council
reassured the Government that when it puts in place film orders and
film notices,  it will—to the extent that there are no
mandatory requirements in law—follow the procedures similar to
those set out in the Road Traffic (Temporary Restrictions) Procedure

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:07:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) asked a pertinent
point about whether this constituted an offence and, if so, what the
penalty was. I can tell him that it is an offence in the same way as a
transgression of existing provisions relating to other special events
for which roads are closed is an offence under the Road Traffic
Regulation (Special Events) Act 1994. I believe, although I could not
swear to this, that a level 3 fine will apply in this case.</hs_Para>

very much hope that those responsible for enforcing the Bill will take
a view on the public benefit and take cognisance of the public interest
in deciding whether any such prosecutions should take place. I hope
that that situation can largely be avoided. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:08:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North East Somerset quite rightly said, members of the
public who want access to their premises or who have other important
reasons for going about their lawful business should be able to do so.
I am sure that there will be a will for that to
apply.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112645001196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0003.htm#13112645001196">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:08:52"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope) raised
some important points about the time for which roads may be closed. I
very much hope that it can be kept to a minimum. As I understand it, we
have been talking about the maximum periods and on each occasion up to
six of the orders might be applied for, but I hope again that this will
be a maximum and that the filming can be completed in much less time.
As a maximum, of course, it can be debated. I probably agree with the
ideological views of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:09:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch as far as local and national public
ownership are concerned. This seems to be a case on its own, an

studios.</hs_Para>

can assure my hon. Friend that—as, indeed, I think he
knows—Hertsmere is not, in fact, a hotbed of socialism, but very
much a testing ground for Conservatism. In this instance it may be a
pragmatic type of Conservatism, for thanks to the keen commercial
acumen of the Conservative leadership of the council over the
time—quite a few years now—for which it has owned the
studios, they have been a great success. I could read out a long list
of films that have been made there, and another list of contemporaneous
television programmes. I have already mentioned “Strictly Come
Dancing”, but I could mention many other programmes, including
“Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?” and “Celebrity
Big Brother”. The BBC studios are the home of
“EastEnders”.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:10:33"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

purpose of the motion is to enable the House to sit until as late as
11.30 pm on Monday, or even later, in order to consider two motions,
one of which proposes to amend Standing Orders. I wanted to know why
the Leader of the House had decided that the business should be debated
so late on Monday, after a Second Reading debate on the important
Mesothelioma Bill. Why could it not be debated at some other time? I
believe that the motion proposing amendments to Standing Orders has
been on the Order Paper for a long time, and I understand from contacts
that I have had with my own Whip that the Government are concerned
about the possibility that the House will divide at 10 pm on Monday.
The business is highly contentious, which is why Members have been told
that they will not be allowed to be “slipped”, or that
slips that had been granted to them have been withdrawn. That suggests
the Government regard it as highly contentious. If they do, it is all
the more reason it should be given a primetime slot, rather than pushed
towards midnight on Monday.</hs_Para>

debate; I am making only a short point. Why does the Leader of the
House need to close down debate on these issues and limit the
discussion to 45 minutes on each of the two subjects, one of which has
been the subject of a Government amendment to the motion tabled by the

Friends  the Members for Christchurch (Mr Chope) and
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:23:59"></hs_TimeCode>for
Wellingborough (Mr Bone) for their good-natured contributions. It is
entirely right that they should ask  a number of questions
about this motion as the time permits. It might be sensible if I make
it clear that the business of the House motion has two main effects.
First, it allows the House to take the two motions together for debate.
Given that both relate to the work of the Backbench Business Committee,
that seemed entirely sensible, as it would not otherwise have been
possible for them to be brought together in one debate. Secondly, it
specifies a maximum time for debate of one and a half hours, as my hon.
Friends have noted. My view is that that is an entirely sensible period
to allow for this debate. I freely admit that that is a
judgment about the amount of time in which the issues that
arise on these two motions are likely to be debated. My personal view
is that the second motion, relating to the capacity for Select
Committee reports to be launched, will not detain the House for long,
as we have seen in practice, but it needs to be regularised in the

Lansley:</Member></B> I think I have explained straightforwardly the
judgment I have made, which is that the two motions relating to the
work of the Backbench Business Committee in the House can be brought
together perfectly sensibly. The latter motion, which I understand has
the support of the Chairs of the Liaison Committee and the Backbench
Business Committee, would not detain us at any great length. From my
point of view, in order to protect Government time, it is important for
us to ensure that we have allowed these motions to be brought forward
for the House to debate. I freely admit to the House that it has been
difficult to find Government time. The Backbench Business Committee, as
my hon. Friends will know, does not have the capacity to use its own
time to bring forward its own motions relating to itself.
<I>[Interruption.]</I> That is a separate debate, but the Committee
does not have that capacity under the Standing Orders. 
<?notus-xml column=229?>For these motions to be debated, Government time has to be used, and so

opportunity. That has been difficult and we have made the appropriate

that there is time available for all the business. My objective is not
to fill time. I say gently to my hon. Friends that they could have
raised the matter when I announced provisional business at business
questions last Thursday. They have done so in the past. They have
raised issues after business questions and, on occasions, I have taken
those issues away and we have amended the timing and the character of
business. In this particular instance, I have to say that the motion
relating to Back-Bench business has been on the Order Paper since
before the summer recess. It relates to a report published by the
Procedure Committee in November 2012. It has taken us more time than we
would have wished to bring it forward. The Procedure Committee was
rightly keen that we should schedule that business. We have done so,
and we have given it adequate time. From my point of view, I hope that

of my constituents work as police officers and firefighters at the

work force have a retirement age of 60. Those who have a retirement age
of 65 tend to be younger people who have joined recently, so it is

of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 on the health and well-being of
defence police and firefighters, and at the ability of those over 60 to
meet the strict fitness requirements that are needed for the important
and dangerous job that they do. The report will also
consider the consequences of early retirement for workers who are
forced to retire early on health grounds because they cannot meet the
stringent fitness requirements. It will also look at the likely cost to

tabled a new clause which became section 36 of the Act, which set up
the review that we are now discussing. I hope and expect that that
review will recommend an age of 60, for all the reasons that I have

think that the passage of the Bill was secured only because of those

simply do not believe that it would be right for these workers to work
beyond 60. The most appropriate comparison is with other firefighters
and police officers. Members of all the other fire services and police

service pension scheme historically had a lower employee contribution
than police and fire service pension schemes, so defence police and
fire service workers had net pay deductions and abatements taken off
their pay in an attempt to give parity with other police and fire

defence firefighters’ pension is based on net pay after those
deductions, rather than on their gross pay. Other police and fire
service staff receive a pension based on their gross pay before
employee superannuation payments are deducted. An actuary engaged by
the Defence Police Federation has said that the abatement and net pay
deduction system is antiquated and very unfair. There may have been a
logic to the system when it was introduced 30-odd years ago, but over
time it has become antiquated. I hope that that will be looked into as
part of the review.</hs_Para>

the remit of other Government Departments and the devolved
Administrations. In addition to investigating whether people over 60
are likely to be physically fit enough to carry out policing and
firefighting duties, the review should look at levels of abatement of
pay and net pay deductions. In that regard, I draw the House’s

want to go back to the original debate, because it is important that we
set the issue in the right context. To be frank, we approached it in
legislation quite late in the day. This seemed to be an area of service
that had been missed out in the debate on pensions. The emphasis in
that debate—and this is exactly the final point made by the hon.
Gentleman—was on the physical capacity of that group of workers
to do the job once they reached the age of 60.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112645001288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/debtext/131126-0003.htm#13112645001288"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:51:24"></hs_TimeCode>I
have seen some of the figures that Unite has submitted as part of the
review, and they demonstrate that for workers over the age of 60 in
this field the absentee rate doubles as a result of sickness and
incapacity. That is a clear indication that it becomes more difficult
to undertake the job. The argument has been
made—<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:51:47"></hs_TimeCode>we
debated this in the context of the Fire Brigades Union
dispute—that if someone is incapable of achieving the required
fitness levels, they might be redeployed within the service. We have
discovered that those vacancies do not exist, so redeployment is not
really an option. People face continuing in the job at a risk to their
health—lack of fitness quickly becomes incapacity, as we have
seen in other emergency services—or they face losing their job
with a reduced pension as a result of having to withdraw from the
service. There are certainly no opportunities for
redeployment.</hs_Para>

whole issue is the unfairness of the situation. When people are called
out to tackle a fire or for any other incident, they are all called out
to do the same task. They do not have on their helmet something saying
“Reduced duties” or “Unfit for lifting certain
ladders”. They are all called to do the same task, so they all
require the same fitness levels. As a result of our concerns, at least
we managed to insert into the Bill provisions for a proper review that
took into account the issue of fitness and ageing with regard to the
responsibilities people were required to discharge.</hs_Para>

understanding is that some aspects of the review are based, for
example, on 12 months of absentee rates rather than on 24 months. I
hope that the review will look comprehensively at all the
information—and as the hon. Gentleman has said, the word we have
is that management support the workers in their demands, because they
understand the nature of the role that they have to perform—but,
whatever the review says, at the end of the day it is for Ministers and
Government to decide. I return to the point that I made earlier: when
that legislation was going through the House a common-sense view was
taken by the majority of members that, yes, a review would take place,
but it would take into account the strength of feeling among Members of
Parliament, who recognised the importance of that role and the
difficulties of discharging it for an ageing work force if people have
to stay on beyond 60.</hs_Para>

implement it rapidly to reassure the workers concerned. I remember the
debate, because Member after Member stood up to praise the service
provided by that group of workers. I remember them being described as
loyal professionals undertaking their task in a way that we all
commended, and putting their lives at risk at different times in their
history. Now that the review, as the hon. Gentleman said, is more open
and transparent, I hope that the drafts will be provided to all the
parties concerned in advance of publication so that they are aware of
what is coming, and that Ministers will deal with the matter speedily

moved away from routine security towards higher value armed guarding
roles. Nevertheless, Blelloch noted that there were still substantial
differences between the role of the MDP and the role of Home Department
forces, such as the lower level of crime dealt with and the attendant
physical stresses and strains placed upon Home Department police
forces, as opposed to their counterparts in the

the armed forces, firefighters employed by local authorities and Home
Department police forces. For those individuals, he proposed that the

it is worth telling. When I entered Parliament in 2001, before giving
my maiden speech—I am sure other colleagues did the

<?notus-xml column=2?>what my predecessor did. My predecessor, who is now Lord Jones, talked
about the two great powerhouses of the area, which were Courtaulds
Textiles and British Steel. One of those companies has gone altogether,
and the other is still important but employs only a fraction of the
numbers it did back then. It still holds the record for the most job
losses on a single day at a single plant, when more than 8,000 people
lost their job. We cannot assume that, just because companies are big
and employ a lot of people, they will be there for ever and a

other areas that suffered in the 1980s have still not recovered, but
because of the efforts of Flintshire county council and others,
including my predecessor Lord Jones, new investment was attracted to
the area, and we have managed to build on that. Importantly, we want to
attract companies that will stay, not just companies that come because
they want grant assistance and that will then up stumps and move
somewhere else. We want long-term investment not only in buildings but
in the work force. Even in good times, we have seen that successful
companies can still fail. I remember when we thought that the optical
fibre market was doing extremely well, but it crashed overnight and the
high-tech factory closed. We lost quality jobs in a relative boom

are getting by okay at the moment, so why do we need to improve and
update our transport network? To be honest, we are barely getting by.
If we get the level of growth in the local area for which we hope, we
will need to improve things, because our transport system is creaking
at the seams in places. The Mersey Dee Alliance carried out research,
which is included in both the Haywood and the north-east Wales
integrated transport taskforce reports to the Assembly, showing that we
can expect to get between 40,000 and 50,000 jobs in the next 20 years.
That figure comprises Mersey waters enterprise zone, with 20,000 jobs;
Deeside enterprise zone, with 5,000 to 7,000 jobs; 4,500 jobs at
Ellesmere Port; Ince resource recovery park, with 3,200 jobs; the
university of Chester’s Thornton site, with 2,000 to 4,000 jobs;
central Chester business district, with more than 1,000
jobs; the Northgate project, Chester, with 1,600 jobs; Wrexham
industrial estate and western gateway, with 2,500 jobs; 7,500 jobs in
Denbighshire; Vauxhall Motors, with 700 jobs; and Bank of
America, with 1,000 jobs. So we hope that a substantial number of jobs
will come to the area during the next 20 years, which is positive

There has been some mention of having an airport in north Wales at

Germany, and for a limited number of light aircraft movements. It is in
a very built-up area, and we have two perfectly good airports at

Wales and part of it in England, so it would require a commitment from
both sides. There is often a strong commitment from Wales in these
cases, as there would clearly be access to markets in England—in
mid-Wales, near Middletown, there is a very strong case, and only a
little bit of the road would be in England. The case from Wales is very
strong and the investment would be made, but the case from the English
side is very weak, because there is little access to markets. Although
the scheme would be hugely important to the benefit of Wales, it cannot
go ahead. It has been stopped, by devolution, from even being
considered. That is a negative aspect of devolution which will grow
over time. As road links elsewhere in Wales improve, we will still find
bottlenecks on the border that cannot be dealt with because of
devolution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112635000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112635000041"><B><Member ContinuationText="Hywel Williams" PimsId="4619" UID="13112635000237" xid="637" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112635000237">Hywel

Discussions about that particular road crossing in Llanymynech had been
going on for many years, but my understanding is that it is now not
being considered at all, because of the difficulty of coping with the
constitutional problems. Cross-border links in other parts of Wales
have fallen off the radar because of the difficulties of taking them
forward. We must address
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112635000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112635000043">Devolution
is not independence. It is not separation, even though some Members
might prefer it to be so. We need the Governments in Wales and England
to work together on projects in which they both have an interest and
accept that sometimes the priority on one side must be considered
alongside the priority on the other. With cross-border links—I
have used the example of Llanymynech today—that is crucial. The
English Government must consider the economic benefits of Wales when
looking at the priority they might give to such schemes. I hope the
Minister takes that on board and considers it in relation not only to
north Wales, but to cross-border links from the north to the south of
Wales.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13112635000044" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112635000044">9.54

central contention to the Minister is perhaps contrary to what the hon.

England matters to my constituents and to north-east Wales. What
happens in England with these projects—for example, the Halton
curve, linking north-east Wales to Liverpool, electrification from
Crewe to the north Wales coastal 
<?notus-xml column=7?>railway line, and the potential HS2 project and its Crewe
link—matters a lot, and so does the speed with which people can
get to north-east Wales. Transport is devolved to the Assembly in many
respects, but the Assembly budget is set by the House of Commons, and
important issues for improving transport links to my constituency rest
partly with Department for Transport Ministers.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside began his speech by stating
the importance of the north Wales economy, which is linked to that of
north-west England. As he said, north Wales business is now worth more
than £10.4 billion to the economy, with 22% of the Welsh economy
and 30% of its manufacturing residing in north Wales. He spoke about
Airbus, paper, steel, wind farms and tourism. Only today, a report
shows that the north Wales coast path has brought 416,000
visitors to the county of Flintshire, which he and I represent, since
it opened. All those businesses and potential economic growth areas
rely on an efficient and effective public transport system.</hs_Para>

potential to create 45,000 jobs in the next 20 years, including at the
Wirral Waters enterprise zone, so it is the responsibility not only of
the Assembly but of the United Kingdom Government and Parliament to
help to develop the region’s transport system. We have great
potential for business and tourism growth. Only last week I hosted a
meeting at Flint town hall of Arriva Trains Wales, Virgin Trains,
Flintshire county council and Taith, the local council-sponsored

the points it made, which the Minister should reflect on, from his
perspective as the link between the UK Government and the Assembly. My
hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside highlighted difficulties
with public transport times versus car journey times and mentioned
Flint, in my constituency. It takes 16 minutes to get from Flint to the
industrial areas of Deeside by car, but 43 minutes by bus, with one

I finish, I have a few points to make about infrastructure. When
discussing infrastructure, we need to talk about broadband. The fact
that 10% of the broadband fund has been spent in Wales is a real
success for the Government and a great success for the partnership
between Westminster and the Assembly. The important investment from the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which has been matched and
supported by the Welsh Government, is most welcome.</hs_Para>

towards a modern economy, broadband infrastructure is just as important
as any transport link. Frankly, in an area aspiring to have new
businesses, saying that we have no broadband capability is not very
persuasive. That is also true from a tourism perspective; time and
again I am told by businesses in my constituency that the lack of
broadband capability and of wi-fi affects
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T10:09:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112635000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112635000074">All
that must be underpinned by the skills sector. We can talk about the
need to invest in infrastructure—whether road, rail or
broadband—to our hearts’ content, but we must also
underpin all that by training our young people so that they can take
the job opportunities. In that respect, the investments in Deeside
college, Glyndwr university and, in my constituency,
Llandrillo—including the support of Coleg Menai, which is part
of Grwp

that he made in trying to rewrite history: the A55 from Chester to

want to concentrate on some issues that have not been touched on, and
one that affects full integration is the ports. Britain is an island

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T10:12:18"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of

made it for England only.
English<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T10:15:45"></hs_TimeCode> ports
were allowed to share the £60 million, but Welsh ports were not
allowed to bid for it—there was just a Barnett consequential

some £3 million. Everyone knows that we cannot get much port
development for £3
million.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112635000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112635000080">Meanwhile<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T10:15:45"></hs_TimeCode>,
because the £60 million was an England-only policy, other ports
in England had the lion’s share, which meant that it has become

development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T10:13:20"></hs_TimeCode>.
Offshore wind development needs proper infrastructure to get goods to

Welsh ports have an even and level playing field for investment for the

is also important. I agree that there have been some huge improvements
over the past 15 years on the north Wales line. The investment in the
west coast line—some £13 billion over that
period—has given great benefit to north Wales, with faster and
better trains between Holyhead and Euston. That is why I support High
Speed 2; the same benefits could be derived from HS2, if we got those
fast links to Crewe in the first place and then electrification along
the north Wales coast. The issue is hugely important and we should look
at it positively. Dublin and London can be linked via north Wales,
which can be part of a huge European network between those

Wales the infrastructure in my view is really from the 1990s, but is
trying to cope with industry that is developing towards 2050, so we
need a far-sighted approach. We welcome the investments in
infrastructure that are now being made in the region. The Welsh
Government have promised to invest £44 million on the line from
Wrexham in Wales to Chester in England. That is crucial to the people
of Wales; many people go every morning from my constituency of Wrexham
across into England, to work for businesses such as General Motors in
Ellesmere Port or the pharmaceuticals centres in Daresbury. They have
high-quality jobs there and need to have contact with those areas. The

public sector transport connection. I am afraid that it is also
extraordinary that in the 1980s, the Wrexham-Chester railway line was

metro system in their region. It is true that there has been massive
investment in the past 10 years in the valleys lines and the Vale of
Glamorgan line in south Wales. That sort of rail investment has not
happened in our area in the past. It is coming now, and I have referred
to the cross-border investment in the Wrexham-Chester line, which will
lead to a big improvement and create a great deal of additional
capacity. We need to say to our colleagues in the UK Government and the
Welsh Government that if our tremendous industrial area is to sustain
jobs and be internationally competitive, we need to work collectively
to provide an infrastructure, in both skills and transport, that makes
the area too good for any globalised company to leave. North Wales has

a support network for our businesses. Businesses need to work together
with our educational institutions to put together proposals for the

so that people who are now travelling across the border can do so more
easily and far of them can use more public transport than at present.

successful air transport networks, but we have dreadful links to those
airports. Anyone who travels to those airports from the west would be
insane to travel by train, so they travel by car, which will create
additional pressure on the road network in the years ahead. We have to
look at how we will link to those international hubs, given our
international businesses.</hs_Para>

to look at High Speed 2, thinking ahead to its construction and how
north Wales will benefit from that. As north Wales MPs, we need to
press the Wales Office about HS2 to see how it will specifically
benefit our area, and we need to press the UK Government to ensure that
there is a plan for north Wales with regard to HS2. We have seen
enormous improvements in the rail network down to London and down
to Cardiff in recent years, mainly through investment in the
west coast main line but also through investment in north-south
networks within Wales. That has happened only because of insistent
pressure from north Wales. We need to keep that going and look much
more closely than we have in the past at the public transport system
within north-east Wales, especially the rail system. We need local
authorities, AMs and MPs to work together to speak out loudly on behalf
of the region that we should all be proud to

first about rail transport in north Wales. In the 19th century, rail
transformed north Wales. My home town of Rhyl had a population of
1,000, but when the train came in 1849, it turned Rhyl into a premier
tourist destination. Rail also opened up the port of Holyhead and the
train route to Ireland, bringing great wealth to north
Wales.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112635000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112635000106">In

smaller lines in north Wales and throughout the UK were closed, but in

we receive our fair share of the UK transport budget. London and the
south-east have  had massive input into their transport
infrastructure. They have had Eurostar; Crossrail, one of the biggest
construction projects in Europe, is being built; and Heathrow airport

rebalancing towards Wales and north-west England, and we in north Wales

when Virgin’s rolling stock was upgraded and we ended up with
Voyagers instead of Pendolinos. We must ensure that we are not

That electrification project will not start until 2015, so what about
north Wales? The Welsh

north, but when are we likely to see the funding mechanisms for that

back to funding for infrastructure in Wales, borrowing powers are

had the announcement back in October 2012 about borrowing powers. UK

devolved.</hs_Para>

should remind the Minister that in Scotland, borrowing is not linked to
income tax powers in that way. The Scotland Act 2012 gives the Scottish
Government the power from April 2015 to borrow up to £500
million for current expenditure to manage volatilities in tax revenue
when they gain responsibility for stamp duty and landfill tax. They
will also be able to borrow for capital expenditure, with a limit of
10% of the capital budget up to a maximum stock of £2.2 billion.
Both those powers are coming into effect prior to income tax-varying
powers. 
<?notus-xml column=21?>According to a similar formula, that would mean that the Welsh
Government could borrow about £150 million for capital
expenditure. Will the Minister clarify exactly what borrowing powers
will be given to the Welsh Government based purely on the devolution of
minor taxes? If some borrowing powers are to be linked to the
devolution of income tax powers, that is a very different situation
from the previous understanding that they were linked to the minor
taxes.</hs_Para>

Minister explain why there are still delays on the issue of borrowing
for the M4? We know that there may be some borrowing powers purely in
respect of the M4, as has been mentioned today. First, will he explain
what is preventing the Treasury from immediately permitting the Welsh
Government to use their existing borrowing powers to finance the
much-needed M4 upgrade? Secondly, and more importantly for this debate,
as the Welsh Government are being given specific borrowing powers for
the M4 first, with a more general borrowing power to follow, what will
happen to any north Wales projects? Will they have to wait for a more
general borrowing power, which could be until the end of the decade, or

people and businesses in north Wales. I commend the hon. Gentleman for
the way in which he addressed the issue, for the strategic oversight
that he brought to the debate and for his detailed knowledge. He has

infrastructure plays a vital role in the economy of Wales and in north
Wales. It enables people to access job opportunities and is a key
determining factor for the attractiveness of a location for business
investment. As the debate has demonstrated, there is a great deal that
we can be proud of in north Wales. The north Wales economy, and
particularly what we see in Wrexham and Deeside, is a jewel in the
crown of the Welsh economy at this time. Opposition Members have
demonstrated their pride in what is happening in their constituencies
and in the region. It is right that they should take pride in that but
want to go
further<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T10:52:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112635000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112635000144">I
take four broad messages from the debate. The first is the recognition
on the part of all hon. Members present of the huge economic importance
of north Wales, as a region, for the economy of Wales, but also for the
United Kingdom. It is a strategic location for business investment.
What we have there with the likes of Toyota, Airbus and all the other
companies that hon. Members have mentioned is an engine of job creation
in north Wales. I take the point made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T10:52:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member 
<?notus-xml column=22?>for Alyn and Deeside that we should not take any of that for granted. He
has been around long enough to have seen huge economic change in his
constituency and region. Companies that were once huge employers there
have disappeared altogether to be replaced by other companies, so we
cannot take that economic success story for
granted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T10:52:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112635000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112635000145">Key
to underpinning that economic success story is continuous investment in
transport infrastructure. That is the second conclusion that I take
from the debate—a joint recognition, on the part of all hon.
Members present, of just how important transport infrastructure is in
securing the future economic development for north Wales that we all
want to
see<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T10:53:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112635000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112635000146">The
third conclusion is the recognition that, because of the nature of the
cross-border issues and economic development in the region, there is
huge interconnectedness between what is happening on the Welsh side of
the border and what is happening on the English side. There is a shared
interest on the part of the UK Government, who are responsible for
transport in England, and on the part of the Welsh Government, who are
largely responsible for transport on the Welsh side; and because there
is that shared interest, there is also a shared
responsibility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T10:53:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112635000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112635000147">That
leads to the fourth conclusion that I take from the debate, which is
the need for far better and more effective working together. The point
about devolution is not that suddenly the UK Government here in
Westminster become uninterested in what the Welsh Government are doing
on transport priorities and vice versa. Actually, this debate has
demonstrated that the need for the two Administrations to work together
becomes even greater. That can be difficult. Hon. Members have
highlighted some of the complexities in relation to the devolution
boundary. I am thinking in particular of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T10:54:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Montgomeryshire (Glyn Davies) and the issue of the
bypass in his constituency that he mentioned. That highlighted a
specific issue that we need to overcome to get the Administrations
working better together to tackle some of those cross-border transport
priorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T10:54:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112635000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112635000148">That
brings me to the fourth and final broad conclusion that I take from the
debate, which is about unity. Yes, we need far better working together
between the Administrations, but one of the things that can help that,
and which has come to the fore this morning—largely—is
north Welsh MPs working together and speaking with a united voice as
champions of further economic development and further transport
investment in their

that the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T10:55:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

for and champion of port development. Yes, ports are a reserved matter,

number of public sector agencies and organisations. We try to focus our
mind on some of the big strategic infrastructure priorities for Wales

on to some of the specifics that have been mentioned, I shall deal
first with HS2, which a number of hon. Members mentioned. HS2 is a
hugely strategically important project for the UK, and for north Wales
in particular through the new station at Crewe. That will unlock the
opportunity for businesses and individuals in north Wales to benefit
from access to high-speed services. Crucially, HS2 strengthens the case
for electrification of the north Wales main line, which a number of
hon. Members mentioned. If we are interested in building the business
case for that electrification of the north Wales coastal main line, HS2
strengthens that  
<?notus-xml column=24?>case. I see a number of hon. Members nodding their heads, and I am

agricultural policy funding secures the vitality of farming in
Scotland, and it is instrumental in the sustainable development of our
rural economy. I represent one of the most rural constituencies
anywhere in the UK, where farming underpins a healthy food production
sector and a range of successful agricultural industries, and supports
vibrant towns and villages. The investment we make in our farming
sector through the CAP generates jobs, creates sustainable livelihoods
and ensures effective land stewardship. Without it, our environment,
economy and communities would be immeasurably
poorer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112647000007">Earlier
this year, agreement was reached on the  future shape and
direction of the CAP. There will be some substantial changes, but most
significant for the purposes of today’s debate is the
requirement for more equitable distribution of CAP funding, known as
external convergence, across the EU. That has enormous significance for
farmers in Scotland, because historically Scotland has had very low
levels of support relative to the area of land in agricultural use.
Scotland receives an average  of €130 per hectare,
compared with an EU average of €196 per hectare. In the UK, the
English average is €265 per hectare, the Welsh
average is €247 per hectare and the Northern Irish average is
€335 per hectare. Compared with other parts of the EU and other
parts of the UK, Scotland has been short-changed on the CAP for a long
time, which has put our agricultural sector at a considerable
competitive disadvantage. In that respect, moves towards convergence
are an important step in the right direction.</hs_Para>

when I questioned Ministers from the Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs on the matter, I received a response that was based
on average farmer payments, which concerned me because it betrays
either a worryingly poor understanding of what the convergence uplift
is or a shameless attempt to pull the wool over our eyes. Average
farmer payments are completely irrelevant to the calculation of the
convergence uplift. I appreciate that the Minister is quite new to his
role and might not yet fully understand the technicalities of how the
convergence mechanism is calculated and what it is intended for. That
is why it is so important to clarify that the convergence uplift has
nothing whatever to do with individual farm size, which varies across
Europe, depending on the landscape, climate and model of farming. The
convergence uplift is calculated on the basis of average payments per
hectare and nothing else. It is intended to benefit those whose support
per hectare falls below 90% of the European average.</hs_Para>

convergence uplift is a mechanism introduced by the EU to ensure that
member states with payment rates of less than 90% of the EU average
rate per hectare receive an uplift designed to close the gap over the
next six years. Although England, Wales and Northern Ireland are all
above that threshold, Scotland is well below it —so far
below, in fact, that it brings the UK average down. That is why the EU
has awarded the UK a 
<?notus-xml column=26?>convergence uplift of €223 million. That is money designed to
level the playing field, calculated on the basis of the average payment
per hectare across Europe. It is money earmarked for Scottish
agriculture.</hs_Para>

“act of grand larceny”. Last week, when I met with
Scottish farming leaders—some of whom, I believe, are here
today—we discussed what representations they might make to
Ministers to look again at the issue and, at the very least, bring
forward the promised review from 2017 to deliver progress towards
convergence over the next six years. Yesterday, along with other
Scottish MPs, I received a letter from the Secretary of State for
Scotland, which appears to kick that possibility into the long grass by
reiterating that no changes will be introduced until after 2020. I
appeal to the Minister to look again at the need for convergence in the

one funding is less than two thirds the size of Scotland’s
eligible area, but Denmark receives more than one and a half times as
much pillar one funding—€964 million, compared with
Scotland’s €596.6 million. That means that
Denmark’s per-hectare pillar one rate is almost three times the
Scottish average pillar one rate. Denmark’s pillar two rate of
€31 per hectare is more than two and a half times as high as
Scotland’s rate of €11 per hectare. The Czech Republic
also has a smaller eligible area than Scotland does, but the Czech
Republic gets one and a half times as much money to fund pillar one.
Its average pillar one rate per hectare is almost twice that of

hectare.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112647000020">Even<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T11:09:41"></hs_TimeCode>
closer to home, our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland, who have a

funding as we do, which means that the average Irish per-hectare pillar

per-hectare pillar two rates are more than  10 times the
Scottish average. I could go on and list every single European Union
member state, because each and every one of them, without exception,
will receive a higher per-hectare rate than Scotland in both pillar one
and pillar two by 2019. Let us be clear: if the average rate of payment
in Scotland had been increased to €196 hectare, in line with the
EU average and the objective of all member states by 2019, Scottish
agriculture would have benefitted to the tune of €1 billion over
the next six years. Instead, as a peripheral region of a member state
that places a low priority on the rural economy, Scotland’s
per-hectare rate will drop to €128 by 2019 and could
fall as low as €108 if all the eligible land comes into the

uplifts 
<?notus-xml column=28?>in their rural development funding. Ireland has secured nearly €2
billion, compared with Scotland’s £478 million. Finland
has secured even more. With that kind of rural development funding, we
could make transformational step changes to Scotland’s rural

frankly, it <hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T11:11:56"></hs_TimeCode>is
an insult to the intelligence of our farmers to pretend that the deal

largesse, by suggesting that 2% additional flexibility on coupling in
some way compensates for the failure to deliver adequate core funding,

resources at the livestock sector, where they are most critical. The
serious point is that an extra 2% coupling makes a negligible
difference to beef farmers in Buchan, some of whom are set to take

views of hon. Members who say that the additional funds should have
been made available to Scotland, but quite simply the UK’s
direct payments will fall over the next seven years and there are no
additional funds to allocate. Compared with 2013, the UK will receive
around €500 million less in direct payments over 2014 to 2020.
It is important to note that the convergence uplift does not mean that
there is an additional pot of

reductions for everyone across the UK. To give more funding to
Scotland—or any one region, for that matter—would have
required deeper cuts to the other parts of the

point has also been made that Scotland has the lowest per-hectare
payment in the UK and that, by virtue of that, Scotland should have
received additional funding. There are a number of points to make about
that argument. First, the so-called convergence uplift was calculated
based on a UK average payment. Secondly, the lower per-hectare payment
in Scotland is due to Scotland’s extensive moorland, which has
yielded lower levels of production and, therefore, has historically
attracted lower subsidy payments than other parts of the UK. Thirdly,
it is important to note that Scotland still makes payments based on
historic subsidies received by farm holdings in 2001, which means that
those areas of land that had been most actively farmed, and generally
still are most actively farmed, receive more money than the unfarmed
moorlands.</hs_Para>

low per-hectare payment also needs to be viewed alongside the fact that
Scotland has the highest average per-farm payment in the UK, at about
£26,000, compared with just £17,000 in England,
£16,000 in Wales and £7,000 in Northern Ireland. I know
that the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan said that she has no respect
for that argument, but it is legitimate. Scotland has bigger farms, and
the land there has historically been less intensively farmed. I think
that the public will realise that if Scottish farmers are getting
payments of almost £26,000 a year, they are getting far higher
payments than the UK average, which is currently only about
£16,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T11:20:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112647000036"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Whiteford" PimsId="5544" UID="13112647000372" xid="1003" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112647000372">Dr
Whiteford:</Member></B> It all depends how one cuts the figures. In
fact, the majority of Scottish farmers—50% of
them—receive CAP payments of less than £10,000. Obviously
farming is more extensive in upland areas of Scotland, which can skew
the figures, but it is important to understand the median average
payment, rather than the mean average payment. Either way, it is
irrelevant to the convergence

Eustice:</Member></B> I do not think it is irrelevant. As I said, the
reason why Scotland has historically had a lower allocation is that
there is much more moorland, which is not farmed as intensively. One
can make the argument that there are differences within that and that
some small farmers get less than £10,000, but that is also the
case in Northern Ireland, England and Wales. The principles are set,
but Scotland’s average farm
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T11:19:53"></hs_TimeCode>payment is among
the highest in the EU. In fact, only in the Czech Republic, where there
are still huge collective farms, is the average payment received per

is important to note that there have always been wide variances in the
per-hectare rate paid, both between member states and within member
states. Countries such as Latvia and Estonia receive less per hectare
than 
<?notus-xml column=31?>Scotland. I should also point out that the Government’s approach
in allocating the cut equally across the UK’s Administrations is
consistent with the approach that we adopted earlier this year when
allocating the UK’s structural funds. Of those, Scotland
received €795 million, which represented an increase of
€228 million compared with the amount it would have received if
the EU’s formula had been used, so Scotland received an uplift
of sorts when it came to the allocation of structural funds, because
the UK was willing to depart from the EU formula and adopt the approach
that we have taken historically. We must accept that if we are to be
consistent and take the historical approach, Scotland might lose in
some areas, but it might also win in others. It has undoubtedly won
from our adoption of the historical approach to structural
funds.</hs_Para>

case, moving from the current approach, which is based on historical
payments in reference to 2001, to an area-based approach. Scotland will
have to think about that carefully in order to get it right. One would

regionalisation of the CAP, ensuring that the national reserve is

are four senses in which the practice of fly-grazing is a terrible
problem. First, of course, there is often the terrible condition of the
horses themselves, which suffer neglect and malnutrition. Secondly,
when a farmer’s field is being grazed on, it is also a problem
for the farmers. Grazing, where it is not authorised, is theft; it is
theft of a farmer’s livelihood. Quite often, of course, the
farmer is left to deal with the problem. Although they are the victim
and not the perpetrator of the crime, they assume some responsibility
for the horses. Thirdly, fly-grazing is a burden for those who must
enforce the law, and for the charities that care for the horses.
Currently, those charities find themselves significantly over-burdened
as a result. Finally, fly-grazing is a great problem for the
public—there are issues of public safety if, for example, horses
get on to the public highway.</hs_Para>

Secondly, there is the Highways Act 1980, which relates to cases in

Animals Act 1971, which is a means of getting horses off private land,

is the process if a farmer discovers that, say, a dozen horses have

check the horses. In doing so, it often finds that there is no

notice to say, “Contact us if these horses are yours.”

Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:08:12"></hs_TimeCode> makes an
important point. The Welsh Bill will not make the problem disappear,
but it will make dealing with it somewhat easier, which 
<?notus-xml column=38?>may help to disrupt and discourage sharp practice. The worry, however,
is that it may also displace the problem across the border. As I
understand it, the Bill cuts the waiting time from 14 days to seven;
reverses the burden of proof, so that an owner coming forward must
actively prove that they own the horses; and, crucially, increases the
options available to those who seize horses. Auction is therefore not
the only option. Horses can also be rehomed, as the hon. Member for
Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan
Edwards)<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:09:31"></hs_TimeCode>outlined

I said, the Welsh Bill will not make the problem disappear and it is
worth reflecting on its root causes. The main reasons seem to be a
relatively small number of irresponsible dealers and the excessive
breeding of horses. There is an over-supply, with horses changing hands
at auction for as little as £5. Following the horsemeat scandal,
there is also less abattoir capacity, although given the cost of
put-down and disposal, that option is, arguably, unlikely to be high on
the list for owners of £5 horses.</hs_Para>

that explains to some extent why horses are abandoned, but it does not
explain why dealers come to pick them up again or why they would buy
them back  at auction. To some extent, dealers perhaps
believe  that the market will bounce back and that the value of
horses will rise again. It also seems that some sections of some
communities attach
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:10:11"></hs_TimeCode>status to the
volume ownership of
horses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112647000087">What,
realistically, can be done? Eventually, we need to rebalance the supply
of, and demand for, horses. It has been suggested that if there were a
market in horsemeat, animals would be better cared for, and there is a
great deal of logic in that. However, there is a cultural issue about
that in this country, and there is no likelihood any time soon of there
being a great appetite for horsemeat.</hs_Para>

Pat McFadden</B> (Wolverhampton South East) (Lab):</Member> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship today, Mr Hollobone. I begin
by congratulating the hon. Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds) on
securing such an important debate. I would also like to explain that I
might not be able to stay for the full length of the debate, as I face
the not unusual House of Commons problem of having to be in two places
at the same time. However, I would like to use the minutes that you
have allotted me, Mr Hollobone, to make a few
points.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112647000116">As
the hon. Member for East Hampshire rightly said, although the problem
of abandoned horses might be thought predominantly to affect rural
areas, that is certainly not the whole case. I can assure the House
that it is a significant problem in some urban areas, such as my own
black country constituency. In many parts of 
<?notus-xml column=42?>the black country, specifically around the Bilston and Bradley areas of
my constituency, it is common to see horses grazing on abandoned former
industrial land or small plots of common land. The state of the horses
varies. Sometimes they are in a decent state and looked after, but
sometimes they are not and are in a very poor state. Sometimes they are
tethered, sometimes they are not. Sometimes they can break free and be
found wandering round housing estates, going into people’s
gardens and causing at least a nuisance and in some cases real
danger.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112647000117"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Kelly" PimsId="5605" UID="13112647000417" xid="1065" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112647000417">Chris
Kelly:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman, a fellow black country
MP, for giving way. Does he share the experience that I have had in my
constituency, where these poor animals have been found dead, still
tethered to the rope that chained
them?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112647000118"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr McFadden" PimsId="4815" UID="13112647000418" xid="909" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112647000418">Mr
McFadden:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is right that sometimes the
horses die, particularly in winter when they are not fed during harsh
weather. The problem is difficult to tackle on two different levels
because of what I call the ownership issue. By ownership, I mean that
it is difficult to establish who owns the horse. Even if you can
establish that, it is difficult to get that person to accept
responsibility for the horse’s welfare. In theory, under the
law, horses should be microchipped and have passports that enable them
to be identified, but the Minister will be aware that the law is
routinely breached and ignored. I have been told by the animal welfare
officer at Wolverhampton city council that, in her estimate, the vast
majority of abandoned horses in my constituency have no microchip. The
system is therefore simply not
operating.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112647000119">The
first ownership problem is that it is difficult for the authorities to
know to whom the horses belong. The other problem is that they are
moved around at short notice, leaving a place and returning to it,
which makes it difficult to track them. Another aspect of the ownership
problem is that it is not clear who, in law, is responsible for
policing the issue, removing horses and dealing with the problem. The
police tend not to get involved unless the horse is on the highway, and
practice among local authorities varies greatly. Some try to tackle the
problem with energy and resources, but some do very little. The owners
are aware of that and can take advantage of the situation by moving the
horses around from one piece of open ground to another. Horse owners
know that councils’ attitudes differ in that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:25:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0001.htm#13112647000120">The
part of my constituency that is most affected by the problem is close
to the boundaries of Wolverhampton, Dudley and Sandwell. It is quite
easy for horses to be moved, and that makes enforcement more difficult.
Sandwell is next to Wolverhampton, and its council estimates that the
cost of a removal—for bureaucracy and transport, as well as
legal and animal welfare costs—can be up to £1,500. Some
councils have tried to tackle the problem by providing grazing space
and charging owners to put horses there. For responsible owners, that
may work. However, irresponsible owners currently get a free good by
putting horses where they should not; they are unlikely to queue up to
pay £10 a week or more for what they currently get for
nothing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:26:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000121">Another
issue is the resources of local authorities. I am not making a partisan
point, but we know that money is tight for councils. Wolverhampton city
council 
<?notus-xml column=43?>has one animal welfare officer, who works part time. She is responsible
for pet shops, domestically kept animals, the few farms in the city
council area and the huge issue of abandoned or illegally tethered
horses. I spoke to her earlier today, and by lunch time she had had
three reports from the public of concern about abandoned horses. To
expect her, on her own and working part time, to deal effectively with
the issue alongside her other responsibilities is clearly absurd, and
it will not work.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112647000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000122"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:27:01"></hs_TimeCode>Even
for officers who have enough time, another issue is at play, which we
should be honest about: fear. Although the horse owners may not want to
declare themselves, those involved in removing horses fear reprisals by
them. It cannot be right that those who are empowered to deal with the
situation, albeit on an imperfect and incomplete legal basis, should be
inhibited from carrying through their powers by fear of reprisals. We
would not tolerate that state of affairs in other walks of life, and we
should not tolerate it in the one we are
debating<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:27:44"></hs_TimeCode>. The
effect of what I have outlined is a problem that has gone on for years
without a proper solution and without anyone getting a proper grip on
it. It is a significant animal welfare problem that causes the public
disturbance and distress. We cannot go on as we are.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112647000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000123">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:27:57"></hs_TimeCode>,
then, is to be done? The current law is inadequate. There is a right of
removal under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, but only if the horses are
in poor or severe condition, which is not always the case. Different
provisions apply to public and private land, and there are different
approaches for the highway or common land. All that needs to be
straightened out and simplified. I do not know whether what the Welsh
Assembly Government are doing is perfect, but at least animal welfare
groups, landowners and the general public have welcomed it. The
Minister should endeavour to clarify and simplify the law to make it
easier to remove the animals.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112647000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000124"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:28:42"></hs_TimeCode>The
simplification should include introducing easier powers of removal from
common land; minimising cost and delay in dealing with some of the
issues that the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:28:48"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for East Hampshire raised; and removing the problem of
proving ownership—in fact, why not reverse the burden of proof
and ask those who claim ownership of the horse to prove it, rather than
charging local authorities with running around trying to find out who
owns it? The changes should also include improving animal welfare and
giving confidence to the public.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:29:14"></hs_TimeCode>The problem is
growing, and may grow further because of what has happened in Wales.
The fact that solving it has been too difficult so far should not
prevent us from putting our heads together and trying to come up with a
better
system.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:29:25"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13112647000346" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000346">3.29

on his

This is a huge issue of not only welfare—bordering on

aspects if we are to come up with a
solution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:29:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

to terms with the subject when a constituent came to me in despair,
having found a number of horses in a field that she owned and been told
by the local authority that there was nothing she could do to remove
the horses; that there was no way of identifying whose they were; and,
what was more, that she was now liable for the welfare of the animals,
with third-party liability should anyone be injured crossing her land
on which the horses now resided. She was quite rightly extremely upset
that that should be the case. I looked into it further and found that
it was not an isolated problem, even in my own area—I was told,
anecdotally, that one gentleman owns 80 horses, but not one square foot
of land on which to graze them, so was using everyone else’s
land—and throughout the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:30:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000127">As
has been suggested, the situation has been exacerbated by what to some
extent has been a crisis in horse ownership. The recent difficulties in
the economy have meant that an awful lot of people who bought horses
with the firm intention of looking after them properly now find that
they are unable to do so, so a lot more horses and ponies are either
abandoned or sold cheaply than would normally be the case. Had I any
doubts about that, they would have been dispelled by visiting the
Glenda Spooner farm in my constituency, in Kingsdon, near Somerton. It
is run by World Horse Welfare, which has already been mentioned and
does a superb job of looking after abandoned animals and getting them
back into shape so that they can be rehomed. I applaud its
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:31:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000128">I
was trying to address the issue when I was in the Minister’s
position, and it is not without its complications—I will not
pretend otherwise. It boils down to a number of clear areas in which
the Government could perhaps have an effect. First, on intervention,
the Government can help to prevent animals from entering the stream, as
it were, by supporting horse charities and perhaps by considering what
they can do directly to help people who get into difficulties to find a
new home for their
horses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:32:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000129">Secondly—a
lot of the debate will be about this—there is the possibility of
new powers. I discussed that at length with the Home Office, which
assured me many times that the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and
Policing Bill would be capable of remedying the nuisance. Potentially
it will be, through the injunctions in the Bill and community
protection orders, but we need guidance to be issued to local
authorities and others as to how they can use the powers in the Bill to
provide help in the area we are discussing. I hope the Minister will
help me with that.

that, we need to look at the Welsh proposals. I spoke to Alun Davies,
the Minister in Wales, some months ago about the subject, because I
knew that he was working on his proposals. What is being suggested in
Wales—providing a range of disposals to local authorities and
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:33:33"></hs_TimeCode>—seems
to have an awful lot of
merit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000130">Thirdly,
I want us to consider liability, which I remember discussing many years
ago during consideration of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000,
when it became clear that people had an absolute liability for animals
on their land. That cannot be right. If it is not their animal, they
did not ask for it to be there and they do not want it to be there, how
on earth can they be liable for its actions? Yet that is the situation
in
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:33:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

need to deal with identification. Microchipping needs to be enforced,
of course, but that applies only to horses under four years old. There
is a misconception about the national equine database, which was
abolished by my predecessor, in that it did not provide traceability.
We need a hugely better passporting system that ensures that we can
trace a horse back to its owner. Serious discussion was going on with
the Irish and French Governments on the issue, and I wonder
whether  the Minister can bring us up to date on where
precisely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:34:35"></hs_TimeCode> we
are.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000132">I
wish to raise a final, not uncontroversial, issue, which I remember
discussing with the Irish Agriculture Minister, Simon Coveney. I am not
betraying any confidence, because he has since discussed it with his
Select Committee in the Dail, but he told me about the possibility of
widening hugely the euthanising of horses in the Republic of Ireland,
because of the overpopulation. We have to give serious consideration to
that. No one wants to kill horses, any more than anything else, but if
we have huge overpopulation, we will never get to grips with the
welfare issues. We first have to reduce the population, bringing it
back to the sort of level where we can find enough good, careful and
sensible owners to look after the

animal welfare charities released “Left on the Verge”,

issue was recently brought home to me by a constituent, Mr William
Jenkins, who grazes his horses on Manmoel common, in the heart of my

spring—more so than ever this year. However, when he turned his
flock on to the common in May, after one of the harshest winters he can
recall, there was little grass to graze, because it had already been
eaten by dozens of abandoned ponies—unsurprisingly, many had
already perished in the prolonged freezing conditions, dying of
starvation or exposure. This has been an issue on Manmoel common for a
number of years—although not only there—robbing farmers

are a number of reasons why fly-grazing throughout England and Wales is
increasing—primarily, the economic downturn combined with too
many horses being bred. The result has been a horse market in which
horses at every level have dropped in price. At the lowest end, they
are being sold at auction for as little as £5. Farmers may
advertise a horse and sell it after 14 days to cover their costs, but
if the pony has no passport or microchip, that animal cannot be sold,
costing the farmer more than the cost of raising the
horse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:38:01"></hs_TimeCode>. There are
also reports of some dealers cutting the cost of animal welfare and

understanding is that ever since the horsemeat scandal, which

irresponsible dealers have continued to buy, breed and import horses as
the market has become saturated. As has already been mentioned, a horse
can now be purchased for as little as £5, although it can often
cost in excess of £100 a week to look after it properly.
Irresponsible dealers are importing horses from France and Ireland

that fly-grazing can do and the way it affects farmers. My constituent,
Mr David Shaw, farms land in Osbaldwick that is located in close
proximity to the local Traveller site. Mr Shaw’s land has been
regularly overtaken by horses belonging to the Traveller community,
which has caused a great deal of damage to his fences and crops, and to
the land itself. Just recently, in October, Mr Shaw found approximately
14 horses in his fields. He turned them out, repaired the fences and
spoke to the Traveller who owned them, requesting that he keep them off
his land, but l5 minutes later the horses were back in his maize field

taken swiftly and offenders brought to justice. The culprits are too

able to look after their horses and ponies properly. The people
involved in fly-grazing are many and varied. Some keep horses
commercially and their incomes have decreased. Rather than disposing of
their horses responsibly, they have tried to keep them irresponsibly.
There was a terrible example in Wales of someone who kept many coloured

proper purposes by the local authority, on verges beside roads, and

However, one example we have not heard about—although

difficult conditions and are fed only when conditions are extreme and
there is snow on the ground. The commoners will bring in all the horses
and dispose of them humanely if they cannot establish who an owner is.

Cairns</B> (Vale of Glamorgan) (Con):</Member> It is a privilege to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr Hollobone, in this important debate.
I pay tribute to
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:57:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds) not only for securing it,
but for introducing it, covering the issues and touching on some
sensitive matters in a way that brought all the parties
together.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000169">The
problem is significant in Wales, and exceptionally so in the Vale of
Glamorgan. Just two weeks ago, the BBC reported on the network news
that 45 horses were tragically destroyed as a result of animal welfare
issues. That case involved the excellent work of charities such as
Redwings and World Horse Welfare. I pay tribute to those organisations
for the compassionate work they conduct in difficult circumstances.
However, a constituent contacted me to say that it was not just 45
horses destroyed, but ultimately hundreds. That demonstrates the scale
of the problem just two weeks
ago.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000329" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000329">Over
the last year alone, hundreds of horses have regularly been moved,
throughout my constituent and the neighbouring constituencies, and on
scores of occasions. The police recently reported to me that they were
involved in 1,500 horse-related incidents in the last 13 months alone.
Animal welfare must be our driving focus in this debate, but we must
bear in mind the significant financial cost. The police estimate the
cost to be around £1.2 million, and they can point to
£745,000 spent directly by them, the local authorities and the
RSPCA. One example, from a range of services that have to spend money
to protect themselves and ensure safety, is Bryntirion comprehensive
school in the constituency of the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs
Moon)<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:59:30"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:59:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
That school had to spend £61,000 on a fence to protect children
in the playground because horses were so regularly breaking the
boundary fence and grazing on the playing fields. Not only were they
breaking the fence, but they were causing damage to the school and
preventing children from participating in physical education and using
those facilities.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T15:59:57"></hs_TimeCode>Landowners also
face significant costs. The average farmer in my constituency will face
a cost of between £1,000 and £1,500 if he is
involved in fly-grazing in any way. Some 56% of farmers responded to a
survey saying that their land had been involved in
fly-grazing.</hs_Para>

that Superintendent Paul James said to me this time last year,
“Unless we resolve the problem on this occasion, I simply
don’t know where we can go next year”. That was because
of the resources being taken up. It was not only about the financial
issues that I have highlighted, but about the time, which would not be
costed into the figures that I mentioned, that he and all his
colleagues had to spend trying to bring an end to the problem. There
was one prosecution, but I fear that we are entering a situation in
which the problem is simply being moved from my area to other
areas.</hs_Para>

Thallium, a joint effort by the police and the Welsh Local Government
Association, identified three key themes. One was about the
identification of horses and the need for proof, and how difficult that
makes things. The second was the delay that the landowner, having
identified the horses or ended up with horses fly-grazing on their
private land, experiences before they can act to dispose of the horses.
People end up being almost forced or encouraged, on some occasions, to
contribute to the problem. Scores of horses can be found on domestic
properties, and strictly speaking, according to the law, people should
be looking after the horses according to welfare standards, rather than
driving them out on to the road to move the problem forward.</hs_Para>

is a shame that I cannot expand much more on that, but I want to
underline the third theme, which is how the horses are handled
thereafter and their disposal. The delay that I touched on is
significant, with the current legislation restricting the agencies to
acting in a humane, responsible way and considering the auction
obligation. However, the euthanasia issue also needs to be addressed. I
pay tribute to the Welsh Government and the way in which they are
approaching the legislation. It is an important start—it is not

“Stella”, in which the neighbour in the

have heard a little today about the scale of the problem. Although
there are no official figures, the charities concerned have estimated
that almost 7,000 horses are at risk. The welfare charities,
in their report “Left on the Verge”, which has been cited
by numerous hon. Members, have also identified a growing trend in
welfare cases involving equines. Incidents of fly-grazing appear to be
on the rise. Clearly, that is wrong and both a burden and a source of
concern for the landowners
affected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:15:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000197">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:15:41"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:19:30"></hs_TimeCode>
want to pick up on a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton
and Frome (Mr Heath) made
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:15:44"></hs_TimeCode> the stress
that the practice can cause landowners. He makes an incredibly
important point. We are talking about people who care deeply about
animals and livestock, and it can be very distressing for them to find
abandoned on their land horses that have not been cared for—that
have been neglected, maltreated or underfed. They may have been left in
fields where there is ragwort, for instance, which could affect their
health. Sometimes the field is not sufficiently secure to keep the
horse within it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:16:18"></hs_TimeCode>.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:16:35"></hs_TimeCode> was very

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:16:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Alun Cairns) about the school that
had to spend money to put up fences to keep horses off its land as a

hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome also talked about the
cost borne by the landowners in these cases, and it is true that that
is a feature. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:16:36"></hs_TimeCode>
point out that sections 4 and 7 of the Animals Act 1971 give powers for
landowners to recover that cost, but I completely accept that, as with
all these things, the difficulty is in the landowners being able to
bring a case to get the money
back.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000199">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:16:49"></hs_TimeCode>
me say a little more about what laws are currently in place, or we have
in the pipeline, that could be used to tackle some of the issues
described today. It is important to note that quite a lot of powers are
already available. First, section 7 of the Animals Act 1971, which
applies in England and Wales,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:17:03"></hs_TimeCode>allows horses to
be taken into the landowner’s possession, provided that certain
conditions are met. After 14 days, the horses may be sold. The
landowner may also claim any reasonable costs from the owner of the
horses for the upkeep of the horses or any damage that they do until
they are either returned to the owner or sold at
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:17:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

number of hon. Members have highlighted, the Highways Act 1980 can also
be used and is often used by local authorities. That Act makes it an
offence for horses to stray or lie on or at the side of a highway. The
police have powers to remove the horses, and reasonable costs can be
recovered from the owners in doing
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:17:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000201">Thirdly,
as we have heard today, horses that are simply abandoned or neglected
are often in a poor state of welfare. I was particularly struck by the
appalling anecdote told by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley South
(Chris Kelly) about horses that were literally dying on a tether in
some instances and by the case cited by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:18:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) involving someone who had dozens or
hundreds of horses that were being neglected.</hs_Para>

important to recognise, though, that in
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:17:57"></hs_TimeCode>such
circumstances it is possible to use section 9 of the Animal Welfare Act
2006, which makes it an offence to fail to provide for the welfare
needs of an animal. The DEFRA statutory code of practice for the
welfare of horses, ponies, donkeys and their hybrids provides clear
advice on how to meet the requirements of the Act. Although failure to
abide by the code is not in itself an offence, it can be used in a
court of law as evidence of neglect, and frequently

Eustice:</Member></B> I will address that point in a moment. I just
want to make this point about new powers in the pipeline. Clearly, the
act of leaving a horse or horses on another person’s land is an
example of antisocial behaviour. The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and
Policing Bill is currently before Parliament and, when enacted, will
provide enforcers with new and much more flexible powers to tackle
antisocial behaviour in all its forms, including the act of leaving a
horse on someone else’s land. Indeed, there have already been
some instances in which the existing antisocial behaviour
orders—ASBOs—have been served on perpetrators of
fly-grazing.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112647000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000205">The new
antisocial behaviour measures will make it even easier for enforcers to
use such powers to tackle these problems. For example, if a person is
identified as having left their horse on someone else’s land
without permission, the local authority or police could issue a
community protection notice requiring the individual to do anything
reasonable to address the antisocial behaviour.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13112647000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000206">In the case
of fly-grazed horses, the notice might require the individual to remove
or even to sell the horses. Failure to abide by a community protection
notice is a criminal offence, and anyone who does so may face a fine or
other sanctions. The provisions give the authorities power to impose a
forfeiture order on any item, including an animal, used to breach a
community protection notice; in this case, that would be a
horse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000207">Several
hon. Members have alluded to the frustration of those who complain to
the authorities about such problems but no action appears to be taken.
If a complainant is dissatisfied with a local authority, either because
it has not responded to their concern or because they consider that it
has not dealt with the concern 
<?notus-xml column=58?>effectively, it may be possible to use the new community trigger. Under
the community trigger, the police, local authorities and other
organisations can be required to review their response if a resident or
group of residents have complained about the same problem three or more
times and are not satisfied with the response.</hs_Para>

all those antisocial behaviour measures, it is necessary to know who
the culprits are. We should not delude ourselves into thinking that we
can tackle the problem without identifying and tackling irresponsible
owners. If authorities can pool their intelligence and information, it
should be possible to identify the leading perpetrators of fly-grazing
and take appropriate action. If the problem is acute in certain
areas—looking at the charts, Wales appears to be particularly
badly affected—it should be a priority for the authorities to do
whatever is necessary to deal with it. The tools are there, and we need
to ensure that they are enforced.</hs_Para>

passport regulations have been in force since 2009. They require all

measures are under consideration, including stricter standards for
passports and a requirement for all member states to operate a central
equine database, to which several hon. Members have alluded. DEFRA
officials are working closely with the equine sector council strategy

horses associated with antisocial behaviour are frequently not

touch briefly on another point raised by the hon. Member for Somerton
and Frome about the tripartite agreement between France, Ireland and
the UK. The Government are committed to protecting our equine industry
from the threat of disease from overseas. European statute requires
that horses that move between EU member states must undergo a
veterinary inspection 48 hours prior to movement, and that they must be
accompanied by a passport and health certificate. Any movement must be
pre-notified to the competent authorities.</hs_Para>

existing tripartite agreement applies a derogation from those rules for
horses moving between the UK, France and Ireland, on the basis that the
three countries share the same health status for equines, and it seems
reasonable that that should continue. We have, therefore, managed to
avoid imposing unnecessary costs and burdens on horse owners.</hs_Para>

considerable work with the equine sector and the member states
concerned, I can confirm that a new tripartite agreement has been
signed, which limits the derogation from EU health controls for
intra-EU trade to groups of horses with a demonstrably higher health
status. That will come into effect in May 2014. Those new changes will
apply only to movements between the UK and France, and Ireland and
France. The situation regarding movements between Ireland and the UK
remains unchanged, because we are satisfied that on disease control
grounds—bearing in mind the aims of the relevant EU
directive—there is no additional risk. The new agreement between
the UK, France and Ireland will hugely benefit the sector.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for York Outer (Julian Sturdy) highlighted the
importance of co-ordination. We have been particularly struck by the
protocols introduced by councils in Wakefield and York, which give

disposal. I emphasise to local authorities that they can use existing

to have this debate under your chairmanship, Mr Hollobone. This timely
debate on safe cycling in London is about saving lives. Just recently,
there were six deaths in just two weeks in London, which forced
attention on the issue. Two collisions occurred on the same day, which
was particularly poignant. Our thoughts are with those who have died on
London streets, and with their families. Most recently, Brian Holt,
Francis Golding, Roger William De Klerk, Venera Minakhmetova, Khalid

well as highlighting the whole issue of safety for cyclists in London,
the recent spate of fatal accidents has raised serious concerns about
roundabouts such as Bow, where Hounslow resident Brian Dorling died in
2011. I have a personal interest in the matter because I, too,
sometimes cycle into work and around my constituency. Every time I do,
I feel as though I am taking a risk, even though I abide by the rules
of the road. Even cycling around Parliament square, which is right

everyone on the roads. Some 70,000 cyclists took to the streets of
London in August for the Prudential RideLondon festival, and the
Barclays Boris bikes have expanded across London. I want to encourage
the inspiration created by the Olympics and the Tour de France, which
will come to Yorkshire in 2014. Individuals such as Bradley Wiggins,

the peak morning period, a time of day that recent incidents have shown
to be particularly dangerous. More bicycles than cars travel across
London, Waterloo, Blackfriars and Southwark bridges during that time, a
setting that presents enhanced safety hazards to cyclists. In pure
numbers, however, there were fewer cycling fatalities in the past six
years than in the previous six. Reading the figures in a different way
shows us that in London in 2012, 22% of all casualties on the road were
cyclists, whereas in 2006 10% were, so there has been an increase in
the percentage.</hs_Para>

schemes are certainly helping. We have already heard about what is
happening in the London borough of Hounslow, and there are also various
initiatives such as Bikeabilty training for beginners, advanced
cyclists and children. We must see whether more can be done. The police

I want us to take seriously. When I cycle in London, I try not to go
anywhere near a lorry if I can help it, and I stay well behind them at
junctions. We could be slightly more radical and ban HGVs during rush
hour, as they do in Paris. Deliveries in London during the Olympics
were made at night, so it could be possible to do that again. We may
need to tighten up driving tests for van and lorry drivers. We have
talked about having more Trixi mirrors at road junctions—big
mirrors that allow better visibility, especially for lorry drivers. In
some areas  of London, and elsewhere, where there are very wide

<?notus-xml column=63?>pavements, there could be safe sharing of pavements  to allow
cyclists to travel more safely. It is important to crack down on

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T16:40:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Minister about some of the things that must be considered as a
matter of urgency. The first is a cycle safety summit, for want of a
better term, to get all the London stakeholders around a table to
discuss the vision, strategy and plan of action going forward. That
would include, of course, the Department for Transport, the
Mayor’s office, Transport for London, the Metropolitan police
and each of the London boroughs, which all have roads for which they
are responsible. It would also involve the cycling safety campaign
groups, and maybe even the all-party group on cycling. It would be a
conversation around a table about a joint approach and a plan of action
to get things moving.</hs_Para>

issue that we need to consider is continuing to improve the safety of
road junctions, whether with Trixi mirrors or safe cycling routes.
Transport for London has increased its budget for safer junctions from
£19 million to £100 million, but how far will
that stretch across the key London junctions that need to be sorted
out? Can TfL also address some of the other junctions that might not be
its responsibility?</hs_Para>

issue is better safety equipment on lorries. I feel strongly about that
issue, given the scale of deaths from HGVs; nine out of the 14 deaths
so far this year have been linked to HGVs. Side guards are critical to
prevent people from being dragged underneath, as are close proximity
sensors to let drivers know whether someone is around and side cameras
to help with blind spots. Maybe we will have to prevent HGVs from
entering central London unless they have safety features. If they do
not, maybe the Mayor could impose a levy or fine.</hs_Para>

issue to consider is the importance of clamping down on all road users
who break the law, with on-the-spot fines for dangerous driving or
cycling. Those who use the roads must respect each other; I say that as
both a driver and a cyclist. I think that being a cyclist has helped me
be a better driver, and I encourage everyone to try it. We might
consider a fixed penalty for going into the cycles-only box at
junctions. I would also like those cycle boxes and the advance stop
lines extended a bit. At the moment, they are about 5 metres out, which
is very close to traffic queues, especially during the morning rush
hour. Maybe that could be extended to 7.5 metres.</hs_Para>

concerns further training for children and adults. London boroughs and
the police have been reasonably good at giving support on cycling
safety, and there are also videos about how HGV drivers have blind
spots. Adults returning to cycling after many years, in particular, may
need a refresher. Another option is changing the driving test for
drivers of all vehicles, including taxis, HGVs and cars, and including
cyclist awareness and safety. I have mentioned considering a rush-hour
HGV ban or a levy on HGVs not fitted with safety
equipment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000247">This

We are also working in other ways to improve cyclist safety. For
instance, we have made it simpler for councils to put in place 20

such limits in areas where cyclists and pedestrians are most

do about side guards. There are a number of vehicles that are currently
exempt from having to have them, such as skip wagons, refuse wagons and
some tippers, and it is important that we consider what we can do to

economy is too shareholder-focused. The pursuit of quick profit leads
to short-term thinking and a lack of investment in our companies, and
our focus on shareholders means that cultural barriers may further
hinder investment. In 2010, 41.2% of investors in British companies
came from outside the UK, and it must be true that a shareholder in a
company who has investments all over the world takes less of a direct
interest in that company than an employee of that company would. It
leads to examples of bankers hedging their bets and putting
people’s lives and jobs on the line. It also leads to a lack of
training for staff and a lack investment in infrastructure, meaning
that companies will last for the next few years but not for the next 40

want the next boom to benefit everybody, and a responsible Government

employees are simply forgotten or neglected when decision are taken is
irrelevant. What we need is someone championing their needs, in the
same way that those of shareholders and of management are put forward.
It is important to remember that many employees, unlike shareholders,
cannot just walk away. They have trained for that job and so cannot
diversify themselves as easily as shareholders can. They are key

workers’ representatives on boards is good for business. The use
of labour representation has been found to increase the value of firms.
Employees have a detailed knowledge of the shop floor and of
operations, so they become an important source of information for those
making long-term decisions. In other countries, the proposal has been
found to make a company more efficient. In a study of representatives,
they remarked that their key knowledge of everyday business and
employee matters made them specialists on the board, in the same way
that other board members were specialists in, for example, accountancy
or
strategy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000282" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000282">The

relations between the work force and management. It is telling that
even Mr Ratcliffe of Ineos compared Germany with the UK and commended
the good working relationship between unions and companies in Germany;
this is the same Mr Ratcliffe who partly caused the problems at
Grangemouth. I think a key part of that is the fact that workers in

it ensures that such bargaining takes place in an atmosphere that is
more like a partnership, which is constructive? I have seen the benefit
of that in my constituency at Cowley, where I can contrast the

Sheridan:</Member></B> My right hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I
can only use my own experience before I came to the House, when I
worked for Thales, which was a progressive company. It downsized during
the defence cuts, cutting thousands of jobs, but it did so by talking
to the trade unions and workers’ representatives. In Scotland
and Portsmouth, BAE Systems is talking to its employee representatives
in a progressive way and treating people like grown-ups. We can
contrast that with what happened at
Grangemouth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000285" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000285">In
times of poor performance, employees are likely to be more aware of the
troubles of their company and may offer concessions. Equally, they will
expect returns when the company is doing well. Importantly, having a 
<?notus-xml column=70?>representative on the board offers an opportunity for early
consultation. A recent survey found that, in such cases, both sides
tended to be more realistic about the issues at
hand.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000286">Financially,
the proposal works well, with fewer days lost to strike action. Germany
lost 3.7 days to strikes for every 1,000 employees in 2008, whereas the
UK lost  28 days in the same year. That is not a one-off: in
2007, Germany lost 8.1 days, while the UK lost 38 days. No worker likes
to go on strike; it is always the very last option and a huge deal for
all involved. The contrast shows how much more effectively Germans
manage differences between employees and management. They come to more
compromised agreements that suit everyone early on, and negotiations
with the unions much less frequently result in strike action. I cannot
see how companies, or indeed the Government, could disagree with a way
to reduce days lost to strike action in  the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000287">Directors

proposal is popular, with 76% of UK employees in favour, according to a
Survation poll. People are beginning to recognise that we get better
results if a company board is representative of its work force. I think
we are all in agreement that we need more women on boards, and we all
see that it would be good for employees and the work force. The
difference between the situations of women and employees in general,
however, is that employees will never be at board level unless we
change the rules.</hs_Para>

that we follow our European colleagues and make it mandatory to have
employee representatives on boards. The Minister might say that we
should not model ourselves on such countries, because the UK is
different. However, the responsibilities of German supervisory boards
are similar to those of British and American boards. We can therefore
look at the German success story and follow suit. We even have a UK

is not in direct contrast to what the Government have proposed. They
are keen to encourage John Lewis-style employee-owned companies through
tax breaks. There is appetite on both sides of the House to give
employees more of a stake in their company—their livelihood.
That is especially true with regard to executive pay, with the
Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills proposing to
make boards and remuneration committees more diverse, following a
cross-party Treasury Committee report in 2009 calling for more employee
representation on those committees. Extending that to boards as a
whole, which would make decisions more directly applicable to
employees, does not seem to be much of a
stretch.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000291" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000291">I
am sure Members have heard arguments on the issue from friends in the
corporate world. There is a lot of resistance to the idea from UK
directors. They say that it might move the objective of a board away
from  
<?notus-xml column=71?>maximising shareholder value towards maximising the payroll. I question
whether that is really a bad thing. In these years following a
financial crisis, we should be looking to make companies less
short-term focused and more rounded. We want UK companies that stand
the test of time and that are good for communities. A board looking to
do that would be focused not only on dividends. Also, we are talking
here about some employee representatives, not 50:50 representation of
directors and employees. The proposal would just give employees a voice
and give the board a fresh
perspective.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000292" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000292">Members
might also talk about the additional burden that the proposal would
bring. They might say that it would make boards bigger and therefore
less efficient, with members preparing less before meetings. There is
indeed evidence that smaller boards are more effective, but evidence
from Swedish employee representatives shows that corporate leaders and
representatives are capable of co-operating in a way that is of benefit
to all. Any inefficiency would be outweighed by the benefits of greater
understanding of the company’s operations and more co-ordinated
decision
making.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000293" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000293">Members
might have been pressed about the risk of confidential information
being leaked. However, we are first looking to improve relations
between employees and the board, so I am confident that employees would
respect the additional responsibility. Evidence from other countries
shows that they are rarely tempted to whistleblow; if they are tempted
to do so, does it not suggest that the company is up to no
good?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000294" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000294">British
businesses are wary of employee representation, but that is because we
do not have a culture of it, and because it would be likely to reduce
ridiculously high executive salaries. For example, the boss of
Volkswagen in Germany, Martin Winterkorn, saw his bonus for 2012 cut by
20%. Most directors are comfortable with high pay, because they are
detached from reality. What they need is people on their board who can
bring them back down to earth. There has rightly been scandal after
scandal about bonuses and million-pound salaries. The Labour party
supports having employees on remuneration committees, but I think it
would be much more effective if we put them on boards,
right  at the
top.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112647000295" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/halltext/131126h0002.htm#13112647000295">I
understand the difficulties of forcing the proposal on to companies,
but I do not understand why we cannot encourage those with whom we do
business to adopt the approach. We could ensure that, in a tendering

much of his sentiment and many of his points, particularly on the
positive role that the trade unions can play in industrial relations.
It is sometimes far too easy to demonise trade unions without
remembering that we have historically low levels of industrial action.
The hon. Gentleman is right that we always want to do what
we can to reduce industrial action even further, but the
vast majority of trade unions  work constructively and
positively with employers in the workplace. Thankfully, examples such
as Grangemouth, where industrial relations are in a much less positive

also agree with what the hon. Gentleman said about the downsides of
pursuing short-term profit above all else, which the Government also

commissioned the Kay review to consider the matter, because

operations, and many companies may want to consider such representation
by looking at the experience of First Group. Ultimately, it is better
if the decision is taken by companies, rather than being mandated

there is much more chance that a company will actually engage with the

end of his remarks, and it could be done in a variety of ways. I argue
that sometimes mandation and regulation are not necessarily as
effective as other methods of encouraging businesses to recognise the
benefits of particular forms of behaviour. Whether on employee

there are a number of reasons why mandating that companies must have
worker representatives on their boards would not be desirable. Part of
that is because of the way in which our board system is structured. Our
board system is different from other European countries that have been
mentioned. We have a unitary board system, which means that anyone
sitting on a board or a board committee is a director with the same
responsibilities and duties as other directors, and is equally
accountable to shareholders for decisions.</hs_Para>

legal distinction between different types of director, whether or not
they are representing employees. All directors have a legal duty to
have regard to the interests of employees in promoting the success of
the company, and we need to be slightly wary of the danger that, if we
force an employee representative on to boards, it could have the
perverse, unintended consequence that the other directors on a board
might take less seriously their existing duty to have regard to the
interests of employees. We want all directors on boards to be thinking

tempting offer to agree with Mr Ratcliffe, but  better
discussion and dialogue between workers and management is always the
best way to avoid disputes. The vast majority of cases, thankfully, do

would not be fair to portray the UK as having poor employee

examples of such participation. Indeed, studies and research back that
up. The latest report on employee involvement by the European

that employee participation is high in the UK—across the EU,
only the Scandinavian countries score higher. That backs up my point

hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire North is right to raise the
issue of pay, because many hon. Members have been concerned about
increased levels of executive pay in recent years. It has been
excessive in many cases and the ratio between the earnings of those at
the top versus those on the shop floor is also concerning.
Directors’ pay in particular has ratcheted upwards, but,
importantly, it has not been linked to performance. In a sense, there
is nothing wrong with somebody being rewarded for a specific success,
such as growing a company, providing new jobs or creating wealth for
the economy, but where that reward is given when the company has not
necessarily been experiencing particularly fantastic results, that
needs to be questioned. Excessive pay for failure or for not bringing
significant
success<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:21:25"></hs_TimeCode> damages
the long-term interests of business.</hs_Para>

forward reforms, which came into force on 1 October, to create a more
robust framework for the setting and reporting of directors’
pay. They will boost transparency, so that people can clearly and
easily understand what those at the top of companies are paid.
Importantly, the reforms will empower shareholders to hold companies to
account through binding votes, creating a stronger, clearer link
between pay and performance. We have already seen shareholders flexing
their muscles in a much more welcome way on issues such as executive
pay<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-26T17:22:02"></hs_TimeCode>. It will

part of a comprehensive approach to crisis management operating in
partnership with others, principally NATO. The European Council was an
opportunity to demonstrate political will to develop capabilities and
to act: but the package of proposed measures on the defence industry
should  not impinge on national sovereignty, nor should the

licensing work carried out at the DVA in Coleraine is the
responsibility of the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon.
Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr Goodwill). I have
discussed the matter with him and his predecessor at length on a number
of occasions. I have made clear to him the concern felt about the
potential loss of these posts and emphasised that it is very important
to look at the wider economic impacts of any possible decision that
would involve removing work from the DVA. My hon. Friend will also need
to weigh efficiency issues for Department for Transport and the need to
deal with the deficit as well as considering the best way to ensure
that drivers in Northern Ireland can access the same level of
electronic and web-based services to licence vehicles that is available
in GB.</hs_Para>

its consultation with user groups and the rail industry on its Draft
Determination, the Office of Rail Regulation concluded that it should
lower the Public Performance Measure targets it had initially proposed
for punctuality for long distance services, and toughen the
corresponding targets for cancellations and significant lateness. This
reflected customers' and operators' views that long-distance rail users
are particularly disadvantaged by serious lateness and cancellations,
and that in the Office of Rail Regulation's view it was sensible to
rebalance targets to focus on these areas of particular concern. The
revised targets are at least as challenging for Network Rail to deliver

Goodwill:</Member></B> I have made no such assessment. Local traffic
authorities are responsible for setting speed limits, including 20 mph
zones and for ensuring that limits are appropriate for their roads.
Speed limits should be evidence led and encourage self compliance. It
is for 
<?notus-xml column=194?>local authorities to gather evidence on the effectiveness of 20 mph
zones. Enforcement of 20 mph zones is a matter for relevant police
forces and the Department does not collect statistics on this
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112670000629" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/text/131126w0001.htm#13112670000629">However,
the Department is planning an assessment of 20 mph limits and zones
which will cover a range of issues including their effectiveness. I am
also aware that the police are currently undertaking some research in
20 mph roads in order to design the most appropriate speed awareness

continuously for more than a year and adults were not allowed to claim
for more than two years. This held the number of long-term claimants
below its true level, with some people who had been out of work for an
extended period, having been moved onto a training allowance before
returning to JSA, counted as short-term
unemployed. The number of long-term JSA claimants rose because this no
longer happened—individuals joining the Work programme continue
to receive JSA until they find regular
employment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112677000313" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/text/131126w0002.htm#13112677000313">In

Francois:</Member></B> Educating the Tatmadaw (Burmese military) in
their role within a democratic society is part of a wider HMG approach
to security sector reform in Burma. Officials have met with members
from NGOs who have interests in Burma, in order to ensure that their
concerns about our engagement are listened to and in some cases, our
approach has been tailored to support their views. During Daw Aung San
Suu Kyi's visit to the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, she asked for
our help in instilling in the Burmese military an understanding of the
value—including to themselves—of being a professional and
apolitical Army. Indeed, Daw Suu particularly liked the fact that the
education that we intend to provide to the Burmese military will be
jointly delivered by military and civilian academic staff. We will
continue to review our engagement in Burma in the light of the
Tatmadaw's evolving stance on reform.</hs_Para>

risk of inhalation of asbestos fibres from a Second World War gas mask
during a demonstration is dependant on the condition of the mask and
how it is demonstrated. The Health and Safety Executive's assessment is
that the risk of inhaling any asbestos fibres during the demonstration
of Second World War gas masks in good condition is low. Nevertheless,
if the mask is damaged or deteriorating there is an increased risk that
asbestos fibres will be released. As all these gas masks are old, and
assessing the condition of the filter is not straightforward, the

streams provided by the Home Office to local areas for crime reduction
and prevention have frequently been multi-purpose, with discretion
given to local areas as to how to use funds to achieve desired
outcomes. It is not possible therefore to disaggregate precise amounts
spent on early intervention crime prevention initiatives over the
period in question. At the same time, specific funding streams have
been consolidated within the police main grant to enable Police and
Crime Commissioners flexibility to allocate funding to locally
identified policing and crime, priorities as appropriate. Alongside the
main police grant, for 2013-14 a transitional Community Safety Fund of
£90 million (which comprises some previously separate funding
streams) has been established to assist Police and Crime Commissioners
in funding local crime and policing projects. While this is not
specifically designated for early intervention programmes some local
schemes may have an early intervention element. It is intended that
this fund will be incorporated into the police main grant from 2015/16.
In addition, in 2013/14, £400,000 has been provided to fund
Advocates for young people, and £700,000 provided to tackle
knives, gangs and youth violence (neither of these schemes was running
in May
2010).</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13112677000076" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/text/131126w0003.htm#13112677000076">Criminal

be taken when interpreting averages based on a small numbers of
defendants. The relatively low frequency of Class A offences can lead
then to be more susceptible to the impact of individual outliers (e.g.
a single historic case or a particularly lengthy
investigation).</hs_Para>

between an offence being committed and subsequently reaching court
encompasses a number of distinct stages (e.g. reporting, investigation
and charge) and associated criminal justice organisation. As such
variations in duration are largely driven by the timing of initial
reporting, the relative seriousness of the offence and the possible
complexity of a
case.</hs_Para><TableWrapper Columns="2" Size="7"><table tabstyle="head"><tgroup cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="12*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="9*"></colspec><colspec colname="3" colwidth="12*"></colspec><colspec colname="4" colwidth="13*"></colspec><colspec colname="5" colwidth="13*"></colspec><colspec colname="6" colwidth="16*"></colspec><colspec colname="7" colwidth="13*"></colspec><colspec colname="8" colwidth="13*"></colspec><thead><row><entry nameend="8" namest="1" rowsep="1"><hs_TableTitle Justify="centre"><I>Average

our reforms, management of the offenders who pose the highest risk of

the responsibility of the National Probation Service (NPS), and

of the Community Rehabilitation Companies

will be required to refer a offender to the NPS if they believe the
risk of serious harm is escalating to high. If a CRC refers a low or
medium risk offender to the NPS, and the NPS decides that the risk of
serious harm has escalated to high, the responsibility for the
management of the case will transfer to the NPS. These case transfers
will happen in a way that minimises the chance of destabilising the

buyout price (the amount a supplier must pay for every ROC they do not
present to Ofgem in order to comply with their obligation) plus the
recycle value (the amount re-distributed to suppliers from the buyout

for the UK—that tackling youth unemployment should be a
priority. That is why the Government implemented the Youth Contract in
April 2012, providing almost £1 billion of additional support

while the Government support the aims of the EU's Youth Guarantee and
agree with much of the supporting guidance, it does not believe a four
month guarantee is right for the UK. Over 80% of 18 to 24-year-olds

Government had little option other than to take swift action to tackle
the increasing use of early entry by some schools. The analysis we

Department's most recent research shows that, in 2012, only 62% of
pupils with an initial C grade in GCSE mathematics retook their exams,
whereas 98% of pupils with an initial D grade took their exams again.
This same trend is seen in English, where 53% of pupils with an initial
C grade retook their exams, compared to 96% of pupils with an initial D
grade. This clearly demonstrates that many schools do not re-enter
students with an initial C grade later on in the year, denying them the
opportunity to improve their grades. This practice of 'banking' a C
grade is clear evidence of schools not acting in the best interests of
their
pupils.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13112677001608" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131126/text/131126w0004.htm#13112677001608">Schools

smoking and smoking cessation in England. The most recent data from the
survey suggest that electronic cigarette use by tobacco smokers for any
purpose has increased from around 2% in 2011 to around 14% in August
2013. If this trend was reflected across the United Kingdom it would
translate to around 1.4 million smokers who have used electronic
cigarettes. The data does not distinguish between use for quitting or
partial substitution, nor does it allow for estimates of duration of
use. It is not possible to differentiate the proportion of those who
have stopped smoking tobacco cigarettes. What data is available on use
of electronic cigarettes in quitting suggests that these are about as
effective as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in

The figures refer to the Health and Social Care Information Centre's
collection of numbers of ‘qualified health visitors’
rather than ‘Sure Start health visitors’. For the
purposes of reporting health visitor work force expansion, the terms
‘health visitor’ and ‘Sure Start health
visitor’ are one and the
same.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>2</Sup> Until December 2012,
health visitor work force data were published by the Health and Social
Care Information Centre as part of the Hospital and Community Health
Services work force publication. It was based on use of the electronic
staff record (ESR) and thus did not include health visitors employed in
organisations such as local authorities and social enterprises that do
not usually use the ESR. A new health visitor minimum data set was
published from December 2012, which includes health visitors employed
by organisations not using the ESR. This supports the Government's
commitment to recruit 4,200 more health visitors by April 2015 and
better reflects the true health visiting work
force.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table>
