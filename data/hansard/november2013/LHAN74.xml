Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, most users access
digital government services via the major search engines. This user
behaviour has been used to inform the design of gov.uk so that
government services consistently come at the top of search results.
Easy access to and education about the official source of digital
government services is the main way the Government protect users from
inadvertently using non-official sites. The Government will continue to
take action against websites that misrepresent their relationship with
government and misuse government

Brabazon of Tara (Con):</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for that
reply, but is he aware that if he googles “European Health
Insurance Card”, the first two or three sites that he will come
to will charge him something more than £20 for the card, whereas
if he goes down to the National Health Service official site, he can
get one for free? There are other examples of this, most notably
passport applications where one can pay well over £40 for
something that one can do oneself for nothing or go through the Post
Office and pay just over £8 for help with filling in the form.
Does my noble friend agree that some of these sites, to a non-legal eye
anyway, come very close to passing themselves off as the official site?
Would not the solution be for the Government to make sure that their
site, even if it costs money with Google, always comes first on the
list<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T11:08:18"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13112188000727" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000727">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I spent some time on
Tuesday afternoon looking at some of these sites. I confirm I had not
realised—no doubt a number of noble Lords have not
realised—that the first two or three sites to come up on the
list are sponsored ads, which is indicated in very, very small print.
In all cases, the top site of the non-sponsored ads was the gov.uk
website. I also checked a number of the sponsored ads, which are
extremely well designed. They all say that 
<?notus-xml column=1062?>they are not an official website, but it is quite easy if you are in a
hurry to miss that paragraph. Perhaps I should add that Transport for
London also suffers from this if you are paying your congestion charge.
I suspect that one or two noble Lords have paid more than they should
for their congestion charge on one or two
occasions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T11:09:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Campbell-Savours" PimsId="2453" UID="13112188000728" xid="1640" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000728">Lord

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government could pay,
as the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, suggested, which perhaps would drive
up the cost of sponsored ads—or perhaps they could intervene and
forbid search engines from carrying sponsored ads in that place. I
think that we would be hesitant to do that. The Government are in
constant dialogue with Google. We look at these sites and check on the
number of complaints—and after agreement with Google a number of
these sites have been removed. The subtle design of them clearly is
improving.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T11:09:27"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Tyler" PimsId="4859" UID="13112188000730" xid="1879" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000730">Lord

about copycat websites, but is my noble friend aware that there are
occasions when the Government make money out of services that should be
free? Surely, what is right for the private goose should be right for
the government gander. For example, for many years now, government
departments and agencies have been using 0870 high-rate telephone
numbers. This has resulted in a change, but I understand from a news
item this month that some £56 million is already being made by
government out of services that ought to be free to the citizen and
taxpayer. It is outrageous that this continues. Will my noble friend
give an assurance that it will be dealt
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T11:10:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T11:10:45"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13112188000731" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000731">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not want to be tempted
down the road of what the Government should charge for and what we
should provide free. The Government do, after all, charge for renewing
a passport—one of the most frequent areas in which other
services then charge on top of the government fee if you answer a
sponsored ad by

Government not now call time on the people who operate these sites? I
suggest that the Government speak to the internet providers and tell
them not to accept these sponsored ads. Secondly, can the Government

I am familiar with the legal subtleties of this. A number of government
agencies and authorities have looked in detail at this and we are in

they are extremely well designed and all of them claim to offer
additional services, but there are occasional complaints that the

concentrated on the sort of services that people access only

private agencies to speed up getting passports or visas for other
countries. Indeed, you can obtain visas through the House of Lords
travel office. The question of how far private agencies should be
enabled to assist in speeding up the process is difficult. The
Government Digital Service and a number of other government agencies
are actively engaged in following this. Of course, the internet evolves
as quickly as the Government chase those who are abusing their
services, but I assure the House that the Government are actively
engaged in looking to do everything we can to limit such
activities.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_21_PT_1/93CD6F10ADB44792A251EFCE77A6A7555159DABE" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 November 2013">Thursday,

about 40% of TB cases occur in the UK. The board is developing a
dedicated London TB plan to strengthen measures to prevent, diagnose
and treat TB in London. There are similar initiatives in Manchester and
Birmingham. However, she is also right to say that we need to focus on
the rest of the country, not least some rural areas, and the strategy
there will be different to identify cases, diagnose them quickly and

accept that some years ago there was an increased incidence of

from outside the European Union who apply for a visa for more than six
months need to be screened in the country of origin. That work is
proceeding, although I have to say that implementation has proved
patchy, so we cannot be complacent. That is why it is vital to have

The Government’s view is that achieving a credible election is
the first step towards moving to a much bigger peacebuilding exercise.
The Government have committed £14 million to these
elections—for election preparation, for holding the elections
and to create the right environment for free and credible elections.
That has been done alongside a significant contribution to
peacebuilding both through DfID programmes and FCO-funded projects. We
will continue to provide that support, and to support the drafting of a
constitution which will underpin that peacebuilding. We will work

was a higher use of voter ID cards and a higher level of enthusiasm for

they were not inside them. However, initial concerns have been raised

first point, the very fact that one commercial bid team has submitted a
bid shows that it believes that there is a potential deal and it can
deliver against requirement. We have always known that running a
defence acquisition 
<?notus-xml column=1069?>would be challenging, which is one reason for testing through the
assessment phase whether it can be done. As for my noble
friend’s second point, he is right to recognise the specific
needs of defence acquisition and support personnel to match the
professionally motivated defence industry. That is why we are very
clear that, whatever option we choose, we will need to work with
colleagues across relevant departments to put in place the necessary
freedoms of operation to provide our Armed Forces with the right kit at

Touhig (Lab):</Member></B> The only outside bidder left in this process
is a consortium led by Bechtel, a company with a litany of
mismanagement of public service contracts, from Iraq to Romania to the
United States. In Boston, for instance, it was responsible for the Big
Dig, a tunnel construction project that went $1 billion over
budget—and two-thirds of the problem was down to its mistakes.

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, the answer is no. The materiel
acquisition partner’s team comprises Bechtel, as the noble Lord
says, PricewaterhouseCoopers and PA Consulting, a consortium of
world-class private sector businesses. The team has extensive
experience of complex program management; between them, they have
delivered programs to the United Kingdom, the United States and to 140
other countries around the world. Bechtel has ranked as the largest
program-managing engineering and construction company in the United
States for the past 14 years. Specifically, MAP members have been
involved in the Crossrail and High Speed 1 rail projects, as well as
the Jubilee line, and in transforming major businesses in both public

Minister said that the status quo is not an option, and certainly there
needs to be a massive improvement in the procurement capabilities and
efficiency of the Ministry of Defence; it is a long-standing problem.
However, when my noble friend Lord Lee says that you cannot have a
competition with only one entrant, is it not true that the competition
now is between an outside contractor—Bechtel and its
consortium—and an in-house resolution? If we do that, will he
ensure, because it is essential, that there is more continuity and
expertise, as has been referred to, in the procurement section of the

assurance. Two processes are happening—one as a result of the
single GOCO bidder and, as yesterday’s  
<?notus-xml column=1070?>Written Ministerial Statement made clear, that requires a further review
across government of the validity of the competition. Secondly, the MoD
will be assessing the bid that we have on the table for a GOCO, along

Tunnicliffe (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, on 19 November, a Written
Ministerial Statement on the GOCO competition included a vague
reference to a review by the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of
Defence. This review, which I could not find on the MoD website,
expressed grave reservations about a competition with two private
sector bidders. A copy of the review is available only from the
Library. Given the importance of this issue, and the Prime
Minister’s commitment to have the most open and transparent
Government ever, will the Minister commit to publishing the review in
full on the MoD website? Further, if the Government are
minded—it seems that the Minister is implying this—to
continue the GOCO competition with only one private sector bidder, will
he commit to a further joint review by the MoD and Cabinet Office on
how such a competition is viable, and publish that review on the MoD

open. I am sure that the review will be put on the website. Clearly,
the contract is commercially confidential, so we would not put that on
the website—certainly until the position is very much clearer.
As far as a further review is concerned, we hope to make a decision on
the validity of the competition very soon, and a final decision on the
whole process by the Summer Recess. I am sure that the whole House will
agree that it is important that we take a considered view before making

me give one example. In a report by Members of your Lordships’
House, Article 18 was dubbed an “orphaned right”.
Sidelining a right which upholds the right to belief, or indeed the
right not to believe, is a serious error and the failure to uphold this
orphaned right is leading to appalling consequences. As the noble
Baroness the Minister rightly warned at Georgetown University last
week, there is a need to “build political will” and to
actively uphold the Human Rights Council resolutions on the treatment
of minorities and tolerance towards other faiths. She said that in
large parts of the world Christians “face extinction” and
that senior politicians in countries like Pakistan have a
“duty” to denounce persecution and to set a standard for
tolerance. The noble Baroness is right and she is to be commended for
leading by her own formidable example.</hs_para>

Muslims in China, and of course Christians in these countries as well

Parekh (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord,
Lord Alton of Liverpool, on securing this debate and thank him for
introducing it with such passion and wisdom. We are right to
concentrate on the promotion of human rights rather than on the
promotion of democracy, which has been in the air for 
<?notus-xml column=1077?>quite some time. The rights are easy to identify and monitor, and there
is greater international agreement on what rights are worth preserving
and what rights are human rights. There is also greater international
pressure for implementing those rights as opposed to the promotion of
democracy, because democracy can mean many different things in many
different contexts. Therefore, I particularly welcome our discussion of
violation of human rights rather than violation of democratic
norms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T11:59:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000092">It
is also right to point out that we cannot deal with violations of human
rights in the whole world; we have to be selective. In that context, it
is important for us to concentrate on those countries with which we
have close ties, and where we can make an impact. In that context I
particularly thank the Prime Minister for the stand he took at CHOGM in
Sri Lanka. He was right to go. I think that the Prime Minister of India
was not right not to go. Our Prime Minister was right to visit Jaffna,
commiserate with the Tamils, condemn the army operations which killed
thousands of Tamils, demand an investigation into what actually
happened during the war and afterwards, and meet the representatives of
the Tamil
group<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:00:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000093">An
equally sensible attitude is increasingly being taken with reference to
Gujarat, the Indian state from which I come, where genocide took place
in February 2002, when a large number of Muslims were killed with the
complicity of the state. The American Government denied a visa to the
Chief Minister but the British Government took a very sensible view and
said nothing. Increasingly, the British Government began to recognise
that we had no conclusive evidence that the Chief Minister had been
directly and actively involved in what had gone on; after all, he had
been in power for only four months. Nor did we ignore the fact that
this sort of thing had happened in other parts of India, and therefore
we could not single out one state alone. About 18 months ago, or
perhaps a little less, the British Government asked the British high
commissioner to India, Sir James Bevan, to visit Mr Modi,
the Chief Minister of Gujarat. More recently, the Foreign Office
Minister, Mr Hugo Swire, visited the place. In Kolkata recently, the
Prime Minister said that he would be more than happy to meet any
elected leader. This is not to exonerate the leader of his
responsibility but simply to indicate that not talking to people is not
the

wish to make three general points. First, as we cannot promote all
kinds of human rights we obviously have to prioritise. Of the six
priorities listed by the Government there is not much reference to the
rights of trade unions, which in my view have played, and continue to
play, an extremely important role. Business rights are fine but they
are not supposed to include trade union rights. During the Arab spring,
trade unions were the vehicle through which important radical change
was achieved. Minority rights are also important. Generally, the
standard definition of human rights concentrates on individual rights
and tends to ignore minority
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:02:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000095">Secondly,
while we are right to condemn violations of human rights, we sometimes
tend to ignore our own complicity in these violations. Large
corporations 
<?notus-xml column=1078?>based in our country sometimes engage in practices abroad that violate
human rights or lead indirectly to violations of human rights. We ought
to tighten up the monitoring of our corporations. Many violations take
place during civil wars. We are sometimes complicit in instigating or
tolerating civil wars in other countries, which can result in gross
violations of human
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:03:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000096">Thirdly,
we tend to be selective about where we condemn violations of human
rights and where we do not. Violations of human rights in Pakistan or
Saudi Arabia are by and large ignored, whereas we tend to concentrate
on them in countries such as China. This sometimes gives the impression
that we are unprincipled and that we are using human rights discourse
or issues to promote a particular political agenda. We need to ensure
that we are principled when we condemn violations of human
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:03:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000097"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="13112188000786" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000786">Baroness

Hollins (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend
Lord Alton on securing and introducing this important debate. It has
been said that wartime rape is as old as war itself. Women’s
lives and bodies have been unacknowledged casualties of war for too
long, but now greater media awareness and reporting, probably in part
because of the exceptional women journalists covering conflict, have
brought wider knowledge of the extent to which rape is occurring. The
consequences of rape are also better understood. Five years ago, a
United Nations resolution described rape as a tactic of war and a
threat to international security.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112188000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000099">Rape is used as a
punishment for men as well as women, by forcing men to watch as their
wives, sisters, mothers and daughters are raped. Victims of rape are
left emotionally traumatised, physically damaged and at risk of
potentially fatal sexually transmitted diseases. Rape humiliates,
dominates, instils fear and disperses communities. The after-effects of
rape are felt for generations, as women bear their rapists’
children, and face shame and revulsion. Surely it is time to draw a
line, and time for the international community to take rape as
seriously as it does the use of other weapons. As my noble friend
mentioned, hundreds of thousands of women have been raped in the Congo.
Reports of rape have also emerged from the current conflict in Syria.
When will women’s human rights be recognised and acted
upon?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112188000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000100">Rape is
always an abuse of power. In the case of rape, it is an abuse of
physical power. When communities are under threat, it is the weak and
vulnerable who suffer the most. People with disabilities are subjected
to more violence in any country, but more so in a country in turmoil,
where people are concerned for their own lives and livelihoods and may
not have the resources to look after the most vulnerable people in 
<?notus-xml column=1079?>their communities. It may be as obvious as someone with physical
disabilities being unable to flee rebel attacks, or as insidious as
someone with a disability being last in the queue for food and water.
Disabled women and girls are also raped.</hs_para>

unusual for victims of rape and sexual violence in times of conflict to
seek help, but when they do, those with disabilities are at a further
disadvantage. Health centres and police stations are far away and
victims rely on others to take them there, leaving them at greater risk
of the untreated physical complications of rape. Police stations and
courts do not have the resources to facilitate communication with those
who have difficulties, such as the deaf and people with learning
disabilities. Many girls and women with disabilities are illiterate and
rely on their families for communication. Families will often not
support a woman or girl in reporting a rape because of the additional
stigma that rape brings to a family already stigmatised by
disability.</hs_para>

those that allow such human rights abuses to be carried out on women

discriminate against women, as much religion still does. We are moving

diplomacy to, for instance, raise Russia's discrimination against gay
people. Perhaps, as the Foreign Office reviews its priorities in its

it does from time to time, it might consider whether the rights of LGBT

Korea and Iran. We rightly condemn their abuses of human rights, but we
look more benignly at countries with which we have close political
alliances or trade links—as the noble Lord, Lord Parekh,
perceptively observed. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Derby reminded us, we should look to the mote in our own eye. If we
were consistent, the UN report of a government massacre of some 40,000
men, women and children from Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority and
evidence of continuing human rights abuses would have led to that

example of this less than even-handed approach to human rights. Next

Golden Temple in Amritsar and the subsequent massacre of tens of
thousands of Sikhs throughout India. An independent inquiry headed by a
former Chief Justice of India found overwhelming evidence of top
Congress Party involvement. Yet our Government’s response to
this attack on a minority faith was total silence. When I raised the
matter with a then Cabinet Minister, I received the reply,

wondering why the history of my home town is relevant to today’s
debate on human rights. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Alton of
Liverpool, for initiating this crucial debate. It is relevant because
it reminds us of the evils of child labour. In Cradley, children were
born, reared, worked and died in the chain shops. It was not unusual to
see baby baskets swinging from iron poles so that women could hammer
iron and rock their baby at the same time. By the age of eight,

dominance of child labour in Cradley is a distant memory. However, this
is not the case in many other parts of the world, where child labour
exists on a colossal scale. Millions of children younger than the basic
minimum working age are deprived of their childhood and work in
appalling conditions that damage their physical and mental well-being.
The ILO 
<?notus-xml column=1087?>estimates that across the world, instead of going to school, 168 million
children aged five to 17 are child labourers. Every child has the right
to a childhood, and every child has the right to an education. Child
labour is a violation of a child’s human
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000146">Today,
I want to highlight two areas of child labour that particularly affect
girls: mining and domestic work. Across the world there are more than
85 million children engaged in hazardous work, the most menacing of
which is the plight of child miners. Children as young as six and seven
are handling explosives, exposed to toxic air and carrying heavy loads.
The physical and psychological effects are traumatic for both boys and
girls. However, girls bear a double burden as they also have to carry
out domestic chores at home for the family. There is no time for rest,
and no time for
school.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000147">Another
area where girls are particularly vulnerable is when they work behind
closed doors as domestic workers. Some 11.5 million children, mainly
girls, work dawn to dusk taking care of domestic chores in other
people’s homes. They live with their employer. They are under
the control of their employer. They are isolated and trapped. Many

must work with each other and everyone involved in our civil society to
alleviate global poverty, achieve universal primary education and
eliminate child labour. We know we can all do more. There are many
charities in the UK that work to alleviate poverty. I declare an
interest as I am a trustee of one such charity, APT—Action on
Poverty. APT fights poverty by giving people the means to feed their
families all year round and forever. It works with local partners on
the ground in sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia to build lasting

know that child labour is directly linked to poverty, which is why
charities like APT are vital. When a person knows that they can feed
their family not just today but every day in the future, they can fully
embrace education, not employment, for their child. If children fail to
get an education, they fail to get the skills needed for their own
growth as well as their country’s economic growth. The poor of
today remain the poor of tomorrow. Sadly, child labour is not just an
issue for developing countries. Studies have shown that children here
in the UK have been found in forced labour. That is why I very much
welcome the Government’s commitment to bring forward a modern
Slavery Bill, which I hope is still due in December. I hope that it
will pay particular attention to child labour here and across the

communities around education, support social protection programmes, and
invest more in education and in modernising agricultural production in
poor rural communities where child labour is rife.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Alton, for initiating this very important debate, and
I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of Cradley, for her very clear
and powerful speech. It is particularly important that she mentioned
something that has not been mentioned so far in this debate, namely the
way that children are still exploited in so many parts of the world. We
look forward to hearing her clear and powerful voice on subsequent

future historians look back on the immediate post-World War II period,
they will judge that one of the greatest achievements of that time was
the UN declaration of human rights and the ensuing conventions. Those
affirmed in law the unique worth of every single individual. They are,
in the words of the late Ronald Dworkin, “trumps”, which
cannot be overridden by any raison d’état. Of course the
trouble, as we know, is that it is so easy to be deeply depressed at
the massive way in which human rights are violated in so many countries
in the world. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, gave us a long list at the
beginning, although he did not mention some of them. It is very easy to
get depressed by that, and it is difficult to know what to focus on in
this debate. As the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, reminded us, it is
important that we should not be selective. However, when we get
depressed, we need to go back to the fact that we still have a
benchmark in the UN declaration. It is a question of being as
persistent in the pursuit of that as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has
been in setting us a very good example in his wide-ranging and
persistent concern for human
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000154">I hope
that noble Lords will excuse me if, as chairman of the All-Party Group
on Dalits, I focus very briefly on them. I do so first because of the
sheer scale of the problem that affects them: there are something like
260 million Dalits in the world, mainly in India and other south-east
Asian countries. Secondly, although all human rights violations are
appalling—torture, religious persecution and so on—there
is something particularly humiliating and degrading about the way in
which Dalits are totally rejected by the surrounding culture in which
so many of them live and every area of their lives is affected. If
anyone doubts the sheer horror of this I would recommend the novel <I>A
Fine Balance</I> by Rohinton Mistry. The “fine balance”
of the title is the balance between hope and despair. I have huge
admiration for the poor of India, for their sheer resilience, hope and
even joy, despite everything. However, the problems are huge. In almost
every area of exploitation the Dalits will be found at the bottom, more
exploited than anybody

am glad to say that we will hear more over the next months about
different forms of trafficking. Noble Lords will not be surprised to
know that because the 
<?notus-xml column=1089?>Dalits are the most vulnerable of all groups, they are found in all
forms of trafficking and at a much higher percentage than other groups.
Trafficking takes the form of bonded labour. It also takes the form of
the Sumangali system for the payment of dowries. Although that system
has been officially abolished in India since 1961, it still goes on.
However, the sex trade is perhaps the most shocking of all. As Dalit
Solidarity Network UK puts it,</hs_para>

the concept of human rights was first formulated after World War II,
the particular concern was the way in which individuals need to be

course, with the kind of discrimination the Dalits experience, because

the Government, when they raise their general concerns about human

Patten (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, like the words “location,
location, location” in a very different context,
“consistency, consistency, consistency” should be the key
to our Government’s attitude to countries that violate human
rights. Our foreign policy must be realistic—of course I
recognise that. I am in favour of our trading nation having the
commercial foreign policy that we are developing. However, I am also in
favour of the motif once used so effectively by the late Robin Cook:
the need for an ethical foreign policy. The two are not at odds and
indeed both trade and aid can be used as powerful levers to bring about
change over the years in delinquent countries. To illustrate this I
will compare and contrast our attitude in this context, particularly in
relation to religious freedoms, on Iran and on Turkey, where there are
dominant
Governments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:47:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000159">I
turn first to Iran. While all are hopeful that Mr Rouhani,
the new President, may make things better for persecuted minorities, we
should all recall that instant warm words of welcome in the media for
apparent, new liberal change around the world often have to be eaten
pretty quickly, as the plight of the poor Copts in Egypt, highlighted
by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, shows us at the moment. They are clearly
the most up-to-date victims of religious clearances in Africa. In Iran,
all religious groups other than orthodox Muslims are now in the
religious cleansing firing line under Mr Rouhani’s new
presidency. There is no or little freedom and much persecution of all
those who are not Muslims, from Sufi dervishes to evangelical
Christians, from the poor Baha’is, who are so persecuted, to
those Armenian and Assyrian churches who happen to conduct their
services in Farsi, which is thought not to be acceptable. Some of those
churches are still being closed down under the new liberal presidency
of Mr
Rouhani<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T12:48:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

visible change and a bit of hope, and the Government have been very
robust in trying to do what they can to help and to condemn such
persecution in Iran. Good. Strangely, however, the Government
seem—although perhaps I am misguided—to pull their
punches a bit on Turkey, a country which is always described as
“mildly Islamist” in polite diplomatic discourse. Bad. Is
it mildly Islamist for Turkey to suppress the ancient Greek monastery
on Halki island, or to restrict the freedoms of worship of the Alevis
in Turkey? Is it “mildly Islamist” to make it impossible
for Christians to have public places of worship established in the
seaside holiday-making areas of coastal Turkey? One Anglican clergyman
has told me that they have to flit from house to house underground to
have underground services, as if they were living in some kind of penal

am very glad that some of our leading western Christian leaders have
got off their knees at long last to say that this anti-Christian trend
must be resisted. I hasten to add that I recognise that being on their
knees is part of the day job of right reverend Prelates, and others, as
they pray for us in need of their prayers. But I am glad that they have
shown this leadership. A few years ago, I took part in a debate in this
place with the noble Lord, Lord Alton, which highlighted the apparent
onset of Christian clearances in Iraq. It is a bit late now, as those
clearances are more or less complete. Turkey next? I do not
know—I hope not—but I do know that it is not
“mildly Islamist” to disperse with such terrifying
violence peaceful demonstrations in Gezi Park in central Istanbul,
where I have walked, rightly condemned by Amnesty International for its
“large-scale human rights violations”. Is it indeed
respectful of freedom of expression for so-called “mildly

any other country on earth, including China? Only three days ago, on

these things are important, but they work only once there is a clear
commitment to the underlying value of the freedom of religion or

Lord for securing today’s debate, particularly as I chair the
All-Party Parliamentary Group on International Religious Freedom or
Belief. We specifically added “or Belief” when the
British Humanist Association became one of the stakeholders. The issue
has for too long been viewed as global identity politics. Christians
seemingly speak up only when Christians are persecuted, Sikhs for
Sikhs, and Baha’is for Baha’is, and this has contributed
to Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights not being
treated as a universal human right. The issue needs careful nuance and
although some commentators, especially some on the centre right, want
neat analyses, the following cursory around-the-world tour reveals that
to be too
simplistic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000189">On
28 August 2013 in the southern Iranian city of Bandar Abbas, Mr
Ataollah Rezvani, a well known Baha’i, was murdered. He had come

Zhang Xiaojie, who leads the Nanle county Christian church, a
Three-Self state sanctioned church in China, was detained. Currently
the pastor and 20 other members of the church are still being detained
without arrest or charge. As has already been mentioned, Alexander Aan,
an atheist, is in prison in Indonesia. Interestingly, Papua New Guinea
has recently launched a consultation to prohibit non-Christian worship.
If you are a Hindu in Pakistan, the law does not allow you to marry.

Advisory Group? Most if not all of the other priorities do so.
Moreover, does it not justify more than a part-time, unpaid special
rapporteur as its main resource at the international level? The Prime
Minister is to visit China next month, so will Her Majesty’s

this unambiguously. Globalisation and the internet on smartphones means
increasing exposure to different beliefs around the world. While
traditionally where you were born and the community you were from
perhaps dictated what you believed, individuals are increasingly able
to make such decisions for themselves. There is a global trend of
religious conversion and the emergence of new religious movements. This
positive empowerment is, however, often met by harsh responses from
many Governments around the world. For instance, as other noble Lords

grew up with friends and family scarred by and in the shadow of the
Holocaust. I appreciated the universal lessons that were drawn from
those terrible events. Also around that time we saw the rise of the
Khmer Rouge and the establishment and operation of the murderous and
brutal regime known as Democratic Kampuchea. As a young school pupil, I
remember participating in the work of a TV appeal to bring relief to
the Cambodian people. These events have had a lasting impact on me, and
in many ways they have guided my life. The events of the Holocaust and
the end of the Second World War gave rise, of course, to the Universal

conventions, treaties and courts may not be perfect, but it is
essential that they exist rather than not. I congratulate the
Government on their successful election to the Human Rights Council.
This reminds us how broad the role is that Government can play, and in
this regard I would like to make a few suggestions and offer some
thoughts on what the Government can consider. First, we need to remind
ourselves that our work defending, protecting and advocating human
rights protects not only those who face the
denial of those rights, but also our own way of life. This is a
dangerous period and the erosion of human rights
can be an early sign of a broader attack on liberty. If our role in the
world is to stand for anything, it is not just about
adhering to the universal declaration, it is surely to protect our
liberal values and way of life and extending the same rights and
freedoms to others. We should do this by making the world more stable,
increasing economic inclusion, making government outcomes more fair,
less corrupt and more effective, and giving more people a stake in
successful democracies. We should cement all of that in place through
stable, equitable free trade and a growing economic interdependence
that binds us
together<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T13:16:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

vast task with many actors. Human rights and democracy are frequently
challenged. They are still very young in most countries and under
pressure, particularly where education and the checks on elected
Governments and corruption are weak, as well as where there is little
appreciation that violence and discrimination against women is perhaps
the greatest bar to a nation’s progress. Human rights must be
part of a long-term strategy across a range of government departments,
international institutions, parliamentary initiatives and an active,
thriving international NGO and civil society
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000199">The
Government are well placed to achieve a lot and their influence depends
on the level of international engagement. I am encouraged by the work
of this and many previous Governments to extend our reach, and I add my
support to these efforts. But I would encourage the Government to look
more closely at whether we are using all the tools we have as
effectively as possible. Surely it is worth considering whether
development 
<?notus-xml column=1098?>aid can do more to support a strategy of long-term political development
as part of a wider strategy across government departments.</hs_para>

We need to address the economic dimensions that influence the
attainment of human rights. There is a need to understand that the
factors which curb human rights go beyond the traditional notions of
corrupt regimes—rather, it is the fact that terribly uneven
societies endure and the extractive capabilities of nations continue to
be plundered while the prosperity and well-being of their citizens are
ignored that causes great forms of repression. Creating the right
market conditions, promoting growth, values and responsibility in the
private sector is certainly part of it, but there is some merit in the
argument that we should be vigilant. We must try to ensure that we do
not allow societies to reach the tipping point where a population feels
that the diminution of their and their children’s long-term
economic prospects and a fundamental lack of hope adds to instability
and conflict and a further erosion of their human rights.</hs_para>

example, although a vast majority of companies, such as my own, are
signatories to the UN Global Compact, only a third of those that said
they were devoted to human rights had a policy in place or a mechanism

livelihoods but stand together to take a responsible position on
building requirements, regulations and standards for the future. Not
only was this a dreadful affair that saw the unjust loss of multitudes

I recall in the early 1980s going to a south Asian country and saying
to our ambassador, “What are you doing about human
rights?”. His answer was, “Oh, that’s a job for my
first secretary”. That would no longer be allowed. Indeed, there
has been an immeasurable improvement in the overseas
department’s links and attitude to human rights. I think, for
example, of changes in the structure of the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, with the human rights and democracy department; the human
rights report, which, happily, came from a recommendation of the
Foreign Affairs Select Committee, which I chaired at that time, which
has certainly been refined and improved; the human rights and democracy
programme; and also the much improved links with non-governmental
organisations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T13:28:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the interlink between the domestic and the foreign. I recall the former
Foreign Minister of Australia, Senator Gareth Evans, saying,
“How can we Australians be taken seriously on human
rights representations abroad if we maltreat our
Aborigines”—being Australian, he actually said
“Abos”—“at home”. That shows that
there is a linkage between what we do at home and the strength of our
representations abroad. That obviously relates to our immigration
policy, our counterterrorism policy and our attitudes to Islamophobia
and
anti-Semitism.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000217">Looking
at our international organisations, I am delighted that we are now on
the Human Rights Council, which is an enormous improvement on its
predecessor, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights,
which could reach agreement only on attacks on Israel. I look forward

I think also of the Commonwealth and the Council of Europe,
included in the second priority in the 2012 human rights
report.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112188000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000218">On
the Commonwealth, of course we think of CHOGM and whether or not the
Prime Minister should have attended the Sri Lankan summit. Yes, there
is a time for engagement but I am troubled by the question of cui
bono—who actually benefited most from the Prime
Minister’s attendance? I fear that the answer may well be the
President of Sri Lanka. The Commonwealth charter is a magnificent
document but in practice, if one looks at the 60% of Commonwealth
countries that still have capital punishment and attitudes towards the
criminalisation of homosexuality, there is much work for our Government
to do in persuading our Commonwealth colleagues of the importance of
human
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0001.htm#13112188000219">On the

the Joint Committee earlier this month. It would be a disastrous
precedent in respect of Russia, Turkey and other defaulters, if

there has to be a balance in any matter of human rights. Sometimes it
is best to do things in a low voice and behind the scenes. I was a
member of the human rights mission to China that was led extremely ably
by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, in which we were
effective because we made quiet representations to the Chinese
authorities. I concede also that there is a temptation to be strong on

want to relate two, very brief stories to the House from my own
experience. I do it in the light of the comments of the noble Baroness,
Lady Suttie, who talked about Russia as it is today—and
certainly there is a great deal of imperfection. When I came into
Parliament some 43 years ago, I immediately became a great friend of
the noble Lord, Lord
Janner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T13:46:01"></hs_TimeCode>. We
decided to form a campaign for the release of Soviet Jewry. He thought
that it was right that I should chair it, as a Christian, and he was a
very tireless secretary. I am sorry that he is not in his place at the
moment, because I pay tribute to him. At that time, it was impossible
to get a visa to go to Moscow to argue our case. It was impossible to
get religious books accepted in the Soviet Union. I remember we sent
one, signed by all the party leaders, to a dissident called
Slepak’s son for his bar mitzvah. It was sent back. Twenty years
later, as a member of an international commission on human rights, I
took part in an epiphany service in the Kremlin in a place where the
leaders of the Soviet bloc countries had gone in the past and Christian
worship would never have been permitted. At that service, 
<?notus-xml column=1106?>handed to Mr Gorbachev’s special representative and chef de
cabinet, Andrei Grachev, was a volume of the Scriptures which was
symbolic of a million Bibles being accepted into the Soviet
Union. That was true

relate just one other incident. Two years later, in 1972-73, we were in
Vienna receiving some who had come out and been given visas. There was
one young lady who spoke the most perfect English. I joked with her and
said, “You must have been top of all your classes” and
she said, “Well, actually, I was, until the day after my parents
were granted the visa, when I was summoned to the
vice-chancellor’s office and told that I had been the victim of
a mistake and I had failed everything”. Twenty-one years later,
I stood in that vice-chancellor’s or chancellor’s office
in the University of Tartu in Estonia, a country by then a member of
the European Community and of NATO, and rejoiced at the freedoms that

tell these two very brief stories merely to illustrate that persistence
can and does pay off. It is important that we maintain
dialogue—the noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred to the Helsinki
accords. It is important that we keep contact with those countries
whose regimes we deplore, and it is important that we deplore them
publicly so that there is pressure on the leaders of those countries to
make them realise that they are not acting in isolation but are being
looked at, and that their words and deeds are being monitored. Let us
remember that in almost every country of which we are talking, be it
Pakistan, Nigeria or Iran, a vast majority of ordinary, decent people

whole range of countries where those abuses have taken, or are taking,
place. These are not simple judgments to make and the noble Lord, Lord

such countries, most particularly North Korea, deserves credit for

The real dilemmas are to be found in the foreign policy choices that
lie between those two extremes, and they have to take account of the

where the UN’s High Commissioner for Human Rights recently

give the House some idea of how the President of Sri Lanka responded to
the Prime Minister’s representations. Will she also assure us
that the Government will not slacken in their advocacy of an
independent inquiry into the events at the end of the war? An inquiry
is surely going to have to be international if it is to be truly
independent. Will we also keep up the pressure on the need for

considering how Britain should respond to human rights abuses, I
suggest that one mistake we need to avoid is looking at the issue
principally, or even solely, in the context of our bilateral
relationship with the country in question. However, Britain’s
influence and leverage are unlikely to be decisive nowadays. All too
often we have seen how easy it is for the country in question to punish
us for our temerity and play us off against other countries which have
been less assertive. We saw that over the Chinese reactions to the
Prime Minister receiving the Dalai Lama, and the Russians are past
masters at that game. A multilateral approach is not just a soft option
and makes it more difficult for the country on the receiving end of the
pressure or the sanctions to divide and rule. I give a few examples of
where it has been very successful: the Commonwealth sporting boycott of
apartheid South Africa; the wide-ranging international sanctions on the
military regime in Burma; and the pressure the European Union is
bringing to bear on Ukraine in the run-up to the Eastern Partnership
summit later this month. This surely points to our making maximum use
of the multilateral instruments and forums that exist for handling
human rights. How effective are those instruments and what sort of
shape are they in? As many other speakers have said, the UN Universal
Declaration of Human Rights must surely remain the cornerstone of our
activity, whether multilateral or bilateral. However, it contains no
enforcement machinery and the UN Human Rights Council, established in
2006, has yet to prove itself fully, although its universal periodic
review of every member state’s human rights record is an
instrument of real value. We need to do what we can to strengthen the
hand of the admirable High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Pillay,
who visited London recently. In that context, I hope that the Minister
will say what response the Government gave to Ms Pillay’s plea

oppose the use of the death penalty because we promote human rights and
democracy and because there are no circumstances in which we believe
that it is appropriate or ethically justified. We want to influence
people and dissuade them from using capital punishment, including those

those suffering the death penalty are under 30. I congratulate my noble

world of multipolarity? There is a great instinct in general to hold
nations directly or indirectly accountable for their actions. It is our
current trajectory that I want to look at. Do we balance properly the
ethical foreign policy that we should adopt, if we can, with the United

There must be a new disposition between all these.</hs_para>

will never be an unbending standard to judge every circumstance and,

dictators, war criminals, illegal arms dealers and others. It would
demand of us only that we looked after our own security and financial
profitability. We would have intervened in Libya because it had armed
the IRA and not because it was slaughtering its own people. These are
the issues that we have to face. We would have turned our backs, in

that the core guidelines, which we may need to behave more
appropriately now, are perhaps these? First, our foreign policy in
these areas should obviously protect our security and that of our
allies, while promoting conditions in which we are least likely to be
attacked at home or have our people attacked in other parts of the
world—and we should do so with our allies in a multilateral way.
Secondly, while our choice of means in such circumstances would almost
always lead to peaceful means, we must acknowledge circumstances where,
for the right and wholly disclosed reasons and with parliamentary
consent, wherever possible, we should intervene as a last resort with
proportionate steps and reasonable prospects of success. I labour this
point because, aside from our own security—the paramount
reason—we also have obligations to protect. They are part of our
international obligations and often imply preventing, reacting and
rebuilding after conflict. I find it hard to conceive of retaining a
permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, as I wish this

will commend also the work of the Canadian Government, who have
captured this thought. Their international commission on intervention
judges the evidence of serious harm, including mass murder and
starvation, and whether the state involved is unwilling, unable or
opposed to averting such harm. If these conditions hold, the principle
of non-intervention yields to the responsibility to
protect—something that we should take very seriously. It was
close to Robin Cook’s thinking, and I believe that it was close
to Tony Blair’s in his speech to the Chicago press

that they espouse. I commend the Canadian approach as being among
perhaps the best architecture that has been designed. It was somewhat
lost in the aftermath of 9/11 and it is hardly known or studied in many

those beliefs, to show them outwardly, to share them with others, to
change your faith or to not have a faith, and to do so without fear of
discrimination, attack or persecution. I echo the words of my noble

Dalits and the caste system”. These old evils still need to be
combated, even as new giants emerge. Perhaps in our generation we might
make caste history. Wilberforce, whose biographer is our Foreign

ResPublica, entitled <I>Holistic Missions: Social Action and the Church

picture of a church which is present in every community, town, village
and city and embedded in its localities. It is a church which baptises,
marries and buries a significant proportion of the population, educates
some 1 million children in church schools and serves the poor, the

central argument is that a nation cannot thrive and progress purely as

massive scandals of appalling care and resultant cover-ups. Our banking

we are to grasp the unique role of the church in social action, we must
recognise that faith plays a vital part in motivating and energising
voluntary action at every level. Some 79% of church members who
responded to ResPublica’s survey have been involved in social
action in the past 12 months, compared with the national average of
45%. According to the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I>, members of the Church of

the City of Sanctuary projects, reaching the most desperate asylum

self-confidence and life chances for unemployed young people.
Apprenticeships in churches and church schools are beginning to develop
high quality training and work experience. Outreach youth work in the
diocese now exceeds all the resource from the other agencies put
together. This pattern is replicated up and down the country where the
social mission of the church is indivisible from its spiritual

is this work widespread but it depends on an institution which is
exceptional in its reach and essentially focused on the local.
Churches, especially the Church of England, act both as a bridge across
communities but also essentially as a gateway into communities. Quite
frankly, it is the established church which is uniquely placed to
achieve almost universal access through its networks of staff and

requires a devolution of power both from government and the private
sector and a readiness to break up monopolistic power that leaves the
churches and the voluntary sector sometimes out of the equation. It
also requires government to think more holistically in terms of
partnering with the churches in health, education, work and training

recognise that there is more that the churches themselves can do in
this area. Much of this work needs to be done at local level,
harnessing the networks and experience already in place. For example,
efforts are being made to bring together the different levels of church
social action. In 2012, a project was launched by the most reverend
Primate the Archbishop of York, under the title <I>Resourcing Christian
Community Action</I>,<I> </I>which aims to be a catalyst to bring
together current best practice in providing Christian care in local
communities with the resources and knowledge needed to multiply this
work across the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:41:35"></hs_TimeCode>. The
challenge in the report to the mission and public affairs department of

good links to church-based social ventures to act as an intermediary on

want to concentrate on the central recommendation of the ResPublica
report. It diagnoses what it calls the failings of state departmental
silos and private sector cherry picking, trapped between individualism
and collectivism. I have a lot of time for that analysis: it is broadly
right. It also talks of the potential institutional role of the Church
of England as the “hyper-local” hub or gateway to
compensate for the failings that I have just referred to. It
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13112188000638" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000638">“Communities
exhausted by the break-up of traditional structures of both families

is sometimes useful when confronted by large themes such as this to go
back to local particular example. I come from a town in Suffolk that
is, I suspect, typical of many towns in our nation. There are more than
300 market towns such as Sudbury. Today, it has more than 12 places of
worship. There are 20,000 people, three Anglican churches, one
Catholic, one Baptist church, a Methodist church, URC, Strict and

Witnesses, the Vineyard and others besides.</hs_para>

does not give the impression of a community that is falling out of
contact with Christianity. I should go on to say that there is a
thriving Muslim community now, mainly made up of the local
restaurateurs and their families. They carry on their services in the
Quaker meeting house, which is a delightful and appropriate thing for
them to be doing. There is in the town a strong Churches Together
set-up, which is typical of most towns. That does a huge amount,
quietly and effectively, to co-ordinate activities between the
different churches and faiths, and provides a flexible and organic
utility for that

sometimes think that of all the aspects of our national life that we do
not pay enough attention to, it is the decline of community life, which
over my span has been continuous and now has now reached a critical
position all round the country. The consequences of the breakdown of
community are incalculable because it is through community that we
learn our humanity, learn to tolerate and be tolerated, and imbibe so
much of the collective wisdom that otherwise escapes us as mere
individuals in our families. The ResPublica report proposes this hub
role for the Church of England largely as a means of shoring up the
community life of the country. The report refers to the decline of the
tradition of communitarian civic conservatism. I think that that is
with a small “c”. Again, it is right. In my home town,
for example, in the 1950s, the leaders of the community were its
natural leaders, in that they were the leading business people, the
leading professional people, leaders from trade unionism and so on.
Sadly, that is less and less the case. I repeat that that is a 
<?notus-xml column=1123?>national tendency. Not having those in the community who are most
naturally looked up to—the natural examplars, you might say, of
civic and citizenship identity—is a massive setback from which
we are all suffering

of my gripes with the ResPublica report is that it concentrates far too
much on the Church of England. All churches have that vital, practical,
exemplary role. The phrase keeps coming back to me of walking the talk.
If the churches do not walk the talk, what the heck are they for and
who are they

report suggests that the Church of England is given the key role of
being the institutional hub in the process of reviving
communitarianism, countering the rabid individualism, consumerism,
materialism—call it what you like—that is, I think,
deforming our society today. It wants the Church of England to
celebrate its values and purpose rather than celebrating celebrity
itself, as we spend so much time doing, I
fear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T14:51:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000331">My
problem with all of that is that I do not think that the Church of
England, although I love it dearly, is fit for that purpose. It is in a
state of extreme inequality within itself. In some parts of the
country, some churches and cathedrals are vibrant and thriving, but
many are not. They are very much on the back foot and struggling. I
believe that, in any event, a state church, such as the Church of
England is supposed to be, is better off being less connected with the
state than more. I think that it infringes on the independence of a
church to be too establishmentarianist. I think that that saps the
independence of the church and its congregations; it makes it more
subject to the vicissitudes of Governments—sometimes the same
Government, let alone changing Governments; it reduces its freedom of
collective or congregational criticism; it also places a downward
pressure on the potential for civic and congregational
innovation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000332" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000332">I
see the Church of England—indeed, all churches—not as
great, hub institutions embraced with and by the state but as seed beds
of individual civic activism, hotbeds even. Often, thank goodness,
churches and chapels are. I see them more as fertilisers of community
vitality rather than some sort of grand master of the same. For those
reasons, I am sceptical of what I take to be a central proposition of
the ResPublica report, although I thank the organsiation for addressing
the issues and challenging
me.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000333" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000333">Lastly,
lest I sit down on what may sound too complacent a note, I think that
the Church of England has a huge amount to do—we have a huge
amount to do. The failure of the Church of England to engage young
people is, I fear, is central to its challenges. In my congregation, I
suppose that the average age must be about 70. We do not have a Sunday
school, but we are thought to be a successful church. We are not. You
cannot say that you are in those circumstances. We are still far too
middle class and far too disinclined to get our hands dirty. I do not
oppose the central proposition of the report or by any means suggest
that all is right in the state of the Church of England. It comes down
to action: walking the talk, as I said earlier. We have a great deal to
do in that direction. My word, does not the country and do not our
communities need the 
<?notus-xml column=1124?>Church of England, all churches and humanists? For goodness’

diocese of Carlisle is not the oldest diocese in the country, dating

the most colourful in its history. Early Bishops of Carlisle acted as
the King’s agents in the north. Together with the Bishops of
Durham, they were responsible for keeping the Scots out of the
so-called disputed lands surrounding Hadrian’s Wall and, to that
end, they employed a small private army, which was housed in their
official residence, Rose Castle. According to a local chronicler, at
least one bishop was more noted for his prowess in the saddle than in
the pulpit and Rose, together with the medieval cathedral in Carlisle
was frequently attacked and pillaged by Robert the Bruce, among others,
with the direct consequence that both the castle and cathedral are half
their original size—rather, it must be said, to the relief of
those who have to maintain them. Subsequent bishops have included
Thomas Merck, who features in Shakespeare's play “Richard

work that is currently taking place. This week, as we heard, the
General Synod of the Church of England has been meeting here in London.
Several of the topics under discussion related directly to how the
church can and does create social capital and add value in our society.
For instance, in a debate on church schools, we were reminded not only
of their high educational standards and increasingly inclusive approach
to admission but of the fact that our clergy give hundreds of thousands
of hours each year to the million or so children who attend such
schools in their parishes. There was a meeting on credit unions,
something with which many individual Christians and whole congregations
have become involved in recent years and a very hopeful way forward in
these times of mounting personal

mentioned by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester, we
also heard a presidential address on poverty and talked about the way
in which churches have been instrumental in establishing food banks

are several in Cumbria. At the recent launch of a new report on poverty
and deprivation in Furness, the local MP singled out the churches for 
<?notus-xml column=1126?>particular mention in this regard. In many ways, initiatives of this

develop schemes such as parish nurses, health centre community
chaplains and parishioners acting as local carers for the elderly and

Griffiths of Burry Port (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I rise with great
pleasure to follow the maiden speech of the right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of Carlisle. It is not a good week to be a Methodist Minister,
so I am hoping very much that the right reverend Prelate will recognise
the sincerity of what I am about to say. The pair of us go back quite a
long way. When I was on the management committee of an ecumenical
project that he was running at Bar Hill, just outside Cambridge, I used
to have to keep an eye on him to make sure that he was doing the right
things. That is the right relationship of the Methodist Church to the
Church of England. Subsequent to that, in Grasmere, when he was the
Bishop of Penrith, we had a marvellous, county-wide effort and we met
up again there. What he does in Cumbria for the cause of ecumenism is
almost proverbial and is certainly trend-setting. I hope that since
there are two other right reverend Prelates sitting there, they will
learn from his example and follow the same
route<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:07:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000348" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000348">It
is lovely to hear that extra dimension being drawn into the right
reverend Prelate’s remarks. We must remember, as we concentrate
on a debate that so specifically picks out the Church of England, that
that is only one player in the field—of course, I want to draw
attention to that. However, we look forward to many useful, helpful,
edifying contributions from the right reverend Prelate. If they are not
forthcoming, I will tell him
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:07:56"></hs_TimeCode>. Of course, I
feel as if I am in the middle of a sandwich here, because I look
forward with great interest to the maiden speech of the noble Baroness,
Lady Lawrence, who has set a tone for British civil society and indeed
for the national consciousness that we must all learn from. It is not
for 
<?notus-xml column=1127?>me to thank her for what she has not yet delivered, but I stand in great
anticipation of what she will
deliver<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:08:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000349" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000349">On
this debate, I have to say that my greatest anxiety is that it can
delude us into thinking that the Church of England is where it all is.
What does it mean to be a Methodist? It is often thought that John
Wesley, when he started off, was a pietistic preacher, full of
spiritual energy and indefatigable zeal. However, perhaps less is known
about the fact that intrinsic to his ministry from the beginning were
actions of social commitment that were totally convincing. He had a
kind of mini health service, free at the point of need, which he ran
from the place in City Road where I now work. He had a ministry to
people on death row in Newgate Prison, a microfinance project with a
commitment to helping the poor with their financial needs, and a ragged
school, which attracted boys and girls from the Moorfield slums,
clothing and feeding them if necessary. I can say only that the vital
religion of a Methodist like John Wesley is coupled inevitably with a
commitment to the transformation of society, so we do not have to think
of it as an add-on at all. We think that we are not doing our job if we
are not doing such things, and that is the end of the
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:10:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112188000350" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000350">I have been the
superintendent of the West London Mission for a number of years and was
the boss of the late Lord Soper of Kingsway—although if anybody
says that they were his boss, they need their head read—who
initiated extraordinary work across the capital city that still exists
to a large extent. That included a bail hostel with a day centre for
over 25 year-olds—it is easy to get money for the
needs of children and young people, but getting money for the needs of
older homeless people is immensely difficult. There was total
commitment, and it was open 365 days a year. He also
initiated work with young offenders, a walk-in centre for people with
addictions or substance abuse of one kind or another, which is
multifaceted and free, again, for all who cross the threshold. That was
a remarkable piece of work, with 80 employees and hundreds of
volunteers who helped to keep it running. That, therefore, is of the
essence; I have often said from the pulpit, “What’s the
point of you having religion if you don’t bring a smile to
someone’s face and make their lives a little easier?”.
There does not seem to be much point
otherwise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:11:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000351" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000351">I
want simply to draw the circle outwards a little—no, I do not
want even to do that. I do not like the compass having its fixed point
in the Church of England, with ever larger circles drawn outside it. We
are partners in this, and this whole thing must be seen in that sense.
Why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:11:44"></hs_TimeCode> finish
there? Why think that that is the range we are thinking of? My
colleague, a very redoubtable Yorkshirewoman, is at this very minute
standing up—if the programme that I have here is running to
plan—to introduce someone from the Amida London Buddhist Centre.
Ten minutes ago she introduced Mohammed Kozbar from the Finsbury Park
Mosque as part of Inter Faith Week. Our work with the faiths is
considerable.</hs_para>

Wesley’s sermon on bigotry said that if someone else is doing a
good piece of work, and it is recognised as being good, those of us who
are Christian have no right to think that we cannot collaborate with
them. You hold hands together and do the good, and that is 
<?notus-xml column=1128?>the end of it. The work in the field of interfaith work has to be
recognised at this point; there is so much of it around. I will give
some figures: there are 289 social projects run by Islington
faith-based organisations—that is 289 in one London borough.
There are 536 volunteers, 68 full-time staff and 52 part-time staff.
Some 74% of faith-based organisations work in partnerships across
faiths and within faiths, and 65% are done in collaboration with people
of good will who have no faith at all. At the end of the day, social
need is social need, and you work together. If people who have faith
feel that that is what motivates them, that is fine—but you do
it with everybody else. Phrases such as the “unique
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:14:00"></hs_TimeCode>” of
the Church of England, and self-aggrandising phrases like that, set my
teeth on edge when I read this particular
report<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:13:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000353" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000353">I
go back to Islington, as all good people do in the
end<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:13:55"></hs_TimeCode>. Of the
social projects run by faith-based organisations in Islington, 32 are
in the area of education, 20 in housing and homelessness, 25 in art and
music, 19 to do with drug abuse, 20 in the field of health, 14 in the
area of business and
enterprise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:14:12"></hs_TimeCode>, and
13 in the area of employment. That is absolutely fantastic. Just two
days ago, in the Cholmondeley Room—I hope one day that someone
will tell me why it is pronounced “Chumley”; I am sure
that there is a reason—we had a reception for Action for
Children, which is a charity that I have supported all my life. It used
to be the National Children’s Home, a good Methodist charity.
There were 92 volunteers receiving their annual Stephenson awards. As
was said in one of the speeches, the monetary value of the voluntary
work being done there amounts to £500,000. It would cost the
organisation that amount to buy in those
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:15:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000354" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000354">We
recognise all the good that is done and have no reason to boast about
it, because if we were not doing it we would not be the people of faith
that we claim to be. There is no need to make a song and dance about
it; it is the essence of our very being that we translate what we
believe into action of the kinds that we have been talking
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:15:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000355" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000355">I
am a little bit dubious, too, about the proposals and recommendations
that have been made in the ResPublica document. Who wants an office in
the Cabinet Office to centre all of this stuff? The Department for

accomplished a great deal in bringing faith groups together as one
means of helping to build an integrated
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:15:45"></hs_TimeCode> in
Britain. In 2008 the Department for Communities and Local Government
produced a report called <I>Face to Face, Side by Side</I>, offering a
framework for partnership in our multifaith society. Those are the
notes that we need to hear because, at the end of the day, people of
good will, whether of faith or not, and those of us who are of faith,
know that we must make allegiances and common cause against deprivation
and need of every

offer these remarks not to sink anybody’s ship or rattle
anybody’s skeleton cupboard but rather to honour the Church of

plead with its representatives to see, in an instinctual way, the
existence of others out there not as people for whom

their family. Never would they have imagined the nightmare that was to
engulf my family—my son Stephen’s life was taken so
brutally and so senselessly by racists—and the 20-year battle
for justice which followed. The experience has taught me that power is
often resistant to the claims of justice and basic human dignity. Those
who demand these rights must be prepared to fight every single day for
them, as they will come up against an establishment more interested in
maintaining the status quo than it is in helping to foster a society
where everyone has an equal claim to justice, no matter who they are or
what they look like. I have to

Closer to home, we have welcomed a new Chief Rabbi to succeed the noble
Lord, Lord Sacks, who has done so much to inspire our diverse nation to
live face to face and side by side. Just recently, the most reverend
Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury has set a fresh tone for my own

of the biggest changes we have seen in English Christianity is that it

many, although not all, of these game changers are rooted in diaspora
communities,

report, funded by an Anglican charity, analyses how the Anglican Church
could restructure its social action work by creating social action
teams in each diocese and having a social action unit in Church House.
It is very laudable but the report’s gem is the tension at its
heart, which has been outlined by other noble Lords. It emphasises
repeatedly the uniqueness of the Anglican Church in terms of buildings,
geographical spread of staff and connection to the state. The most
reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury said at the launch of a
cross-denominational social action initiative, HOPE 2014, that he
imagined looking back at 2013 and seeing that, “the churches put
aside their differences and they chose to pray and work
together”.
Again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:34:31"></hs_TimeCode> and again,
the initiatives relied on in the report are those of the churches
working together. HOPE 2014 connects with more than 25,000 churches in
the country. Sometimes it will be the Anglican priest who is the
facilitator, but the Rutland Foodbank, of which I am patron, is run by
churches together, and the local council first approached the Baptists.
Sometimes the Anglican church is the best building but often it is not
and purpose-built worship centres, such as the Birmingham Christian
Centre, an Elim Pentecostal church, might be
best.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000376" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000376">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:31:48"></hs_TimeCode>,

consultancy working in London and the north-west, and given businesses
from the Isle of Wight their first space on the mainland, alongside 10
others creating jobs and apprenticeships locally. It will soon open its

social services outside of the state. The report, due to this tension,
slips

very enthusiastic young man with horn-rimmed glasses 
<?notus-xml column=1135?>and wild hair talking to us about something called the Beveridge report.
I recall him telling us that, when it was implemented, the world, and
particularly this country, would be a better place, that a new era
would dawn and that everything would be lovely. There was no
examination on the subject, so I apologise to your Lordships for not

six years after that, I was walking with my father one evening in the
fields near our house and he said to me, “I joined the Labour

all those objectives have been achieved”. I see the contented
smiles on the Front Bench opposite, so I regret to say that he then

difficult to unthread the tangled collection of ideas raised during
this short debate and in the report. The report I welcome warmly,
because it has triggered this very badly needed discussion. It has some
shortcomings. If I can be really petulant and elderly, I would say that
the principal ones are the very small type, the use of white print on
blue and the use of semi-colons instead of full stops practically
throughout, which means that you never have a capital letter to go back
to when you are sitting in an ill-lit passenger seat in a car trying to
read the thing going up the M4. On a purely practical point, I ask

its research criteria are excellent. The research base for the report
is pretty narrow. Nineteen parishes out of 43 dioceses do not amount to
a great deal. It is not enough to come to conclusions on, but it is
plenty to start the discussion. I think that we can all endorse, and
everybody has endorsed, the extraordinary variety of the existing
interventions of the Anglican community into social efforts to improve

noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Burry Port, hit the nail on its head when
he pointed out that, actually, the Church of England is not the only
church. That chimes in with one paragraph on page 8 of the report, on
the social and spiritual mission of the church, where it was thought
necessary to start with a little apologia about the necessity of the
church taking social action at all. That rather took my breath away,
because surely the duty of the church is not to run churches like a
chain of theatres around the country trying to fill the house with
suitable programmes; it is to be the body of Christ in the community.
You cannot be the whole body of Christ if you are only one church when
there are many churches. We must have a broad co-operation in
this.</hs_para>

puts the Church of England at centre field in this country is the
existence of its organisation and its resources in the form of
buildings. The report refers to the church in many communities being
the only landmark at the moment. It seems to say that there were other 
<?notus-xml column=1136?>landmarks—there were pubs and schools, which were of course the
social landmarks. More and more villages and towns have lost most of
their pubs and schools, and some have lost all of them. The church is
the last visible central link; its spire puts it ahead of the chapel,
which does not make it any better than the chapel, just more visible.
It is also apt to be bigger and can house more people. However, the
church is ultimately conservative with a small c, which means that it
is full of pews. If churches are to diversify their activities, they
need to make a clean sweep. I think I see agonised expressions on the
faces of the right reverend Prelates to my left because if there is
anything more divisive and difficult to do to a medieval church than
remove the pews, I do not know what it is. But the fact is that it is
done very successfully. The church ought to publish a brochure showing
that, extolling the fact that the atmosphere of the place can still be
spiritual, and explaining that far more members of the community can
make use of the church. Incidentally, members of the existing
congregation, which may possibly grow, will also find that they are
able to do new and inventive things. That is another spin-off of the

Lady Berridge, who made a very good speech, I attended a meeting
recently in the Jerusalem Chamber, where the final version of the
authorised version of the bible was agreed, to hear Professor Linda
Woodhead of Lancaster University give a PowerPoint presentation. She
gave a most illuminating account of the position, outlook and
membership of the Church of England. I strongly recommend that account
to my episcopal friends and ask them to distribute it as it was a
suitable forerunner to the great declamation by George Carey in
Shropshire, which nobody has yet had the bad manners to mention, which
warned of the end of the church unless something changed. We now have
to look at whether what is being proposed is the right change. A good
deal of reservation has been expressed about that, not merely because
it puts everything in the hands of one church but because of its rather
obscurely articulated union with government. The union of government
and church is a very dangerous institution, indeed. If the church is
seen to co-operate with the Government, de facto it is not co-operating
with the Opposition and it is likely to get all the flak that the
Government get for things that go wrong which are not the fault of
either of
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:47:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000395" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000395">I
turn to the practical difficulties of what is proposed. The subject of
how the two organisations can co-operate and make use of their
respective resources is a very fruitful one, and the Cabinet Office is
possibly the right body to engage in it. However, what really matters
is what happens at the bottom end in the parish. Parishes vary very
much, as do churches. I lead a fragmented life which means that I
worship in three churches regularly and in a fourth from time to time.
One of the churches, in which I was for some years a licensed lay
minister, and in which I now have the right reverend Prelate the Bishop
of Oxford’s permission to serve, is a tiny chamber about four
times the size of the
Bishops<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T15:34:58"></hs_TimeCode>’
Bar. It has a thriving life but no room to expand. Apart from arousing
great hostility, taking the pews out would not increase the
congregation. I also worship fairly regularly in a church in south
London, which I suppose is rather bigger than the 
<?notus-xml column=1137?>Peers’ Guest Room. I fear that this speech is going to read very
badly in <I>Hansard</I>. That church’s congregation is rather
more black and ethnic minority in origin than it is white. It is a very
harmonious congregation. Then we go to a very big church in west
London, which is humming with activity and full of people, and which
has a completely different ability to help. We do not want to think
that one size fits all but we want to realise that it is not only the
Anglican parishes that are there when there are all the denominations
which your Lordships have just heard recapitulated. I will not run

covered up and forgotten about.</hs_para>

and providing new opportunities, underpinned by clear priorities and
principles. With innovations and developments in technology, we can
deliver services in a much more individual way, tailored to
people’s specific needs rather than a one-size-fits-all

1979—or was it early 1980? I can assure noble Lords that I was a
very young man then and my hair was a bright red colour; things have
changed a bit since then. Until his retirement in April this year,
Canon Graham Shaw was a central part of the community in Walworth for
34 years. My two brothers and my sister, along with many young people
in the area, attended the Crossed Swords Youth Centre that he founded
in the basement of the church.</hs_para>

the City initiative, following the publication of that report in autumn
1985, Canon Shaw set up a mental health drop-in centre at St
Paul’s Church. He did that because of his experience and work in
the parish and the problems, stresses and strains that he saw every
day. People with long-term mental health problems are one of the most
excluded groups in society, and social exclusion and discrimination in
turn sustains poor mental health. He understood that the role of a good
mental health service was to ensure social inclusion. For many of the
people who used the service, it represented their first step towards
recovery, helping them to regain a sense of belonging to a community
and to gain stability, safety and acceptance. For some people, this can
then lead to an emerging sense of possibility about their future, hope
and personal confidence in their ability to take the next step on the
road to recovery.</hs_para>

enlightened as it is today, with talk of gay plagues and other equally
ill informed opinions. In each of those three examples, the church
never sought to become, replicate or replace the services provided by
the NHS or the local authority. However, what it did do in each case
was provide essential, cost-effective support for the community,
without which there would have been further cost to individuals and to
the community, more prejudice, and more costs and additional problems

by talking on behalf of the Government but by being a little personal.
I grew up in the middle of the Church of England and part of my mixed
response to this report comes from my personal experience. My mother
was part of that great volunteer army of middle-class women who held
civil society together. They had enormous energy, they were not allowed
to have jobs and they threw themselves into working to support their
locality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:03:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to when I was a boy had pews which, if I remember correctly, were
allocated in a sort of hierarchical fashion. The bank manager’s
pew—my father was the local bank manager in this small
town—was third from the front on the right. I was slightly
relieved when I went back into that church in
north Northamptonshire with my sisters a few years ago and discovered
that they had removed all the pews and put in a really good new floor.
It is now very much a social and community centre. Once one got over
the shock of seeing this medieval church with its very beautiful floor,
one realised that it was real progress.</hs_para>

Church of England was a little too close to the idea that it was there
to enforce morality and social order, and was not enough about the
social message. It is a problem that the Roman Catholic Church has
retained for a rather longer time than the Church of England. I partly
escaped by becoming a chorister at Westminster Abbey where I therefore
had to listen to two sermons every Sunday. Since one of our canons held
very firmly to the view that the church had a clear social message,
which is probably why he never became a bishop, I certainly picked up
the idea that the church had a strong social mission. I married into a
nonconformist family. Indeed, the Wyke Gospel Temperance Mission tea
urn still has a place in our dining room. Like many other things in our
cities, the mission was demolished 30 or 40 years ago, as most of the
Wyke community was demolished. That is part of why our communities have
been getting weaker. Much of the physical environment which held things
together has gone, and great new estates have been put in

evangelising the working class and providing working class communities

Part of the historical tragedy of the Church of England has been the
split of Methodism, which I firmly hope will be resolved by
reunification of the churches in the not too distant future. I live in
the village of Saltaire. At one point it was suggested that it might be
demolished because it had lots of old-fashioned terraced houses and was
dominated by a Congregational church—one of only two churches in
England that I know has a full peal of bells. The Congregationalist
mill owner who built the entire village clearly had some tendencies
towards respectability, which meant Anglicanism. The full peal of bells

of us who have lived through the past 60 to 70 years are

As the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, remarked, market towns retain the
built environment and the sense of tradition and community which in
some of our big cities we sadly have entirely lost. The decline of
communities was also due partly to cars, TV and middle-class housing
developments—those dreadful suburban places without any
centre—as well as children moving away to college, and the
internet. Let us face it, the downside of the liberation of women has
been the loss of that great volunteer army who used to hold local

what is the role of the church in this? I strongly agree with the noble
Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, that the church should not be too close
to the state. The church should be in healthy and dynamic tension with
the state. We have an established church. It is not a state church. It
is a church that I am happy to say now works very closely with other
churches and across faiths. It has, as the Church of England rightly
says, physical bases in the sense of churches within most of our local

I shall not rehearse the points made by noble Lords, but will take
firmly to heart a point that many made: the Church of England is but
one player on this field. We heard so powerfully about the Methodist
tradition of Lord Soper and John Wesley. It is impossible to be the
Bishop of Leicester without being only too aware of the enormous
variety of faiths and the enormous proportion of the population of the
city who on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday are in places of worship and

reverend Prelate the Bishop of Carlisle for opening our eyes to what is
now possible in Rose Castle. Some of us looked with envy on successive
Bishops of Carlisle for living there, but those days are now over and
the Church of England is putting not only that building but so many of
its buildings to new uses in practical ways for the contemporary needs
of our contemporary society. That is why the noble Lord, Lord Elton,
will be pleased to know that there is much more support from here for
the removal of the pews than he might suspect. I invite the churches in

take note of what has been raised—as, indeed, will colleagues in
ResPublica and elsewhere, who will continue to stimulate and challenge
us on these matters. It is now some 43 years, I think, since I was a
civil servant in Whitehall, working as a Second Secretary in the
Foreign Office. I used to walk up Whitehall to Trafalgar Square and St
Martin in the Fields. The experience of seeing one church attending to
the needs of the homeless and destitute while also ministering to the
occupants of Buckingham Palace, engaging in the campaign for the ending
of apartheid in South Africa and involving itself heavily in the Covent
Garden community projects and a whole range of other things inspired me
to think that this was a way of life that really could transform life
at the heart of one of the world’s great cities, and set me on
the path to ordination. That vision has shaped so much of my work and
is why I care passionately about the matters we have raised today. I am

committee decided to undertake this important inquiry was that research
and innovation is at the heart of what Europe requires to drive
economic growth. It is well recognised that research and innovation is
at the heart of any successful, vibrant economy. The World Economic
Forum recently suggested that we should move away from talking about
developed and developing economies and talk instead about
innovation-rich and innovation-poor economies. In that context, there
has been some concern that, in the economic crisis that continues to
face many parts of the European Union and many member states, there
might be a temptation for the Commission to decide that a clear and
determined focus on funding research and innovation should be
sacrificed to use those funds for other purposes. We wanted to assure
ourselves that that would not be the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:30:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000455" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000455">As
part of our inquiry, we were reminded that the European Union’s
principal competitors are deeply committed to research and innovation.
One such example is China—an important competitor, which, by
2015, has determined that 2.2% of its GDP will be focused on research
and innovation expenditure, some €180 billion a year.
The agreed 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework commitment for
research and innovation expenditure under the Horizon 2020 programme of
the European Union is some €70 billion. We need to put in
context the fact that our competitors have recognised and are
determined to drive forward innovation in their own
economies. Of course, that can be done in part at European level, but
it needs also to remain a deeply committed area of activity for each
member state as part of the use and setting of its own
budgets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:32:02"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:31:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000456" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000456">I
mentioned a concern about the drift in describing certain programmes
and projects as relating to research and innovation as their primary
purpose in the hope that they might avail themselves of funding from
the Horizon 2020 envelope—the €70 billion currently
agreed as part of the proposed budget. Here we need to be clear that
there are mechanisms in place, as the new budget goes forward, to
secure true research and innovation focus for funding that is
attributed to research and innovation activity. In 2009, a declaration
made by the Commission, member states, stakeholders and others in the
research and innovation community—the Lund
declaration—made it clear that, in going forward in the European
Union, the focus in research and innovation funding should be to meet
the grand challenges facing member states. The big issues such as
health, well-being, and so on, should be addressed by big programmes of
imaginative research and innovation rather than by defining rigid
themes of activity that are somewhat ossified before the funding
becomes available and prevent the true purpose of
innovation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:33:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

also recognised as a set of principles on which to take forward
research and innovation funding in the European Union that the prime,
underlying principle on which funds are made available across Europe
for competing projects is one of supporting excellence and the highest
quality, not compromising those funds in any way for other purposes or
any form of political expediency. In that context, your
Lordships’ committee came to the clear conclusion that, despite
the economic crisis, the European Union should redouble its efforts on
research and innovation expenditure. Although the funds finally agreed
in the current budget round were not as high as one might have hoped,
they are an increase on the funding available for research and
innovation in the previous budget, and that should be
welcomed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:34:33"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:34:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000458" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000458">In
terms of practical issues, the first is participation. Here I look much
more at the position of participants from the United Kingdom wishing to
avail themselves of the important funds available in the Union
for research and innovation funding. Our higher education
institutions and many of our larger commercial enterprises are well
organised and able to develop the partnerships and create proposals
that are highly attractive in order to enjoy substantial European
funding. In particular, our universities have become adept at
developing relationships across Europe to make their proposals of
relevance not only to academic communities and society more broadly in
the United Kingdom but applicable, and therefore of interest, to
similar academic entities and society more broadly among European
member
states<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:35:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of small and medium-sized enterprises, some 98% of companies in our
country, have found it less easy to interact and develop the successful
pan-European alliances necessary to attract substantial research and
innovation funding. Yet when we look at the issue in economic terms,
there is no doubt that the success of these SMEs is going to be vital
to drive economic growth across Europe and help achieve the kind of
increase in employment that we all expect these types of businesses to
deliver for the broader
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:36:17"></hs_TimeCode>. In this
regard, I ask the Minister where Her Majesty’s Government are on
ensuring that the mechanisms available within our own support
structures for businesses in terms of their application for European
funding currently stand. Contact points within the structure of the
technology strategy boards seem an appropriate opportunity for a
greater focus on helping small and medium-sized enterprises interact
more successfully in the future. This can be done first by influencing
the calls for proposals that are put out under the banner of research
and innovation funding in the European Union—the Horizon 2020
programme; by ensuring that our SMEs are better able to develop
European alliances to make their funding proposals attractive as
pan-European projects; and by ensuring that they are able to deliver
those applications and, if those applications are successful,
programmes that have meaningful impact for the European economies. I
wonder whether the Minister can comment further on where Her
Majesty’s Government are with regard to developing those support
structures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:37:28"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:37:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000460" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000460">The
second practical issue is the basis for the allocation of these funds.
We have heard that although the budget 
<?notus-xml column=1150?>will be substantial—some €70 billion over this financial
framework—those funds still represent only a fraction of the
global expenditure on research and innovation available among our
principal competitors. It is therefore essential that a single
principle remains at the heart of the allocation of these
funds—that is, allocation based on the excellence and quality of
the proposals and independent peer review, with no other influence on
how those funds are allocated. It is that basis of allocation which has
ensured that our own universities and other participants from the
United Kingdom have done so well in this funding, and it is the basis
on which we can be certain that much of what has been done in previous
programmes of research and innovation expenditure in Europe continues
to develop strong outputs for the benefit of all citizens across
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:38:38"></hs_TimeCode>. It was
reassuring to learn that the Commission now has appointed a chief
scientific adviser with a scientific advisory council. Can the Minister
confirm that the Government continue to emphasise among their European
partners in the Council of Ministers and in their discussions with the
Commission the vital importance of the transparent, objective
allocation of funds based on the excellence and quality of
applications? They should not stray into using these funds potentially
to build capacity in parts of Europe where the science base is not
currently strong, which is an important objective that should be
achieved through regional development funds, rather than this funding
for research and
innovation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:39:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

disturbing statistics about the time to grant. This is the time it
takes from the end of a call for proposals to grants being made. It
averages some 340 days. We found this unbelievable. In the fast-moving
area of innovation and research where discoveries are being made every
day, a proposal to seek funding for a particular project can remain
fresh only for a certain period of time, after which by definition
something else must be discovered and that should take precedence. If
the bureaucratic process actually to get the funds out is taking so
long, that can be a major disincentive to smaller organisations,
particularly the SMEs, and to university departments where committing
funds to keep staff in place to be able to work on an ultimate research
project can be exceedingly difficult. I would be grateful if the
Minister could confirm that Her Majesty’s Government will
continue to push for a reduction in the red tape. Of course there must
be processes in place securely to protect the funding, but we must make
sure that they are not so bureaucratic that in the end the purpose of
the exercise, which is innovation, is inadvertently
destroyed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:40:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

important ongoing need to continue to review the success with which

Haskel (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, at the recent Lord Mayor’s
banquet, the Prime Minister said that we were in a global race, and I
am sure that he meant a race to the top. Most of us agree that we
cannot leave our success or failure to chance or to simple market
forces. We need a strategy, one to get us to the top and, of course, a
central part of that strategy is research and innovation.</hs_para>

agrees with that and supports this work, as it has done for many years,
through the framework programme currently in its seventh phase which
finishes at the end of this year. From 2014 we will have Horizon 2020,
which will support research and innovation. The framework
has been especially important to us. As the noble Lord, Lord Kakkar,
has just told us, our higher education institutions are among the top
participating institutions, and this participation has provided an
additional 15% on top of the UK Government’s own budget. It is
growing and it compensates in cash terms for the freeze in our domestic
science budget.</hs_para>

successful participation of our higher education institutions in the
framework is not reflected in the participation of our private
commercial businesses. They comprise only a quarter of the total number
of UK participants, and there are very few small and medium-sized
enterprises among them. So the purpose of our inquiry was to see how
this could be improved: how small private businesses could achieve the
same high participation rate as our higher education institutions. The
inquiry is seeking to identify the right structures for us to achieve
this increased participation.</hs_para>

response from the Government to our report is encouraging. They agree
that the participation of companies and small to medium-sized
enterprises in Horizon 2020 has to be supported, facilitated and
encouraged by a greater presence in Brussels for those organisations
that support them and help them to participate, such as the Technology
Strategy Board, the national contact points, trade
organisations and chambers of commerce. Many are already represented
there, which makes consultation and information transfer
with the participating companies shorter, simpler and
quicker.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000470" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000470">That
is especially important because many small enterprises look to this EU
money to help compensate for the failures in bank lending. I agree with
the 
<?notus-xml column=1152?>Government’s observation that Horizon 2020 needs a
“pro-innovation regulatory framework”—indeed, many
of our recommendations are directed towards that end. However, my one
request is that innovation should be regarded in the broadest possible
terms: not just new products and services through science and
technology but all the other aspects of innovation that are important
to business and in which it invests. These include writing new
software, modernising and speeding up the supply chain, design,
branding, and developing new business processes and new ways of serving
customers.

suggest to the Minister that perhaps one reason why private industry,
particularly SMEs, participates far less than higher education
institutes in the framework is that, to them, research and innovation
is far wider than science and technology. If the Government want
business to participate more in Horizon 2020, they must seek to broaden
the interpretation of innovation. If the Minister will not take it from
me, he may be persuaded by the recent McKinsey report which
confirms
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000471" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000471">This
does not, of course, detract from the importance of science—it
is in addition to it. Indeed, I had the opportunity to briefly discuss
our report with the noble Lord, Lord Rees. He is sorry that he is
unable to speak in this debate, but he was disappointed that the
European Research Council did not feature in our report. He considers
that the European Research Council is probably the most cost-effective
EU institution supporting research and innovation. Certainly, it mainly
supports academic research in universities, but business eventually
benefits from that. It has been going for six years and now has a
budget of €2 billion. He wanted us to be aware of the excellence
of its work and is anxious for us to benefit from it. He said it is as
excellent as our own research
councils.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000472" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000472">I
note in the Government’s response that they plan to create much
greater awareness of Horizon 2020 through a range of events at all
levels. We all say amen to that. However, if you are trying to capture
the interest and attention of companies, you must include innovation in
the less tangible aspects of their
businesses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000473" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000473">I
said at the start that we are in a global race and Horizon 2020 has to
be part of our strategy to get to the top. That strategy must include
all areas covered by the Commission. In our report, we again spoke of
our concern about the quality of impact assessments. All parts of our
Government and all parts of the Commission rely on these for making
informed decisions. So it is essential that these impact assessments
should indicate how the issue being assessed impacts on this
strategy—how it contributes to our getting to the top. This must
be applied consistently across all policy areas. It should also be part
of the assessment of costs and benefits. I understand that the
Commission is reviewing how to quantify these benefits in an impact
assessment. Is there any news on this work? It is important to us.
Members of the European Parliament must be taking this seriously
because they have set up their own impact assessment unit. We, too,
should be making use of this

have a couple of other points to make. In our paper we speak of public
procurement as a means of encouraging demand-side innovation, to use
the 
<?notus-xml column=1153?>economists’ jargon. Thanks to the imaginative schemes run by the
Technology Strategy Board here in Britain, we have developed a fair way
of encouraging companies, large and small, to participate in this. It
includes interim grants for small and medium-sized companies. Most
small and medium-sized companies are aware of these schemes and many
participate. The Commission has its own schemes, which are less
successful and more bureaucratic. Can we not try to persuade the
Commission to use our schemes, on the simple grounds that they are more
effective and, combined, would be more
beneficial?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000475" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000475">Whenever
research and innovation are discussed, intellectual property rights are
always a concern. The problem for smaller companies is that protecting
their intellectual property rights slows down outcomes: it delays the
practical and actual introduction of their innovative services or
products. The world of business moves very fast, as the noble Lord,
Lord Kakkar, told us. In a perfect world, these companies would protect
their intellectual property before it is made public. It is for this
reason that our report calls for a more cautious approach to open
access, which the Government reject. I hope the Minister understands
that in doing so they are slowing down the rate at which innovative
products and services are introduced by some firms in this
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000476" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000476">In

pick up a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, figures that I
have seen recently about what is called, in the jargon of the business
department, BERD—business enterprise research and
development—show that it is a smaller proportion of the total

rapidly, but BERD has continued to grow in recent years. This should
not be ignored. Indeed, in 2011 it increased in real terms by 6%. As
that normally happens only during periods of economic growth, this is
quite encouraging and we should not be too pessimistic about
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000479" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000479">When I put

It led me to compare the way in which this is done in the Community

obviously common ground. The procedures for assessing the impact of any
proposal for research have developed in recent years often in different
ways and at different paces, but the purpose of impact assessments has
become increasingly clear both to EU institutions and UK bodies such as
universities and the research councils. Simply stated, it is this: they
are to help those whose task it is to decide how to spend research and
innovation money to make choices that will give the best value for

immediately one comes to a question: what is meant by value? At this
point, I should perhaps state my interest. I attended a recent seminar
held by the Foundation for Science and Technology, of which I was
chairman for nine years and am now the president. The subject of the
seminar was:</hs_para>
<hs_quote UID="13112188000641" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000641">“Maximising the

thought that this might throw some light on the comparison between this
country and the EU. Indeed, the words might have been paraphrased as
“the effectiveness of research and innovation proposals”,
which appears in the title of this report, but that case relates to the
European
activities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:57:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13112188000483" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000483">Whether
it is value that you are talking about or effectiveness, I am inclined
to believe that they aim at the same thing. Here, the noble Lord, Lord
Kakkar, gave us an interesting point on what he thought might be part
of value or effectiveness. That was echoed by one of the speakers in
our seminar, who asked the question, “What is the
value?”. He answered it by asking more questions: “Is it
employment, or productivity, or human capital and skills, or human
contentment and health—or is it all these
things<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:57:48"></hs_TimeCode>?”.
Some of the participants in the discussion started at the other end and
suggested that the purpose of research is the advancement of knowledge
and understanding, and that this should in turn lead to the innovation
which we all
seek<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:58:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000484" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000484">One
feature of our discussion on that occasion was that, although the UK
stands very high in the world rankings for research or universities or
whatever it is—I shall cite in a moment some figures on that
which we were given—when it comes to innovation, we are not so
successful, as the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, indicated. I shall come to
one or two of the
reasons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:58:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:58:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000485" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000485">However,
I turn first to universities. Three or four of our top universities
regularly figure in the top 10 of virtually every world ranking of
universities. When one looks at a longer list of, let us say, the top
50 universities, one sees that there are very few, if any,
in other parts of the European Union. In Europe, we absolutely dominate
the university field. It has been suggested to me that this may be
because far less research is done in EU universities than is done in
universities this country and, therefore, they do not 
<?notus-xml column=1155?>rank as high. I can understand that but it is interesting to note that
almost none of them is in the top 50. That may to some extent colour
the attitude of some of our partners in the European
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T16:59:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000486" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0002.htm#13112188000486">Turning
to research, the UK has 1% of the world population and produces nearly
8% of research papers, almost 12% of world citations and 14.5% of the
world’s most highly cited papers. This is a remarkable record of
which this country can be very proud. However, as I said a few moments
ago, we are not as good at innovating—not nearly as good as this
volume and quality of research would suggest that we ought to be. We
discussed the trends that may be giving rise to this. The noble Lords,
Lord Haskel and Lord Kakkar, have already mentioned one or two of them,
but it comes down to knowledge transfer—that is the key
phrase—and the difficulty of transferring knowledge from the
research field to the industrial field. The noble Lord, Lord Haskel,
was absolutely right to put his finger—as does the
report—on the fact that this is even more difficult as regards
SMEs. Why should this be? Several reasons have been given. One is the
inherent institutional, cultural and financial barriers between
universities and business. Another is the great reluctance of
businesses in this country, but perhaps also in Europe, to take risks
and to realise that introducing the products of new research does
involve taking risks. There is a reluctance to do that. I was told that
if a firm announces that it is going to undertake a major research
programme, its shares immediately fall on the market, whereas one might
think that this would be a plus. However, in the eyes of the market it
is not; it is a
minus<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:02:08"></hs_TimeCode>. The other
tendency, of which we are all very well aware, is that of thinking

come to my main point. Many of the speakers at the seminar emphasised
the huge importance of impact assessments. These have grown over the
years in many different ways. In this country it is virtually universal
practice to require researchers to make the best assessment they can of
the impact which they believe their research could have. The
Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research at Brunel University said that in the
experience of that university the very process of having to support a
research application for funding with a carefully composed impact
assessment was making applicants look at how their research might be
transferred to other fields. He went

something like the Haldane principle operating within the European

Brooke of Alverthorpe (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am also a member
of Sub-Committee B so I declare an interest there. I join the noble
Lord, Lord Kakkar, in expressing our gratitude to the noble Baroness,
Lady O’Cathain, for leading us through this exercise, which was
not easy. I express our grateful thanks, too, to our clerk, Nicole
Mason, and our policy analyst, Paul Dowling. Additionally, I express my
gratitude to the Minister, David Willetts, since I have taken evidence
from a number of Ministers over the years and I think that we found his
approach very refreshing. He was open in endeavouring to respond to the
points that we  
<?notus-xml column=1157?>put to him, and it is worth putting on record that he seems to be doing
his best there. However, he is not doing it with the easiest of
hands.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112188000493" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000493">I say
that in the light of having recently been in Brussels. I had not been
there for quite some time and those I met ranged from representatives
of the Parliament through to the Council. It did not surprise me that
we had not had a speedy response to our document because the people I
was meeting seemed to be saying, “Well, we want you to stay in
Europe and we’re keen to have you there, but if you don’t
want to stay then you will go”. This was a new response,
different from any that I had heard before.</hs_para>

there were some feelings that we have been withdrawing in a number of
areas. The following statistic links indirectly to this question: the
UK is entitled to 12% of the officials in the European Union but we are
now down to only 4.5% of the people working in Brussels and in related
organisations of the EU. If we are trying to get business in there,
bidding for research and so on, it helps if we have officials working
within the EU and particularly working in Brussels. That was given to
us in evidence by some people who have made very successful
applications in the past for money. We heard from a representative from
Cambridge who has now moved to Brussels and says that having a base
there has made a world of difference to what they could get when
bidding compared with what was happening to them previously. I say to
the Minister that, in the broadest sense, we need to have a look at
what is happening with our representation there at official level. What
chance do our people stand when going in from a distance, or indeed on
the spot, if they do not have British officials who know the ropes, so
to speak, and can guide them through the labyrinth that has evolved
when it comes to submitting bids?</hs_para>

others have said, many witnesses have explained that R&amp;I is
increasingly a global undertaking. While we might have some misgivings
about some of the operations of the EU, its performance generally in
this area has been identified by most of the people who gave evidence
to us as being a worthwhile venture, to be supported and indeed
expanded—subject, of course, to trying to ensure that we are
getting value for money and that the infrastructure through which
people have to apply for the money operates properly and is properly
accountable. It is therefore good to see that the EU R&amp;I budget for
Horizon 2020 was agreed and publicly announced this week, at €79
billion. This is one of the areas where our committee can claim some
success: we said in one of our recommendations, after the Council
meeting in February, that the figure of €70 billion that was on
offer was not enough and we thought it should be more. The good news
was announced yesterday that it has gone up to €79 billion. We
were one of the drops of water that went on to the pebble that has made
the change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000496" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000496">I

the end of June to our report that was written in April, they seemed to

complacency—a lack of ambition on our part in trying to maximise
the returns that we could get for our people then to compete for
research and innovation. I am wondering where the Government stood in
that negotiation, and I would like to know if today they could give us
some insight into how the figure moved up by nearly €10
billion—a phenomenal increase, really, given the background to
the budget negotiations. I would welcome some insight there. I suspect

is important for government and for all of us to take note of what is

relationship that we have with some of our representatives there and
that we spend more time with our MEPs. That is a side political issue

to look at how some of the other countries have responded immediately
to the announcement about the budget decision having been reached. I

get at least €1 billion for Ireland. It is a far bigger amount
than technically they are entitled to but that is the ambition that
they have publicly announced. A number of other countries have already
said what they plan to do. We have been waiting for quite some time in
working with these processes, so can the Minister give us an indication
of our ambition in the claims we will be making? How much money do we
anticipate we will be trying to get back in terms of research and
innovation? We do not have any clarity on this, whereas others have.
Similarly, in looking at the shift in the budget figure, our approach
may be somewhat complacent and not as ambitious as some of the other
countries, which will be in there pitching very vigorously indeed to

extraordinarily well, in relative terms, in finding funding for our
universities and our higher educational research areas, and long may

research compared with that spent on research in

our competitors devote to industry and manufacturing has been going up.
However, the UK is even worse than it was some years ago in the
division between the money going into research for academia and that
going into industry. This is a cause of concern for all of us. If the
Government are serious about trying to effect a shift in the basis of

was the failure to make contacts with SMEs. In turn, that led some of

submitting applications for research and improving their performance.
The Government have to spend more time looking at the contact points. I
think that the Minister, the right honourable David Willetts, was not

potential. That has already been trailed to some extent by the
connection between Sainsbury’s and the European innovation

appropriate for pure research to be done. To my mind, that is a
necessary part of the message that we are sending out. The need to
address health issues is clearly one that we ought to focus on. I cite,
for example, motor neurone disease, which as yet has no cure and which
widely concerns the medical profession—and not only in our own
country. We could, for example, hope that the European Union will watch
with great interest the convention that is taking place in Milan in
December for motor neurone neurologists from across the world. I

A number of other countries have participated in programmes

Warwick of Undercliffe (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to
the noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, for securing this timely debate and

that he makes to us in his new role as an ambassador for healthcare and

are others to congratulate as well, notably the Minister, Universities
UK and the UK Higher Education International Unit, as well as other
bodies which have been involved in the long-running lobbying campaign
to secure a good outcome for research, innovation and higher education
in the EU budget negotiations, which were concluded on Tuesday.
Although the final figure is less than the €80 billion
originally proposed by the Commission, about which the EU Committee is
rightly disappointed, it is none the less excellent news for the UK
that the budget for research and innovation has been protected in the
context of the first overall reduction in the EU
budget<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:33:28"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
I have a caveat to that praise in relation to the arts and humanities,
to which I will return, as I will be urging the Minister to take
further
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:33:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000516" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000516">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:34:34"></hs_TimeCode>
quality, breadth and depth of research in the UK enable it to secure a
disproportionately large quantity of EU research funding, as others
have said. 
<?notus-xml column=1162?>Research and innovation is one of the areas where UK interests are most
closely aligned with opportunities offered by the EU. The more that the
EU invests in research and innovation, the more the UK benefits from EU
membership. However, the decision to protect the innovation and
research budget in a climate of cuts is also excellent news for Europe.
Evidence suggests that each extra 1% invested in public R&amp;D in
Europe generates an extra 0.17% in productivity growth. The European
Commission has estimated that the current framework programme for
research and innovation will create 900,000 additional jobs, and growth
in GDP of nearly 1%—growth which equals the total expenditure of
all other EU budget lines
combined.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000517" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000517">In
short, the European Union has made the right choice to protect
investment for growth. We in the UK will benefit enormously from that
decision. So far, under FP7, the UK has received more than 15% of all
funding. Only Germany has received more. We are certainly the most
successful country by far in applications for European Research Council
and Marie Curie research funding. I want to quote one exemplar: UCL. I
declare an interest as a council member. UCL is a lead player in
EU-funded research and is consistently ranked in the top four HEIs in
Europe. It has more than 600 FP7 projects with a total cumulative
budget in excess of €300 million. ERC research funding, arguably
the most prestigious in Europe, represents half UCL’s research
income, which clearly demonstrates excellence across all areas of
activity. UCL is the lead HEI in Europe in health-funded
research.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112188000518" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000518">The
report that we are debating today rightly points out the importance of
prioritising excellence. There has been substantial pressure to
distribute research funding on other criteria. In my view, it would
have been wrong to distribute research funding merely on the basis of
geographical factors. Not only would it be unfair, but it would have
diluted the economic impact of this investment. The fact that the
funding for excellence pillar of the Horizon 2020 budget has been
increased is also good news. Further, EU-funded research and innovation
enables stakeholders to engage in international collaboration on a
global scale. This has positive impacts in Europe and the UK by
building a critical mass of knowledge and adds significant value given
the global nature of the research environment and the common global
societal changes we are all
facing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000519" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000519">I now
come to my caveat: the arts and humanities. Only last week, the foreign
secretary of the British Academy and the president of the All European
Academies wrote to the Commissioner for Research, Innovation and
Science expressing deep concern that the social sciences and humanities
were being marginalised in the development of the Horizon 2020
programme. The amount proposed for SSH research provides considerably
less funding than has been available under FP7. The draft work
programme foresees bids of between €1.5 million and €2.5
million, which means, on average, roughly four to five successful
projects per call across the entire European Union. This is
nonsensical. It is bound to have an impact on those bidding, when the
chances of success are so small. The presidents are concerned, as well,
that there are no structures which embed interdisciplinary work, and I
know that the vice-chancellor of Cambridge is raising these issues as 
<?notus-xml column=1163?>we speak with DG Research in Brussels. Will the Minister undertake
urgently to talk to the British Academy to understand its concerns so
that his department can intervene with the European Commission, should
it prove necessary, in order to reassure the social sciences and
humanities research community that it will, indeed, be able to
contribute to a successful Horizon
2020?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000520" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000520">Meanwhile,
a new element of the research budget will be targeted at widening
participation in research programmes and spreading excellence. It will
receive about 1% of funding from the Horizon 2020 budget and will
encourage partnerships between strong research institutions and those
in new member states through new twinning and teaming initiatives. This
will be complemented by much larger structural funds, the receipt of
which is now linked to a national innovation strategy being in
place.</hs_para>

the budget negotiations in general is, in my view, good news for the UK
and Europe, we cannot afford to be complacent. As the EU Committee
points out, if we are to compete with emerging economies, we will have
to spend a still higher proportion of GDP on research and innovation.
Europe has failed to make significant progress towards meeting the
Lisbon goal of investing 3% of GDP in research and development. The EU
average is just 2%, while the OECD average is higher at about 2.6%. The
UK lags behind, spending less than 1.8% of GDP on R&amp;D. The previous
Government had a target to increase this to 2%, but we have made
frustratingly slow progress towards that figure.</hs_para>

noble Lords have emphasised, emerging economies such as China and South
Korea are increasing investment rapidly and seeing results in improving
performance in patent and citation indices. What has happened to that
target? What plans do the Government have to raise our game? Does the
Minister accept that it would be dangerously complacent for us to
assume that we can continue to outperform faster-developing economies
when we have much lower levels of
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:40:09"></hs_TimeCode>? As
the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has pointed out elsewhere, the UK has a
fantastically efficient research system, more so than the US, as
measured by the number of citations for each unit spent. However, it is
not at all clear that we can continue to maintain that advantage in the
long term.</hs_para>

the committee is right to identify private sector involvement in
R&amp;D as a priority. The UK has an inglorious history of decline on
this score. Universities do much to stimulate investment through
partnerships with industry, but if we are to maintain our position as a
leading economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:40:57"></hs_TimeCode>

remarks that were made earlier. I thank our parliamentary clerk, our

very nature of research and innovation means that it seeks to break new
frontiers in technology. This inevitably means that it is a keenly
fought battleground for new ideas, and as noble lords will be aware, we
live in a very competitive world. We have heard that the Horizon 2020
budget, which is to be rolled out next year and which will run until
2020, will be €71 billion—although as the noble Lord,
Lord Brooke, mentioned, another €8 billion may be added, which
would make it €79. That sounds like a lot of money
until—as the noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, said—you look at
countries such as China, which are set to increase their spending on

2015.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000527" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000527">If we in

the main point of the report that I will focus on this afternoon is the
perceived urgent need to make it easier and more attractive for our
SMEs to apply for R&amp;I grants from the EU. One of the reasons for
their reluctance to apply for funds in the past is that they see the
whole application process as labyrinthine and too bureaucratic. Add to
that the fact that they may have to wait up to 499 days—as a
worst-case scenario—for their application to be accepted, and
then factor in the possibility of late payment, which further
exacerbates the time to receiving the grant, and you can see the
problem all too clearly. Indeed, my right honourable
friend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:45:00"></hs_TimeCode> David
Willetts, during a very helpful session with the committee, cited a
company that was advised that it had been awarded a grant and was so
excited and enthused at being told this that it recruited extra staff,
but the money was so slow in arriving that it went
bust<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:44:54"></hs_TimeCode>. Paragraphs

committee was also concerned at the lack of flexibility in funding at
the end of a given project. By its very nature, innovation is not an
exact science and there can often be a time overrun in bringing new
ideas to fruition. When that happens, it will inevitably incur extra
costs, but there is currently no provision for this in the Horizon 2020
funding package. We believe that the process should be more flexible
and that follow-on funding should be made available to help to ensure
that projects are completed and achieve full commercial

how the European Commission has been particularly effective—much
more so than the United States in many ways—in
identifying new areas of technical research and setting up networks
across the EU. One of Boeing’s top aerodynamicists came to a
conference this summer in Lyon and was amazed by the new concepts and
applications for turbulence over wings developed by European
programmes. No academic in the United States has any idea about
Boeing’s future plans, but in Europe hundreds of research groups
are participating in the Airbus programme. It is a remarkable general
programme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:51:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, I received a very mealy-mouthed response to a PQ in which I
asked what the effect on our Airbus programme would be of Britain
leaving Europe. To my astonishment, the reply was that there would be
no difference except, perhaps, to one or two tiny research projects.
Leaving Europe would have an enormous impact, and this is something
that we should be clear
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:51:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

are rightly emphasised in this report, despite the Government’s
destruction of some of the regional economic programmes which existed
before they came to power. The networks that I helped to set up with
colleagues across Europe to bring researchers together with industry
have been going successfully since 1988. One of the points made in the
report is that programmes are funded by the European Commission and
then stop. What happens to the people involved? If the various
industries and researchers have their own networks then although the EC
projects may come and go, the bottom-up network will continue. Some EC
officials were reluctant about having these independent networks but
now realise that they are actually a good way to fit the

the EC system is that it is inevitably bureaucratic because it is
trying to do things that have not been done before. It is trying to
bring people from all across Europe together and introduce
interdisciplinary projects. I accept that there will not be much
correspondence if you have one project in Swindon that is working on
one topic in one lab. But if you are trying to do something across
Europe and break new ground, you will have a lot of meetings and
letters—because it is worth it and you will get the most 
<?notus-xml column=1167?>remarkable results. There was an effective project on system dynamics in
policymaking involving all sorts of disciplines which, noble Lords will
be pleased to hear, ended up considering even the fashionable question
of defining happiness. We also had interesting discussions about what
is wrong with economics, and we had meetings here in Parliament. That

organisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:53:46"></hs_TimeCode>.

asked the CEO of a high-tech SME who was previously a director of a
university science park about this issue in order to get an objective
view. He agreed about the benefits of EC support for networks but said
that there were definitely problems for many individual SMEs. The
difficulties included understanding what the grants were and how to
apply for them. He said that there were certainly problems about
payment and it was important to understand the rules on payments when

reasons the SMEs find it difficult is that the big companies delay

this report. While listening to speaker after speaker, I thought that
surely someone would mention it, but astonishingly no one mentioned the
really surprising thing. The Government and the European Commission
have to promote the technology of Europe. They do a pretty bad job of
it. If you go to Beijing, as I do quite often—and I came back
from Kuala Lumpur last night—you will have 25 trade missions,
including the European trade mission, all giving little bits of this
and that. Then you have the American trade mission with extraordinarily
specialised offices from all the federal agencies. Who will you buy
your product from when you have it all explained to you by the United

am pleased to see that the present Government are promoting exports and

pathetic little sideshow by the Brits. It should have been much broader

considered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T17:56:40"></hs_TimeCode>.

these European projects. The United States Department of Commerce

believe that our Government in Whitehall are even looking at the
European projects we are funding, some of which are Brit in origin and
some in other countries, to see how we can use them. That is a really
important point. Our money is being used to fund technological projects
in other countries in Europe, but are we making use of them for our

about objective science because I have been to France, Japan and China

dominated. There is a lot of very important science that is never
referenced or seen by these things. The IPCC is perhaps another
example. That is particularly true of the humanities where you have all
sorts of literature in many different languages. It should be part of
the Chief Scientific Adviser’s remit to take a broad view of

all, are the Government’s replacement for RDAs—something

worst-case scenario that the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, pointed

EU’s current framework programme, FP7. It receives, as several

of the total funding available, which puts us second only to Germany

successful projects than any other country: 41.2 % of all grant
agreements in FP7 to date include at least one UK partner.
Research-intensive UK universities have been particularly successful in
this regard and are actively engaged in Europe. Several

noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, in his excellent contribution, stressed the
importance of the assessment of programmes and their delivery. In this
regard, I want to highlight to your Lordships’ House several
notable success stories. For example, the Nobel prize-winning work
undertaken at Manchester on graphene, an ultra-thin, ultra-light and
superconductive material with potential uses ranging from energy
storage and high-speed computing to improved tennis racquets, was
partly EU funded. Jaguar and Rolls-Royce are collaborating with Queen
Mary College and innovative UK SMEs in a project aimed at turning waste
heat from engine exhaust gases into electricity, meaning reduced carbon
dioxide emissions and better fuel consumption. ARM Ltd has successfully
participated in a series of EU research projects which have helped
underpin its global leadership in providing microchip designs for a
broad range of digital technologies. I say to my noble friend Lord
Maclennan that the Jaguar and Rolls-Royce example underlines issues and
challenges that we are looking at in terms of
environment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T18:13:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000562" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000562">On
the quality of the UK research base, the UK does well because of the
excellence of the research conducted here. An indicator of this
strength is provided by the distribution of grants by the European
Research Council, which funds groundbreaking research on the basis of
Europe-wide peer review. Among all the ERC grant-holders, the UK ranks
well ahead of both Germany 
<?notus-xml column=1172?>and France. This quality provides a firm basis on which to build even
stronger engagement in the future. I agree wholeheartedly with the
praise of the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, for the European Research
Council, which plays an important role in all these EU research
programmes, and from which, as I have already illustrated, the UK has
done
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T18:14:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000563" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000563">The
noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, and others referred to Horizon 2020. The
process of negotiating the new seven-year Horizon 2020 programme has
been long and complex but the political agreement that was reached
between the Council and the European Parliament represents, in the
Government’s view, a good deal for Britain. It retains the
primacy of excellence as the factor for deciding who receives funding.
I know that we have discussed this issue but I assure my noble friend
Lord Jenkin that excellence is the key determining factor in this
regard. The programme is structured round a limited number of key
societal challenges such as health, climate change and energy security.
It also provides a range of support right along the innovation chain,
from blue sky research through to large-scale demonstrators of new
technologies. It seeks to embed and mainstream the insights from
research in the social sciences and the arts and humanities—I
know that was a concern of the noble Baroness, Lady
Warwick—another area of UK strength across the programme, as she
rightly pointed out. It will allocate increased levels of dedicated
funding to innovative small and medium-sized enterprises. I agree with
the important point that the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, raised about
applying a much broader interpretation of research and innovation.
Horizon 2020 will make provision for other areas of support and for new
business
models.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000564" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000564">The
noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, and others referred to red tape. One of the
key challenges and issues for the implementation of the programme
remains that of reducing red tape and administrative overheads. We
should not look at this just in a European context. As someone who
spent many years in the private sector before joining your
Lordships’ House—indeed, during my time on the
Conservative Back Benches I continued in business—I know that
red tape is not just an issue that government must tackle but one with
which many businesses across the board have to grapple. The rules that
set the conditions for participation in the Horizon 2020 programme
contain welcome simplifications, which is something for which we have
pushed. The Government will monitor in particular the European
Commission’s performance in delivering on its commitment to
reduce the time taken over funding decisions by 100 days. My noble
friend Lord Liverpool pointed out that it is all very well securing the
funding but asked what is the point of bidding for it if, by the time
it arrives, the business has closed. That is a very important point on
which to
reflect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000565" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000565">As
regards Horizon 2020 funding, within a smaller overall multiannual
financial framework for 2014-20, spending on research and innovation is
one of the few areas to increase. This is in recognition of the
potential for spending in this area to contribute to sustainable growth
and jobs and add real value to the investments made at national level:
a point underlined at the European Council meeting last
month.</hs_para>

participation. As several noble Lords have pointed out, in looking at
UK participation in EU funding programmes, I have thus far focused
on the performance of our UK universities. I am aware that
UK business participation in the framework programme has not always
been as strong as we would have liked. There are several
reasons for this. I have already referred to the levels of
bureaucracy and red tape associated with EU funding. I assure
all noble Lords that we shall work with the
Commission to address this in Horizon 2020.
Indeed, the committee’s report specifically highlighted this as
a major
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000567" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000567">The
Government also need to enhance their support to potential
participants. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and
the Technology Strategy Board have therefore been working on the
implementation of new national support services for Horizon 2020. A new
TSB-hosted website and helpline service will be ready in time for the
launch of the first competitions for grants in December. I turn to some
specific questions in this regard. The noble Lord, Lord Kakkar,
referred to the key role of SMEs. The Technology Strategy Board has a
key role to play through the national contact points system in
prompting opportunities for SMEs. It is welcome that funding will be
allocated on the basis of excellence, as I have already mentioned. For
the first time, individual SMEs will be able to receive funding, so
they will no longer be required to find out about partner
organisations. This, we feel, should help participation and make it
easier for SMEs to participate
themselves.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_21_PT_1/23B5C0495B0CC6DDD61E9E7BA3FF11A46CC8BC82" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 November 2013">Thursday,

noble Lord, Lord Young, also raised the issue of the national contact
points. Full-time employees of the Technology Strategy Board will be
better integrated with the technology innovation structures, the
knowledge transfer network and the Enterprise Europe Network to provide
a better co-ordinated service. He also raised the important point about
the role of local enterprise partnerships. The TSB is in the process of
developing relationships with the LEPs, including a focus on their
innovation agenda. This includes drawing attention to the opportunities
available for EU funding, notably via the structural funds.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112188000569" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000569">The TSB’s
recruitment of the new Horizon 2020 national contact points is under
way. The TSB is also actively looking to establish a presence in
Brussels early in 2014 that will further help to improve the support it
provides in increasing business access to Horizon 2020 programmes.
Furthermore, we are working to strengthen communications strategies to
ensure that information about Horizon 2020 and the opportunities which
it offers is available to all those who might have an interest in
participating. I fully take on board the important point made by
several noble Lords about having presence on the ground. Again, I
underline the Government’s commitment to encouraging that. When
I was discussing this debate with officials, I raised the obvious point
that while it is all very well having the funding, if you do not know
about it then it is a difficult chore. Therefore, the communication
strategy that the Government are seeking to put behind this
will, we hope, also encourage wider and greater participation,
especially at the SME level.</hs_para>

mentioned the barriers to innovation. It is essential that European
funding programmes for research and innovation foster the emergence of
new industry sectors and jobs. The committee’s excellent report
rightly drew attention to issues that affect the exploitation of the
outputs and outcomes of the projects funded. One such was the EU
regulatory environment. For instance, there is little point in working
on disruptive technologies if the regulatory framework or regime
favours existing technologies. More generally, there are concerns about
EU regulations or differences of approach between EU countries which
make it excessively difficult, at times, for business to bring
innovative products to the market. The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, spoke
about the importance of the demand side in innovation, particularly in
public procurement. I am glad to report that Horizon 2020 will in fact
introduce a new SME instrument aimed at pulling innovations through
into the market place.</hs_para>

innovation-friendly regulation. My right honourable friend the Minister
for Universities and Science has been actively promoting a more
innovation-friendly regulatory environment in Europe, working with key
partner countries. We are now seeking to build on this momentum and to
provide and promote a greater role and higher profile for scientific
advice in policy and decision-making, drawing on the expertise of the
chief scientific adviser to the EU and the Commission’s in-house
joint research
centre.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000572" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000572">We
have heard a lot about what some noble Lords suggested was the
diminishing influence of Britain in Europe. I do not agree with that
point. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, pointed out, it is notable that
the Commission’s chief scientific adviser, Professor Anne
Glover, is indeed British. I use that word deliberately. She may be
Scottish but she is British as well, and long may that be the
case.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112188000573" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000573">The
noble Lords, Lord Brooke and Lord Hunt, raised the issue of
representation on the ground in the EU. I must point out that in this
policy area, notwithstanding how many British representatives
we have at the moment, one of the important
things to realise about Europe is that while officials there are of
course promoting national interests, there are also the wider interests
of Europe. We certainly take the view that we must establish good
working relationships with all Commission officials. The only thing I
would point out in support of this point, which was also
well made by my noble friend Lord Maclennan, is
that the success of our relationship is perhaps
underlined by the fact that Her Majesty’s Government
have secured many of our key negotiating objectives within Horizon
2020.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000574" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000574">I shall
deal with a small point as an aside. The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, and
my noble friend Lord Liverpool raised the issue of the actual funding
amount. Because this was preset, the actual funding remains and is then
adjusted, so the figure of €79 billion that we are hearing being
quoted has been adjusted for inflation. It is important to point out
that
distinction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T18:25:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000575" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000575">I
turn to the launch of Horizon 2020. The package is now largely agreed
and waiting for formal adoption at the end of this year. Officials are
working closely on 
<?notus-xml column=1175?>this point. Indeed, in a “hot off the press” moment, I was
informed as I was coming in to the debate that only this morning the
European Parliament agreed in its plenary session in favour of the
Horizon 2020 package. This will now pass to the Council of Ministers
and we are currently awaiting the date of that meeting. We will
continue to work with all UK stakeholders and our partner countries in
preparing the ground for the formal launch of the programme, drawing up
work programmes, for instance, and engaging with potential participants
to ensure that they are fully aware of the opportunities on offer. A
series of promotional events is planned, with BIS holding a formal
high-level launch event for Horizon 2020 on 31 January next year. I am
of course happy to share the details of the programme as it is
agreed.</hs_para>

shall touch on a few other questions that were raised. The issue of
impact assessments was mentioned. As I said, excellence will remain a
key part of this. My noble friend Lord Liverpool raised a concern over
duplication of the European Parliament’s role as well as the
role of the European Commission. That is something that we have taken
up and we are assured that, rather than duplicate this, the role will
be perceived as being complementary in nature.</hs_para>

friend Lord Jenkin and 99% of the time I find myself agreeing with him

currently being used and asked why certain issues have to be raised
again. One of the things that I grew up with in personal, business and
indeed political life was that if you believe in a particular point, if
you believe in something such as the importance of excellence and the
importance of reiterating a point, and you wish to provide some
constructive input to your friends, you keep reminding them of it.
However, for many years applications have been assessed on the basis of
an independent peer review. The principle is now fully accepted and
written into the Horizon 2020 legislation. As I have already said, the
principle of excellence is manifest in the European Research Council,
which is widely acknowledged and which supports world-class
research<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-21T18:28:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112188000578" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131121-0003.htm#13112188000578">My
noble friend Lord Maclennan raised an important point about the EU
research and innovation programme and the importance of participating

asked various questions about the committee’s reply to my right
honourable friend David Willetts’s letter of 19 July. The TSB is
actively looking to establish a Brussels presence, as I have already
said. The issue of British nationals in the DG was raised. Up to 59

were deployed in response to the threat to aviation posed by
non-metallic improvised explosive devices, such as the device used in
the attack on Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam Schiphol to Detroit
on Christmas Day 2009, and the device recovered in Yemen in spring
2012. These devices were designed to make detection by existing
screening methods extremely difficult. More broadly, the UK threat

scanners now use millimetre wave technology, which has no known health

evidence from airports is that nearly all passengers accept the use of

who refused to be scanned by a security scanner were not offered an
alternative, and were not allowed to fly on that occasion. This was a
security and operational decision: only a private search (a thorough
hand-search in which the passenger may be asked to loosen or remove
clothing) would offer a broadly similar security assurance to a scan,
and it was considered that offering this as an alternative would be too
operationally disruptive to the airport and to other
passengers.</hs_para>

operating security scanners for several years has shown that the vast
majority of passengers are content to be screened by a security scanner
if selected. Consequently the number of passengers refusing to be
scanned is very low. As a 
<?notus-xml column=58?>result, and having reviewed the current position, I have concluded that
from tomorrow, Friday 22 November, passengers who opt out of being
screened by a security scanner will be allowed a private search
alternative. This is a method of screening which we consider is of an
equivalent security value to a security scan. These revised
arrangements will be kept under review to ensure that high levels of
security are maintained whilst avoiding disproportionate impacts on
airports and passengers.</hs_para>

can be demonstrated that another security process, or combination of
processes, offer the same level of security as a scan, then I will
consider allowing further alternatives to a private search to be
offered to passengers.</hs_para>

I have placed in the libraries of both Houses a copy of the Government
Response to the Law Commission’s Report “Expert Evidence
in Criminal Proceedings”. The Law Commission’s
investigation followed concerns expressed by the House of Commons
Science and Technology Committee in 2005. The Report was extremely
thorough, and concluded that legislation was needed to bring existing
common law provisions into statute, to provide judges with additional
powers to exclude expert evidence, and to create a new
“reliability test”. However, administration of this test
would require additional pre trial hearings, which have cost
implications to which the Government cannot, at this time,
commit.</hs_para>

bring in new legislation, I intend to ask the Criminal Procedure Rule
Committee to make changes to the Rules relating to the timing and

contribution to an ecologically coherent network including the waters
around our islands. To support this process we have been working with
the Devolved Administrations in the UK, the Joint Nature Conservation

a possible merger, and taking on charitable status. The NFC and Defra
