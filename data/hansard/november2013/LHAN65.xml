honourable friend the Minister for Europe recently briefed the
September General Affairs Council of the European Union on the balance
of competences review. This is but one example of the regular
conversations that we are having with our European partners

were few and far between, but even they would agree with the excellent
results of the last EU summit at the end of October and the firm and
detailed agreement reached by President Barroso 
<?notus-xml column=98?>and the Council of Ministers on a secure reform agenda for the future,

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to hear my
noble friend echoing the speech that the Prime Minister made to the CBI
only yesterday. The balance of competences review is only one
of the things that the coalition Government are undertaking on European
issues. It is intended to be an evidence- based review, and we
have so far had well over 1,000 contributions to the reports published
and under
consideration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Barnett" PimsId="3885" UID="13110570000289" xid="1068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000289">Lord

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, it is not a question of
which competences we agree. We are asking various stakeholders, and
getting very large pieces of evidence from producer groups, about the
current balance of competences. I think that the Scotch Whisky
Association has produced the most pieces of evidence so
far—clearly a stakeholder. As Ministers have said before from
this Dispatch Box, the current Lisbon treaty has a lot of headroom on
competences, not all of which are currently exercised by the European
Union. We are asking stakeholders to say whether they are happy with
the current balance, whether there are areas in which they would like
the balance to be tipped back towards the national level or whether
there are areas in which they would like the balance to be
tipped further towards common
European policies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T14:51:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Howell of Guildford" PimsId="1037" UID="13110570000291" xid="1752" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000291">Lord
Howell of Guildford (Con):</Member></B> Would my noble friend, who
knows a lot about these things, accept that it is not just a question
of looking at the balance of competences? It is also about looking at
unpicking and unravelling some of the categories of competences, which
are now substantially out of date, as they were invented in the last
century. For instance, agriculture now embraces all aspects of climate,
energy and scientific issues as well; and many aspects of social
policy, which used to be centralised, are now much better handled at a
very local level. Those are all areas in which it is not just a
question of taking the competence as it stands but unravelling and
unpicking it to see what aspects are best dealt with at a global,
national or local level. Would he take that message back to his
ministerial
colleagues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T14:52:38"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13110570000292" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000292">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, one thing that has come
across strongly to me from the first round—and the second round,
which we are currently considering—is the dynamics of
globalisation, on which the noble Lord is himself a great expert, and
the extent to which the context in which we operate with our European
partners in a great many sectors differs fundamentally from the context
in which we joined in 1973. As I have stressed before, we are not
seeking to arrive at policy recommendations in this review; we are
asking for 
<?notus-xml column=99?>evidence of how far the current arrangements satisfy
the various stakeholders and where there is room for improvement,
reform or
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T14:53:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Clinton-Davis" PimsId="2640" UID="13110570000293" xid="1162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000293">Lord

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the Prime Minister made it
clear in his speech to the CBI that he is interested in a reform and
not a repatriation agenda, and that he seeks to use the process of
reform as a way in which to convince the sceptical British public that

familiar with the Dutch Government’s recent study of
subsidiarity. In the process of publishing the opening stage of papers,
the Minister for Europe and I spoke to Ministers in other
European Governments and many of them have very similar views to our

trade with us creates. We also import 800,000 more cars from Europe
than it buys from us. All these factors mean that in many respects from
a trade point of view Europe needs us more than we need it. I hope that
this imbalance of trade will be well remembered in any future

identified, the patient voice has to be at the heart of the health and
care system, and Healthwatch plays a crucial role in supporting that as
the new consumer champion for health and social care. It is very easy
to get fixated on the amount of money that is going into Healthwatch.
One additional consideration could be the investment that a local
authority may be making in other areas to ensure that the voice of
service users and the public is heard—for example, through the
voluntary and community sector. Surely what matters are the outcomes
that are achieved for service users and the quality of those

report from Healthwatch England was laid before Parliament on 9 October
and it outlined some encouraging progress at both a national and a
local level. There are already examples of the impact that local
Healthwatch is having—for example, the work of Healthwatch in
Peterborough, which is looking at how to improve health outcomes for
offenders. My noble friend mentioned autism. I am aware that
Healthwatch Cornwall uncovered a gap in the services meant to deliver a
diagnosis of autism in children. That work resulted in a really

brought a lot of good news for health trusts, and my own in particular.
However, the Healthwatch bodies—certainly locally where my trust
is involved with them—need some support and guidance about what
they are meant to achieve. It may seem odd but there is still some
ambiguity about who is doing what. We are working with them as an acute

certainly right that some local Healthwatches have got off to more of a
flying start than others. I am aware of many that are working closely
with their local clinical commissioning groups and indeed with provider
trusts. However, others need encouragement and support, and we have

there are unfortunately individuals on all sides of this conflict who
seek to derail any attempts at peace. The Government stand with those
who are looking to work towards peace between Israel and Palestine, and
the UK consistently outlines steps in this regard and raises these
issues. Indeed, my right honourable friend Hugh Robertson, the new
Minister of State responsible for the region, is currently visiting the
region and he will be raising this issue with all sides. Let me once
again reiterate that we are calling upon both sides, because the

Lord for his words. Of course, irrespective of the colour of its
Administration, over the years the UK has been consistent in ensuring
that we require a two-state solution, which, as he said, secures the
borders of Israel in a secure way and ensures that the Palestinians
have a viable state. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary
has made it clear that there is no greater global priority for the UK
than the search for peace in the Middle East. Let me assure the noble

that it has been a painful process for the Government of Israel.
Indeed, reports have suggested that up to 80% of the Israeli population
were against such releases. As I have already said, it was a courageous
decision on behalf of Prime Minister Netanyahu. On the second point, I
think the timetable has been set. Secretary of State Kerry has been

that seems to me to be crystal clear. We are not in a static situation
as we prepare for the peace talks that have been longed for for many
years as the Israeli Government are quite deliberately making the
situation more difficult by the continual expansion of the settlements.

Ramsbotham (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I should make it abundantly
clear from the start, as I have done to the Leader of the House and the
Minister, that far from being a wrecking Motion, this is a saving
Motion designed to save the Government from doing untold damage to a
very precious part of the big society that they claim to
champion—namely, the voluntary sector—and to save the
vast majority of voluntary sector organisations which have nothing
whatever to do with the electoral process. That is why my Motion is
confined to a very specific part of the Bill and organisations with
which I and, I suspect, every other Member of the House are in regular
contact.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110570000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000068">I
freely admit that it would have been more normal for me to have tabled
my Motion at Second Reading, but it was only when the masterly report
of the Commission on Civil Society and Democratic Engagement entitled
<I>Non-Party</I> <I>Campaigning Ahead of Elections</I>, under the
outstanding chairmanship of my noble and right reverend friend Lord
Harries of Pentregarth, was published after Second Reading that
the need for urgent preventive action became abundantly clear. The
report accentuated the points made by the constitutional Select
Committees of both Houses and the Joint Committee on Human Rights to
the effect that there are serious flaws in what is being proposed that
the Government need to address. However, these could have been exposed
had the Government allowed the three-month consultation period
that hitherto they had been so keen to promote. By not engaging
with the sector and pressing ahead with the Bill, which
essentially addresses political matters, the Government appear
to be oblivious to what they claim to be the unintended consequences
for what I described at Second Reading as one of the “jewels in
our national crown”; namely, the vast number of organisations
that have nothing to do with the political
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T15:22:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

debated the unfortunate redundancies imposed on members of the Armed
Forces within days and weeks of qualification for pensions, I mentioned
the damage that this had done to the all-important mutual trust that
there should be between government and people. I fear that the way that
this Bill is being handled will seriously damage the trust that the
voluntary sector has in the Government, which is something that the
alleged champions of the big society can ill afford to lose. Indeed,
the very clear exposition of the consequences set out in the
commission’s report reminds me of the most succinct but
unenforceable instruction that I ever saw in the Army: a note pinned to
a company notice board which read, “A breach of common sense is
a breach of the rules”. I was therefore glad when the Leader of
the House contacted me last 
<?notus-xml column=109?>night, after I had tabled this Motion, to see whether there was a way of
avoiding confrontation—which was, I assured him, the very last
thing I wanted.</hs_para>

that a way could be found to mitigate the damage that had been done and
to assuage a voluntary sector that is understandably worried and
incensed. As it forms such an indispensable and irreplaceable part of
our national infrastructure, I have to admit that I was amazed that the
Government did not realise the risk they were running in tabling this
part of the Bill. At Second Reading, I asked why the
Secretary of State for Justice had not complained about the
likely damage to those voluntary organisations that he hopes to
engage as partners in his rehabilitation revolution. Like me, many
Members of the House are wearing the annual symbol of the Royal British

passage of the Bill to date. Following our conversations, and having
taken on board his constructive suggestions, I am glad to say that we
seem to have an agreed way forward. I believe that we have come up with
a way of delivering a pause in our consideration of Part 2 of the Bill
so that there can be wide consultation over the

of those involved and interested in Part
2.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000074">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T15:26:58"></hs_TimeCode>
of the suggestions made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, was that we
could revise the order of consideration to delay our consideration of
Part 2. I can undertake to return to the House tomorrow with a revised
order of consideration Motion, to take Parts 1 and 3 first and Part 2
last. I understand from the Chief Whip that I can also undertake that
the two days in Committee on Part 2 will not be scheduled before 16
December, on the understanding that we need to finish Committee this
side of the Christmas Recess. That effectively gives a near six-week
pause in our formal consideration of Part
2.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000075">In that
period, I and my colleagues in Government responsible for the Bill will
consult widely with all the interested parties—Members
of the House and the many others outside. We intend to draw on the work
of the Commission on Civil Society, chaired so ably by the noble and
right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, and to build on it so
that the charity sector has a proper opportunity to explain to the
Government its concerns not only with this Bill but, as we discovered
in our conversations, with the current statute electoral law in this
area, in particular the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums
Act 2000. We can also consider the reports generated by the two Houses.
I also hope to facilitate further discussions between the Electoral
Commission and the Charity Commission about each of their sets of
guidance, in the hope of achieving something straightforward and agreed

it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000076">If the

find a solution in nearly double those three weeks. I stress that we
are listening and that we want to listen. We have already shown
willing: we announced this morning that we will bring forward an
amendment, the effect of which will immediately be to exempt all
smaller charities from the provisions of the Bill. If that listening
ultimately proves not to satisfy all the concerns in this House, then
there can of course be Divisions in Committee and on Report, as is
usual and proper, and the House will have a final opportunity to stop
the Bill completely on the Motion that the Bill do now pass at the end
of the process. The House will therefore scrutinise the Bill in

probably a bigger part of that sector than is the rest of civil

extremely useful purpose in concentrating minds, particularly within
the Government. I would never say that the Government have been running
around like headless chickens, but there has been a great deal of
activity over the weekend and into today, to try to find a compromise

is saying, “No, it is not. It is actually
white”. Who is right in this instance? A great deal of scrutiny
and investigation is required. The question is whether it needs a
special Select Committee or whether it can be done through the normal
processes of this House, augmented by enhanced consultation by the
Government with all corners of the House, with everybody outside and
with the whole of civil society in the mean time. Is five weeks long

further discussion and negotiation with outside bodies, the Government
will be serious and honest—and will not, when we come to
Committee, take the typical attitude of all Governments to Bills, which
is to defend the status quo and the wording on their Bill, then give
way when they are really forced to? As far as Part 2 is concerned, are
the Government really going into this with an open mind? It is not just
a matter of reassuring the third sector or civil society that the words
in the Bill will not harm them, but of taking seriously their view that
the Bill will harm them and of looking at ways of changing the Bill so
that not only will it not harm them but civil society generally will
accepts and be confident that it will
not.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T15:46:47"></hs_TimeCode> Are the

was extremely concerned about the idea that we should depart from our
ordinary practice for the scrutiny of Bills. As far as I know, one part
of a Bill has never been sent to a Select Committee in this way. In my
time, the whole of a Bill was sent when an office that had lasted for
more than 1,000 years was to be abolished by a press release from No.
10; the House then sent the whole of the Bill to a Select Committee. So
far as I know, though, a Select Committee has never been appointed to
deal with part of a

danger that I see about that is that if it were to be done, it would
suggest that we were not confident in our own procedures for
dealing with all forms of questions. It would undermine the
confidence that exists at the moment in the integrity of the
parliamentary process that we have come to know and respect. One thing
about this House that I seek to emphasise as often as I can is that
anyone who has a point of view that they can persuade a Peer to raise
will see it raised in consideration of the Bill in this House, and the
Government will have to give an answer. People may not always be very
keen on that answer, but at least they can get one. That is a very
valuable aspect of our House’s procedure, and I am delighted
that it has been preserved in the arrangement that the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, has made with my

particularly of Part 6, does not meet the needs or requirements of a
very large number of those who are now to be affected by it. I hope I
will not embarrass my noble friend Lord Greaves if I quote him as

noble Lord the Minister seemed to appreciate that he had to justify the
restrictive approach to registration adopted in the Bill. What reasons
did he give at Second Reading? The first seemed to be that it is
necessary to have a register of consultant lobbyists so that Ministers
and civil servants know on whose behalf they are being lobbied. One
might expect Ministers or civil servants to ask appropriate questions
of people making representations to them to obtain that information, if
it were not already obvious, rather than go to the trouble of
legislating for a
register<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:02:31"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, whatever inquiries are made by Ministers or civil servants, it
seems to me that this reason is no justification for confining the
obligation to register to consultants.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:01:09"></hs_TimeCode> register has
to be seen in the context of the public’s desire to know who is
seeking to influence government policy, and perhaps
succeeding.</hs_para>

explanation given by the noble Lord the Minister was that if the
register is extended beyond consultant lobbyists, it would contain too
much information. Is that a good reason? If the register is confined to
consultants, and thereafter all lobbyists elect to operate as
consultants, is it the intention to abandon the register because there
are too many entries? An inclusive register would mirror the current
voluntary register but would obviously be larger.
Nevertheless, it would not be too cumbersome. If a member of
the 
<?notus-xml column=119?>public noted that there had been a communication between a Minister or
senior civil servant and a named person during a relevant quarter, he
or she could search the website for that name and discover the identity

two observations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:05:00"></hs_TimeCode>
to make on that purported reason. The first is that the provisions in
many parts of this Bill are far from clear, but what is abundantly
clear is that this Bill has nothing to do with lobbying the public.
Clause 2(1) defines consultant lobbying as making
“communications within subsection (3)”. Subsection (3)
only
includes,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13110570000253" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000253">“communications

second observation about this reason is that the activities of
charities consist mainly of non-lobbying activities. Any lobbying of
Ministers or senior civil servants is incidental to those activities.
In his response, will the Minister confirm that charities will be able
to take advantage of the exception allowed by Clause 2(1)(c)
and paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 1? In so doing, will he confirm the
explanation given in private by Ministers and officials that the word
“incidental” is not related to the proportion of time
spent on lobbying activities but is concerned with ascertaining the
intention of the remit of the client or employer to the
lobbyist<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:05:55"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000123">The
reasons advanced by the Minister for restricting the register to
consultant lobbyists do not bear scrutiny. There is no justification
for such restriction. The amendment would have no adverse effect on
charities but even if there were such a risk, there could be an
amendment to include a specific exclusion for charities. Will the
Minister confirm that the mischief that this part of the Bill seeks to
address is unrelated to the activities of charities? If so, will he
agree to bring forward at Report an amendment to exclude charities from
any requirement of registration to put the matter beyond any

Taiwan. Is it intended to protect communications between officials from
Taiwan and Ministers or government officials that come within Clause

Norton of Louth (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to speak to my
amendments in this group which seek to achieve the same aim as
Amendment 1 in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie. I
will keep my comments fairly brief as the noble and learned Lord has
made the case that I would have made. However, I want to make a few
points in support of the thrust of what these amendments seek to
achieve. The Short Title of this Christmas tree Bill begins,
“Transparency of Lobbying”. That is misleading because
the Bill does not contribute to transparency of lobbying. The Bill may
result in us knowing who engages in the activity of lobbying—in
other words, lobbyists—but it contributes little to knowing what
lobbying takes place on particular policies or measures. It could be
argued that it is necessary to know who the lobbyists are in order to
know what lobbying takes place, but it is certainly not sufficient, and
I am not sure that it is even
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:10:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000130">The
value of a register of lobbyists is far from clear. As I argued on
Second Reading, I am not clear what the compelling argument is for
introducing a register. The value of the register proposed in the Bill
is especially unclear. It is not a register of lobbyists. It is not
even a register of professional lobbyists; it is a register of some
professional lobbyists. If one is to have a register of lobbyists and,
as I say, I am not persuaded of the case for it, one should at least
try to make it comprehensive. This entails broadening the class of
lobbyists covered in the Bill as well as the class of those being
lobbied. This group of amendments deals with the class of lobbyists. We
will come shortly to the other aspect of the Bill and its
limitations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:11:49"></hs_TimeCode>. The
noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, powerfully made the case for the
measure to be extended to encompass in-house lobbyists. As I argued at
Second Reading, I see no case for 
<?notus-xml column=121?>distinguishing between those who are paid and are
external to a company and those who are employed directly by a
company<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:12:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000131">It
is no good saying that in-house lobbyists should be excluded as it is
apparent on whose behalf they are lobbying. The fact that someone works
for a company as a political lobbyist is not necessarily a matter of
public record. They may have a title which masks their activity and may
work in a public affairs division rather than a parliamentary affairs
unit. If one is truly going to have a register of lobbyists for the
purposes of transparency, one should aim, as I say, to be comprehensive
and not go for an option that excludes more than nine out of every 10
lobbyists<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:12:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000132">My
amendments, like those of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, are
designed to encompass in-house lobbyists. That is the purpose of the
whole grouping. I am not particularly wedded to the wording because the
aim at this stage is to get the Government to concede that the Bill as
drafted will not make any significant difference to transparency in
respect of lobbying government. Indeed, Part 1 conflicts with what the
Government seek to achieve because it establishes a new regulatory
regime at public expense and for no clear purpose. The taxpayer will
not get value for money. If my noble friend the Minister argues that
extending the definition to in-house lobbyists is too complex or not
practically feasible that, I fear, is not so much an argument for
rejecting the amendments as it is for dropping this part of the

Amendment 143 is perhaps the simplest and is the key. It would amend
title of Part 1 to read, “Registration of professional
lobbyists”. Establishing a register only of consultants would
add nothing to the existing non-statutory register. Worse, it would
effectively end that voluntary register, its associated code of conduct
and related disciplinary mechanism. As UKPAC says, the Bill risks
creating a statutory register with minimal coverage while undermining a
voluntary regime that lists several hundred employers such as agencies,
in-house lobbyists, public bodies and charities, and more than 1,000
people employed in
lobbying.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000135">Indeed,
the proposed register—a skeleton rather than a viable
thing—would cover only 1% of lobbying meetings, yet would be a
heavy financial burden on consultant firms because they would have to

because it would not enable the public to see how outside bodies seek
to influence the political system.</hs_para>

“Today” programme, which I assume we all listen
to, Andrew Lansley said last week that the public should be able to see

not tell you that if you saw only the list of clients and not the
particular client on whose behalf even a consultant was meeting a
Minister. The register would tell us nothing about the big six energy
companies’ discussions with perhaps HMT or DECC officials.
Indeed, we would learn about only their meetings with

proposed register would exclude virtually all business lobbying,
whether done by companies themselves or by their trade bodies. The
Minister needs to tell the House whether that really is the intention.
Does he really want a list that excludes the bulk of lobbying activity?
Last year, BIS had 988 meetings with lobbyists, only two of which were
with consultants. Under the Bill, only those two meetings would need to
be entered on the register. Thus the register would capture fewer than
1% of ministerial meetings and do nothing to shed light on what goes on
behind those closed doors in
Whitehall.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000138">Big
government decisions often involve big business which—quite

Part 2 of the Bill, we might have saved ourselves half an hour earlier
this afternoon and not have been presented with such a dog’s

good governance, we need to see who is lobbying Ministers and civil

well be taken. I just wondered whether Ministers had considered the
contents of his contribution. His is a sort of halfway-house proposal:
it would dilute the value of the register but would ensure that the
kind of information that we really need was available. Today, he
slightly alluded to his case, and I believe that the questions he
raised at Second Reading should be answered during the deliberations on
the Bill. I cannot understand for the life of me what is driving the
Government down this route, apart from some huge PR effort to convince
the public that they are doing something about lobbying in line with
their coalition agreement. However, their proposal does not meet the
terms of what I understand was
agreed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T16:23:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

this area—a system has been in operation which provides far more
information than the Government are seeking the lobbyists and lobbying
organisations to provide. It has been suggested in this House and in

I should declare a couple of interests. Some years ago I
wrote a book on lobbying. It is a very small interest because
it is out of print and no one can buy it. It was a do-it-yourself book
on how to lobby and was intended specifically for the voluntary sector.
The other interest I want to declare is that I spent some years until
coming into this House as chief executive of the Refugee Council.
Indeed, one of the things that I did most was to lobby. The
organisation did quite a lot of lobbying on refugee policy.</hs_para>

that activity myself. It took me to all three party conferences: going

Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, let me start by
stressing that lobbying is a normal, valuable, regular aspect of any
healthy democratic political system. The question is one of
transparency and certainly not one of trying to reduce the level of
lobbying in this country. Part 1 was designed to address the problem of
consultant lobbying firms entertaining and going to see Ministers
without it being clear who they were representing. The Government have
dealt with the question of employed lobbyists—members of
charities and others—through their arrangements for
transparency. Every three months, I and others have to declare who we
have met and what organisations employ them, including anyone who
happens to be an old friend, perhaps from student days: I have to list
“the Information Commissioner” or whoever it may be
because a meeting has taken
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000152">We have
looked at other systems, in particular the Canadian one, which adopts
the universal system of wishing to take on board every single lobbyist.

impossible for the general public to have access to that kind of

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I take that on board. The
question of designing a system that is easily accessible to everyone,
including if one has such a very large register as that which the noble
Lord and some others are proposing, is one with which we all have to
deal. The Government are indeed looking at making the ministerial
diaries more readily and more rapidly available. At present we submit
them every three months, so they are sometimes three months or more in
arrears. We are aware of that problem. However, we are much more
transparent than previous Governments in this respect and are, to that

which they have met that consultant and the purpose of it. I still do

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, there was considerable
concern while the previous Government were in office that consultant
lobbyists were a powerful element in our political system, that we did
not know who they represented and that it would be better if the public
were informed who their clients were. The noble Baroness has, on a
number of occasions, stressed the point that perhaps one should also
add what subjects they are discussing with the Government. I am very
happy to take that away and perhaps on a belt-and-braces principle that
should be tied in. However, I do not think it takes away the issue that
for transparency of the democratic process it is desirable to know who
consultant lobbyists are representing and who therefore is paying
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000161">Perhaps
I may move on to answer some of the questions. The noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours, asks what our assessment is of the number of lobbying
organisations that will be required to register. Our current estimate
is that it will be somewhere in the order of 350. We have held a number
of constructive meetings with representatives of the industry at which
we discussed the voluntary register and the code of conduct, and we
have talked with the three main industry bodies concerned. They were
able to give a reassurance that many of the concerns regarding the

details. As I said to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, if the
tobacco industry lobbies on behalf of its own industry, we know what is

distinction between a consultant lobbyist and a professional lobbyist.
Because I am concerned with the EU balance of competences exercise,
over the past nine months I have read a great deal of evidence produced
by the Scotch Whisky Association. I know exactly where the association

that I did not actually join the National Trust primarily in order to
support its campaigning and advocacy work, but it regards that work not
as an incidental part of what the trust is for. Noble Lords
should look at the most recent announcement made by Oxfam. It is
changing its internal organisation so as to put more stress on its
campaigning dimension. Campaigning is at the centre of what Oxfam
regards as its entirely appropriate charitable activities. Part of

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, that stretches my expertise
very considerably. I will have to consult and write to the noble Lord
about that. It is a good academic question. The Government have been
quite clear that there is no exemption from the requirement to register
for large multidisciplinary firms that conduct consultant lobbying. We
refined the exception provided in paragraph 1 by amendment in Committee
in the other place to clarify that it will not be enjoyed by
organisations such as, for example, law firms if they run consultant
lobbying operations and lobby in a manner which is not incidental to
their other activity—even if consultant lobbying is not their
primary activity. As such, they will be required to register if they
meet the other criteria outlined in the definition of consultant
lobbying. The provisions outlined in paragraph 1 provide an important
and effective exemption for those whose limited involvement in lobbying
is in a manner which is merely incidental to their normal professional
activity. However, it brings within its scope those that provide

Amendment 39 provides a long list of exemptions from the
Opposition’s definition of professional lobbying. Exemptions are
provided for constituents contacting their Member of Parliament,
persons making communications on their own behalf, persons responding
to government consultations or an invitation to submit evidence to a
parliamentary committee, persons acting on behalf of government,
persons not receiving remuneration, and those responding to a court

in my own mind so far—no doubt it is my fault—as to what
exactly is meant by a professional lobbyist. For example, if a company
has engineering matters that it wants to deal with, it might send along
an engineer to tell the Minister what it is all about. He might not be
described as a professional lobbyist but, being an engineer, at least
he knows about the subject matter. Does a professional lobbyist have to

trying to interface between the company and the political process, and
it would be the public affairs departments of many companies with which

many noble Lords observed at Second Reading, lobbyists will not confine

This is clearly the case when one considers the word

policy documents for consideration by senior officials, then elected

policy documents that were ultimately submitted to elected members. Any

communicate with these officials at an early stage. I suspect that the
same is true in central government and devolved Governments in the
United Kingdom. If this provision is to be of any significance, it

<?notus-xml column=133?>PPSs are in a special position regarding their Minister. Although
unpaid, they may have access to draft policy documents and will attend
meetings with the Minister and departmental officials when the
formulation of policy is being discussed. I recall that the noble Lord,
Lord Browne of Ladyton, who is not in his place, attended many such
meetings when he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the late Donald
Dewar when he was Secretary of State for Scotland. The special
relationship that a PPS has with his or her Minister and the access to
policy documents and discussions indicate that their inclusion in the
affected parts would increase the transparency that the provision seeks
to achieve. The other amendments are consequential because the

Rooker (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendments 23,
some of whose content has been covered, and 26. Before I do so,
however, I would like to jump back for a moment because I was reluctant
to intervene on the welcome Statement that the Minister made at the
beginning of our proceedings. I hope that when he comes forward
tomorrow with the timetable, Part 4 will actually still be Part
4—that is, after we have finished Parts 1, 2 and 3. It is no
good doing Parts 1, 3 and 4 and then trying to fix in Part 2. Part 4,
on commencement and everything else, has to come at the end and remain
as the final part of the Bill. I hope that that will be the order that
we will get
tomorrow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:02:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000199">I
shall share this with the Committee: I have made a bit of a list,
although I agree, frankly, that the route taken by the noble Lord, Lord
Norton of Louth is much more satisfactory. Like my noble friend Lord
Campbell-Savours, I am amending what is on offer; I am not trying to
rewrite the Bill. It is fairly obvious that a Minister of the Crown has
to be covered, and it is an open-and-shut case that special advisers
should be covered.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110570000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000200">What the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Hardie, has just said about Parliamentary Private
Secretaries is absolutely true. To be honest, I had an effective PPS
only for my first four years as Minister when I was in the other place;
to have a Lords Minister with a Commons PPS is a complete waste of
time—not much help at all. Nevertheless, the PPS that I had for
two years in MAFF and then for two years at the DSS—the same
person—did not attend all meetings but certainly once or twice a
week was sitting around a table with officials and myself and other
Ministers, along with the Secretary of State’s PPS. That was
normal; there was nothing suspicious about it. It worked perfectly
okay. It was very useful. That person therefore has to be covered by
such legislation, not in their role as a constituency Member of
Parliament but in their role as a minor functionary in the Government.
They can be dismissed by the Prime Minister or indeed appointed with
the Prime Minister’s permission. Effectively, for practical
purposes, those decisions are made by the Chief Whip but it is the same
thing: the head of the Government sanctions these appointments and
dismissals—as I found out to my cost when I got sacked as a PPS
in 1977. I had voted the wrong way on a Bill. So PPSs have to be
covered, and the Government have covered Permanent
Secretaries.</hs_para>

come to the issue of non-ministerial government departments. On the
latest count that I have, there are 23 ministerial government
departments and 21 non-ministerial
departments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:00:42"></hs_TimeCode>. One
thing that is unique about them compared with the non-departmental
public bodies and executive agencies—it is a cast-iron
cert—is that they are all separately funded by the Treasury.
They are government departments. They do not have a parental
department. When one looks at the Cabinet Office list on the web for
November last year, they are all listed. For executive agencies, the
list gives the parent department. For non-ministerial departments,
there is no parent department but a post-box department that answers
PQs and debates. It has no role whatever in policy and no authority.
Most non-ministerial departments are set up by primary legislation.
They have their own Act of Parliament to set them up—obviously,
I declare an interest, having just done four years as chair of the Food
Standards
Agency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000202">Let us
take the first one on the list: the Charity Commission for England and
Wales. It is the independent regulator of charitable activity. In the
advert for a new chief executive that I saw at the weekend—I am
not quite sure what has happened there because I thought the former
chief executive was reappointed in August—the word
“independent” is used. Non-ministerial departments are
set up to give them a degree of independence. In fact, most members of
the public do not know that they are government departments. That is
the benefit. They are genuinely treated as independent regulators. Half
the food industry does not understand that the Food Standards Agency is
a copper-bottomed, 100% central government department, but it operates
under its own legislation as the independent regulator for the sector.
It answers to Parliament, like all government departments, and all the
staff are civil servants, as in all these 21 non-ministerial
departments.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110570000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000203">Although there are 21
non-ministerial departments, only one is covered in the legislation: HM
Revenue and Customs. The reason is that it is the only one of the 21
where the chief exec is a Perm-Sec-status civil servant. In all the
others, the chief executives are either directors-general or in some
cases, directors, who are very senior civil servants, but not at the
top. There is a difference in their status. The one exception is HMRC,
where there is a Perm Sec, and that is covered in Schedule 1.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110570000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000204">Non-ministerial
departments are set up in the way they are to keep them away from the
sticky fingers of Ministers on a day-to-day basis. I know it looks like
Topsy, and it is a very unsatisfactory arrangement with the hierarchy
of different bodies, but each one was set up for a reason: to keep
Ministers away from the day-to-day activity. That is obviously the case
in Customs and regulating charities and, certainly, in food. Not having
Ministers involved in the day-to-day working on a hunch has been a big
success. That is the reason for setting them up as freestanding and
funded by the Treasury, unlike executive agencies or non-departmental
public bodies. They are quite different, but they are central
government departments and are all staffed by civil servants, and the
heads, including the chairs of boards—I will come to that in a
moment—are all approved on appointment by the Prime Minister,
after they have gone right through the interview process 
<?notus-xml column=135?>with Civil Service commissioners. They are government departments for
all practical purposes, but they do not have a Minister walking the
floors day to day. Ministers do not like it because they do not have
any policy levers over these government departments, but they answer
PQs and debates, and it is a very satisfactory and British way of
dealing with an
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110570000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000205">So are
they subject to lobbying? Ha! You only have to look at the list. Of
course they are subject to lobbying. Who is subject to lobbying? The
chief execs are. So far as I know, they all have governance boards with
a chair to deal with the governance aspects and they are all non-execs.
I have not gone into that, but I think most of the boards are
completely non-exec. In the case of the Food Standards Agency, it
certainly is, and long may it remain so.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110570000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000206">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:09:46"></hs_TimeCode>
question is whether they are subject to lobbying as government
departments. They are operating, by the way, without phone calls from
the Perm Sec or Minister of another department. They are told that it
is a no-go area: “Take your tanks off my lawn. The legislation
says that I am responsible for this policy. We, as the
agency”—it may be a regulator; most of them are, but
there are other functions—“are responsible under the law
for these areas of policy”. Ministers therefore do not have a
role. They do not sit around the table deciding on the policies. The
agencies and non-ministerial departments do that, and the board deals
with the strategy and governance, so you can bet your bottom dollar
that the chairs and chief execs are subject to lobbying and, as such,
should be treated in the same way as the Government say that Ministers
and Perm Secs should. It naturally
follows<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:10:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

listed was that of a chief scientific officer to a government
department. The Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser is of
course listed in Schedule 1. That is not good enough. They
are incredibly influential in the departments. By definition, they are
all now part time; that was part of the change some years ago to have
all the chief scientists out in the real world. They have got to have a
chair somewhere or be part of another organisation, and give three to
four days to the department. That is certainly the case with Defra and
the Food Standards Agency, as was. That was laid down: they would have
another role and be tied to academia or outside science. Are they
subject to lobbying? You can bet your bottom dollar they are. Should
they be covered? Most
certainly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:11:39"></hs_TimeCode>. They
should be covered for their own protection. It is not a question of
saying that they cannot be trusted, but these bodies are independent
and this applies to all government departments, whether they are
ministerial or
non-ministerial<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:11:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

this—I think I have made the point—but my other point
relates to Clause 26. With the charities part of the legislation, we
have this new rule of one year before the date of the fixed-term
election; now we have that fixed date you can do things that you could
not do before. Different rules will come in. Well, frankly, the
salaried leader of the Opposition and the financially publicly
supported members of a shadow Cabinet, six months before the
election—and they could be the Government after those six
months—ought to be covered. There ought 
<?notus-xml column=136?>to be some kind of rule which includes the
Opposition for their protection. Again, I am not casting aspersions; it
is for their protection. The reality is that all kinds of accusations
will be made during the election period. First, Ministers will be
publishing their diaries and all that during the election. There are
bound to be some people causing trouble, asking questions and things
like that. Within that final six months, the official Opposition,
salaried out of public finds, trying to be the Government, ought to be
covered. That is a crucial period. I have not discussed this with
anybody, by the way; I just came up with a bit of lateral thinking the
other
day<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:13:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110570000209" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110570000209">If the Government are
genuine about the transparency of the lobbying they have to cover as
many arms of government as they realistically can. I deliberately did
not include every single civil servant—the bottle washers,
cooks, cleaners, engineers and whatever. They would be going too far
and would be impractical. We need a tight list that could be practical
and both understood and accepted by the lobbying fraternity,
government, customers outside government and the staff concerned. The
staff would want to be involved because it is about their protection.
All kinds of allegations would be bandied about when things go wrong.
It is much better if you can always say, “We are open and
transparent”. The greatest protection people have is openness
and transparency. Most of the press do not read the open and
transparent stuff until something goes wrong. Then they make all sorts
of accusations, saying that they have discovered this, that and the
other, while things were already there, open and transparent. However,
that means that you do not get the full scare stories of the press or
the leaks, and openness is a good idea. In this case that ought to be
shared by the Opposition. It would obviously be to a limited extent,
because they do not issue contracts. All kinds of lobbying activities
will go on, and it will be useful for everyone else to know who was
being lobbied, who was doing the lobbying, and what they were lobbying
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:15:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_05_PT_1/6744D3B89BF2627836A1ADB5B29361A0708AEBAD" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 November 2013">Tuesday,

important Members of the other House have been special advisers, not

the coalition Government have now insisted that Ministers should do. I
understand the arguments for extending the scope of transparency still
further down the Civil Service chain, but the noble Lord, Lord Rooker,
made a very valid point. It will be difficult to know where to stop, if
you go down the departmental hierarchy. The cases that he mentioned are
not within that hierarchy, of course. If we went further down that
hierarchy, there would be a substantial administrative burden; for the
move to be effective, hundreds and perhaps thousands of civil servants

a significant channel for this purpose. Other officials will deal with
that particular policy area—or a special adviser or the
parliamentary private secretary. In saying that, I have nothing against
special advisers; they play an extraordinarily valuable role
from which Ministers and civil servants benefit. Parliamentary private

admirable amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. I was
never a civil servant. I was a Permanent Under-Secretary but I was

to see Permanent Secretaries. If you are Permanent Secretary at the
Foreign Office, the people who come to see you are CEOs or chairmen of
companies that are in trouble and want the help of an embassy or high
commission somewhere around the world. They do not send government
affairs people, so widening the definition would not bring in Permanent
Secretaries—they come themselves. They certainly do not send a
professional consultant lobbyist to see the Permanent Secretary or, I
think, the Minister. I think they do to see special advisers, so I
think that is a very important addition which has to be brought in.

Permanent Secretary and would therefore not have been covered by the

need to deal with the distinction between the Diplomatic Service and

look very closely at Schedule 1, in which the definition of

I do not know what is meant by the inclusion in the schedule of
a reference to the institutions of the European Union. It is
every citizen’s right to approach the European Parliament, lobby
the European Commission or approach the Permanent Representative and
his office to register their views in the Council. I am not terribly

if these definitional points were tidied up, I am still bemused. I am
not quite sure, despite the noble Lord’s elegant explanation,
what the problem is that we are trying to fix. As the Political and
Constitutional Reform Committee in the other place pointed out, it is
not clear that transparency in lobbying is a significant problem.
However, if it is a significant problem but a problem that applies only
to Ministers and Permanent Secretaries, and that is all, and we keep a
narrow definition, it is a problem that we can solve this afternoon. We
need to change the <I>Ministerial Code</I> and the code of practice for
civil servants, and we need a clear instruction to all
Ministers’ private secretaries that in any contact with a
lobbyist it must first have been established who the client
is—who the lobbyist is acting for. Problem solved. You do not
need a Bill to do that if you are dealing with the narrow problem that

doing it. But where then do you draw the line? When I was Permanent
Secretary, senior trade association representatives or senior company
executives did come to see me and did ask for help. Were they lobbying?
They were not professional lobbyists but were acting for their company
and asking for the support of the Government, high commission or
embassy in question. If you legislate on the activity you need a
recherché definition of what exactly lobbying is. Of course,
that is not in the Bill because the Government have ducked the problem

Lord, Lord Kerr, I was a Permanent Secretary for some 10 years and,
unlike him, was a civil servant. I do not remember in that period ever

among the grades immediately below mine. This debate has therefore

Dubs:</Member></B> My Lords, I was a very junior Minister in Northern
Ireland and, of course, was being lobbied all the time. Such activity
would, of course, be covered by the Bill, except to say that most of
the people doing the lobbying were not consultant lobbyists but
from a range of organisations. Perhaps I may make a few brief
points<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:35:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13110577000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0001.htm#13110577000011">I very much agree with
my noble friend Lord Rooker about shadow Ministers. It is clear that
any lobbyist worth their salt will pinpoint those who will be of
influence, should there be a change of Government after an election,
and make a beeline for them. That is an important issue. I also agree
with my noble friend about government agencies. There were a large
number of government agencies in Northern Ireland, which were a bit
closer to government than the ones in England. Nevertheless, the point
my noble friend makes still applies—I am quite sure that a lot
of lobbying of those government agencies went on, and goes on, which
would not be covered by the definition of a Permanent
Secretary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:36:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to make another general point about civil servants. As I said earlier,
although I had lots of meetings and was being lobbied, that activity
would be covered because I was there. But of course civil servants are
lobbied to secure access to a Minister, and that is a crucial part of
the process. They need not be very senior civil servants but be senior
enough to say to whoever is doing the lobbying, “Yes, I will get
you a meeting with the Minister”. The Minister has to agree to
such a meeting but in the way things are that nearly always happens.
Civil servants who are not that senior can therefore be quite
influential. Indeed, in all my meetings with civil servants during that
time and when people lobbied me, I do not think that the Permanent
Secretary of one of the two departments I represented was there on more
than a handful of occasions. It was all done at a less senior
level<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:37:31"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
bound to say that I cannot work out where the cut-off point should be,
although there clearly has to be one. One of the considerations should
be to include those civil servants who are senior enough to assist in
the process of gaining access to a Minister. That might be a
helpful way of looking at this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:37:55"></hs_TimeCode>. Someone
said that Permanent Secretaries are ultimately responsible. I would
say, “if they know”, because, in the nature of things, so
much is going on I do not believe that a Permanent Secretary could
possibly know about all the contacts made by lobbyists with more junior
civil servants. There is a bit of a problem
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:38:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to comment on advisers. I was not senior enough to have an adviser,
although the Secretary of State had one who helped all of us. I very
much agree with noble Lords who said that political advisers are
crucial in the process. They open doors, can be extremely influential
and give advice to their Ministers, having been lobbied in turn. I am
therefore puzzled. I understand that the Minister has said—we
had meetings on this before Second Reading—that transparency is
what he is after, but I am puzzled as to why the Government are taking
such a narrow view of the way in which the lobbying process works. We
are talking about a process that seeks to influence legislation and
public policy, and the scope of the Bill should be a bit wider to cover
people who lobby in that manner.</hs_para>

Aberdare (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I have listened to the whole

Lady Hayter, told us that two out of 988 meetings with Ministers at BIS
were with consultant lobbyists, so that is not a huge number. One of
the briefings that we have had from the professional lobbying
bodies—from the PRCA—tells us that rarely do
consultancies speak directly to Ministers on behalf of clients,
especially without the client being present, in which case I imagine
that it is fairly clear for whom they are speaking. Furthermore,
speaking to Permanent Secretaries is pretty much unheard of, as has
been confirmed by a number of former Permanent Secretaries in your
Lordships’

addition, the professional bodies tell us that their estimate of the
number of organisations likely to have to sign up is around 100.
Therefore, I fail to understand how this is likely to improve
transparency. Indeed, it seems to me that there is a real risk that it
could reduce the incentive to sign up to some of the voluntary

seems to fall between two stools, and I am not sure which one to rest
on in order to form a view on these amendments. It seems to me that if
we are to have a register, it has to be a broader register that on the

and on the other hand covers a wider range of people who are being
lobbied. I agree that if we are to have a register, it should extend to

rarely lobbied by them. I would be much more attracted by the sort of

Martin of Springburn (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, if I understood the
noble Lord, Lord Tyler, correctly, he feels that more restraint should
be put on special advisers, and I agree with him. I have already said
in this House that it was absolutely appalling that in the previous
Government the Prime Minister’s special adviser 
<?notus-xml column=144?>went about the business of blackening, or seeking to
blacken, the names of the family of a member of the Cabinet. That was
absolutely disgraceful. He then went on to have the absolute brass neck
to write a book. When he was interviewed, he said, “Well, you
see, when I left I did not get any money, so I have to get some money
somewhere”. I say: welcome to the real world. I had constituents
who were in employment for less than two years and they did not get any
redundancy money, but they did not seek to brag about the bad things
that they did.</hs_para>

organisation called CAFOD. Fellow Catholics, like me, are expected to
give to missions on what is known as Mission Sunday, and they do so
very generously. The poorest of the poor set aside funds that they have
worked hard for to give to that organisation, and it really amazes me

they have to go into constituency mode when they go home at the

you are going to land up in the company of one of these consultants.
The local authority could say—it happened to
me—“We would like to invite you as a Glasgow MP to talk
about a certain industry within the city”. When you turn up, lo

Royall of Blaisdon:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise, with my very messy
notes, to support Amendment 3 in the name of my noble friend Lord
Campbell-Savours and to speak to Amendments 18, 22, 29, 32, 33 and 36.
I do so while congratulating the Government on their unique feat of
uniting transparency campaigners and the lobbying industry against the
Bill—including on the issue that our amendments seek to address,
namely the scope of those who are lobbied. I speak as someone who has
been lobbied as a Back-Bench Peer, as a Minister and as a member of the
shadow Cabinet. All the while I was a legislator, but I have also been
a special adviser, albeit to the leader of the Opposition. I agree with
my noble friend Lord Rooker that it is important to include members of
the shadow Cabinet in such legislation.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:50:36"></hs_TimeCode> hear what the

However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T17:50:48"></hs_TimeCode>, these
people aspire to be in government and perhaps within the next year they

that lobbyists play and the invaluable information that they provide.
We should also recognise that in lobbying they have a profound effect
on us as legislators and on the laws that we pass. We therefore need to
keep that in mind, because it is a matter of being open and transparent

tabled in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Royall, I shall
speak also to Amendment 93. I would expect a Bill on lobbying to do two
things. First, it should show who is lobbying whom over what, which was
the issue of the first two groups of amendments. Secondly, it should
raise standards in the industry to help make it a profession, with all
that that implies for ethics, training and good practice. As I made
clear earlier, I am not against lobbying. Like many other noble Lords,
I spent too many years seeking to influence civil servants and
politicians, sometimes with success and sometimes with none, but
always, I hope, by employing honest arguments and with the most open of
motives and the cleanest of hands. For me, it is particularly sad that
the golden

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the Opposition’s
proposed amendment would prohibit lobbying unless the person had signed
up to the registrar’s code of conduct. Their new clause would
require the registrar, after consultation with relevant stakeholders,
to produce a code of conduct which would include a provision that any
inappropriate relations between lobbyists and parliamentarians were
strictly forbidden. Amendment 108, which has been grouped elsewhere,
would enable the registrar to impose civil penalties for breaches of
the code of conduct. The Government are not persuaded that a statutory
code of conduct is appropriate, and I suggest that the proposed
amendments are based on a miscomprehension of the role of codes, either
statutory or voluntary, in the regulation of lobbying. The Opposition
appear to suggest that such codes are in existence and are operating
successfully in other jurisdictions. Perhaps I may draw their attention
to international examples of statutory codes of conduct, of which there
are very few.</hs_para>

professionalism—and requires that lobbyists act transparently,
that they respect confidentiality, and that they avoid conflicts of
interest. That code is not a statutory instrument and there is no
sanction for 
<?notus-xml column=153?>non-compliance other than a report from the
registrar outlining the lobbyist’s misdemeanour. That is
appropriate, because determining non-compliance with these very broad
principles is a challenging, uncertain and subjective
process.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110577000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110577000066">We
have not been able to identify any international precedent for the type

able to propose just one provision for their code of conduct

“I am a registered consultant lobbyist” —or, if

to get some detailed answers to some of these issues so that we can

some of the points being raised as, otherwise, we will not get the

12 has a degree of substance. I have not brought it with me, because I
do not want to make big speeches in Committee, but this is based on
paragraphs 18 and 19 of the report from Graham
Allen’s constitutional reform committee in the other place. The
reality of life is that lobbyists, in return for payment, provide
professional advice on how to lobby but do not lobby themselves. That
is, to a great extent, the evidence that was given to the Select
Committee in the other place about the way that professional lobbyists
work. They go to a company and say, “You have a problem and this
is the way to solve it: deal with it this way and approach these
people. Do it all yourself and we will guide you through”. That
is perfectly respectable—I am not criticising it in any
way—but it is not covered by the Bill. The industry itself says
that is the main way that it works. There has to be a response to that.
I did not follow the details in the other place but the Select
Committee report criticised the Bill as an object lesson in how not to
legislate. This is an important

Rooker:</Member></B> The point behind this is that the Bill is
addressing an issue that does not really arise. The vast majority of
the work that takes place is lobbyists training and advising others how
to do their own lobbying. They will not get caught by this. The reality
is that the Bill will not cover anybody. The numbers are going down all
the while. We will end up with a register with nobody on it; there will
be no fees to run the register. I am not criticising this; it is a
perfectly respectable way to work. I do not want to criticise people
who train others how to lobby; it is a bit like training others how to
legislate. But that is what the industry told the Select Committee in
the other place about how the industry works. This Bill is a complete
waste of time and does not address the issues the Government set out to
address. That is what is behind Amendment 12, simply the way it

they promulgate to the department to act on, and there are no notes. I
have been on the receiving end of it myself in the past four
years—of being given an instruction that came about because of
such meetings where there was no access to the notes because there was
no note-taker present. I did not follow that instruction, by the way.

you say that you must have a note of so that you cannot be
misrepresented later on. It should not require a note in the
legislation but I am suspicious because the Bill does not reflect the
way in which the industry works, so I wonder why we have the Bill and

not think that the Bill will stay as it is but let us assume that it
does: if a lobbyist has personal contact with a Minister or Permanent
Secretary—there is a question over how we define personal

the previous Parliament, one of my colleagues in this place, a
Minister, made some incredibly important decisions one weekend in the
middle of a crisis and did not have a back-up civil servant with him.
It was an issue. It is a protection for the Minister. The civil
servants in the private office will make sure that it happens, as long
as they know about the meetings, of course. That is the other issue:
the meetings have to be in the diary

inadequately, designed to cover deep in the issues in Schedule 1. I
looked at what the Minister in the other place said and, to be honest,
the answers on this aspect were not satisfactory. There is a powerful
case for the in-house lobbyists of a company to be covered; they are

Tyler</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, I read with
interest Amendment 12, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord
Rooker, because there is a serious point here, although I am not sure
that that is the right way to approach it. As I mentioned earlier, way
back in the 1980s, I headed a public affairs consultancy. I recall that
on many occasions I and my colleagues would advise
clients. They were not, on the
whole, 
<?notus-xml column=158?>commercial clients. They were usually trade
associations, local authority associations, environmental groups, the
Countryside Commission, the Rural Development Commission, and so on.
Ministers and their senior team would always rather hear from the
horse’s mouth, not from me as an intermediary. I had some
experience; I had previously been a Member of Parliament; but it was
far more effective for bodies of such reputation to speak directly to
Ministers. So there is the definition suggested by the noble Lord, Lord
Rooker, that not just those who are themselves making representations
but those who, in return for payment, provide professional advice on
how to lobby should be within the
subsection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T18:40:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000002">However,
we may be losing the effective target for the legislation. It would not
be appropriate to deal with the next group of amendments in great
detail, but the critical issue is who meets who when and what is
discussed. In those days, I may have advised a client to take a
particular line, think about the implications, talk to particular
people in whatever context or perhaps given them bullet points as to
what to say. For example, I recall advising a client on what approach
they should take when talking to the then Prime Minister about which of
the options should be supported by the Government for the Channel
crossing. We went into detail about exactly what should be said. We did
not go to see the Prime Minister in No. 10, and Sir Nicholas
Henderson, who was the leader of that particular team, did not take a
great deal of advice from me—he was far too experienced at
dealing with Prime Ministers, not least Mrs
Thatcher<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T18:41:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000003">The
critical issue is the details of the meeting: who, when and how? That
is why, in the next group of amendments, we will address that to a
greater extent. It is important that we concentrate on that. I give
credit to the present Government because they have made that a great
deal more transparent than it has been in the recent past. That is a
real step forward, and we must make sure that the Bill builds on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T18:41:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Royall of Blaisdon" PimsId="485" UID="13110585000163" xid="1719" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000163">Baroness
Royall of Blaisdon:</Member></B> I support these probing amendments
from my noble friends Lord Rooker and Lord Campbell-Savours, and
certainly look forward to the Minister’s response. On Amendment
30, I certainly agree with my noble friend Lord Rooker that such an
amendment would afford important protection to the Minister and his
office but, as he acknowledged, that should be a matter of good
practice, and I am not sure that one can always legislate for good
practice. It will be interesting to hear the Minister’s

noble friend Lady Hayter and I have tabled Amendments 21, 28 and 48 to
50. There are three essential issues: the inclusion of
electronic communications; the inclusion of lobbying about European
legislation; and the exclusion of parts of the schedule that limit the
definitions of
lobbying<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T18:43:02"></hs_TimeCode>. In the
21st century, I think we would all accept that electronic
communications are probably the principal way by which we all
communicate, yet the Bill defines communications as “oral or in
writing” and fails to make clear whether electronic indications
are also included. I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify
that. If electronic communications are not included, I hope that the
Government will consider that issue and, if not, I will certainly come
back with an amendment at a later
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T18:43:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Australian register of lobbyists states that communications with a
government representative includes oral, written and electronic
communications, and the USA register provides that the term lobbying
contact means any oral or written communication, including an
electronic communication. Were electronic communications not to be

about this, but Jeremy Hunt’s texts to News Corporation lobbyist
Frederic Michel about Rupert Murdoch’s proposed takeover of

our Amendment 28 in this group is intended to ensure that the
Government address the issue of lobbying UKRep and senior officials
representing the UK in Brussels. As we all know, lobbying in
the European Parliament is covered by an EU register of lobbyists, but
there is much lobbying in relation to European legislation where UKRep
is concerned. I have to some extent been on the receiving end of it,
although not directly employed by UKRep, and have also lobbied
UKRep<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T18:45:07"></hs_TimeCode>. Brussels
is the city second to Washington in being the kingpin of lobbyists. It
would be absurd if our civil servants working in UKRep, especially the
Permanent Representative and the Deputy Permanent Representative, were
not covered by the Bill. We are not talking about foreign policy; we
are talking about domestic policy and the way in which it is affected
by European legislation and how it is then implemented in this country.
I hope that the Minister will be able to respond favourably to that
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T18:45:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000008">Finally,
our amendments to Schedule 3 would delete paragraphs 6, 7 and 9.
Paragraph 6 can be deleted because it is designed to be a carve-out of
which activities do not count as lobbying. However, we are seeking a
different carve-out in Amendment 39, which excludes a number of
activities, such as someone contacting their MP or making
communications solely on their own behalf. That means that we can
delete the government provision excluding certain types of lobbying.
Our Amendment 49, which would delete paragraph 7, is

importantly, I hope that the Minister will address the
amendments relating to electronic communication and about UKRep,

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank noble Lords, in
particular, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, for the detail of the various
amendments. I will take them all back and consider them. First, on
Amendment 10, it was absolutely the intention of the Bill to capture
consultant lobbyists who lobby as a profession, not the neighbour who
is lobbying for a friend about a housing development, or whatever, for
no payment. That is part of informal campaigning, which is different
from the professional consultant lobbyists with whom Part 1 is intended
to deal.</hs_para>

that that gives him some
comfort<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T18:48:01"></hs_TimeCode>. I also
take the noble Lord’s point, which I had noted in the committee
report, about not only direct lobbying but the sort of indirect
lobbying that comes through professional advice and the danger that
public affairs companies will retreat from saying that they are
lobbying to saying that they are merely providing advice. We clearly
need to ensure that we cover
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T18:48:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000012">On
the question of VAT, the Government were looking for a simple means to
exclude the very small fry from the Bill. It was felt that whether or
not a business has a large enough turnover to have to register for VAT
was the simplest and easiest method to exclude the small fry and
include the large ones. That is the intention. If the noble Lord has a
better way to do it, I look forward to discussing it, but there is
nothing more intended by that
provision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000013">The
noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, had an interesting thought about
whether communications include interventions. I am advised that
interventions are communications, but, again, we will consider in
detail the subtle differences that may occur. I am certainly advised
that it is established practice in legislative drafting that the now
ubiquitous nature of electronic communications is accepted as being
included in the term “writing”, except in cases where the
context specifically demands otherwise. The Bill therefore makes no
distinction between a handwritten note, a typewriter-produced
letter—if such still exist—a dot matrix-printed telegram,
a fax, an e-mail, a text message, a personal tweet or a BlackBerry
messenger conversation, so I assure the noble Lord that the amendment
is not
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000014">On
the inclusion of “European” in the Bill, I understand
that the intention is that lobbying the UK Government in respect of
European legislation will be captured. Our understanding is that
lobbying with respect to government policy, including government policy
towards the European Union, is covered by the Bill but we will look at
that to make sure that it is fully covered.</hs_para>

point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, was about level. When
you are looking at UKRep and thinking about Brussels, it would be best
to think not just about the Permanent Representative and the Deputy
Permanent Representative, 
<?notus-xml column=161?>because in many ways those are figureheads. The real
work is done in working groups by quite junior public servants. Some
are diplomats and some civil servants but they are often in their early
30s and, in those working groups, they are doing serious legislation.
They certainly are beset by lobbyists from outside all the time, so if
you are going wide then you need to look down in seniority a bit, well
below the top
brass.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000018"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13110585000168" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000168">Lord

out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T18:49:59"></hs_TimeCode> to avoid
reading out any of the note prepared beforehand, in order to satisfy
the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter. However, let me read out the paragraph
I have on that. I can assure noble Lords that any lobbying of the UK
Government in relation to European legislation is indeed captured by
the Government’s provision at Clause 2(3)(a), which captures
communications in relation to government policy. Communications in
relation to the development, adoption or modification of the
Government’s policy on any element of European legislation would
therefore be captured by the definition of lobbying as
drafted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000019">The
overlap between what happens in Brussels and London is, I appreciate, a
slightly more subtle issue than that. The question of what happens when
everyone is abroad is a constant of globalisation, and one which the
British Parliament may find it a little difficult to cover entirely by
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000020"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Kerr of Kinlochard" PimsId="1274" UID="13110585000169" xid="1717" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000169">Lord
Kerr of Kinlochard:</Member></B> The question is of how policy develops
in response to a development in the negotiation. Policy is not an
artefact made in London, whole and entire, which stays like that all
the way through a negotiation. Policy has to take account of what
others do or what amendments emerge from the European Parliament. The
process of legislation in Brussels is very much ongoing and the key
figure is often the young man or woman who is sitting in the relevant
working group. Yes, they will be contacting London but they will also
be contacting their opposite numbers. The chances are that most of the
decisions on how we react in a war of movement will be taken on the
ground, without reference up to Ministers. Of course the Ministers will
see every night how we are getting on but, over there in Brussels, the
lobbyists are very close to this. If you are to take an interest in
contact between lobbyists and UKRep, do not cut it off at the Permanent
Representative and Deputy Permanent
Representative.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T18:49:59"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000021"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13110585000170" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000170">Lord

through a whole series of meetings. Capturing every single dimension of
the political process may be beyond the wit of man or woman to achieve.
We are looking here at making lobbying more transparent and capturing
the main actors involved. The Bill specifically includes the lobbying
of Ministers wherever they are: in London, Brussels or Washington. How
far down the chain of officials we go, outside the United Kingdom as
well as inside it, is a matter that we need to consider under the issue
of proportionality and how far we think we need to cover absolutely
everything.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000022">Perhaps
I may turn to Amendment 30, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker,

what we might now be considering. As the noble Lord said, the

noble Lord’s Amendment 51 takes us back to the definition of
directly employed lobbyists versus consultant lobbyists. As I said on a
previous grouping, Part 1 is intended to deal fundamentally with
consultant lobbyists—lobbyists for hire—rather than those
directly employed in the public affairs departments of multinational
companies. From my own experience, perhaps I may say that companies and
banks based in London often operate directly with
government and we know who they are. Consultant lobbyists are
often representing companies based abroad, foreign Governments or
others who are not used to knowing how the British political system
works. That is one reason why they come to consultant
lobbyists, who are specialists. They advise them and then often lobby
for them. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T18:49:59"></hs_TimeCode>That

response. What the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, said in his intervention
regarding Brussels is absolutely right. It so happens that about 95% of
the legislation affecting food in this country, and which is
implemented by the government department—the Food Standards
Agency—is actually European. It starts in Brussels. At the point
when I joined the FSA in about 2009, my predecessor had already decided
to embed someone in UKRep because we were too often too

what happened with the way that the food information regulations were
dealt with in Europe. There was massive lobbying against some of the
things that we wanted to do, such as traffic-light labelling. I will
not criticise people from other countries but the international

described by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr. I will not name them. There are
negotiations and meetings while they are trying to get this stuff ready
for the Parliament, which has more interference now—I meant more
contact and should not have said that; parliamentarians should
interfere but the EU Parliament has a different role now in this

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 54 and 74 are
in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Royall. We support an
independent registrar, which means independent of the industry as well
as working independently of the Government. However, the matters over
which the registrar must judge, the standards that he or she sets and
the objectives set for the office have an importance to Parliament and
to our standards and expectations. We believe that that requires an
organic link to Parliament, not just to the Government of the
day.</hs_para>

that that link is to the elected House, which by its nature
is responsive to the outside electorate and their concerns and
interests. We recommend that the Minister, in making the appointment,
should consult the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee of the
other place and that, in similar mode, the registrar should report back
to that committee on an annual basis.</hs_para>

of the registrar reporting is important. In my view, though, rather
than reporting to a particular committee, it would be more appropriate
to oblige the registrar to produce an annual report to Parliament
itself. If it were going to be confined, I would not just confine it to
the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee of the other place; I
hear what the noble Baroness says, but there would also be a case for
the Constitution Committee of you Lordships’ House being
included as well. My preference would be for a report to Parliament,
but I wholly support the principle that there ought to be a report. As
the noble Baroness said, bringing the registrar within the scope of

been said on other occasions, not least at Second Reading,
there is wide agreement across your Lordships’ House that the
movement towards more transparency on meetings, with reports from
various Ministers about what meetings have taken place with outside
organisations, has been a major step forward under the present

one or two departments have not even got around to publishing for the

the Government took up the suggestion in our amendment, a simple and

enormous lobbying register. We would have immediate access. This would
fulfil my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth’s objectives: we
would have the information, very accessibly, at our fingertips very
quickly. It would not matter whether the lobbyist was a professional

my office we started to try to put together the spreadsheets for
different departments. We just did two or three departments for one
quarter in order to see if this experiment could be undertaken by
anyone—parliamentarians or people outside. Excel itself can then
produce a list of external organisations that have met Ministers.
Quickly we could see who had met Ministers in more than one department,
right across Whitehall. Surely that should be the objective that we all
have. If we can do that in my office, there is no reason why
departments and the Government collectively should not and could not do
so. If it was done professionally, the data would then need to be
parsed to ensure that if a meeting with BT came up, for example, it was
indicated whether the meeting was registered as with BT, with BT Group
or in other formats. Clearly there has to be some moderating
intervention, but in this day and age that is surely not too difficult
or expensive a task to ask of Government in the interests of
transparency, which is surely what this initiative is all about. Then
the result will be a fully searchable database, online, for all to
examine—interested citizens, organisations outside Parliament,
journalists and us. We could see what exactly had happened in the
process of influencing legislation or executive decisions.</hs_para>

effective still, government departments should surely be able to
publish these data at least on a monthly basis. Previously the Minister
explained that he records very carefully all such meetings. Why should
other Ministers not do so on a monthly basis rather than a quarterly
basis? Surely that is no more difficult than doing so on a wider time
basis. Anyone who has tried to influence the Government knows that time
is critical. Get in at the right moment, or you fail. Given the way in
which legislation, particularly statutory instruments, can go through
both Houses of Parliament relatively speedily, if you do not know who
has talked to whom within a matter of a few weeks after their meeting
has taken place, the exercise becomes purely
academic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000040">We
need to see when people have been exerting influence at the same time
as that influence may have had effect, not three or six months later.
These would be very simple but very significant improvements. I hope
that the Government, who have now created a more transparent system for
meetings—the first time that any Government have attempted
this—can see that this is the way to be more transparent still,
and that surely is precisely what Parliament should be asking in the

friend just said. It seems rather silly to have done what is required
in order to be transparent without taking the necessary steps to make
it easy for other people to access that transparency. For example,
ministerial diaries will be done on a daily basis, I assume, or
possibly on a weekly basis, in advance, I hope, so the basic structure
is there almost immediately. I cannot see why the diary cannot
immediately be put out. Obviously, the diary sometimes has to be
corrected, because even ministerial diaries sometimes do not 
<?notus-xml column=166?>actually transpire as intended, but an immediate
correction could be made to make sure that it is accurate. I cannot see
why it could not be done immediately, on a daily basis. Certainly,
weekly would seem perfectly possible. If not, having made what one
might regard as an important step towards transparency, the Government

Lord Tyler, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay. Ministerial
diaries need to be secure about the future. There are security
considerations about ministerial movements. The future is quite
different from the past. I do not see any reason why ministerial
diaries should not be available the following day. I agree that they
need to reflect not what the Minister planned to do, but what he
actually did, and therefore the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, is
quite right, but that can easily be done within a few hours. I see no
reason why they should not be out the following day. I think the
Foreign Secretary’s diary used to be, until a slightly
embarrassing moment in the time of Ernest Bevin. When he was planning
to go to the cinema, the diary said, “Night of love with Mrs

between the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, at
Second Reading and the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler,
today. That is the way forward, but what it really needs is courage.

the Floor of the House of Lords and in the Division Lobbies in the hope
that they will have the support of the Official Opposition for the

concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, but also the
suggestion by the noble Lord, Lord Lang of Monkton, at Second Reading
that an easier and perhaps more effective approach to lobbying issues
might be to require the person in government who is lobbied by
discernible commercial interests to declare that in a lobbying
register. That would perhaps go slightly further than the amendment,
but I think the amendment meets the concerns expressed then. The
amendment would have the added advantage that it would enshrine in
statute 
<?notus-xml column=167?>this admirable initiative taken by the Government so

worried about the speed which is being talked about by the noble Lords,
Lord Kerr and Lord Tyler. I have no objection to getting up-to-date
information but, if I understand correctly, we are talking about the
information going out the following day. There have to be security
implications. When I held of the office of Speaker, I was warned that
there are fixated individuals who watch, stalk, make a pest of
themselves and can be even more dangerous than that. The information
would not only show up who the Minister was meeting but could well show
up the venue, the place where the Minister was meeting. If it showed on
a regular basis over a number of weeks that a meeting was taking place
at a certain venue—let us say that the Minister by preference
wanted to meet in his or her native city and said, “Make it a
Friday at my constituency central office”—it could throw
up a pattern of where the Minister was every Friday or every Monday for
that matter, before they moved down to Westminster. I put that in as a
word of caution. If the information says that the Minister met a
representative from BT or Centrica, I would not be too unhappy, but if
it showed a Minister meeting at a certain venue, I would worry about
that.</hs_para>

the various probing amendments. A number of them, starting with
Amendment 54, are about stiffening the independence of the registrar.

noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, would prevent any person who had
been a civil servant or a political adviser in the previous five years
being appointed registrar. This is also thoughtful, and designed to
provide assurance regarding the independence of the registrar which, of
course, the Government are entirely committed to establishing and
maintaining. Under the Bill, the registrar will be appointed according
to the public appointment principles of open and fair competition and
the Minister will be able to dismiss the registrar only where they are
satisfied that there are reasonable grounds that he is unable,
unwilling or unfit to perform the functions of his office. If thought
unreasonable, any such decision by a Minister could be challenged in
the usual way, by judicial review. The registrar will be independent of
the lobbying industry and the Government, and will have a clear remit
to operate independently of the lobbying industry and the
Government.</hs_para>

The noble Lord, Lord Norton, provides exemptions from the requirement
to publish for commercial or security-sensitive material. This is
certainly an intriguing proposal but, I suggest, neither a feasible nor
proportionate one. At a time when our focus should be on ensuring more
efficient and effective government, a statutory
requirement that every oral or written communication received

new charity, which owes its genesis to the inspiration and
determination of Air Vice-Marshal Stables, then chairman of COBSEO, to
set up a charitable organisation that would be complementary to and
supportive of the many service charities that already exist. Some might
argue that there are enough already, so why have yet another one? Time
is too short to explain in detail. Briefly, however, Stables was
able to persuade the Big Lottery Fund to make a grant of
£35 million to set up the Forces in Mind Trust, and the Royal
Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry has
given partnership support. Those are surely two very resounding votes
of confidence in the concept, place and value of this new
charity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000076">The
trust aims initially to concentrate on transition, a term used to
describe the process whereby service men and women, as well as their
families and dependants, make their individual preparations to leave
the Armed Forces and return to civilian life. For the majority who

significant number who have faced or are facing a difficult transition,
and the trust has focused on that group. The trust’s patron is

<I>Transition Mapping Study</I> report, which is the trigger for this
short debate, is well worth study. Some recurring themes emerge from
it—for example, transition experiences vary greatly, and much
depends on the individual’s attitude to his or her transition.
The differences between military and civilian life are often
underestimated; cultural differences, for example, can come as some
surprise, and even as a shock. Families matter; the extent to which the
service leaver’s family is supportive and able to help is a
strong indicator of likely transition success. Financial awareness is
also important. For many it differs greatly between their service
experience and forthcoming civilian life. The quality and consistency
of the transition process within the services has improved but remains
uneven. After transition the safety net that could be provided by
service charities is hard to navigate. Not everyone who leaves the
Armed Forces is entitled to resettlement support. Even among the
entitled, some lack educational qualifications. Others are required to
serve their final months deployed overseas or distant from their chosen
civilian life. As the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce, says in his
foreword to the report, such individuals are at particular risk of
failing to make a successful
transition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000078">I
will draw attention to some guiding principles identified in the
report, from page 78 onwards, to aid those assisting with transition.
These have been distilled 
<?notus-xml column=173?>from interviewing stakeholders, analysis of existing research and the
research team’s own work and modelling. For example, how can one
best comprehend and encompass the whole context of the experiences of a
service leaver? Moving from a service environment to a civilian one is
not simply about a change of job; it involves a change of lifestyle and
culture, maybe moving home, establishing new friendships, new schools
for the children, greater personal administration and responsible
management of personal affairs. It involves not only the individual
service man or woman but also the immediate members of their

organisations tailor and direct their services to meet the needs and

arrangements. Failed transition cost the state upwards of £113
million in 2012. The financial cost to the charity sector and
individuals will be many times more, not to mention the quality of life
cost to the individual of ill health, family breakdown and even
imprisonment. The report lists 10 categories of failed
transition—for example, homelessness, imprisonment, class A drug
treatment, family breakdown and unemployment. Through an algorithm, it
calculates that the cost to the state in benefits, treatment and loss
of revenue adds up to that figure of £113 million for 2012.

the noble and gallant Lord said, and as was mentioned in the debate
initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, last week, military life is
not just a job but a way of life. Leaving the military can mean
personnel and their families leaving work, homes and communities, each
of which will impose disturbance and uncertainty. In addition, as the
insightful survey by the Forces in Mind Trust makes clear, there are
very varied cultural differences between military and civilian, in
forms of behaviour, language and
expectations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T19:43:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000085">The
transition to civilian employment has been greatly improved since the
days when the military ran its own training programmes with its own,
often somewhat mystical, accreditation. During the many years when I
worked for City and Guilds, we saw expansion in demand from the
military for NVQs and other vocational qualifications. New recruits
sometimes needed basic literacy and numeracy qualifications. Advanced
skills, such as those called for by REME, with its technical and
mechanical prowess, by nuclear submariners in the Royal Navy, or
aeronautical engineers in the Royal Air Force, and many other forms of
skills could be recognised in a way that would be understood and valued
by civilian employers. City and Guilds also worked with higher command
and staff courses to award degree-level qualifications. Over the years,
increasing numbers of personnel have been offered opportunities to gain
university degrees—again, placing them in a better position for
civilian life. So whatever the rank or length of service, all should
now leave with a profile of achievement which equips them for the
employment market. Creating transferable skills is one of the
recommendations in this
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000086">But
there is more to the transition, of course. Ray Lock, the chief
executive of the Forces in Mind Trust, which generated the survey, has
flagged up the importance of practical skills to cope with everyday
life. Military personnel who have spent their service life in barracks
or mess accommodation may have little experience of managing
their personal finances. If food, accommodation, heating and uniforms
have all been provided, it can be a steep learning curve to have to
sort out everyday needs for oneself. As he
says,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13110585000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000149">“soldiers,
sailors and airmen can join up as young as 17 and are cocooned from
civilian life when they are in the forces. As well as missing the
camaraderie and identity of the Armed Forces, they can struggle to deal
with rent, bills and
planning”.</hs_quotefo><hs_para UID="13110585000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000087">The
study found that the worst affected were often young veterans who had
left early. They may have joined up with few coping skills and, in a
short period in service, not managed to build up self-sufficiency. An
essential part of any transition process will include learning the
responsibilities of everyday life. Critical to that is financial
literacy, which should be part of every school leaver’s
education and one of the many areas in which the Armed Forces are doing
considerable work to try to improve the skills of those serving.
Another theme of the report is to create independence.</hs_para>

challenges faced by single people are matched by those with dependent
relatives. In my 30 years, when my husband was a serving RAF officer, I
became very involved in welfare matters, particularly in respect of
wives and families; this was before the days when partners were
officially recognised. The military community has always been
resourceful and capable of innovative self-help projects. I remember
that, through the station executives, it was possible to set up
opportunities, albeit limited, for families to access learning and
training, which would give them some skills and confidence to continue
learning, both during and after their service life. Those were
embryonic schemes, and much progress has been made since then, with
official engagement with the family, which is another theme of the
report. It is important to do this at the earliest
stage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000089">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T19:47:48"></hs_TimeCode>

benefits. I pay tribute to the work of families federations, which have
raised the profile of military family life, identified problem areas

would like to address two areas this evening. One is to do with the
Forces in Mind transition study itself and the second is a wider point
affecting the veterans sector in the UK as a whole. It is a great pity
that the study did not address the singular and very knotty problem of
foreign and Commonwealth personnel as they transition to civilian life
here. There are about 
<?notus-xml column=176?>8,500 such folk in the Armed Forces—some 5%
of the total. It is not known how many of them aspire to British
citizenship, but the annual number of foreign and Commonwealth veterans
who have sought help from the Veterans Aid charity has increased
exponentially over the past seven years and now constitutes some 22% of
those who were seen by the charity this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T19:59:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000094">This
may be due in part to the successful resolution of the Lance Corporal
Baleiwai case. Your Lordships may remember that he was a Fijian soldier
who had served with distinction for 13 years, including on operational
tours in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, but, because
he had had a barrack room fight with another soldier, was threatened
with
deportation.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T19:50:45"></hs_TimeCode>
Following a petition and a relaxation of the rules by the Home Office,
he and his family were allowed to stay. The publicity surrounding this
case may well have given more of those likely to encounter such
problems the courage to seek help. However, if there is a belief that
because of interventions such as that the problem has gone away, that
is not the experience of the charity. If anything, the situation is
worse than it has ever been and the problems do not relate just to
citizenship but to applications for indefinite and further leave to
remain in the country. Many of those affected are service men and women
who have served for less than four years and have been discharged on
medical grounds or made redundant through no fault of their own. They
believe that they have a fair claim to stay, but often do not. Public
perceptions of the wider immigration issue also work to the detriment
of this cohort. Indeed, they are further disadvantaged by the
£1,000 cost of an application to regularise their status, which
is not refundable if it
fails.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000095">A
recent case is that of a former Royal Engineer from Nigeria who left
the Army in September after two years of service, having been medically
discharged. He had lived in the United Kingdom for six years but had
never applied for citizenship. After leaving his Army quarters, he had
nowhere to go. When he went to see the charity, he was sleeping in a
garage and his 18 month-old daughter and pregnant wife were sleeping in
a cupboard. The charity provided immediate intervention but this is not
a long-term solution and the outcome remains
uncertain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000096">Discretion
can be exercised in these cases, but although there are guidelines they
are by no means clear. They are further confused by the bureaucracy
surrounding the applications, which is very complex, even for those
with legal training, and virtually impenetrable to the lay soldiery.
Not everyone can be helped, of course; there are clear cases where the
actions of an individual make him or her ineligible. On the other hand,
a single error on a form can generate rejection or critical
delay.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000097">Things
are happening. A Private Member’s Bill in the other place seeks
to amend the British Nationality Act 1981 so that foreign and
Commonwealth citizens in the forces who want to apply for
naturalisation as British citizens are not disadvantaged because of
time served overseas. Current law states that foreign and Commonwealth
citizens must have been in the UK for five years prior to making an
application, and those who have spent time serving overseas, albeit on
active service in Afghanistan, may have to wait longer to apply than
non-service personnel or those who have 
<?notus-xml column=177?>spent their entire military career in the United
Kingdom. It is clearly a well intentioned Bill that was introduced to
ensure that the military covenant is delivered in practice as well as
in spirit, and it should be applauded. It will, however, address only a
small part of the wider
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000098">This
brings me to my wider point, which concerns the veterans sector as a
whole. There are currently three studies relevant to this
issue—the mapping study itself, the study of the noble Lord,
Lord Ashcroft, and a study being conducted by the Centre for Social
Justice. The latter two have yet to report. We should await the outcome
of these studies before any action is taken. However, coupled with the
recent enshrinement into law of the military covenant, high
expectations have been raised in the veteran community and the many
charities
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000099">We
should not forget that the vast majority of those leaving the Armed
Forces manage the transition to civilian life well. Those veterans in
crisis or real need constitute a relatively small but none the less
important cohort. At the same time, the veterans sector is
comparatively well provided for. The Charity Commission calculates the
net assets of Armed Forces charities at about £1.1 billion, with
an annual gross income of nearly £750 million. However, there
are currently some 2,050 Armed Forces charities from which these totals
are aggregated. This seems a staggeringly high number and suggests that
there is a charity for every 10 members of the Armed Forces. I suspect
that many of them are unsustainable in the longer term and that many,
too, are donor-led rather than needs-led, with good folk having what
seems a cracking good idea and starting up a charity without serious
analysis of the need. The marketplace is, indeed, very
crowded.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000100">Therefore,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T19:55:41"></hs_TimeCode>I suggest that,
however well intentioned all these studies are, the time has come for a
much more radical look at the veterans sector. We should revisit the
notion of an independent veterans’ champion or ombudsman, or
whatever would be the best title to describe him. The Ministry of
Defence is the principal department with responsibility for veterans
and has, through no fault of the individuals, had something like seven
Secretaries of State and seven junior Ministers handling the veterans
portfolio in the past eight years, which is not a recipe for focus and
continuity. This is a source of concern for the ex-service charity
world and begs the question of whether it is not time to look at the
Canadian model of a fully fledged department of veteran affairs with an
enshrined veterans’ charter. Working with the Charity
Commission, this official or department should be able to bring a
better coherence to the veteran sector while encouraging needs-led
rather than donor-led activity and provisioning. It should also allow
the sector to get the biggest bang for its buck, which is certainly not
the case at the moment. It would have a much clearer focus on the
issues across the board and across government and would have the
independence to recommend courses of action to the Government,
untrammelled by departmental
agendas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T19:56:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13110585000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000157">7.57

Battlefield medicine has improved dramatically. Consequently, the
survival rate of members of the Armed Forces who receive very severe
injuries while on active service is much greater than would have been
the case some years ago. As welcome as that is, the net effect is that
many very seriously injured personnel are returning to this country.

transition process. Within that number will be a percentage who, over
time, will present with post-traumatic stress and related conditions. I
should like to think that we as a country will put some resources into
helping research and development into these conditions, which would
have an international application. Perhaps this is one area in which
those in Northern Ireland who have had significant experience can give
a lead—which is certainly our
intention.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13110585000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000158"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T20:03:46"></hs_TimeCode>8.03

was much impressed by the statement on page 15 of the <I>Transition
Mapping Study</I> that the difference between a manageable transition
and a poor one can come down to resources when the safety net provided
by charities for ex-service personnel either works or fails to work,
and by the point that the safety net is hard to navigate, even by those
who understand it. I was impressed because I find this assessment of
the efficacy of the safety net in present circumstances quite
disturbing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000109">My
initial contact with the services was some 55 years ago when
I was called up for national service in the Army. Perhaps I was
unusually fortunate, but two features of the Highland regiment that I
joined impressed me at the time and are relevant to this debate. The
first was that the regiment had strong links with particular areas in
the Highlands and certain areas in the north of England from which
traditionally it had drawn its recruits. The second feature was that
the regiment maintained strong links with those areas by means of a
network of regimental associations that were very active in looking
after the interests of those who had left the service but were in need
of support. We were all encouraged to believe that although we had gone
back into civilian life, we were all still members of the regimental
family. This applied especially to the regular soldiers who had been in
the service for a long time. It was appreciated that they, too, would
be likely to need support. That was why the associations were set up
and why the retired officers of the regiment took such a strong
interest in
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000110">I left
the Army just as the process of amalgamations was starting. To begin
with, the association system could cope with that. The regimental
family was enlarged but was still a family. That all changed when all
the 
<?notus-xml column=180?>surviving Scottish infantry regiments were gathered together into a
single body, the Royal Regiment of Scotland. I make no criticism of the
decision to reform the Army in Scotland in that way, but it has had the
unfortunate consequence that as the links with particular recruiting
areas and the associations that went with them were broken, the old
families have almost entirely disappeared. That kind of support is not
there any more. It will take time to build up a
replacement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000111">I
mention this because I suggest that it makes it all the more important
that the Government pay very close attention to the points made in this
study. The old system, when the regiments could do so much to provide
the support and guidance that was needed in their own areas, has gone.
Of course, as the study points out, there are strong differences
between the culture of the different services, and indeed between the
various units in the Army, too. The system which I have been describing
was suited to the way the infantry regiments, each with its own cap
badge, were organised. However, I suspect that the process of slimming
down has made itself felt across all three services in a similar way.
This increases the need for positive action by the Government, and it
is a point that I think this study is making about the provision of
resources.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13110585000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000112">At
this time of the year one thinks, of course, of the Royal
British Legion and of Poppyscotland, its Scottish counterpart whose
unique poppy I wear. I am troubled by the suggestion that ex-servicemen
find the charity sector, in which these organisations play such a
prominent part, hard to navigate. I doubt whether this can be
attributed to lack of effort by the charities. Each year Poppyscotland
helps thousands of ex-service men and women and their families to
overcome physical, emotional and financial difficulties. It also
supports other veteran charities which provide specialist help and it
has a high profile. Help is available to those who need it if they know
where to go and can bring themselves to seek it. I am quite sure that
Poppyscotland would not be alone in feeling disappointed if the route
to get help from it were difficult to navigate. That is the last thing
it would wish to happen. There are, however, as we all know and as has
been mentioned by my noble and gallant friend Lord Walker, very many
charities in this field, and one can understand that it may be a bit
difficult for those who are in trouble to know where to turn to
because, as the study points out, there is no central conduit for
finding one’s way about.</hs_para>

there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T20:09:31"></hs_TimeCode> seems to
be much force in the points that the study makes, in recommendations
4.6 and 4.7, that there is a clear need for a central tool to be
devised and provided. That would seem to be an important practical step
that the Government might take to address this worrying situation, and

some of the issues raised in the <I>Transition Mapping Study</I>,
published nearly three months ago by the Forces in Mind Trust. The
study reviews how the transition process from military to civilian life
currently works, and how it is viewed by stakeholders and recent
service leavers. That information has then been used to develop an

whole of the impact of unsuccessful

has already been said, the report points out that the cost to the state
last year of Armed Forces personnel not making a successful transition
into civilian life at the end of their service is estimated at upwards
of £113 million. On top of that are the financial costs to the
many relevant charities which become involved and to the individuals
and their families who are directly affected. The report makes 26
recommendations for addressing this issue. It goes on to state that the
cost of implementing many of the recommendations would be but a small
fraction of the £113 million cost figure for last year, when
there were just under 20,000 service
leavers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000117">The
figure of £113 million for the costs of poor transition is
broken down in the report. Alcohol misuse makes up the biggest single
figure with a cost of £35 million, followed by mental
health issues at £26 million. Unemployment costs come
in next at £21 million, with the costs of family
breakdown being put at £16 million. The cost of homelessness is
assessed as being £5.5 million and ending up as a prison inmate
£4.4 million. There are then the more limited costs related to
other matters reflecting poor transition, which bring the total figure
up to the £113
million.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110585000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110585000118">The
report recognises that over the past 13 years there has been an
increased awareness of the issues involved in servicemen and
servicewomen transitioning from the Armed Forces to the civilian world,
starting with the formal statement in 2000 under the previous

why, as a society, we should ensure that those who have served in the

2003, the processes necessary to improve transition from the services

Defence’s <I>Strategy for Veterans</I>, and this was further
developed as part of a Command Paper published in 2008. The 2003
<I>Strategy for Veterans</I> laid down the objectives that transition
to civilian life from the Armed Forces was intended to achieve. It set
out three key pillars, the purpose of which was to ensure that veterans
received excellent preparation for the transition to civilian life
following service, support from the Government and the voluntary sector
where needed, and recognition of their contribution to

enshrined in law for the first time, and provided that no current or

disadvantage compared with other citizens in the provision of public

previous Government. In respect of the general expectations and
aspirations implicit in the covenant, the document said in relation to
transition that support should be provided to all service personnel to
assist in their transition from service to civilian life. It went on to
say that provision should include training, education, and appropriate
healthcare referral and job-seeking preparation and assistance, and
that this should include information and guidance on housing and

aspects of service life: in-service, resettlement and
transition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T20:25:10"></hs_TimeCode>. For
those still in service, the recommendations include: profiling
potential Armed Forces personnel for their aptitude for personal
development; increasing the alignment of military vocational training
with civilian skills; financial awareness training; and reducing the
intensity of deployment. During resettlement, it was recommended that
an assessment be made of an individual’s needs to support them
to make a successful transition. The possibility of conducting work
experience in a civilian environment was also raised, as was providing
more resources, particularly for early service leavers. Finally, during
transition itself, the recommendations include engaging the family,
reviewing post-services housing provision, improving informal
one-to-one support and improving the research and monitoring of former
Armed Forces personnel after
leaving<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T20:26:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord Craig, and others raised the issues of mental health,
homelessness, imprisonment and those who are wounded in service. I hope
to be able to address some of those matters. Some recommendations have
already been addressed by the Ministry of Defence and were in train
prior to the report being published. The early service leavers
initiative, although in effect only since 1 October 2013, was
implemented early following the positive evaluation of the 2012 pilot
scheme. In addition, noble Lords may have seen the media launch in
September of MoneyForce, the new training programme and website to help
improve the financial awareness of UK Armed Forces personnel. Several
noble Lords highlighted this as a serious issue. For the first time
ever, personnel will receive structured financial education during
basic training to equip them and their families with the best
information and tools to make informed financial decisions about their
future. MoneyForce is an excellent example of the Armed Forces covenant
in action.</hs_para>

the disadvantages that mobility brings, in line with the principles of
the Armed Forces covenant. It will support greater lifestyle choice and
the retention of personnel. These two financial initiatives are the
first step towards creating a through-service awareness of transition.

service families are thinking and allow us to discuss ideas and
problems as they arise. We maintain a range of formal and informal
contacts with the three federations. For example, the MoD hosts a
biannual families working group, which brings together the family
federations, the Children’s Education Advisory Service and
welfare policy officials to discuss the key issues. The family
federations have also had direct contact with Ministers as necessary,
including through attendance at annual conferences. Each individual

the onset of mental health problems and providing effective support and

that 3% of those found sleeping rough in north London claim to have
served in our Armed Forces. On leaving the service, the need for social

some aspects of the position of the registrar of lobbyists were

he has no power to remove the head of the Charity Commission without at

Martin of Springburn (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I know that the noble
Lord put this amendment down in good faith. I can see the negative
aspect of consulting with the Speaker and the Lord Speaker. First, the
legislation states that the person who shall appoint the registrar is
the Minister, not the Speakers of both Houses. There is an old saying
that if you hire the person, the unpleasant task of firing them is also
yours. Things would need to get very serious indeed for a Minister to

which has happened with other appointees to the House, where the
individual concerned could appear on the face of it to have a good
personality and to be a likeable person; they strike up a rapport with

remove them. It is easy for the media to indulge in a good person/bad

think that the question that the media would ask is: have the Speaker
of the House of Commons and the Speaker of the House of Lords been
consulted? The Minister might find it quite easy to say, “Yes,
they have been consulted”. If dismissal is to take place, it
goes without saying that the Speakers of both Houses have agreed with
that proposition. If the responsibility is given to the Minister via
the Bill, any difficulties should be left at the Minister’s

that the parliamentary commissioner, whom we have for both Houses, is
appointed for either four or five years nonrenewable. That is a
satisfactory way to deal with the matter: the registrar gets a

there are no hard feelings, whereas the Bill talks about a third
renewed appointment. I have not looked fully into the responsibilities

moving Amendment 65 I shall also speak to Amendments 67, 70, 71, 75,
76, 77 and 113, which are in the names of my noble friends Lady Royall
and Lady Hayter. This is an extensive group of amendments but the main
focus is to expand greatly the amount of information that the register
holds. For example, one of the key amendments in the middle of this
group concentrates on the detail of spending by lobbyists. This is
important as, without these details, it is possible 
<?notus-xml column=190?>only to build up a very limited picture of the
lobbying activity taking place because, as Unlock Democracy says in its
briefing to noble Lords:</hs_para>

disparities and trends in
lobbying”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13110596000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110596000017">Compare
the current, limited proposals in the Bill with the level of
transparency in place in the United States, where it is relatively easy
to find out how much is being spent, and by which companies and
sectors, using publicly available information. For example, the Senate
record of spending shows that Boeing spent $15,440,000 on lobbying in
the US in 2012. General Electric spent $21,200,000. These are very
significant sums and they are spent by in-house lobbyists. As we know,
this can have a marked effect on policy and the discussions around it.
For example, an IMF working paper from 2009 draws a direct link between
the amounts of money spent in lobbying by financial services
firms and high-risk lending practices before the financial crisis.
Ameriquest Mortgage and Countrywide Financial, both of which were at
the heart of the crash, spent $20.5 million and $8.7 million
respectively in political donations, campaign contributions and
lobbying activities from 2002 to 2006. The IMF paper concludes
that,</hs_para>

here. As recently as 2 July, the head of the Prudential Regulation
Authority was reported in the <I>FT </I>as saying that he was going to
draw up rules to prevent the banks lobbying parliamentary officials

we will not get any of the same transparency when it comes, for
example, to lobbying by the big six energy companies. It has been
reported that Ministers from the Department of Energy and Climate
Change have met representatives from the energy giants on 128 occasions
since 2010, yet have held talks with the main groups representing
energy consumers only 26 times during the same period. We need much
more information about what is going on

65 would exclude the option of an individual residence being listed as
the address of a lobbyist. Our concern is that this seems to represent
a potential loophole, which we urge the Government to reconsider. The
effect of the Bill, if passed in its current form, is that the level of
transparency for the register is limited to the individual name and
address of a main place of business or, if there is no such place, the
individual’s residence. This is surely a loophole that would bar
us from knowing who the individual works for. That concern fits into
the wider point raised by our Amendment 67: that an increase in
transparency should allow us to see who is lobbying on behalf of a
company and which members of staff are engaged in that
lobbying.</hs_para>

Norton of Louth (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, my Amendment 115 is in
this group. From my point of view, it is the core amendment in terms of
shifting the 
<?notus-xml column=191?>emphasis of the Bill. As I have drafted it, the clause is designed to be
integrated in the Bill, but essentially it seeks to advance an
alternative to what the Government propose. If the Government insist on
the current provisions of the Bill then, as today has increasingly
shown, it will achieve little by way of making lobbying of Government
transparent; if anything, we are establishing that it may serve to
obscure rather than
enlighten<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T20:50:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110596000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0002.htm#13110596000022">As
we have heard, the focus of Part 1 as it stands is on those who lobby.
As I argued at Second Reading, a more comprehensive approach, achieving
transparency without the need for a clunky bureaucratic framework, is
to focus on those who are lobbied. That would shift the emphasis far
more to the actual activity. My amendment is designed to give effect to
what I argued at Second Reading.</hs_para>

statutory requirement on Ministers when making statements of the sort
enumerated in Clause 3 to publish at the same time details of those who
lobbied them on the matter, that would ensure that the public were
aware of all those who had lobbied the department. I stress the
department because the amendment encompasses civil servants, special
advisers and PPSs. Any representations made to anyone in the department
would be shown. It would not matter who the lobbyists were: full-time
independent lobbyists, in-house lobbyists, part-time lobbyists or
individuals making representations on that particular issue—all
would be caught. We would thus have true, comprehensive

know what the Government’s response will be because the Minister
kindly replied to my amendment earlier, before I had spoken to it. It
is clear what the Government’s position is: “We believe
in transparency as long as it’s not too much trouble”.
That is essentially what was advanced. Yet we have already heard today
a fair amount of material that suggests that it is doable. My noble
friend Lord Tyler has made a powerful case for a database and has
explained how it could be done—it is manageable. My amendment
would take us somewhat further than that in terms of the amount of
information that would be produced, and perhaps the time when it was
produced because it would be drawn together at a particular point, but,
as my noble friend has demonstrated, putting that material together is
not that difficult.</hs_para>

made the case, and I will revert to it, about what Select Committees
do. The Minister was saying, “When a Minister brings forward a
Bill, good heavens, he might receive lots of representations. If he had
to produce and publish those, my goodness, the workload would be
horrendous. How could it be achievable?”. Well, what would
happen if a Select Committee received lots of representation, perhaps
in three figures, when it was conducting an inquiry, and then when it
was doing its report actually had to list those who had made
representations and then publish the evidence? Oh, my
goodness—it already does. Select Committees manage that sort of
exercise on very lean resources, so the Government should be able to
undertake a similar exercise with the resources at their disposal. As
my noble friend Lord Tyler has 
<?notus-xml column=192?>indicated, it is no longer a case of putting together lots of papers
from different sources; much can be done electronically, such as
recording meetings for the database and publishing Ministers’
diaries the day after the event, so we are already getting there. That
is not the obstacle that the Minister was suggesting, so it is not
really credible now to argue that it is not doable; it is.</hs_para>

problem is not the practicality but the political will. If the
political will were there to achieve it then it could be done, and it
would achieve the Government’s stated aim in a way that Part 1
simply does not do. As it is drafted, it would not achieve a great deal
at all; it would create a burden of bureaucracy that would not add much
by way of transparency. If we believe in the transparency of
lobbying—in other words, if we actually want to give effect to
the first words of the Short Title—then this is the route to go.
I look forward to the Minister’s second
response.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110596000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0003.htm#13110596000027"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T20:54:27"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Campbell-Savours" PimsId="2453" UID="13110596000179" xid="1640" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0003.htm#13110596000179">Lord

shall speak to Amendments 68 and 69, which stand in my name in this
group. Amendment 68 is to press Ministers on whether they feel the Bill
adequately covers the possibility that lobbyists may, for whatever
reason, seek to hide the name of the recipient of the payment. There is
a reference in Schedule 1 Part 2 to the beneficiaries of payments, but
I do not think it is absolutely clear what the intention is there. A
person lobbying may be acting on behalf of another whose identity as a
lobbyist is not to be revealed, but where the person whose name or
company name is not to be revealed is the recipient of the financial
consideration. There may be circumstances where a lobbyist has been
subcontracted by another lobbyist to carry out work where the
subcontractor has an expertise which the main contractor lacks, but
where the main contractor does not wish to lose their client account
due to a lack of expertise. There may be circumstances where a lobbyist
subcontracts the work for a particular client to avoid revealing to
another client that the main contractor lobbyist has other clients in
the same commercial sector. There may be circumstances where a lobbyist
hires a subcontractor for Client A to avoid revealing to his or her
client that he is also representing Client B, whose interests are
diametrically opposed. These are but a few scenarios that could include
the avoidance of registrar penalties, potential disqualification as a
registered person or even matters relating to liability to the Inland
Revenue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110596000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0003.htm#13110596000029">Amendment
69 brings us to the heart of the legislation. It dominated debate in
the Commons. It would require the name of the person lobbied and the

transparency and, sadly, the Government are doing very little to bridge

Lords, I welcomed the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. The
amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, goes further and I
welcome that even more. In Amendment 81 I go even further. Noble Lords
will see that it would introduce a register of lobbying activities. It
gives statutory effect to the welcome initiative of the Government in
requiring Ministers and Permanent Secretaries to publish on a quarterly
basis details of meetings they hold with external organisations. This
statutory register would ensure that this practice continues under
future Governments. It would also include details of lobbying activity
submitted by lobbyists. The public would obtain from this register a

will no doubt recognise the language of my proposed new clause. My
approach in framing the clause has been to mirror the provisions
in Clause 4 about keeping a register and in Clause 5 about who
must make returns and the content of returns. In a later group,
Amendment 103 imposes similar criminal sanctions upon failure to make
returns to the register. I realise that some noble Lords might think
that a trifle draconian but, if we are serious about civil servants and
Ministers making accurate returns and they fail to make the return,
what is the sanction? Or if they make a false return, what is the
sanction? However, there is a sanction against

Amendments 82 to 86, 91, 92, 97, 102, 104 and 114, which are all

the registrar to serve an information notice on Ministers, civil
servants and political advisers whom he has reason to believe ought to
have submitted a return. I can imagine that that might well arise if a
lobbyist has submitted a return disclosing a meeting with a Minister or
civil servant in which a lobbying activity took place when there is no
equivalent return from the civil 
<?notus-xml column=194?>servant or Minister. In that situation the registrar would serve an
information return upon the offending party and he or she would be

could determine the involvement of others in the formulation of policy

given to the registrar would make this an effective tool in the search

amendment, so we do not expect that the wording will necessarily be
accepted. However, if it is possible for someone simply to record
themselves as a lobbyist on the register and give only their private

they are acting for—will be missing. One would hope that they
would put in their business address, but if the current phrasing is

We on this side are not at all clear why our proposals for a more
expanded register that would work only if it delivered full

use of the portcullis. This is an issue that concentrated the minds of
Members of the House of Commons Select Committee who considered the
issue of lobbying during the 1980s, nearly 30 years ago. That inquiry
followed the previous inquiries of 1969 and 1974 by the Select
Committee on Members’ Interests (Declaration). At that time in
the 1980s, we had been considering a register for those in the industry
who had access to Parliament, not government. In an attempt to think
through the consequences of adopting such a register, we visited
Canada, a country that at the time had only recently introduced a
system that included registering lobbying activity, thereby going
further than the Government’s current proposals.</hs_para>

Martin of Springburn:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to my
Amendment 73 but, before doing so, I wish to say that I
fully endorse the points made by the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours, in relation to Amendment 72. He may recall
that one particular Member of Parliament decided to publish a
book—an act of fiction—on the front cover of which was
the portcullis. It was clearly there to try to give the impression that
the book was authorised by the House. The Member would not listen but
the publisher did, to the extent that the royal crown—I think it
was the prince’s crown—was taken off the second edition,
although the portcullis gate was left on. That, at least, was
something. It is right and fitting that the portcullis should be the
symbol of both our Houses and not of any individual
organisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T21:25:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

73, I recall the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, saying in an
earlier debate that you have to know whom you are dealing with. That
has to be clear. Those who hold press cards in the House of Commons are
very well looked after, but it is the taxpayer, not their newspaper,
who provides them with a desk and facilities. In fact, I believe that
some journalists do not even have a place to hang their hat at their
newspaper’s head office. I recall that only about five years ago
the health and safety situation here was so bad for
journalists—some of the senior reporters were using
portakabins—that it was put to me that it was time we did
something. Both Houses paid a share of £8 million to refurbish
the Press Gallery. We even opened a restaurant, which is named after a
highly respected journalist called Chris Moncrieff—it is called
Moncrieff’s bar. We did all that and it is lovely. I was there
to officiate at the opening, and so was Chris Moncrieff. I said,
“It’s not bad that two teetotallers have opened up a
drinking
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T21:27:39"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

piece of publicity about that £8 million but nor was there one
good piece of publicity about it. Nothing was said about it. Even now,
I get very angry when I read pieces by journalists who are taking cheap
shots. I also hear them doing it on Sky 
<?notus-xml column=201?>News. They say, “Oh, they’re getting

concern, which is dual membership. You have to know whom you are
dealing with. I could be in one of the cafeterias here having a cup of
tea or whatever and bump into someone who I think is a
journalist. If we enter into a discussion, I know whom I am dealing
with. However, it would not do if the journalist were both a journalist
and a lobbyist. You might ask whether that is possible. It is. Some
people in the Press Gallery have been there for years and years, and
they are entitled to be there, but sometimes their newspaper will say,
“We’re sorry but you’re no longer required.
You’re redundant”. That must have happened to the boys on
the <I>News of the World</I> and there are others in that category.
Some of them get to like this place so much that they will go to a
regional newspaper or a publication and say, “I will be your

always prided myself on being a constituency MP but it has put me in an
embarrassing situation. I remember one employer writing to
me—the head office was in London but there was a factory in my
constituency that made non-combustible boards. The employer was worried
that fire regulations were going to be dropped and that people would
put up plasterboard in airports rather than the non-combustible boards,
which are also called non-asbestos boards. Between 200 and 250
people were employed in the company so I was keen to meet that
employer. I thought that I would be meeting him alone in the House of
Commons and would be able to say, “You’re employing local
labour in my constituency and I will make that representation”.
That is what a Member of Parliament is entitled to do. He was with
someone who I thought was a reporter. I said, “Excuse me, but I
didn’t expect to meet you here”. The person said,
“I am lobbying on behalf of this company”. I took
exception to that and said, “No one needs a facilitator to see
their Member of
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T21:31:20"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110596000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0003.htm#13110596000074">It
is interesting that some of these big companies feel that when they
come to Parliament they need to get themselves a lobbyist, yet small
companies with 10 or 11 employees say, “I’m going
to see the Member of Parliament in the Barmulloch community
centre—that’s where Michael Martin sits on a Friday
night”. They have more nous than the great captains of
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T21:31:57"></hs_TimeCode> do in
these matters. What appalled me was that this reporter was doubling up
as a lobbyist. I think that that is wrong: you are either one or the

the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Martin of Springburn, about the

representatives of any interests in that constituency. As I understand
it—as I recall, this was reinforced in the other place on

rise to support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours,
because he makes a very important point—I am surprised that it
has not come up more in our discussions on the Bill—and that is
this point about a kitemark for lobbying firms. Lobbying has always
been a contentious activity. When I was writing about lobbying in the
1980s I made the point then that quite often the problem is not in the
relationship between the lobbyist and the parliamentarian.
Parliamentarians know perfectly well when they are being lobbied and
essentially where it is coming from and can assess what is happening;
if you like, they know the quality of the lobbying.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T21:36:03"></hs_TimeCode> real
problem, I argued, was between the client and the lobbyist, because
clients would not necessarily know the quality of the firms they were
employing to make representations.
Lobbying<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-05T21:34:59"></hs_TimeCode> firms
are very good at making grand claims for their success rates.</hs_para>

there is an issue of lobbying firms wanting to portray themselves in a
certain way. My concern here is the one made by the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours: you will get firms on the register using that to
promote their interests to potential clients—putting on the
notepaper something such as “Registered lobbyist, regulated by
the Registrar of Lobbying Companies”, as a way of giving
themselves the seal of approval. I fully endorse what the noble Lord,
Lord Campbell-Savours, is trying to do in his amendment but I think
that it raises that broader issue which he has touched on and which we
need to be very much aware of. I am surprised that we have not
considered that to a greater extent. It is just one of the problems if
you go down this particular route of having a formal register,

different reason from that given by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. The
example the noble Lord gave of meeting the employer in the company of
someone who was both a lobbyist and a newspaper reporter highlights the
need for a code of conduct. What is there to stop the lobbyist in that
situation

and phoning his newspaper to tell them he has a scoop—or
whatever it is called nowadays—that the factory in Springburn
has or has not been saved. More subtly, he could tell one of his fellow

maintained. Of course, if there was a code of conduct I would hope that

their officers are, and information about the source and extent of

that I have the option of going to the Parliamentary Standards

Parliamentary Press Gallery credential is also holding a

find that difficult to take in because the Parliamentary Standards

required to declare relevant interests on the register of

can do both as long as they register it. He is not answering the point

are not prepared to legislate, we are prepared to carry on allowing

first circumstance is bringing Parliament into disrepute. I recognise
that the professional associations have their own codes of conduct, but
their codes are not written by Parliament—they are written by
their legal advisers and approved, I presume, by their members.
Parliament, in conditions of a statutory register, although not
included in the Bill, needs to seek protection against being itself
brought into disrepute through the actions of lobbyists who are not
subject to a code. We will all be aware of the well documented and
publicised scandals of recent years and that a small minority of
lobbyists can abuse their relationships with Members of Parliament. The
same applies with civil servants: if a lobbying operation is found to
have compromised the integrity or independence of a civil servant, it
is not just the civil servant who is necessarily at fault; a heavy
burden of blame inevitably falls on the lobbyist. We need to be sure
that the lobbyist concerned loses his or her official seal of approval,
which is effectively what registration
provides.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110596000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-0003.htm#13110596000098">As
to the wider issue of offences under Clause 12, there can be no

is important to bear in mind that under Clause 1, a person cannot be in

appropriate sanctions in respect of non-compliance with the register,
Ministers considered the option of removing a person from the register,
thereby prohibiting them from continuing to operate as a lobbyist.

a penalty, as it would essentially take away their

reasonable doubt in a criminal court, yet the Opposition’s

as to whether the Act had been breached, and to impose sanctions on the

sure that there is not a lacuna here. I appreciate where the noble and
learned Lord is coming from, with a genuine concern on this issue. If
one were to accept some of his other amendments, the case for writing
into the Bill the appeal to the tribunal would be stronger. If a person

they could advise him or her accordingly and reregister without

would amend Clause 16(3) so that the maximum amount for a penalty
notice would be reduced from £7,500 to £5,000. I note
that his point of comparison is the Scottish civil penalty. In setting
the maximum amount for a penalty notice at £7,500, the
Government were mindful of comparable regulatory regimes, such as the
fines imposed by the Companies Act in relation to the late filing of
accounts, and we took that as our comparator. The Government are
confident that the proposed limit of the civil penalty is thus an
appropriate one and are not persuaded that it should be
reduced, although of course the registrar is able to issue
civil penalties of any amount up to £7,500, so not in every case
would it be the amount.</hs_para>

Woodhead tunnels are located on the former Manchester to Sheffield
railway line, known as the Woodhead route, which was closed to
passenger traffic in 1970 and to freight in 1981. The original single
bore Victorian tunnels were replaced in 1953 by a new tunnel when the
line was electrified. In the 1960s, National Grid bought the Victorian
tunnels and installed high voltage cables to transmit electricity. When
the line finally closed in 1981, National Grid purchased the modern
tunnel with a view of installing new cables in the modern tunnel and
abandoning the Victorian tunnels when cables needed renewing some 30
years
later.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110573000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-wms0001.htm#13110573000036">In

2007/8 Ministers received many representations urging them to protect
the Woodhead tunnels so that the Woodhead route could be re-opened to
rail traffic in the future. There was no case then for taking any steps
to halt National Grid’s plan but Ministers did agree to
consider, at the appropriate time, whether or not to instigate an
inspection and maintenance regime on the Victorian tunnels This would
leave open the option to move cables back into the Victorian tunnels 
<?notus-xml column=13?>and re-use the modern tunnel for rail traffic in the future. With
completion of the work imminent, that decision needs to be made now

2008, much has happened which has helped inform my decision. The
Government has committed funding to the Northern Hub programme. This
includes schemes to increase capacity and line speeds on the Hope
Valley route. A study recently carried out by Network Rail indicates
that demand for travel between Manchester and Sheffield could more than
double in thirty years. With the planned investment, the Hope Valley
line and its trains could accommodate this growth. If freight grows,
schemes have also been identified which could enable more freight
trains to
run.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110573000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105-wms0001.htm#13110573000039">The

route was ever required between Manchester and Sheffield, it is

Crossrail, the best solution is most likely to be the construction of a

LIBOR is a benchmark used by the market for the
pricing of various financial contracts. In some cases, attempts at
manipulation were to lower the final LIBOR rate, and in others they
were to increase it. Such attempts may only have moved the overall
LIBOR rate by a fraction of a percentage point, if at all.
Consequently, it is very difficult to establish any sort of net effect
from the attempted
manipulation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13110569000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105w0001.htm#13110569000012">However,
the Government takes the attempted manipulation of LIBOR very

Our principled position remains to return RBS back to full private
ownership when it is in the interests of the taxpayer to do so. This is
also the case for Lloyds. The Chancellor has taken the first steps to
return Lloyds to the private sector and will continue to consider
options for further share sales. The Government is not setting out a
firm timetable or target price at this stage and the Noble Lord would
not expect us to do so. For RBS however, share sales are some way
off.</hs_para><hs_TabledBy UID="13110569000264" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131105w0001.htm#13110569000264">Asked

fraud is received, proper consideration is given about whether or not
to investigate. Should the investigation reveal the suspect could be or
is suffering from a mental illness, the Department's fraud
investigators comply with the Codes of Practice under the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984. This includes ensuring that an appropriate
adult attends the interview with the suspect if appropriate. Further
consideration is then given by the Fraud Investigator's manager on a
case by case basis as to whether the investigation should be referred
to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration of a prosecution.
Should the matter be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service, any
mental health issues will be considered in accordance with the
principles set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and their official
policy on prosecuting mentally disordered offenders in reaching their
decision.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question">

Free television licenses are available to those aged 75 and over. They
are not made as a cash payment, and therefore making this benefit
taxable would be complex to deliver. Therefore the Government has not
