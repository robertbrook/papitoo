are certainly concerns about motorcycle deaths—motorcycles are
particularly dangerous. We have targeted motorcyclists, in particular,
in our Think! campaign. Of course, in some cases motorcycle deaths are
very much related to the weather. In North Yorkshire, certainly, when
we have a nice summer there are, sadly, an awful lot more motorcycle
casualties. It is of concern that we are seeing more cycling
casualties, and I have noted some of the accidents in London involving
heavy lorries and cyclists. Some of that is due to the fact that there
has been a big increase in the number of people cycling, but it is of
concern and we are targeting our information campaigns on
motorcyclists and cyclists.</hs_Para>

doing Bills. First Reading—outcry; Second Reading—lose
the argument but stubbornly refuse to listen; go to the
Lords—hit the emergency pause button and say that he will do all
the things he should have done before he published the Bill in the
first place. This is just like what happened on the Health and Social
Care Bill. Everyone who will be affected by the lobbying Bill opposes
it. Just like on the health Bill, he cannot make the case for his
proposals because there is no case for them; and just like on the
health Bill, he is disguising his true intentions because he knows he
has no public support. Will the Leader of the House tell us how he
intends to use  the next six weeks to “listen, pause and
reflect” on the lobbying Bill, and will he commit now to making

so-called new private sector jobs involved zero-hours contracts; and he
decided that the appropriate way to respond to a question about the
rights of pregnant women not to be sacked was to have a cheap shot at

as such, but I will ask the relevant Minister at the Department for
Education to respond to those issues. As the hon. Lady says, the
state’s responsibility as a corporate parent to children has
often not been discharged as well as it ought to have been. Clearly it
is important that we improve the quality of the placements that we
achieve for looked-after children. The Children and 
<?notus-xml column=423?>Families Bill made good progress through this House, when it was the
subject of extensive scrutiny, and it continues to be the subject of

success in increasing our exports to China, India and
Brazil—some of the emerging economies —but we all
recognise that we need to do more. We have some great businesses, but

access to dialysis here compared with in other countries. The previous

point with the welcome progress that is being made in his constituency.
As I said earlier, the resources and support that the Government are
giving to UK Trade &amp; Investment are making a difference. The way in
which the Foreign Secretary has reoriented the priorities of the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office and our diplomatic posts around the
world is making a difference. The support that the Government are
giving to bilateral chambers of commerce is making a difference too.

groups with active GP involvement gives an opportunity for that to be
reconsidered, in particular by GPs who recognise the

step-down care after admission to acute services. We might see
a reduction in the number of beds in the most acute

At the moment, there is still an attractive promotional aspect of
tobacco, which is the packaging. We want all tobacco packs to be
uniform, including the colour of the pack, and to allow the promotion
of strong anti-smoking and pro-health messages. Evidence is emerging

standardisation of packaging, including

The vast majority of smokers begin smoking in childhood. Two thirds of

young people under the age of 15 begin to smoke every year. When you
add in the people that begin to smoke between 15 and 18, it becomes
300,000 smokers per year. Once someone is hooked, it is very difficult
to give up. Most people say that after the direct sale of cigarettes to
minors was made unlawful, many young people still continued to start
smoking. Cancer Research stated in 2011 that more than 200,000 young

young people start smoking, they are likely to continue for the rest of
their lives. Smoking causes much more damage to young lungs, which
increases the likelihood of young people dying from smoking-related
diseases. The tobacco industry is desperate to retain its market share,
and to recruit new smokers every year. After all, older smokers either
quit or die, and younger people also die from smoking-related diseases.
Most of the new smokers will be children. In my constituency, about 550
children start smoking every year. That is a scandal, and I want to see
that figure radically reduced.

of whom live in some of the most deprived wards in the country. We need
to take active steps to reduce the incidence of smoking, and to
implement measures to prevent future uptake. The decision to delay
progress with standard packaging will needlessly condemn hundreds of
thousands more to a life of addiction because some think it
“cool” to smoke. Plain packaging fits the bill. Not only

Pressure on smoking must be continuous and relentless, because we

Incidentally, in the United Kingdom fewer people are attempting to quit
with the help of the national health service for the first time in five

results in the death of half its long-term users. Fifteen months have
now passed, so we have had another five months during which we have had

when they are too young to make a truly informed choice, we are failing
to provide each child with their very basic rights. The reform is

passive smoking, we banned smoking in public places; to prevent

therefore strongly believe that the arguments against plain
packaging—standardised packaging—and the justification
for the Government’s “wait and see” approach are
inconsistent. First, introducing standardised packaging is not aimed at
stigmatising adults who already smoke. This is not about limiting
choice for adult consumers; standardised packaging does not change what
is inside the packet, but is a measure to protect children who are more
easily influenced by marketing. Secondly, some hon. Members have argued
that introducing such a measure would limit the tobacco
industry’s right to advertise. Instead, we should be asking
ourselves whether, by allowing the continuation of the status quo, we
are infringing on the right of every young person to have a healthy
childhood, and increasing their chances of taking up a habit that could
have significant health implications for them for the rest of their
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T12:37:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

regrettable that I, along with many other hon. Members, must persist in
relaying the facts to a Government who, as of yet, seek to ignore the
evidence in front of them. This country has been an international
leader in public health policy and we should continue to be so. We will
have standardised packaging at some point in the future—it is
just a question of when. Fundamentally, standardised cigarette
packaging is about improving the nation’s health and giving each
child the best possible chance of living a healthy life. The choice is
theirs when they are an adult, but the responsibility is ours now. I
urge the Government to
act.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/7B2A1D2B8A38DEDD355791214F74DAE65CC7759E" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="7 November 2013">Thursday

there has been a huge change in the

surrounding smoking since I was a child. I do not know whether anyone
in the Chamber is as ancient as me, but if they are, they will remember
a television advert saying, “You’re never alone with a
Strand”. It had a picture of a glamorous, enigmatic man with the
collar of his raincoat turned up. He was smoking, and every man wanted
to be like him because he was glamorous and mystifying. Hollywood
stars, who appeared to spend their entire lives in evening dress, had
long cigarette holders and the practice was presented as glamorous,
attractive and sophisticated. People of my age at that time could not
wait to grow up and reach 16 so that they could smoke—everybody
did—because it was a sign that someone had grown up. I
suppose that it was a blessing that I was brought up poor and working
class. I could not afford to buy cigarettes and I should probably be
grateful for that fact now, as it meant that I never took up
the habit.</hs_Para>

When I was young, price was the one thing that stopped me smoking. Had
I been able to afford it, I probably would have tried it. The NHS study
“Smoking, drinking and drug use among young people in England in
2011” reported that 5% of 11 to 15-year-olds smoked
regularly—that is, at least one cigarette a week. That sounds to
me as though one child who could afford a packet of cigarettes was
handing them around to their friends. That was half the number reported

over common sense, and tobacco is no different. Stopping young people

Smoking prevalence has fallen among adults by a quarter and among

preventable disease and death. It far outweighs the next six major
causes. When it comes to public health and to children and young
people, we have a special duty, over and above that which we owe to all
our fellow citizens. That duty is clear: we should act. Above all,

tobacco must attract children. Why? Because its product kills 100,000
of its customers every year in this country, and it needs to replace
those dead customers. The evidence is clear. Smoking is a childhood
addiction, not an adult choice. We need to understand that. Some 40% of
smokers are addicted by the age of 16, and two thirds are addicted by
the age of 18. Two hundred thousand children take up smoking every year
and about 530 of them do so in my borough, the London borough of
Sutton. Very few people start smoking over the age of 20, as we have

people to exercise a democratic choice at the age of 16, but that is
not today’s debate. Although I would hope that voting was an

average of one in five people in England as a whole. As a consequence,
we have much higher rates of smoking-related death in Salford and a
higher incidence of lung cancer, with 175 new cases of lung cancer

1950 the figures were much higher: around 80% of men and 40% of women
smoked. Amazingly, cigarette advertising at the time used images of
doctors and celebrities to promote the different brands. One brand even
used images of Santa Claus smoking—imagine that in the run-up to

changing perceptions of smoking. That is important for our children. A
review commissioned 
<?notus-xml column=462?>by the Department of Health and the Public Health Research Consortium

in conveying messages about the health implications of smoking and more
likely to reduce the mistaken belief that some brands are safer than

damaging, which is also untrue.

the tobacco advertising I have talked about is pernicious. However it
is done, whether with slim packages, colouring or making it look like
perfume, it focuses on young people, and particularly young women who
want to remain slim. It is almost unbelievable that tobacco companies
used to use Santa Claus and doctors to promote smoking and try to
persuade us that it was safe. I do not want to continue to see 1,000
young people in Salford start smoking each year. It is time we took the
next important step to close down cigarette advertising by introducing
plain packs. It is time to prevent our children starting smoking. It is
time the Government supported the amendment to the Children and
Families Bill that will take that important step. Above all, it is time
to reduce the large numbers of people affected by smoking-related
illness and early death, both in Salford and across the
country.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/E0C65F6A6E5B576504F104105B6B844EDB531810" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="7 November 2013">Thursday

However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:09:52"></hs_TimeCode>, my

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:09:52"></hs_TimeCode> look at the
matter from the perspective of a member of the Public Accounts
Committee, which recently produced a significant report on the impact
of tobacco smuggling on the loss of tax revenue in the UK. Having seen
the evidence, I came to the strong conclusion that the case for plain
packaging is certainly unproven.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South said that she wanted to ensure
that 1,000 children in her constituency do not take up smoking. I
wonder what the evidence is to suggest that those 1,000 children will
not take up smoking simply because of a change in the product’s
packaging. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:15:58"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron) explained that he
started smoking by stealing cigarettes from his father. I wonder
whether his father’s choice of brand had any significant impact
on his decision to steal a single cigarette. When I was growing up in
Caernarfon, when people wanted to smoke they went to a local post
office to buy singles. I suspect that they gave no consideration
whatsoever to the brand; the point was that they could buy cigarettes
very cheaply, usually one at a time. It was an important development
when that was made an illegal practice 
<?notus-xml column=463?>that would not be tolerated. However, it is still the case that the
driver is the price, not the branding. That is what I want to talk
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0002.htm#13110788000106">When
the Public Accounts Committee researched the smuggling of tobacco
products into the UK, some of the information that emerged from that
work was shocking. For example, in the top 10 recognised consumer
brands of cigarettes in this country there are often two or three that
are illicit and that it is illegal to supply in this country—for
example Jin Ling, Richman and Raquel. Strictly speaking, those brands
should not be available and so they would not be affected by
legislation on plain packaging, yet independent consumer surveys show
that those brands, despite being illicit and illegal, are recognised by
the
public.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0002.htm#13110788000107">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:17:29"></hs_TimeCode>
question we must ask, therefore, is why and how those brands are
gaining a foothold in this country. Clearly it is unacceptable that
they are smuggled into the country, and at such a rate that they are
now recognised consumer brands. The key point we must recognise is that
the driver for the sale of those products is not the branding or the
so-called attractive packaging; it is the price. A packet of 20
cigarettes costs between £7.50 and £8. My son, who is
lucky enough to have a paper round, would have to spend half his weekly
wage if he decided to buy a packet of cigarettes legally, yet he could
go out to any estate or high street in my constituency and, if he was
switched on, find a packet of illicit tobacco for between £2 and
£2.50.</hs_Para>

therefore argue that the driver encouraging young people to start
smoking is more likely to be the price than the branding. If a young
person can buy a packet of 20 cigarettes for 15% or 20% of their weekly
paper round wage, they would be more tempted to do so than if they
could buy it for 50% of their wage. By concentrating on plain
packaging, we are ignoring an important fact: price is a driver for the
sale of these products.</hs_Para>

and again hon. Members have argued that plain packaging is about
protecting young people, yet in university towns the young people often
smoke roll-your-owns. The figure for roll-your-own tobacco is
absolutely atrocious. In my constituency, which has no higher education
facility, 48% of loose-leaf tobacco will be smuggled and illicit. The
vast majority will not be recognised UK brands. In any town with a
university or further education college, the percentage of illegal and
smuggled loose-leaf tobacco will be even higher. What is the driver?
What is persuading young people to buy tobacco products that are not

price.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0002.htm#13110788000110"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:19:59"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Barbara Keeley" PimsId="4794" UID="13110788000677" xid="910" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0002.htm#13110788000677">Barbara

absolutely furious. Indeed, I lost my father to lung cancer at the
young age of 63. My children never saw their grandfather simply because
of his smoking. If the evidence was clear that plain packaging would be
the answer, I would be supportive. I find it very odd that Members are
saying that looking at the evidence is somehow condemning people to
die. That is emotional and unacceptable language.</hs_Para>

officers thought that plain packaging would lead to an increase in the
size of the black economy in relation to tobacco products. A full 62%

key thing we need to remember is that time and again this place has
legislated in haste. There is a significant question mark over both
sides of the debate. What the Government have said is very simple: let
us see the evidence and consider it. If the evidence from Australia and
other countries that decide to go down this route proves that there has
been a reduction in the use of tobacco products, a reduction in illicit
tobacco being taken into the country, a fall in the availability of
illicit products, and a fall in the number of smuggled

moving to legislate.

than the facts. We should congratulate the Government on being willing

absolutely support the principle of standardised packaging of tobacco.
I believe that it should have been introduced a long time ago and that
it should have had a higher priority than a ban on point-of-sale
displays. That is because introducing standardised packaging would have
resulted in the end of displays of cigarettes, as the adverts that
those displays created would no longer be created by standardised
packets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:26:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0002.htm#13110788000121">The
decision not to proceed with standardised packaging has rightly been
criticised. Questions about whether advisers have unduly influenced
senior Conservative politicians are perfectly legitimate and do not
seem to have been properly addressed. However, equally disturbing are
the interventions by the unions, with bogus claims that standardised
packaging will result in significant job losses in the packaging
industry. I would have hoped that Labour Members would be just as vocal
in condemning those interventions as they have been in questioning the
influence of Conservative party advisers, but sadly
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:27:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0002.htm#13110788000122">The
Government’s argument for delaying a decision on standardised
packaging was based on a perceived lack of empirical evidence that it
would discourage young people from taking up smoking. I would have
thought the fact that the tobacco industry has spent hundreds of
thousands of pounds, and more, in trying to lobby against standardised
packaging would be evidence enough. Why would it spend so much money on
trying to stop something happening if it was not going to have an
impact on levels of
smoking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:27:44"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0002.htm#13110788000123">If
that is not evidence enough, may I bring to the Minister’s
attention early-day motion 559, in my name, which highlights research
by the British Heart Foundation into standardised packaging for
cigarettes in Australia? It interviewed 2,500 young people and found
that more Australian teenagers than UK teenagers had been discouraged
from taking up smoking, owing to the standardised packaging. Fifty-nine
per cent. of Australian teenagers said that standardised packaging
deters them from smoking, and 77% of UK teenagers and 66% of 
<?notus-xml column=466?>Australian teenagers support it.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T13:28:26"></hs_TimeCode> that is still
not enough for the Minister, perhaps she could look at the findings of
the study by Cancer Council Victoria, which showed that when young
people view packs stripped of colours and logos, they believe that the
cigarettes are lower quality, will taste worse and are less
appealing.</hs_Para>

my opinion, the evidence is clear: standardised packaging does
discourage young people from taking up smoking, and we should introduce

step further? A lot of research was carried out to work out the most

rationing themselves, and people who are trying to cut down on smoking
will also buy them. I understand that this is about increasing the
price of the first packet of cigarettes that someone buys, but making
people buy 20 cigarettes at a time will increase the amount they smoke
and encourage them to smoke more. That will be the unintended
consequence of what is probably a well-intended piece of EU legislation

seriously harmful and clinically proven to kill. Smokers advertise
tobacco brands to other people every time they take out their pack to

that standardised packaging makes health warnings more effective and

approach.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0002.htm#13110788000171">The
third claim I want to counter is that the proposed changes to tobacco
packaging are somehow a symptom of the nanny state. People should, of
course, be allowed to make their own decisions, but we should not be
standing by while industry sets honey traps and uses every means at its
disposal to try to make those decisions for them. Nearly all new
smokers are children, we are dealing with an addictive product that is
clinically proven to kill, and smoking rates are higher among the most
vulnerable groups in our society, particularly children in residential
care. That is why today’s debate is so important.</hs_Para>

conclude with my most important point, which is why we cannot afford to
delay. The Minister has previously made clear that the
Government’s position is to wait and see. Her predecessor did
the same, despite saying that she personally had been persuaded of the
case for standardised packaging a few months previously. Just today,
about 570 children across the country, none of them older than 15, will
have their first cigarette, and approximately 71 will have done so
while we have been debating this subject. If we wait and see, we will
be standing idly by while hundreds of thousands of young people become
victim to this deadly addiction.</hs_Para>

Opposition have made their position clear. If the Government wish to
bring forward legislation to make standardised packaging a reality,
they can count on our full support. That was our position before the
Government changed their mind about this issue in July, and it is our
position now. The Children and Families Bill is making its way through
the other place. Labour has tabled an amendment to that Bill to
introduce standardised packaging that will be debated in the coming
weeks and voted on later this year. That simple measure would make a
huge difference and is clearly supported by Members on  all
sides of the House. On behalf of those 71 children who have started
smoking during this debate, and the 200,000 who will start every year,
I urge the Minister and her Government colleagues to do the right thing
and support our amendment. Let us save future generations from the
perils of
smoking.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_07_PT_1/D58EB36872975A42560B5EB629ACB582D18F36B9" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="7 November 2013">Thursday

Members have said, tobacco use remains one of our most significant
public health challenges. For me as a new Minister, over the past month
briefing after briefing and chart after chart have illustrated how
important and what a significant public health challenge tobacco
control is. There is no question in my mind that it is an essential
aspect of any Government’s commitment to reduce the number of
people dying prematurely in our country, and it is essential to
promoting the health and well-being of children. A number of speakers
have made the point that two thirds of smokers say they were regular
smokers before they became adults. Many have spoken about adult choice,
but we must recognise that by the time many people are addicted to
smoking, they are already an adult and the addiction started as a
child.</hs_Para>

standardised packaging would have in this country. It is sensible and

although at times in this debate it has been possible to miss that

good, and we will continue to implement our existing plan to reduce
smoking rates while keeping the policy of standardised packaging under
active review. The tobacco control plan for England sets out national
ambitions to reduce smoking prevalence among adults, young people and

very complex, and are to do with family and social circumstances. One
policy alone will not address that. Local authorities have a vital role
to play, which is why we have given local government responsibility for
public health backed by large ring-fenced budgets—more than
£5.4 billion in the next two years. I encourage all hon. Members
who have participated in today’s debate to ask tough questions
of people locally. I hope that they are talking to their public health
directors, health and wellbeing boards and clinical commissioning
groups about where tobacco control sits in the armoury of local
government. That is why this power has been devolved. The local insight

have some of the highest priced tobacco in Europe and we will carry on
with our high tax policy. That is coupled with an effective strategy,
led by HMRC, to reduce the illicit tobacco trade, which has been
mentioned in the debate. However, we must not forget the great progress
that has been made. As I said, less than 20% of adults in England now

see the figure fall still further. The Government, working with other
interested parties, are trying to drive down the size of the illicit
tobacco market through improved enforcement and reducing opportunities
for fraud. I am grateful to those hon. Members who have made the point

I am wholly in favour of standardised the packaging of tobacco

been advanced against its rapid introduction. The first concerns the
illicit trade. In reality, the illicit trade continues now, but the
evidence is that through the security marking of packaging and
cigarettes themselves, and with greater vigilance from our customs and
excise people, the illicit trade can be stamped on hard. The tobacco
industry, which is against standardised packaging, uses the illicit
trade as an excuse.</hs_Para>

we have heard that the big tobacco companies would use the money they
currently spend on packaging to cut the cost of tobacco. My answer is
to increase the tax. We must ensure that tobacco is expensive so that
people are discouraged from purchasing it.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:14:45"></hs_TimeCode>Thirdly, the key
argument from those who oppose the measure seems to be,
“Let’s delay and prevaricate. Let’s wait 
and see what happens. Let’s wait for everyone else to decide,
and then take action ourselves.” As we have said, 300,000
under-18s start smoking every year, so the longer we delay, the greater

would like to set out the Government’s thinking on the four-year
centenary of the first world war and give a flavour of the philosophy
underpinning its approach. The great war may be the keystone of our
times but our understanding of it is not very good. Polling data
suggests that the public know that there was a war in 1914 and have a
pretty good idea of who was on what side. They know about mud, trenches
and iconic things such as the Christmas truce. Thereafter, it starts to
get a bit hazy. Improvement of our grasp of the causes, conduct and
consequences of the first world war must be at the heart of the
centenary that is about to break upon us.</hs_Para>

what exactly should we be remembering? The remembrance
that the Prime Minister was talking about involves
so much more than simply bringing to mind experiences that few of us
have had or people we have never met. Remembrance is not synonymous
with recollection. This Sunday is Remembrance Sunday, not recollection
Sunday. It is an opportunity to acknowledge the fallen, while
consciously reflecting on the nature of war and resolving to avoid it.
That is what we mean by remembrance. We also give thanks that, peace
restored, the great majority who served in the first world war did
actually return to raise their families—our

we commemorate the centenary of world war one, there will be those who
say we should seek to understand the fundamental question of why
Britain went to war in the first instance. A recent poll for British
Future asked how much people knew about the war. Its polling showed
that 66% of people knew that world war one began in 1914,
that 47% knew that the war was in part sparked by the
assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and that 9% knew that Herbert
Asquith was the British Prime Minister at the start of the
war.</hs_Para>

polling will not capture, however, is the extent to which the public
understand the original motivations for the war. A student of history
might conclude that, aside from the strategic rationale,
Britain’s motives for entering world war one demonstrated a
conscientious effort to uphold international law and a desire to defend
smaller, more vulnerable nations. There will be those who will seek to
have this informed debate, but there should be no doubt about the
profound impact of this war.</hs_Para>

people know something of the 750,000 British soldiers who died or the
1.5 million soldiers who returned home injured. They may have heard
something of the 20,000 British soldiers who were killed on
the first day of the Somme or they may recall Wilfred Owen’s
imagery of choking soldiers drowning in a sea of chlorine gas. They

profound impact on Britain too, and many countries in the Commonwealth
sought independence after it ended. Britain lost its place as the
world’s largest investor, and the role of 
<?notus-xml column=488?>women changed for ever. By 1931, 50% of women remained single, and 35%

other great social change that came from world war one involved voting.
Before the war, neither working men nor women had votes. The sacrifice
of men from all classes, combined with the fact that women were taking
on jobs that had previously been seen as a male preserve and with the
campaigning of the suffragists and suffragettes, compelled politicians
to change the
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:49:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000275" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0003.htm#13110788000275">In
the light of that, Labour Members consider it essential for us to
ensure that the right tone is struck when we are remembering world war
one. I believe that we are all clear about the fact that this is not a
celebration, but a commemoration. War should never be celebrated;
instead, it should be remembered, and we should learn from it. Getting
the tone right is therefore imperative. We agree with the Government
that there should be no flag-waving, that there should be an absolute
right to remember those whose opinions differed, and that there should
be no rigid Government narrative. It is right for us to give people the
facts, and then to let them conduct their own analyses and form their
own
judgments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:50:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000276" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0003.htm#13110788000276">However,
it is important that, as a country, we do not shy away from addressing
some of the war’s complications. There is a strong public
perception of what it was like, formed partly by war poets and
reinforced by the 1960s production of “Oh! What a Lovely
War” and television programmes such as “Blackadder Goes
Forth”. Those cultural representations stand as powerful and
eloquent testimonies to the savagery of world war one, but if they are
all that we know of the war, they are poor

who have been schooled in stories of the “lost
generation” may be surprised to learn that the fatality rate in
the British forces overall was 12%. That is a terrible
figure—and some communities were affected much worse than
others—but the figure is not as high as people tend to imagine.
Nor are public impressions of daily life during the war always
accurate. Blackadder lived for years in a dugout, but in reality
infantry battalions spent an average of about one week of every month
in the trenches. There were notable exceptions, but they do not

“Blackadder”, which, although obviously very amusing,

world war one. However, my hon. Friend is right to point out that it is
not a strictly historical account. I think that the commemorations

believe that, in order to ensure that world war one is remembered and
commemorated appropriately and its complications are addressed, those
involved in the centenary events should be mindful that—as the
Minister rightly pointed out—there will be debates about the
history. Some will say that we should go further than the western
front. Some of the bloodiest battles may have been fought in western
Europe, but battles fought in other parts of the world are also
important in the overall context of the war, and it is therefore right
for us to recognise the huge contribution of British Empire forces from
around the
globe.</hs_Para><hs_Para tab="yes"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:53:30"></hs_TimeCode>Some
will say that we should address the gap between the “pointless
futility” narrative and what soldiers actually believed that
they were fighting for, both during and after the war. Today our forces
in Afghanistan rightly take pride in the job that they do and the bonds
of service that they form, and the same applied to those who fought in
world war one. During those years, soldiers fought for much. They
fought because of a belief that their country was threatened, but
ultimately, when it came down to it, they fought for their regiments,
and for the man standing next to them in the trench. If we want to pay
proper tribute to the war dead—as I know that we do—and
also to those who came through the war, we should seek to remember
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:54:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000281" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0003.htm#13110788000281">Some
will say—and, as the Minister said, there are clearly
sensitivities in this respect—that we should recognise that the
British military, along with their allies, defeated Germany militarily
in the war, with the final period marking one of the most effective in
the history of the British Army. For many decades, historians have
pointed to military tactics developing and improving between 1914 and
1918, which eventually enabled the allies to break out from the
stalemate of the trenches. Although that is little consolation to those
who lost ancestors in the war’s early years, it does explain why
there was so much public grief at Haig’s funeral in 1928 from
the veterans who had served under his command, surprising though that
is to us now. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:55:05"></hs_TimeCode>It

conclusion, there is no doubt that the importance of world war one
cannot be counted in terms just of battlefield casualties or military
innovation, as my hon. Friend has very eloquently illustrated. By dint
of its influence and its timing, and the wider social change it brought

century. As such, it is something we must
commemorate, we must learn from and we must educate our children
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:58:20"></hs_TimeCode>, but above

Speaker. May<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:00:30"></hs_TimeCode> I
first congratulate both Front Benchers on their moving and informative
speeches? We are all the sons and daughters of history. I am conscious
of the fact that 99 years ago today, on 7 November 1914, the
old British Army with the Territorials was dying, literally, in the
area of Ypres in Belgium. Both my grandfathers were there—both
survived—one in the Royal Flying Corps and one who had
volunteered in August 1914 because he could drive, and then found
himself in the Army Service Corps. As an old man, he told me that he
had not expected to be toting a rifle and bayonet with the infantry,
but such was the desperation of the defence that they were
needed.</hs_Para>

generation is the lucky generation. I know I do not look it, but I am
64, and I am of the generation that missed a major war. My grandfathers
fought in the first world war, and my father and uncles fought the
second world war. I lived through the cold war. However, a younger
generation—my son and his friends—might ask why we are
commemorating the first world war when we should perhaps be
commemorating the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, which had just as
major an impact on history. I suggest that the reason is not least
because of the scale of the suffering and involvement, but also because
we have an empathy towards the people involved and we can understand
them far more. A very literate group of men and women fought, and we
have images of them. In addition, the war is still controversial
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:02:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000294" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0003.htm#13110788000294">I

parliamentary commissioner on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. I

should Parliament commemorate the first world war? It is because there
is a political element, a commemorative element, a learning and
knowledge element and a personal element. The political one is that to
engage young people today, we need to get them to think about the fact
that big political issues were being debated before and during the
first world war. Let us be under no illusion: Britain was not a
peaceful, pastoral, “Downton Abbey” kind of place in the
spring of 1914. We were nearly faced with a civil war in Ireland, there
were mass industrial disputes and there were major social problems of
one kind or another. In some respects, the war prevented domestic
violence on a large scale.</hs_Para>

also have to recognise that Parliament did count. Of course, the Prime
Minister did not have to come to Parliament to get a vote in support of
his declaring war, but he was conscious of taking the temperature. The
legislation that Parliament passed during the first world war, some of
it pre-dating the war, is still with us today. Examples of that include
the setting up of the intelligence and security aspects of British
government, and legislation on licensing. The debates on conscription
broke the old Liberal party, and debates took place here on whether or
not we should seek a negotiated peace. Those things are not just a walk
down memory lane; if we face young people today with all that, they
will understand the importance of it. That is one thing that the
advisory committee is hoping to get Parliament, and, in particular, the
Youth Parliament, involved with.</hs_Para>

is an important aspect, because large numbers of MPs and peers, and
their children, were killed or badly wounded in the first world war and
we commemorate them. Let us remember that both Asquith and Bonar Law,
the leaders of the two major parties, lost sons in the first world war.
It was not an academic war for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:05:17"></hs_TimeCode>. Large
numbers of staff served in the first world war. One of the waiters in

for the question of learning and knowledge, it is important that we
will provide, via websites and the internet, a lot of information about
Parliament and  the memorials in Parliament that will be
available to the public. We will link that to the project on lives of
people in the first world war that is being established by the Imperial

than anything else, this all has a personal aspect. One thing that my
noble Friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire has done in the House of Lords,
which is something that we will do in the House of Commons, is to send
a questionnaire to every peer and peeress asking what their families
did during the first world war. He has received some fascinating
replies. People had relatives who served not only in the British armed
forces, as one might expect, or on the support side, but in the
Commonwealth armed forces and the Indian army. He has received replies
from people whose relatives fought on both sides: the father’s
side of the family in the British Army, and the mother’s side in
the Austro-Hungarian or German army. I would like to think that we
would be able to get such information from colleagues in this place and
from the staff, too. We would be able to put that into the public
domain to contribute to the
commemoration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000303" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0003.htm#13110788000303">We
must also consider the fact that we will not stop in 2018 with the
commemoration of 1918. The first world war did not end there; its
legacy continued. There were big debates in this House about how we
were going to honour the dead. The establishment of the Imperial War
Graves Commission in 1917 was controversial. Up 
<?notus-xml column=493?>until then, bodies had been brought home, so the decision to bury the
dead where they had fallen was controversial. Political upheaval
followed the end of the first world war.
Ex-soldiers from Irish regiments became members of the IRA or, on the
other side, of the auxiliary division of the Royal Irish Constabulary.

was also the disillusionment that grew in  the 1920s and 1930s,

the Labour, Liberal and Conservative parties. It is difficult for us
now to think that while Harold Macmillan, whom I remember meeting in
1978 as a very old but fully alert man, was the British Prime Minister
in 1963, which is well within my lifetime, his most moving experience
was serving in the first world war. He tended to judge men and women by

hope that what we are doing, with the help of Members, to get
Parliament to consider how to commemorate the first world war will not
only interest us, but involve the wider public and young people, which
is one of our greatest aims. I suspect that all those men and women who
were lucky enough to survive the war and live on would approve of what
we are trying to do and of the fact that we are going to consider the
matter in a non-prescriptive way. Instead, to use that old expression,
we will let a thousand flowers bloom and have a proper

Jones</B> (Hyndburn) (Lab):</Member> Today I want to remember the 11th
Battalion East Lancashire Regiment, universally known as the Accrington
pals. The battalion’s horrific losses stand as a reminder of the
gratuitous barbarity of the warfare, particularly trench warfare,
during the first world war. The history of the battalion is as known
now as it was in the years of suffering that followed. The tragic waste
of human potential during the first world war was quite simply
shocking. Young men died in horrific and frightening circumstances.
Modern cinematic productions allow us occasionally to glimpse that
horror and, each and every time, any thought of this being a reality is

people in Hyndburn signed up not to the pals, but to other regiments. I
was fortunate enough to find a piece of information from Kew about my
great grandfather’s record. He served in the Royal Ambulance
Medical Corps. While I knew him before he died, I recall my grandfather
occasionally speaking of his father’s time on the front line,
carrying off young men who had lost body parts and whose bodies had
been mutilated by shells, mines and bullets—some alive, some
dying, many dead and many screaming out as they died. That my
great-grandfather rarely spoke of those horrors, paralysed by his
fearful memories, is testament to the torturous experiences many of the
combatants
faced.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:10:47"></hs_TimeCode> I am

speak about the Sikh contribution in the great war. I know that much
has been made of the contribution of all Commonwealth forces, but the
Sikh contribution is sometimes overlooked. I will also refer to the
contribution of Wolverhampton. It would be remiss of me not to do so.

the start of the war, Sikhs made up a tiny percentage of an undivided
India, yet they were contributing 22% of the British Indian army. More
than 138,000 Indian troops fought in Belgium and France and over a
quarter of these would, unfortunately, become casualties. After the
bloody battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915, the Sikh regiments had lost
nearly 80% of their men, with three regiments standing at just 16% of
their original complement. The valour and courage of Sikh soldiers was
rightly commended by British generals. General Sir Frank Messery,
commenting on the Sikh contribution in both world wars, noted that the
only physical protection that Sikhs had was their turban—a

as it was then, of Wolverhampton. At the outbreak of war in 1914, many
men enthusiastically flocked to the town hall to sign up, eager to help
the national effort in a war they believed would be “over by
Christmas”. As a bustling industrial town, Wolverhampton was
ready to contribute to the provision of resources for the front line.
Villiers Engineering Company produced ammunition, and Guy Motors became
the largest manufacturer of firing mechanisms for depth charges in the
country. H. M. Hobson Ltd manufactured carburettors for engines, and
the Sunbeam Motor Car Company produced staff cars and commercial
vehicles for the military, ambulances for the Red Cross and engines for
aircraft and high-speed naval craft. It is ironic that the Villiers
Engineering Company and its Sunbeam motor manufacturing unit, which was

showed its proud, hospitable credentials in the great war by providing
accommodation for displaced Belgian refugees. In September 1914, the
local refugee committee and Roman Catholics in the area offered to
accommodate 25 refugees, and the offer was accepted by the local
authority. The following month, two hostels were established in
Finchfield and Pennfields, and by March 1915 a further three hostels
had been set up.</hs_Para>

but of its many war heroes. I will highlight one individual in
particular. Douglas Morris Harris was a wireless telegrapher on board
an Italian drifter, the Floandi, which was being used to blockade the
port of Kotor and prevent the Austrian navy accessing the Adriatic sea.
In May 1917 the drifter was attacked by the Austrians, but Harris
remained dutifully at his post and unfortunately lost his life at the
age of just 19. For his bravery he was awarded one of Italy’s
highest honours, and his bust still stands proudly in the grounds of St
Peter’s church in Wolverhampton, adjacent to the cenotaph, which
I have the pleasure of being able to see from my constituency office

was no surprise that when the war came to an end in 1918 the people of
Wolverhampton greeted the news with relief, happiness and thanksgiving,
as well as sorrow and reflection on what, and indeed who, had been
lost. It was certainly a sorrowful time for the Belgian refugee Peter
van Cleven, whose son had been killed on the battlefield just a few
days before the war ended. In 1919 the local authority established a
war memorial committee to create a roll of remembrance to honour over
1,700 men from Wolverhampton who left home to fight but

the first world war was a truly terrible conflict. There can be no
doubting the bravery of the millions who fought for their country, many
of whom lost their lives—nearly 1 million soldiers from the
British Army and over 700,000 from the British isles. But I believe
that we should also acknowledge the conscientious objectors to the war.
They, too, were people of courage who stood up for what they believed
in and experienced enormous public opprobrium as a result. They also

Morgan Jones and Ness Edwards, were conscientious objectors. Ness was

General in the 1951 Labour Government. He was preceded by Morgan Jones,
who served as an Education Minister in the Labour Governments of 1924

from a modest background, his father being a coal miner. He left the

the moment Britain entered the great war in August 1914, Morgan Jones
was a vocal opponent of the war. Like many in the ILP, he believed that
the war was unjustified and unnecessary, a nationalist conflict that
set worker against worker. He therefore opposed the war as a socialist
and as an internationalist. But he also adopted a Christian pacifist
position and declared his opposition to all forms of warfare, believing
that the destruction of human life should not be a means of solving
international disputes. His unequivocal views led him quickly to join
the No Conscription Fellowship, and he was appointed to its national
committee in
1914.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000333" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0003.htm#13110788000333">In
the early part of the war, until 1916, the British Army consisted
entirely of volunteers, and south Wales was a particularly important
recruiting ground. However, it soon became clear that relying on
volunteers was not enough, so the Government introduced the Military
Service Act 1916 and conscription. Under the Act, local tribunals were
established to determine cases of exemption for men who could best
contribute to the war by continuing in their civil roles. One of the
effects of the Act was to create two kinds of conscientious objector.
The absolutists were those who adopted a maximalist position of being
opposed to the war but also refusing to accept any kind of alternative
work. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:25:36"></hs_TimeCode> other
type of conscientious objector was the alternativist. These individuals
were wholly opposed to the war but prepared nevertheless to accept some
form of alternative employment, mostly in

objectors, and he eventually came to accept membership of this

Chavasse rehabilitation centre in Colchester is named after Captain
Noel Godfrey Chavasse, VC and Bar and recipient of the military cross,
who died aged 32. He was the twin son of the Bishop of Liverpool. The
battle of Guillemont saw acts of heroism by Captain Chavasse, the only
man to be awarded the Victoria Cross twice during the first world war.
In 1916, Chavasse was hit by shell splinters while rescuing men in no
man’s land. He performed similar heroics in the offensive at
Passchendaele, gaining his second VC to become the most highly
decorated British serviceman in the war. Sadly, he died of his wounds

interest in the great war—it only became known as the first
world war in 1939—started when, as a 14-year-old scout on my
first class hike, I was required to do a task on a topic and I chose
war memorials. As I went around the villages on the Essex-Suffolk
border, the sheer numbers of those who died between 1914 and
1918—or was it between 1914 and 1919?—quickly dawned on
me. The question of why some war memorials have different dates has to

different
year?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000344" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0003.htm#13110788000344">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:32:03"></hs_TimeCode>

Tony Baldry</B> (Banbury) (Con):</Member> The great war resulted in
death and carnage on a previously unknown and unimagined scale. Not
surprisingly, there was an enormous and justified outpouring of public
grief that resulted in a major public arts programme in Britain to
design and erect memorials to those who had died, and the
Imperial—now Commonwealth—War Graves Commission was
founded in 1917. We are fortunate to have two commissioners among our

centenary years of the great war will hopefully stimulate considerable
interest in war memorials and monuments and the histories of the names
of those inscribed on those monuments. Clive Aslet, the former editor
of <I>Country Life</I>, recently wrote a book called, “War
Memorial - the story of one village’s sacrifice from
1914-2003”. It took a typical village—Lydford in
Devon—and traced the individual history behind all the names on
its war memorial. Clive Aslet has

I would really like to do for the Centenary of the First World War in

my hon. Friend the Member for Broadland has said, it was Government
policy that all those who died overseas would be buried where they
died, irrespective 
<?notus-xml column=504?>of their rank. The graves were located overseas, and back home there was
a memorial bearing the names of those who died. It is difficult now to
imagine what it must have been like and the enormous grief when, some
few years after the great war, memorials were unveiled with the names
of those engraved, the memories of whom were still clear and
sharp.</hs_Para>

every community had to design, commission and erect its own war
memorial. As early as 1915, a newly formed civic arts association was
distributing advice about appropriate ways to remember the dead. In
1919, the Victoria and Albert museum put on a war memorials exhibition
organised by the Royal Academy of Arts with the intention of directing
groups, communities and committees in the right artistic and
architectural direction. As early as 1916, the Commonwealth War Graves
Commission made the important decision that no distinction was to be
made in the formal nature of the memorials between officers and men
lying in the same cemeteries. All were equal in death.</hs_Para>

around Hyde park, one finds it all too easy to take the Royal Artillery
memorial for granted—something that one sees all the time but
does not always notice. I hope that during the next four years, we will
notice all our war memorials and ensure that by 2018 we learn as much
as we can about the lives of the men whose names are inscribed upon
them, and that every war memorial is restored and remains

the first few months of the outbreak of the first world war, 139
Unionist MPs and 41 Liberals had signed up. At a time when it was still
voluntary, that was a very high percentage of those of service age. All
the big political families lost somebody. William Ewart
Gladstone’s grandson, Lieutenant William Gladstone, who was 29
and MP for Kilmarnock, died in the Royal Welch Fusiliers on 15 April
1915. Captain Neil Primrose, the Liberal MP for Wisbech and
Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, was only 35 and the second son
of former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery. He was awarded the military

want to talk about two particular cases. The first concerns the Cawley
family. Harold Cawley was Liberal MP for Heywood and Parliamentary
Private Secretary to the Home Secretary. He was the second son of
another MP, Frederick Cawley, and was sent to Gallipoli in May 1915 as
an aide-de-camp. His younger brother, who was not an MP, died at Mons
the day before he set sail. Harold Cawley hated being in a headquarters

of his friends from Rugby were killed on the same day in Gallipoli. He
got his wish and of course was killed on 23 September 1915. Ironically,
because his letters to his father were from one MP to another MP, they
had parliamentary privilege, so the Government could not prevent their
being made public. That is one reason we know about the disasters of
the Dardanelles campaign.
Even<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:54:33"></hs_TimeCode> more sadly,
his other brother, Oswald—this is now the third son—who
became an MP when his father was made a peer in 1918, was also keen to
fight, became a captain in the 10th King’s Shropshire Light

three shields from the first world war that I think are missing from
the Chamber. The first is for Dr John Esmonde, who was the

medical corps. It is true that, in one sense, he was not a combatant

desire to control the Balkans; the German desire to continue
Bismarck’s work on expansionism; the French desire to gain
revenge for Germany’s battle in 1871; and Russia’s
anxiety after its defeat in Japan and its civil war problems.

an officer I am keen to understand the details and the importance of
the conduct of the war to learn lessons for the future. We have not
asked why the war lasted so long. Britain was certainly not prepared
for the war; the Crimea was the last main one, and then there were
colonial adventures, if we can call them that. The Russo-Japanese
conflict was a bad influence on us; the impact of firepower was
understood but the wrong examples were taken from the use of the
bayonet, which I am afraid influenced our senior
commanders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000396" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0003.htm#13110788000396">It
is those senior commanders who were not ready or engaged in modern
warfare. They were looking through the prism of the 19th century. War
was seen as noble, structured and decisive; decision-making was very
much controlled from the top in an hierarchical, autocratic structure,
mostly, dare I say, by cavalry officers, which I am glad to say is no
longer the case. It is no wonder that this Army—trained as much
for the sports field as the battlefield, bred from narrow regimental
and Army loyalties and led by a higher command that was a stickler for
tradition and suppressive of criticism— took far too long to
defeat the
enemy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000397" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0003.htm#13110788000397">The
British commanders expected to win through their offensive spirit, the
mobility of attack and using phrases such as “at all
costs” and “regardless of loss”. Indeed General
Smith-Dorrien, Commander of II Corps, was relieved of his command for
daring to ask permission to retreat. We are now very familiar with the
locations of these battles; Mons, Ypres, Passchendaele, Loos and so
forth. The fundamental problem across all of them was that the
antiquated command structure actually prevented battalion and brigade
commanders from exploiting wins—unwilling to leverage any
success until new orders
arrived.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000398" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0003.htm#13110788000398">Those
artillery barrages that we learned so much about and have seen in
footage did not cut down the barbed wire or destroy the enemy trenches
to give the foot soldiers an advantage when charging across no
man’s land. As has been said, the most vivid example of that is
the battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916, when 57,000 casualties were
suffered in a single day; the biggest ever in the British Army. Not
until new tactics emerged—with battalion and brigade commanders
given freedom in decision-making and combined warfare was developed,
with greater use of the tank and the aeroplane— was that
stalemate broken in the battles of Hamel and
Amiens.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000399" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0003.htm#13110788000399">We

redrawn to create something close to what we know today. Socially,
every town, city and village had to come to terms with a loss of life

Corbyn</B> (Islington North) (Lab):</Member> This Sunday, like many
colleagues, I shall be at my borough’s annual presentation of
wreaths at the war memorial. Our memorial is a circle on Islington
green. It was designed to show how people can come together after
conflict, not in a spirit of victory but through a desire for no more
war to take place. Later that day, we will lay wreaths at the site of
the casualty department of the former Royal Northern hospital. To
commemorate the thousands of local people who lost their lives in world
war one, there was a public collection that resulted in the building of
an accident and emergency department there, on the basis of a need for
something tangible that people could live from, rather than die from.
It is a very appropriate memorial.</hs_Para>

we look at the war memorials—and when we remember the pals
regiments that colleagues have mentioned—we see dozens of names
from the same family. We see how one generation was completely wiped
out, with many brothers dying alongside each other. I recall looking at
a huge war memorial in Sospel in southern France. It commemorated the
people of that town, and it was clear that many members of the same
families had died in the Franco-Prussian war, the first world war and
the second world war. That series of wars wiped out
generations.</hs_Para>

a child growing up in a small village in Wiltshire, I recall talking to
old men who breathed with enormous difficulty. They told me that they
had suffered “the gas” in the first world war. We have to
remember those who suffered and those who died. We remember them with
poetry and with hope. Many brilliant poems have been written about the
first world war, as well as brilliant pieces of music such as Ralph
Vaughan Williams’s “The Lark Ascending”, which he
dreamed up in the trenches. In the lull between the fighting, he could
see the larks above the fields; their song was drowned out as the guns
started up again. Nigel Kennedy played it brilliantly at the last night
of the Proms earlier this year.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:02:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David) pointed out. There were massive
anti-war meetings in Finsbury park in my constituency well into the
first world war. The international women’s conference against
the war and in favour of peace took place in The 
<?notus-xml column=508?>Hague in 1915. It obviously did not stop the war, but it did influence
President Woodrow Wilson and the 14 points that he later
produced.</hs_Para>

first world war was a culmination of the rivalry between nations and
empires; it was a commercial war in many ways. It was envisaged in J.
A. Hobson’s brilliant work on imperialism in 1902, in which he
predicted that there would be a war between the European nations
because the tension and the arms expenditure were so great. There are
serious lessons to be learned from that.</hs_Para>

map of the middle east was drawn as a result of the first world war.
The Sykes-Picot agreement, which was revealed during the war, after the
Russian revolution, showed the intention of Britain and France to carve
up the middle east for themselves. The League of Nations was
unsuccessful, but it represented an attempt at the end of the first
world war to work out an international order that would prevent the
same level of carnage from befalling another generation. In many ways,
the League of Nations was doomed before it even started, because of the
behaviour of the powers at the negotiations that resulted in the treaty
of Versailles. Instead of bringing about a peace, those powers sought
to impose a victors’ justice so, for example, the people of New
Guinea stopped being subjects of the German empire and became a
mandated people under the power of Australia, while the people of the
middle east came to live under mandated territories of Britain and
France. Many of the problems that the world saw later arose from the
first world

in it. Above all, we should bring up our children to try to look for a

differences, rather than feeding an arms race all around the world that
can lead only to another war, such as the tragedies of the Congo,
Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Let us try to look to a world of peace and

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:06:17"></hs_TimeCode> visited Bosnia

in the biggest mosque in Sarajevo to meet the grand mufti, the head of
the Muslim faith  in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I remember him
saying in really good English, “The last time this country was
run properly was under the Habsburg monarchy, and we still call this
mosque the Emperor mosque because the Emperor Franz Joseph restored
it.” We should think 
<?notus-xml column=509?>about what has happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina since that time, which
suggests that there is an element of truth in that. We are officially
to start our national commemorations on 4 August, but we should not
forget 28 June 1914, when the Archduke was shot, and what happened
subsequently. We still have responsibility to mend those terrible
events that happened in Bosnia and

someone who was a history teacher, I was a little perturbed by the

the Members for Wolverhampton South West (Paul Uppal) and for Reading
West (Alok Sharma) pointed out, imperial troops made an unbelievable
contribution to the war. There is a Sikh memorial in Belgium. The
Indian memorial at Neuve Chapelle commemorates 4,742 Indian troops of
no known grave. I saw Jewish graves at Lijssenthoek military cemetery,
and I have seen Muslim graves organised in line with Mecca. I have seen
a grave for seven people from a Chinese labour battalion who died in
the first world war.</hs_Para>

diversity of people who live in Britain, we have an opportunity. As a
teacher in Tottenham in 1972, I faced the question of how to teach the
first world war to classes of pupils from different religious
backgrounds and ethnicities. Of course, such teaching could be done,
because a huge number of the grandfathers of such pupils would have
been there. It has been calculated that about 1.2 million non-white
soldiers fought across the first world war theatre. We therefore have
an opportunity to use these commemorations to bring people together in
a practical way, as people realise that their family histories of the
war might not be much different from those of families who
live  next door.</hs_Para>

on the “In From The Cold” project. It has sent me a chart
showing that, in Lancaster and Fleetwood alone, there are 161 war
graves scattered across different churchyards. For instance, two
soldiers are buried in Glasson churchyard, three in Pilling churchyard,

Thiepval is, of course, synonymous with the battle of the Somme, and it
was the 36th (Ulster) Division that emerged from Thiepval wood on that
fateful day, 1 July 1916, and charged towards the German lines. Indeed,
the Ulster division was the only division of X Corps to achieve its
objective that morning, but it paid a terrible price in doing so: 5,500
soldiers were killed, wounded or missing in

One thing that I have been working closely on with the CWGC is raising

There was a real danger that this could go wrong. As he said, it is
right that there will be national and international commemorations, but
the real focus has to come from below—I totally agree with him
on that; local communities have to get involved. I pay tribute to the
Heritage Lottery Fund, which is providing grants for local communities,
a few of them in my constituency, including Park View school, which has
just received a grant for doing a world war one project. I know that

project is to create a memorial arch over the route that they marched
down to the ships in the harbour waiting to take them to France. The
arch will commemorate not just those who lost their lives and for whom
that journey was their last on home soil but everyone who served in the
war—soldiers, nurses, people in the supply chains, everyone who
was part of the national contribution to the first world war. I hope

Lazarowicz</B> (Edinburgh North and Leith) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> On the
morning of 22 May 1915, 227 people were killed in what is still
Britain’s worst rail disaster when a troop train and two other
passenger trains collided at Quintinshill near Gretna. Almost all those
who died were men from the Leith Battalion of the Royal Scots, who were
killed before even reaching  the battlefields of France that
they were heading for on their first posting after training. The vast
majority of those who were killed were obviously from Edinburgh and
Leith. Of course, in the time before and after hundreds more from the
community of Edinburgh died 
<?notus-xml column=516?>in various battlefields and at sea, but the impact of that rail
disaster, because it had such a dramatic effect on
one day on people who did not even get to France, where they had been
expecting to fight, was both dramatic and traumatic.</hs_Para>

disaster is now remembered every year on its anniversary at a war
memorial in a cemetery in the centre of my constituency. At
one of those commemorations a few years ago I met a grandchild, the
great-grandchildren and the great-great-grandchildren of a victim of
that disaster who were pleased that the local community was now
remembering their ancestor. I am glad to say that the Quintinshill
disaster is recognised by both the UK and Scottish Governments as one
of the Scottish national events to be remembered in the commemorations
of world war one. It reminds us that the way in which the
war impacted on individuals and communities was not just at the front
and at sea but in places a long way from the battlefield and in ways
that we do not always appreciate.</hs_Para>

bodies of those who died in that disaster were brought back to the
Drill hall in Leith. That building is now the Out of the Blue centre, a
successful arts and cultural centre. Appropriately, in that very
building a couple of months ago, I was privileged to take part in the
launch of one of the community projects funded by the Heritage Lottery
Fund. It was a project organised by the Disability History Scotland
group, which aims to look at how the experience of disability caused
directly or indirectly by world war one had consequences for families
and communities, for social policy, disability groups and disability
rights campaigns for generations until
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:33:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000453" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0004.htm#13110788000453">That
is again a reminder of how the consequences of war extend far beyond
its original participants in all sorts of ways and down the decades.
Besides the project that I mentioned, I know that others in my
community have sought, and I hope received, funding from the
HLF. I have encouraged them to do so and I hope that the publicity
about today’s debate will encourage other groups to
come forward with projects for their community.</hs_Para>

ceremony that has recently been revived is at the war memorial at
Newhaven village in my constituency, a fishing village in the past and
a very small fishing community now. It takes place every year at the
war memorial attached to the local school. It brings together the wider
community and the young people at the school to remember what their
forefathers fought for in the first world war. It is an opportunity to
remind young people of what happened at that time and to look, as many
colleagues have said, at reconciliation and work for peace so that
future generations will not have to go through what so many went
through in the first world
war.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000455" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0004.htm#13110788000455"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:34:59"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13110788000638" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0004.htm#13110788000638">4.34

is an inescapable truth and to leave any conflict saying that it is the
last would be either naive or wilfully misleading, but what we can do
is recognise the importance of what is done, ensure that the skills and
requirements protect the armed forces as much as possible, and remember
those who have made such sacrifices in our country’s name. That
is why I am so proud to speak today and take part in the commemoration
service across Weaver Vale this weekend. Those who have fought for
Britain may be gone, but they are always in our thoughts and in our

my grandfather, who, being a Manchester lad, wanted to join up in 1914
but was not old enough. The recruiting sergeant knew that he was not
old enough so, along with his mates who were under age, he hot-footed
it to Manchester Piccadilly station, got on the west coast line down to
London Euston and joined up at the first recruiting office, which just
happened to be the Middlesex

Speaker, I am very grateful for your permission to contribute to this

all have our different methods by which we have been in contact with or
affected by the first world war. Mine dates back to my days as a
schoolboy, when I became friendly with a veteran of the Royal
Navy, Mr Leslie Horton, who served from 1915 to 1945 in just
about every variety of royal naval ship. He served on the destroyer HMS
Landrail in the first world war, for example, and the S-class submarine
HMS Seadog in the second world war. The force of character and
personality of all those people who have been through these
vicissitudes, ordeals and dangers cannot help but transmit itself to
people of a younger
generation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T16:40:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000467" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0004.htm#13110788000467">In
the brief time available I want to make one point for the Minister to
consider in his reply. It will not come as a surprise to him, because
we have discussed it privately previously. I want to be certain that
when, in the course of commemorating the events of the first world war,
we focus on particular spikes in the history of that catastrophic
conflict, we do not end up focusing solely on those events that marked
terrible mistakes and defeats. It is a reality that the generalship
behind the battle of the Somme was sadly lacking—some would say
it was grossly negligent. It is a fact that the mistakes made at the
battle of the Somme were repeated at the battle of Passchendaele, but
it is also a fact that by the time we got to 8 August 1918, the lessons
of those disastrous earlier offences had been learnt, however
belatedly. The battle of Amiens, which hardly anyone has heard of by
comparison with the earlier battles, was a stupendous victory for which
our forces gain too little credit.</hs_Para>

course commemoration is about reconciliation, but we must not blind
ourselves to the fact that those battles took place not on the
territory of a country that did the invading, but by definition on the
territory of countries that had been invaded. It should be a matter of
pride for the people of this country that we fought on the right side
in the first world war. Indeed, the failure to draw the right lessons
from what happened at the end of the war had the consequence that after
the second world war we were determined there would have to be
unconditional surrender—so that next time nobody could argue, as
they had done after 1918, that they had not really been defeated. Let
us of course reach out the hand of friendship and remember the terrible
mistakes made, but let us remember the victories, too, and the justice
of the cause for which British soldiers, sailors and airmen fought and
died.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13110788000641" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0004.htm#13110788000641">4.43

we should approach this commemoration is symbolised by Harry
Patch’s insistence that German and British veterans should carry
his coffin. For the past 20 years, long before I became a
Member of Parliament, I have been attending the remembrance service in
Eltham. 
<?notus-xml column=520?>Over the years, it has become a much more diverse affair. In fact, the
people who attend nowadays represent the diversity of the armed forces
who took part in the first world war more than they ever have in
previous years. It is a real community event with everyone coming
together. More recently, we have been happy to welcome a large
contingent of the Gurkha community, and it is a pleasure to see how
their presence is warmly welcomed by the entire community. British

UK’s risk-based strategy to reduce GBS infection in newborn

B streptococcus is one of many bacteria that can be present in the

Early-onset group B strep can cause problems such as cerebral palsy,

is worth reflecting on how the UK compares internationally on rates of
group B strep. The reported rate per 1,000 births is 0.38 in the UK; in
the USA, where there is testing, it is 0.41; in Spain, 0.39; in France,
0.75; in Portugal, 0.44; and in Norway, 0.46. Even in comparison with

care that are helping to reduce group B strep and improve the quality

high-quality and safe maternity services that deliver the best outcomes
for them and their baby. Maternity services feature prominently in the
key objectives set out in the first mandate between the Government and

care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:12:00"></hs_TimeCode>. To help
deliver that, there has been significant investment in the maternity
work force. Since May 2010, the number of full-time
equivalent midwives has increased by 6.5%—just under
1,500—and in addition there are currently in excess of 5,000
midwifery students in training. There has, therefore, been considerable
investment in maternity services to ensure much more personalised care

encouraging and positive to hear what my hon. Friend the Minister is
saying but it is still focusing on the at-risk women, which is what the

nationally—something I discussed with the group B strep groups
and the chief medical officer at a meeting this time last year to
progress the work at a greater pace—will put us in a better
position to understand in particular which women are at high risk,
whether birth units are picking up on those women in a timely manner
and how we can improve the situation throughout the country. In the
past there has been quite a lot of variation in practice, broadly based
on the RCOG guidelines, but it is important—knowing the
devastating effects of this illness—that we put together a

consider the confounding factors that arise in any research. For
example, there is some evidence of different rates of carriage of group
B strep among different population groups. Also, the clinical treatment
of the disease in hospitals—which is separate from the screening
process—can vary from country to country. We have to set the
data alongside other practices that take place at local level in order

shall turn now to the question of routine screening for group B strep.
The UK national screening committee advises Ministers and the national
health service in all four countries on all aspects of screening
policy, and supports implementation. At its meeting on 13 November
2012, the screening committee recommended that antenatal screening for
group B strep carriage at 35 to 37 weeks should not be offered, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:20:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Mid Bedfordshire has pointed out. That is the reason for
the debate. The reasons given included the fact that the currently
available screening tests cannot distinguish between women whose babies
would be affected and those that would not. As a result, about 140,000
low-risk pregnant women would be offered antibiotics in labour
following a positive screening test result. The overwhelming majority
of those women would have a healthy baby without screening and
treatment. In other words, a woman who had screened positive for group
B strep at one point in her pregnancy might not necessarily be carrying
it at the time of delivery, and up to 140,000 women a year could be
given antibiotics during labour even though they did not need
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:21:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000538" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0004.htm#13110788000538">On
the back of the evidence, concern was also expressed, understandably,
about resistance to some of the antibiotics used to prevent early-onset
group B strep, about the long-term effects on the newborn and about the
potential for anaphylactic reactions in labour. Many of us will recall
the chief medical officer for England’s report, in which she
expressed particular concern about the risks posed by antibiotic
resistance due to overuse. The use of antibiotics on that size of
population could create a risk of resistance developing, which would
have adverse
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:22:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Dorries:</Member></B> I am interested in what the Minister has just
said. As I mentioned in my speech, we are talking about a penicillin, a
narrow-spectrum antibiotic. I know the Minister’s background,
and he will know that GPs would prescribe it for a throat infection.
This is a widely and commonly used antibiotic. Does he not think that
these expressions of concern are over-egging the pudding
slightly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:22:38"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000540" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0004.htm#13110788000540"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Poulter" PimsId="5522" UID="13110788000801" xid="1024" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0004.htm#13110788000801">Dr
Poulter:</Member></B> In the report that the chief medical officer
published earlier this year, she made the point graphically that the
overuse of antibiotics among people who do not need them can lead to
resistance developing in bacteria. We know from hospital super-bugs
such as MRSA and VRSA that many other resistant strains of bacteria are
developing. Part of the challenge is to see responsible prescribing
adopted more broadly across the NHS, to ensure that antibiotics are
being targeted at the people who will benefit directly from them. The
chief medical officer’s concern is that the screening that 
<?notus-xml column=530?>my hon. Friend is proposing could lead to many tens of thousands of
women being given antibiotics inappropriately at the time of delivery,
because they were not carrying group B strep at the time, and that that
could result  in resistance developing. We already know about
the devastating consequences of group B strep infection, and the
development of further resistant strains could be an unintended
consequence of such screening that none of us would want to see. We
need to be mindful of that possibility, as I believe the national
screening committee was when it made its recommendations.</hs_Para>

majority of babies who die from early-onset group B strep are premature
and are, sadly, born too early to be helped by screening at 35 to 37
weeks. Data from 2001 show that, in that year, there were 39 deaths due
to group B strep, of which 25 occurred prematurely—that is,
before the 35th week of pregnancy, when any screening would have been
carried out. Those deaths would therefore not have been prevented by a
screening programme.</hs_Para>

estimated that up to 49,000 women carrying GBS at 35 to 37 weeks of
pregnancy may no longer be carriers when receiving treatment during
labour. Studies of the test suggest that between 13% and 40% of
screen-positive women will no longer be carriers at the point of
delivery. There is also a potentially detrimental impact on maternity
services, increasing the medicalisation of labour, with the increase in
hospital births and increases in the birth rate that we are seeing. We
know that once there is one intervention in labour, it can lead to
other interventions and a high rate of Caesarian section when it might
not have been necessary in the first place. I am not saying that that
would always be the case and absolutely not with GBS—far from
it—but we know that when a woman enters a medicalised pathway in
a maternity unit, it can often lead to interventions that might
otherwise have been unnecessary and that are sometimes quite
distressing for the woman during labour. This is particularly the case
when many of the women potentially put on prophylaxis would no longer
be carriers of
GBS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T17:25:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110788000543" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/debtext/131107-0004.htm#13110788000543">The

approximately five years away from development. First-stage trials have
now been undertaken, and wider population- based studies for safety and
efficacy are in place in high-prevalence areas like South Africa. I am

solution to GBS, and I shall certainly do all I can to push and nudge

Poulter:</Member></B> It is sometimes difficult to explain variations
in clinical practice and the care of women during maternity services
between different states or within regions of countries like Spain and
to understand why they are different from what we have in this country.
Here we have robust guidelines in place for trying to identify at-risk
women and we are trying to tighten them through audit while we have low
rates. I am not sure whether the same can always be said elsewhere in
the world. That is why other countries might have wanted to introduce a
cruder tool through a screening test to help them reduce their rates.
As I have said, I will look further into this matter and write to my
hon. Friends in order better to inform them.</hs_Para>

and clinical audit are important. We want to make sure that we have a
proper national audit programme to carry out and develop good and
better practice guidelines for GBS. Looking forward to a vaccine, we
hope that that will be a long-term answer to this devastating disease,
not just for the UK but throughout the world. Prioritising other
research studies is also important. At the moment, a study is being
carried out by the maternal health and care policy research unit. It 
<?notus-xml column=532?>is looking at women with GBS sepsis, which will help us understand the
physical impact that GBS has on women’s health. A second study
looks at providing information at a national level on the numbers of
women and babies affected by anaphylaxis due to antibiotic use in
labour for GBS or presumed GBS infection. As I mentioned, one concern
about a blanket prophylaxis would be the potential anaphylactic
reaction that we know can occur when someone is allergic to penicillin
or other antibiotics.</hs_Para>

face the challenge of keeping their houses warm. The Prime Minister has
made a number of interventions to try to reduce energy bills, by
suggesting that environmental levies will be rolled back and, more
recently, that transmission costs can be reduced. However, the Energy

energy companies’ hedging ahead could be to consumers’
benefit in smoothing out future peaks and troughs in energy prices, but
an additional problem is trying to get transparency on what wholesale

that the margin is right, we need greater improvements in clarity. In

lead a full and frank conversation about the contribution that
consumers are being expected to make towards ensuring that we have
safe, secure and affordable energy supplies. It is crucial that the
public are made aware of the challenge that we face in meeting our
energy needs. In its response, DECC said that it had been up front
about the fact that energy prices will continue to rise and told the

taxation may be a fairer funding mechanism than the use of levies, but
it also emphasised how crucial it is to tackling fuel poverty that we

remaining 6% is presumably related to Government policies. DECC itself
stated in its reply to the Committee that, in 2013, Government policies
to achieve energy savings, provide support to vulnerable consumers
through the warm home scheme and incentivise the shift from fossil
fuels were estimated to account for 9% of household energy bills. The

carbon price is allocated in the breakdown of those percentages; it

recognise that, given the breakdown of confidence, the benefit of

fear of confusing customers, and because the information is available
elsewhere. It is a shame that the Government and the regulator do not
credit the British public with the ability to digest this
information if it is clearly set out on bills, and to
say that it is available elsewhere suggests that they have some

for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith),
said in his opening remarks, the report represents the best attempt yet
at seriously shining a light on one of the central issues in the
widening discussion about what is happening with energy bills, what
might be done about them and what might be done on levies relating to
bills. It attempts, as far as it can, to get to the bottom of what
exactly goes on as far as energy companies’ profits are
concerned. Clearly, if it is concluded without possible contradiction
that energy companies are making what one might term excess profits,
the conclusion may be drawn that the bills that stem from those
companies’ activities do not bear the appropriate relationship
to those companies’ activities, and action may then follow,
either through regulation, through the companies themselves, or through
further light being shone on the relationship between those two
things.</hs_Para>

have seen—most recently in debate in the House

best be done about bills, and indeed what might be done on a wider
basis, and how the market could be reset if it is considered that the

imagine that the starting point for a number of those questions is in
the table in the report that sets out the aggregate profit margin for
the big six companies’ generation and supply. The bald figures
are that in 2011, the aggregate margin for profit in generation was
24.4%, and the aggregate margin in supply was 3.1%—a very
substantial difference in aggregate profit margin. Bearing in mind that
the aggregate profit margin from generation is related to the aggregate
profit margin in distribution—one eventually, by one means or
another, sells to the other, and there is a retail outcome—we
should certainly ask why the two are so different.</hs_Para>

Committee tried to look at how the accounts put forward by companies

different ways and have different internal arrangements. In some

in the UK, which may or may not have a relationship with parent
companies outside the UK. It is difficult to say to what extent it is

had a go at looking at that, but from what I have observed about the
process, it has fallen rather short of producing proposals that can get
to grips with the issue of trading, which seems fairly central in
trying to find out exactly what is happening. A vertically integrated

of the practices we heard about, which appears to be wholly without
transparency, is netting off. A number of activities, particularly
those further down the curve—further out than what might look
like trading —do not appear as trading at all and are netted off
in the company’s accounts. We heard recently that varying

are other arrangements that struck me that remain outside
the mechanisms that may enhance transparency in trading. There is the
practice whereby one side of an 
<?notus-xml column=155?>organisation realises, near to gate closure, that it is unbalanced in
terms of its previous purchases. It will effectively phone itself up to
balance itself on the other side by creating trade—that is,
creating generation that would not otherwise have taken place. That may
appear as a trade, but it is not; it is a pre-order to prevent the
company from going out of balance and incurring costs that it might not
like to at the point of gate closure.</hs_Para>

also mid-stream trading arrangements, which a number of the big six
operate; they bring under their wing small independents, which act as
if they were trading on behalf of the larger company. The trades made
by the larger company are offered to the smaller, independent company.
It is a little like some south American countries using the dollar as
their currency while technically being independent. That may bring
considerable benefits to those smaller companies, but it means that a
number of the trades that take place do not look quite what they

need to go a lot further to establish how the various flows within
vertically integrated companies take place, and how the outcomes of
those flows either benefit or disbenefit customers. Certainly, there is
the argument that some of the issues, such as netting off and gate
closure balancing policies, may benefit customers, inasmuch as they
save money, even though they appear to be anti-competitive in terms of
the way in which trades are arranged. Getting full disclosure right may
have the consequence that some costs go up rather than down. Indeed,
one needs to be clear and careful about what those effects look like,

Interestingly, the Committee considered the role that levies might

green levy review, and what are essentially not regarded as green
levies are in the green levy review. The levies that one can determine
to be true green levies on bills, such as the renewables obligation,
feed-in tariffs and the upcoming contract for difference, are not going
to be reviewed. Levies such as the warm home discount, the energy
companies obligation and the earlier levy on smart meters, however,
remain to be reviewed. They are not green levies, and neither is the
carbon floor price, which looks like a green levy but does not actually
save any carbon and goes entirely to the

those levies are reviewed, exactly what will the review consist of, and
what will be its objectives? If the review simply asks to what extent

Byles</B> (North Warwickshire) (Con):</Member> According to DECC,
average gas and electricity prices have risen by 41% and 20%
respectively in real terms since 2007. There has been a lot discussion
in the past couple of weeks on the most recent price rises—on
average, 10% per company price rises, which we all saw in a
very short space of time—and a lot of the debate focused on how
much the energy companies could or could not blame the preceding
year’s rise in wholesale prices.</hs_Para>

Committee had a discussion with the companies, and there was some
disagreement on exactly what had happened to wholesale prices over the
previous year. The figures from 2007 show that we should not consider
the problems of one year in isolation. We should not consider in
isolation an individual set of price rises put in place by the
companies because the problem has been ongoing for many years. There
are continuing upward pressures on
prices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000058"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:07:42"></hs_TimeCode>In
some ways, perhaps the Committee has once again demonstrated its
prescience by pre-empting this debate by conducting our inquiry before
the most recent—perhaps “hysteria” is not the
right word—strong interest in energy prices, which is a result
of the most recent price rises. The price rises are important because
they have crystallised the debate. Energy prices are now a rapidly 
<?notus-xml column=157?>increasing concern, and energy policy is dominating
the news for reasons that those of us who want a coherent, long-term
energy policy probably wish it was
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:08:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000059">All
sorts of odd things have been thrown into the debate in the past few

large degree, I am concerned that many of those solutions are reactive
and potentially temporary. The nub of the problem with energy policy is
that, for multiple reasons, we face ongoing upward pressure on prices.
For too long, politicians of all shades have not been willing to have
an honest debate on why that is and what the implications
are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:09:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000060">In
particular, through our collective rhetoric, politicians have
persistently fuelled the myth that Governments can control the cost of
energy to a much larger degree than they can. We are all guilty of
that. It is tempting to have a pop at the Opposition for what I believe
is an incoherent price freeze policy, but politicians of all parties
have tended to point to the other lot and say, “When you were in
power, prices did x.” That fuels the expectation that
Governments can pull a lever, push a button and control such
things.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000062">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:09:56"></hs_TimeCode>
some ways, it is hardly surprising that the natural conclusion of all
that rhetoric is—I will say it—the incoherent policy of
the Labour party, suggesting that it can pull a lever and freeze
prices. Neither a price freeze nor a windfall tax would do anything to
address the root causes of energy price rises. Both would be short-term
sticking plasters to address the

have risen for many reasons. In spite of the argument over the past few
weeks about what has happened to wholesale prices during the past year,
it is true that increasing international wholesale prices are a key
medium-to-long-term driver of why consumer prices are rising. It is
hard to see therefore how the wholesale price over the past year can
justify the large price increases that we have seen in the past few
weeks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:10:35"></hs_TimeCode>. The UK is
now a net importer of gas, so we are a price taker; we have to pay the
going rate for the marginal cost of gas—whether for liquefied

are also increasing owing to significantly rising network and
transmission costs. Those costs are getting off scot free, to a certain
extent, because we do not talk about the transmission costs as much as
we should—up 10% this year. We do not see them discussed in the
media or in the House to the same degree as we discuss gas prices and

some of the price rises are clearly the result of Government levies,
which are there for different reasons; DECC, however, has estimated
that energy and climate change policies will add 33% to average
electricity prices by 2020. It is true therefore that an artificial
price rise has been put on bills by politicians. The Government are
absolutely right to review the impact of such levies and whether the
different policies can be managed in different

do not want to sound as though I am excusing the big six and saying

questions that we had to ask—Members who spoke earlier have gone
through some in great detail, and I will not repeat what 
<?notus-xml column=158?>they said—but, clearly, a lack of
transparency and competition have allowed us to get into the situation
in which the big six have such highly complicated structures that they
appear to be overcharging themselves. To a degree, the high profits at
the generation end and the low profits at the distribution end smack of
the big six overcharging themselves and each other somewhere along the
line. I urge the Government to reconsider asking Ofgem to implement the

politicians in the House to point at the big six and say,
“It’s all their fault,” is dishonest and
simplistic, however, because the situation is much more complicated
than that. As a matter of policy, we are in fact switching off the
cheapest ways of generating power and replacing them with more
expensive ways of doing so. We are doing that deliberately, with a
large degree of consensus, and for sound reasons if we believe that
climate change is a real problem that needs to be addressed. I do
believe that, and most people in this place—though not

a sense, however, we have not even started on that process. Right now,
we are still sweating old coal assets as if there were no

for which the capital costs have long since been paid. When those power
stations start to come off line over the next few years and are
replaced with newer generating assets, we really will see the

“quadlemma”—is the investment needed. We must come
up with a way of keeping energy costs down and decarbonising without
frightening away the investors we need to put hundreds of billions of

Stringer</B> (Blackley and Broughton) (Lab):</Member> The BBC news on
Radio 4 at 1 o’clock today said—I did not hear the whole
story, because I had to be in the Chamber—that there was one
wind turbine in Wales that had cost £48,000 to put up, but was
producing £5 of electricity a month. That is beautifully
symbolic of some of the things that are wrong with the existing energy
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:18:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000079">I
was not a member of the Committee when the report was written, but I
have read it and it is a good one. It calls for greater transparency
and more competition and its conclusions rely on the presumption that
fossil fuel prices will carry on rising, therefore making renewables
worth using and more financially
efficient<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:18:55"></hs_TimeCode>. The
next report by the Committee, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:18:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Warwickshire (Dan Byles) said, should look at some of the
fundamentals. The reason why electricity prices are going up is simple:
the cost of production and the levels of demand. Looking at that, as
the hon. Gentleman indicated in parts of his speech, is worth
doing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000080">The
example I gave at the beginning of my speech is an extreme one, but it
is a strange policy that decides to invest in energy sources that
provide guaranteed income 
<?notus-xml column=160?>for the generators at three times the current market rate for energy, as
is the case with offshore wind farms. As has been said, the reason is
fear of climate change and induced global warming because of the
increased production of carbon dioxide. We could have a long debate
about that, but I do not intend to go into it now.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110755000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000081">What is
rarely said is that the current policies are having a perverse impact.
How many times do we hear Government spokespeople say that the carbon
footprint of the United Kingdom and Europe is increasing as emissions
go down? The reason is simple. We have exported our production to
China, India and elsewhere, where production processes are less
efficient and we have to pay the carbon price of bringing goods
here.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110755000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000082">The cost of
electricity production from offshore wind farms is three times the
market price for an intermittent supply, and at the same time we are
increasing our carbon footprint. That is not sensible, and the policy
is not working. It will work only if everyone signs up to an
international agreement on carbon, and it is highly unlikely that the
United States, India and China—the major carbon
producers—will do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000083">The
fact that our carbon footprint is increasing is not often mentioned,
and some Ministers do not seem to understand anything about the issue.
When the Minister, the right hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle
(Gregory Barker), was asked to define climate change, he gave the
useless definition that climate change was climate change. He repeated
that twice. When a Minister of State has that level of understanding,
it is not surprising that we do not have useful
policies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000084">The
other basis of the policy is that the people in the Department of
Energy and Climate Change know that the price of fossil fuels will rise
over the next 10 or 15 years. If they could predict the
market, I suspect they would not be working in the Department because
they would all be rich. The fact is that there is a super-abundance of
fossil fuels in the world; there are trillions of cubic metres of shale
gas in this country and sufficient coal to supply the world for
hundreds of years. That is not the problem, although there are
constraints on supply at particular times.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110755000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000085">The price of
oil and gas now is about the same as in 1974, when exactly the same
predictions—that the price of gas and oil would continue to
rise—were being made. It may, or it may not. It cannot be
predicted, and we must focus on reducing the price of energy production
instead of increasing it, as we are doing at present. We need huge
investment in research to find more efficient forms of energy, probably
renewables.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000086">After
our previous debate, I sent the Minister, the right hon. Member for
Bexhill and Battle, an analysis of the market showing that the extra
cost—not the cost—of replacing our power production
facilities was about £226 billion, and that was for renewables:
wind farms and other forms of alternative energy. If 20% of that went
into research into fusion processes, incremental improvements in the
current technologies and improvements in batteries and storage instead
of wind farms, that would probably affect prices more,
whatever the international price of fossil fuels. That would be better
than putting all our eggs in one basket, as we seem to be
doing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000087">The
other side of the equation is demand. There are some complicated
schemes. The green deal is not working and has a very low take-up among
people who are not 
<?notus-xml column=161?>well off and want a better energy deal to insulate
their homes. I referred to the extra £226 billion needed to
replace energy kit in this country. If my arithmetic is correct, if we
gave £1,000 to households—it could be done on a needs
basis and would not necessarily involve every household—that
would cost £30 billion, which is about 15% of the extra cost.
That would dramatically improve the position of people living in fuel
poverty and it would reduce demand, although probably not on a
one-to-one basis because when demand is reduced people tend to use the
money to buy extra electrical goods and so on. However, it would have a
significant impact on what is going
on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000088">I
am glad that the Labour party decided to introduce a freeze on prices
after the next general election. That will not be a solution to the
problem of energy prices in the long term, but it will give us a chance
to take a much closer look, as the hon. Member for North Warwickshire
said, at what we are doing about energy.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110755000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000089">Many people
with good motives have said that the world is going to fry and that we
had better build windmills. Most of that policy is not working. It is
expensive and it is putting people into fuel poverty. I am not on the
side of people who want to destroy the planet—quite the reverse:
I am on the side of people who cannot afford to pay their fuel bills.
We must take a serious, long-term look at how we can produce energy at
lower cost and provide a secure supply, which we do not have at
present.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13110755000277" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000277">2.27

issue is not so much a quadrilemma, whatever band that may be—my
hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Dan Byles) referred to
it—but a dilemma. It is how to keep bills low for our
constituents while ensuring that investment flows into our energy
infrastructure, which is in dire need of replacement. That is not an
argument between political parties; it is a fact.</hs_Para>

discussions over the past few weeks have been fuelled by this report
and the decision of the big six energy companies to raise prices. They
have been about fixing prices, and the Labour party’s proposed
price freeze. That would take us down a path that is dangerous for
energy infrastructure investment. I made that point yesterday
during the Opposition debate on energy prices.</hs_Para>

debate, my fellow member of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for
Southampton, Test (Dr Whitehead), who is not in his place, said that
the big six energy companies invest significantly in energy
infrastructure. The fact of the matter is that at our Select Committee
sitting of a week or so ago, Tony 
<?notus-xml column=162?>Cocker from E.ON made the point that E.ON has
invested more than £7 billion in that infrastructure over the
past five years. If we are to invest something like £110 billion
over 10 years in infrastructure, we can work out that E.ON is spending
about 10% of that cost. Extrapolate that over the other energy
companies in the big six, and we are talking about £60
billion’s or £70 billion’s worth of
investment from the total of £110 billion that is
required to build our new power stations, put in our pipelines
and build pylons to keep our lights switched

have to be careful in our energy proposals that we do not spook the
markets or frighten off the private sector investment that we need in
our generating capacity and downstream piping—otherwise, the
poor old taxpayer will have to foot the bill. I simply make this plea,
which echoes what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:30:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North Warwickshire said: we want to keep prices low, but
let us not do anything that ends up costing the taxpayer and consumer

want to take one issue up with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:31:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Warwickshire (Dan Byles), with regards to what he said about
incoherent policies; I shall get my own back and then move on in a more
consensual way. I think there is incoherence in the policy at the
moment—not in the Labour party’s policy, but in the
Government’s policy—of bringing in additional tariffs in
January this year, then bringing in additional carbon prices in April
this year, and then saying in November, “We are going to have a
review”. The Government need to stop and think whether to hold
back on bringing in such levies or whether to think the issue through
in the long term. They cannot have it both ways.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110755000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000100">I want to
concentrate on two areas that were in the report briefly, but have been
missing from the debate. We have discussed extensively wholesale prices
and levies—and quite rightly, because they make up large
components of the bill when put together. However, another section of
the bill is transmission, which, again, the hon. Gentleman touched
on.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110755000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000101">If we look at
the table in the report, when we break down the bill, the cost of
transmission and distribution of energies to our homes contributes
between 19% and 25% for the companies. There is a variant of some 6%
and some regions are paying that extra cost. Given that we have a
national grid, I do not see why that should be 
<?notus-xml column=163?>the case. One such area is mine, which generates a
lot of energy through nuclear and renewables. We need to look at that
point.</hs_Para>

am not sure which Government Front-Bench Member will wind up, but I
hope that we will get some answers on whether the energy review will
look at transmission costs, because they make up a huge amount. We did
not get them yesterday, because the Secretary of State was not around
for long, but we need those answers rather than having the question
knocked about.</hs_Para>

Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr Lilley) catches your eye, Ms

Wales, the water industry has a not-for-profit organisation running
pipes to homes and it invests all its profit back in infrastructure.
That reduces costs to the customer at times, but the company is honest

infrastructure. Exactly what that company is doing is clear and
transparent, because it produces its reports, and it has members on the

anybody suggests that such an approach would in some way inhibit
competition, within that model, companies go out to tender to get the
work, so there is competition within that non-profit
organisation. We could consider such a way forward for our national
grid; at the moment, I do not believe that National Grid is acting in
the national interest—I think it is acting in the interests of
shareholders, first and foremost, because of the nature of the company.
That is wrong for such an important issue as utilities and transmitting

that fuel prices have been going up since 2007. In the past three to
four years, people have had pay freezes and their household incomes
have flatlined. Inflation is only 2.7%, but food inflation and energy
inflation is far more than the basic rate of inflation, so people are
suffering. Their incomes are going down in real terms and they are

Peter Lilley</B> (Hitchin and Harpenden) (Con):</Member> Rising energy
bills are hurting our constituents; we all know that. The public
suspect that those increases in energy bills are driven by rising
profits. Politicians and environmental campaigners have a vested
interest in fanning that suspicion to divert attention from the
increases in the cost of energy that the political elite are planning
in the move to increasingly costly renewables, with the added costs
that they impose on the transmission
network.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000114">The
Select Committee’s duty is to investigate the public’s
concerns and, if we establish that there are excess profits as a result
of monopoly power, suggest ways of bringing the big six energy
companies to heel by strengthening competition and through stronger
regulation. In the report before the House, the best figure that we
could establish for the aggregate level of profit for the energy
companies—generating profits, wholesale profits and those
downstream—was something like 7.6% of the household energy bill.
That is not itself an obviously excessive figure, and it certainly
cannot explain the very large price rises. The main factor clearly has
been rising fuel costs in the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:40:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000115">However,
before the Committee held our hearings last week, we shared the
public’s suspicion, at least as far as the current round of
tariff increases was concerned, because we could not see how they could
be explained by rising fuel costs; they certainly had not risen by 8%
or 10%. We therefore planned to ask the companies forensic questions:
if they had raised their tariffs by 8%, how much had their costs gone
up by over the same period? When they fudged and prevaricated, we would
come back with searing criticisms and indictments. To 
<?notus-xml column=165?>our surprise, they did not fudge. They gave concrete
figures on how much their costs had gone up, company by company, and
element by element of their costs. The main factor was not rising fuel
and wholesale prices. It was two other factors: rising transmission
costs, because the regulator had allowed a 10% increase in transmission
tariffs; and, in many cases, policy costs—the costs of social
and environmental subsidies as a result of our switch to
renewables<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:41:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000116">Naturally,
the factual conclusions that we established went largely unreported,
because they did not play into the prevailing narrative. Of course, the
fact that we established what we did does not mean that the profits at
the beginning were not excessive and did not contain an element of
monopoly profit. Conservative Members are all in favour of profits, as
long as they are earned through increased efficiency and increased
investment. We are strongly against monopoly profits and if, in our
inquiries with Ofgem and the inquiry that my right hon. Friend the
Prime Minister has established, we find that there is a monopoly
element, we will be the first to support returning that excess profit
to the consumer, and we will certainly welcome any steps that can
increase competition and reduce unnecessary
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:42:49"></hs_TimeCode>. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:42:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Ynys Môn (Albert Owen) said, that should not exclude our
looking at other models for the downstream element—he says that
that applies in Wales; it certainly applies in places such as New
York—if that could reduce the costs to the
consumer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:43:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000117">However,
the big factor driving energy costs in the past has been rising fuel
costs and, essentially, rising gas costs, which drive up both the cost
of electricity and, directly, the cost of gas bills; and the big factor
in the future will be the switch to renewables. The hon. Member for
Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer) is a distinguished addition to
our Committee, and his contributions to our debates will be of great
importance. As he mentioned, onshore wind will double the cost of
electricity; offshore wind trebles it. The figures for other renewables
are of a similar order of magnitude. There is no way switching from
fossil fuels to renewables will do anything other than increase the
cost of energy to both households and industry. We should remember that
only one third of the cost of renewables goes on to household energy
bills. Two thirds go on to industry, but ultimately those costs, too,
are borne by households. The pain that people are feeling from their
energy bills is only one third of the total cost that will be imposed
on
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:44:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000118">What
shall we do about this? Knowing that the main cost driver in the past
has been the rising cost of gas, we should be going hell for leather in
drilling for and exploiting shale. Over little more than six or seven
years in the United States, the shale gas and shale oil revolutions
have brought down prices by two thirds. If we do the same in this
country and overcome the obstacles that the environmental
non-governmental organisations such as Friends of the Earth and so on
are trying to put in the way, and the obstacles inadvertently imposed
by European law, we can enjoy similar success. Either we will bring
down gas costs in this country or, if they remain high because we are
linked to the European gas grid, the profit on that gas will generate
huge tax revenues, which will enable us to relieve other burdens on
households. Either way, we should be doing that, and I urge the
Government to tackle that with renewed vigour. I know that my right
hon. Friend the Minister is 
<?notus-xml column=166?>personally keen to achieve that, and to make good
the unnecessary 18-month moratorium that Chris Huhne imposed on this
country; I think that was a greater crime than his speeding

should recognise that the transmission costs are going up in large
measure because of the need to link up the transmission network to
distant places. Huge subsea transmission cables are being built. Some
£24 billion is to be spent on renewing and extending the
transmission network. That is equivalent to £120 per household
every year between now and the end of the
decade.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000120">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:46:13"></hs_TimeCode>
should go for shale and have a pause—a moratorium —on the
switch to renewables; there are still enough costs coming through from
that to make life very painful for our constituents. The German
Government are thinking of doing that. The Spanish Government have done
something like it. We should not be ahead of the field in penalising
our constituents and our industry by imposing unnecessary and excessive
costs on them. I urge Ministers and the Opposition to think again about
a commitment that, whatever they pretend, will be the ultimate cause of
problems for our constituents and businesses in the

criticisms of the energy market and reflect our desire to see that

businesses. The conclusions were ably set out by the Chair of the

hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith),
in his opening speech. The Committee is fortunate to have on it a
number of hon. Members who possess real expertise on, and insight into,
energy policy in the UK, and who command widespread respect in the
House. We have heard from many of them today, but unfortunately I do
not think that I will be able to go through each of their speeches,

is well known, the Labour party is not satisfied with how the energy
market is functioning. We have therefore laid out plans for ambitious
reform of that market, involving separating the generation and supply
sides of the big six energy companies, establishing a new regulator
and, crucially, freezing prices for 20 months while we get that job
done. The evidence for the need for that reform package is visible to
all of us in our constituencies, day in, day out, but this report has
added to that list of evidence. I would like, in the remainder of the
debate, to draw the House’s attention to some of the conclusions
that I feel are particularly
relevant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:48:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000124">One
thing that comes across very starkly from the report’s
conclusions is the dissatisfaction with the regulator, Ofgem. Several
recommendations demand more activity from Ofgem, but conclusion 16 on
page 73 seems particularly frank. In it, the Committee states that it
is 
<?notus-xml column=167?>“astonished” at how long it has taken Ofgem to act on
improving wholesale market competitiveness to ensure that customers are
paying a fair price for their energy. In the rarefied language of
parliamentary reports, that stands out as particularly hard-hitting,
and it is our belief that Ofgem needs to be replaced with a much more
effective regulator that has powers to force energy companies to reduce
their prices when the wholesale cost of energy
falls<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T14:49:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000125">Yesterday,
in the Opposition day debate, the Secretary of State attacked the
Labour party over its plans to reform Ofgem before claiming, in a

Ofgem. Some people would say, “That’s the Liberal

of the Government’s response to the problems of the energy
market has been to encourage people to switch their supplier. Of course
people should ensure that they are getting the best deal that they can,
and of course we should ensure that switching supplier is as
simple as possible. However, from the consumers’ perspective,
there is little point in making the effort to switch supplier when they
are just switching from one company that is overcharging to another
that is overcharging.</hs_Para>

is noted in conclusions 8, the low-level of switching between suppliers
is a symptom, not a cause, of a lack of competition. It is difficult to
see how any policy to make switching easy could have a significant
effect if underlying problems in the market are not addressed. The
Government seem to be deliberately ignoring the fact that switching has
actually halved in two years, with only 340,000 people switching in
June this year; that is down from almost 800,000 in summer 2011.

Louise Ellman</B> (Liverpool, Riverside) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Robertson. I am
pleased to have the opportunity to debate the Transport
Committee’s recent report on whiplash claims. It is the third
report that we have produced on the cost of motor insurance since the
2010 election. Our work in the area started because of complaints about
rising motor insurance premiums. In April 2012, the average quoted
premium reached more than £1,100 and the premiums paid by young
men and women were particularly high, at more than £2,000 for
men aged between 17 and 24 years old. Although premiums have fallen
recently in cost, they remain high, particularly for young
drivers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000150">Many
people need to use a car to get to work, to college, to hospital
appointments or to visit family and friends. Public transport is not
always available for such journeys, particularly outside towns and
cities. The high cost of motor insurance can prevent people from owning
a car, seriously affecting their work lives, education or social
activities. It can also encourage people to drive without insurance or
to commit other forms of fraud. The high cost of motor insurance is
also a factor in the cost of living squeeze, which affects households
across the land. Our reports have shown that there are a number of
factors that influence the cost of motor insurance, including the high
accident rates for young drivers, organised fraud, the merry-go-round
of referral fees, uninsured driving, cold calling and the growth in
whiplash claims. We have pursued all those issues, and most of them are
being addressed.</hs_Para>

repeatedly asked the Government to do more to improve the safety of
young drivers—in particular, by making the driving test more
rigorous or by introducing graduated licensing. It is appalling that
27% of 17 to 19-year-old males are involved in collisions within a year
of passing their test. In 2011, 148 young drivers died. I look forward
to the Government’s Green Paper on the issue, which is due
soon.</hs_Para>

of concern that we identified, which is within the Minister’s
remit, relates to the activities of claims management companies and, in
particular, cold calling. We are told that cold calling is illegal, but
the problem seems to be growing. We have all received phone calls or
text messages urging us to make a claim because of an assumed or real
recent accident. What action is being taken to clamp down on cold
callers? Have any firms been prosecuted?</hs_Para>

recent report, we looked at another factor that explains the rise in
the cost of motor insurance: claims for whiplash injuries. A whiplash
injury is a soft tissue injury to the neck caused by a sudden, forceful
jerk, such as can be caused by a road accident. Symptoms can last for a
few weeks or months. In a minority of cases, symptoms can last for
longer, especially if exacerbated by a pre-existing condition. There is
no generally accepted test for a whiplash injury. They do not show up
on X-rays or MRI scans. However, the medical evidence that we received
confirmed that the injuries are real and can have debilitating
consequences for those who suffer from them. There are about 500,000
motor insurance claims for compensation arising from whiplash injuries
each year, although the number is coming down.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110755000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000157">The official
figures on road safety show a welcome reduction in the number of people
killed or seriously injured. In 2012, there were a total of 195,723
casualties in all the road accidents reported to the police, which was
4% lower than in 2011. Some 1,754 people were killed—an 8%
decrease from 2011—and 23,039 were seriously injured, down 0.4%
from the previous year. Those reductions are welcome, but every
individual serious accident is a tragedy for the individual and the
family concerned. It is not clear, however, exactly how the number of
claims relates to the number of accidents, as the statistics on road
traffic accidents are not comprehensive. There is widespread agreement
that a significant proportion of the claims are fraudulent or
exaggerated, but there is no authoritative data, perhaps because of the
very nature of the issue. The Government are right to be looking
seriously at the problem.</hs_Para>

Government proposed whiplash claims of up to £5,000, which would
cover most of them, should be dealt with in court by using the small
claims track. That approach was strongly backed by insurers, but
rejected by most solicitors. The Transport Committee opposed that
change, because many people who use the small claims track would have
to represent themselves, and we thought that that would impair access
to justice, especially as insurers would, of course, be legally
represented. It was also not clear how expert evidence would be
accommodated in the system. I am pleased that the Government accepted
those arguments and rejected making that change at present.</hs_Para>

provide medical reports on whiplash claims. There have been claims that
reports

however, ask a number of other questions that have not yet been
answered. For example, is there a role for existing regulatory bodies,
such as the General Medical Council, in auditing or peer reviewing
reports or dealing with complaints? Should practitioners who prepare

claimant’s medical record? We have written to the Ministry of

complex issues have been created by the dysfunctional motor insurance
market. It cannot be good practice for insurers to settle whiplash
claims without medical evidence. It is unacceptable that ways are still
found for insurers, solicitors, doctors, garages, car hire firms and
others in this merry-go-round to make money out of claims, often by
inflating the work necessary to address them. For years, insurers have

was a danger that the Government’s consultation on whiplash
would be another stitch-up on behalf of the insurance industry, but
what has emerged in their response is far less damaging and, in some
ways, positive. I do not know whether the new Minister had a hand in
developing it—I would like to think he did—but he brings
a breath of fresh air with him. Having dealt with his two predecessors
over the past three years, I have, sadly, become used to there being a
lack of evidence to support the Government’s conclusions and to
a disconnect between their policy and their soundbites, particularly on
this issue.</hs_Para>

may be being over-optimistic as far as the Secretary of State, although
not the Minister, is concerned. I say that because the Government
response to the Select Committee report and the consultation was
announced in a peculiar way—it was certainly new to me. The
evening before it was announced, there was an embargoed press release,
which then featured in the morning papers, before the report itself had
been considered. Therefore, the report—rather like this
debate—did not get the attention it perhaps deserved.</hs_Para>

is fairly clear why that happened. Suddenly, when he took up his post,
the Secretary of State for
Transport<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:15:59"></hs_TimeCode>
started talking about MOT prices and motorway fuel prices. The reason
for that is that the centrepiece of the 
<?notus-xml column=175?>Government’s consultation, which they
intended to adopt —the increase in the small claims limit from
£1,000 to £5,000 for personal injury—had been
jettisoned, primarily due to the evidence in the Select
Committee’s report, and the Government were left with not very
much to say on personal injury and whiplash.</hs_Para>

medical panels are interesting, and I will come on to them a bit later,
but they are hardly revolutionary—they are hardly going to make
the major changes to personal injury law or the processing of claims
that the Government, with the usual bombast that surrounds the
Secretary of State, led us to believe they would. We had a
bit of clever pre-spinning on this issue, but the substance, which we
will talk about this afternoon, is that the Government simply backed
off from a very unwise proposal.</hs_Para>

I said, I have had three years of having to deal with rhetoric that
simply is not supported by the facts. “Compensation
culture” is one of the buzz phrases the Government have used to
mount a wholesale attack on personal injury law, despite the phrase
being disowned by their own experts and reviews. It has been a cover
for cherry-picking the Jackson reforms and implementing only those
parts the insurance industry thought favourable. It has also been used
as a cover for extending the portal scheme, which is not a bad scheme
in itself, to cover higher amounts and to include public liability and
employer liability to a high level. That was before we had really seen
whether the scheme was working in relation to road traffic. All those
factors have tipped the balance very much in favour of defendant
insurers and away from claimant victims.</hs_Para>

reputation of all personal injury claimants, and particularly road

belated attempt—now abandoned—to raise the small claims

personal injury claims on to the small claims track, so they would not
have been subject to cost regimes or representation. Many victims, some
of whom will have quite substantive injuries—a £5,000
general damages claim in a personal injury case represents quite a
severe injury—would therefore be on their own, as litigants in

Slaughter:</Member></B> It is difficult. There is a lot of rhetoric out
there, and I have said what I want to say: that we should be concerned
about fraud per se, and, in the context of personal injury actions,
about soft tissue injuries, because it is easier to make fraudulent
claims on them. The issue is how we deal with that.</hs_Para>

am delighted that the Committee’s report highlighted two issues.
One of those is third-party capture, which is an open invitation to
fraud. We know why insurance companies use it. They think they can
settle a claim quickly and cheaply by offering a sum of money that is
probably a fraction of what a genuine injury is worth. Usually because
the victim does not know what it is worth, or needs money in a hurry,
or perhaps because they do not want to have the case tested in court,
they will settle for the sum—perhaps a few hundred pounds or
£1,000—offered in an unsolicited phone call from the
insurers. That must be wrong. Lawyers and medical experts have been
saying that for a long time.</hs_Para>

that the issue has been highlighted, and even more pleased that the
Government appear to have accepted it. I hope that the Minister will
say a bit more about what action will be taken. I have tabled
parliamentary questions, and the Minister has answered some of them,
but I do not think that he dealt with that issue, and it would be

other issue that I was pleased to see highlighted in the report was how
often fraud is pleaded by insurers defending claims. The answer is
rarely. I cannot give a percentage, but from talking to
practitioners—I do not think that this is denied—I
understand it is rare to raise the issue of fraud in defence. If that
is not being done, it is difficult for insurers to claim that
they are aware of fraud.</hs_Para>

claims can and should be challenged, and not only for the sake of the
individual cases; if that happened more commonly it would, one might
think, discourage fraud. What the insurance industry has been looking
for, which the Government were going along with until recently, is a
quick and dirty solution, which might deal with the problem but would
throw out the baby with the bathwater. It would also prevent victims
from getting fair compensation and encourage bad practice. It would
encourage third-party capture and would also be likely to encourage the
intervention of claims management

hon. and hon. Members present will probably all be clear about the
noxious effect that the claims management industry has had in its
expansion in many areas of public life in the past few years. Having
been 
<?notus-xml column=177?>restricted in some areas, it is looking for others to expand into, and
it has its eye on the one that we are considering. If the small claims
limit had been raised, with the result that claimants could no longer
get representation, they would have been easy prey for claims
management firms, who would say, “Let us handle it for you. We
will take 30% or 50%,” and would purport to negotiate with the
insurers on the claimant’s behalf. I hope that resisting the
temptation to raise the limit will deal with
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000190"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-07T15:26:01"></hs_TimeCode>I

bureaucracy and I am not sure that we could not have achieved the same
objective of being sure we were getting reliable, robust and testing
medical reports simply through registers of medical practitioners who

year, three months, I think, after they decided not to proceed with any
change to the small claims limit for personal injury claims. They
started a new consultation in April. I think it was in February that
the previous report found against going ahead. The Government decided
to go ahead and raise the limit to £10,000 for
non-personal-injury cases, and that is probably right. We can argue
about the exact figure, but it was somewhat overdue.</hs_Para>

decided not to increase it at all; after they dismissed the

it was not just that report: every report in the past 15 years, under
the Labour Government as well as the present Government, that has

limit as the Government proposed. I think that, having got everything
it wanted through the insurance summit at Downing street and so forth,
the insurance industry decided it was on a roll. Having got the Jackson
concessions and similar things, it was looking for an 
<?notus-xml column=178?>opportunity to go further. This was the prize that insurers
really wanted, because they thought that it would almost entirely
destroy the personal injury lawyers, save for catastrophic and major

one looks at other countries to learn lessons, with Australia being the
obvious example, one can see that such changes lead to wholesale
restrictions on the rights of claimants. In Australia, there is
something called whole-person impairment that has quite a high
threshold below which no personal claims can be made. In other words, a
person has to be substantially injured before they can bring a claim.

conclusion, the Government need to be more even-handed in relation to
this matter. If they are, they will get a better response from all
sides. The insurers feel that they have been on a roll so far. We must
have no more summits with the Prime Minister or anybody else to which
only one side is invited. I think we can all agree that that was a
serious error of judgment; only listening to one side is never a good
idea if we are to make sensible policy. The Conservative party needs to
place less reliance financially on the insurance industry, which is a
very substantial donor, because that is not a helpful way to

of us want motor insurance premiums to continue to decline. I think the
figure of £90 in the average premium is given in relation to
whiplash and soft tissue injuries. That is a substantial sum, but it is
far smaller than the amount spent on repair costs, car hire costs and
many other areas that are open to abuse. I hope the Government will
turn their attention to that matter and not be put off by the fact that
the insurers are often complicit in those areas. Credit hire and
inflated repair costs are a scandal. They cost far more than personal
injury costs in relation to insurance premiums, and that is something
that should be tackled.</hs_Para>

kind. People are suffering moderate soft tissue injuries where
previously they would have suffered catastrophic injuries. That
improvement is to be welcomed, so let us not throw the baby out with

Friend for his comments. The Government did indeed consider that
recommendation, but we do not intend to take any action on it. The
limitation period is of long standing and applies to wider personal
injuries than just those in road accidents. It is important to bear
that in mind. This debate is specific to whiplash

Government accept that many claims may be genuine, but many
speculative, exaggerated or even outright fraudulent claims are clearly
being made. It is not right that people who cheat the system should get
away with it and force up the price of insurance for honest,
hard-working motorists. I make no apology for targeting the exaggerated
claims of whiplash fraudsters to drive down

seemingly now claim for whiplash injuries sustained in the most minor
of incidents, and Government data show that more than 1,900 claims a
day are made. According to the Association of British Insurers, the
cost to the industry from whiplash claims is £2 billion,
resulting in £90 being added to the average motor insurance
premium. That is why the Government were committed to reducing the
number and cost of whiplash claims at the Prime Minister’s
insurance summit last year. We need to take action to tackle
speculative, fraudulent and exaggerated whiplash claims, but we must
not lose sight of the needs and legitimate expectations of those who
have suffered a genuine injury. A reduction in the number of such
claims will lower the costs for insurers, which will in turn allow them
to continue to reduce motor premiums for
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110755000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/halltext/131107h0001.htm#13110755000234">Motor
insurance premiums are beginning to fall. Figures published by the
AA’s British insurance premium index in October, as I said
earlier, show that quotes for annual comprehensive car insurance have
fallen by 12% over the past year. Incidentally, regarding some remarks
made earlier by the hon. Member for Hammersmith, I refer him to
what the Association of British Insurers said in oral evidence to the
Transport Committee. The ABI said that it expects savings from the
Government reforms that have been implemented to result in a decrease
in insurance premiums.</hs_Para>

meet representatives from key stakeholder groups to outline the way

the new system. It is both important and sensible to involve industry
experts when designing the detailed changes. Such input will be

Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Mr Edward
Davey):</Member></B> Almost a year ago I informed Parliament that my
Department and the Treasury had just been notified about allegations of
manipulation of the UK gas market. As I said at that time, I take these
allegations extremely seriously. Market abuse is always wrong, and
where it exists it must be identified and the full force of the law
applied.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110745000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/wmstext/131107m0001.htm#13110745000014">The
specific allegations were that there had been manipulation of the gas
market in Great Britain on 28 September 2012. These
allegations concerned trading on that day in the period leading up to
4.30 pm, when price reporting agencies produce a benchmark price for
the day. Such benchmark prices are often used in a range of other
contracts. It was alleged that gas was sold at a lower price than
necessary, in order to manipulate downwards the benchmark price
produced by price reporting agencies.</hs_Para>

is right and proper, these allegations were scrutinised by the
independent regulators for the affected sectors. Ofgem has the lead
responsibility for the physical energy markets, with the FCA leading on
financial markets. The reviews entailed detailed analysis of relevant
information in order to understand the market conditions and the
trading positions of relevant market participants, including contracts
priced by reference to price reporting agencies closing prices. Both
reviews have now
concluded.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110745000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/wmstext/131107m0001.htm#13110745000016">Both
regulators concluded that they could find no evidence in this instance
of market manipulation, and Ofgem considers that the interests of
energy consumers were therefore not harmed. They consider that the
explanations provided by the sellers for the relevant trades are
credible, and they have not found evidence which disputes the
explanations provided. In light of this, they conclude that no further
action is required in connection with these
allegations.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110745000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/wmstext/131107m0001.htm#13110745000017">Regardless
of the outcome of these particular allegations I am fully committed to
ensuring we have a transparent energy market where the risk of abuse is
reduced. If any abuse does take place, it must be identified and
robustly dealt with. The Government have a strong record of providing
regulators with the powers they need to tackle market abuse, and we
will continue to take further action where
necessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110745000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/wmstext/131107m0001.htm#13110745000018">We
took a leading role in developing the EU regulation on wholesale energy
market integrity and transparency—known as REMIT. REMIT
prohibits insider trading and market manipulation in wholesale energy
markets across the EU and has been in force since 28 December 2011. The
UK was one of the first countries to implement REMIT in full, when we
put in place civil powers to allow the regulator to tackle manipulation
of the energy markets, in June 2013. In view of the importance of the
energy markets set out in the annual energy statement I now plan to
consult on the introduction of criminal sanctions for energy market
manipulation
activities.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110745000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/wmstext/131107m0001.htm#13110745000019">Ofgem
continues to monitor wholesale energy markets, and has an established
whistleblower policy to encourage people to bring any examples of
market abuse to its attention. REMIT already requires those organising
transactions in wholesale markets to report suspicious trades to Ofgem.
Ofgem is also working with European colleagues to further develop our
cross-border REMIT market monitoring
systems.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110745000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/wmstext/131107m0001.htm#13110745000020">The
allegations in this case were that prices used by price reporting
agencies were manipulated. We need confidence that there is a rigorous
price assessment process, providing a fair assessment of the market.
Ofgem therefore ran a call for evidence on benchmarks in gas and
electricity sectors on: potential risks; whether the current processes
are fit for purpose; and whether further action is necessary. Ofgem is
currently analysing the responses received. It will be for Ofgem to set
out its approach, but if action is warranted its responses could range
from facilitating effective self-regulation by PRAs, to more
significant regulatory interventions. Whatever approach is adopted must
take account of international initiatives in this area. PRAs are
already implementing principles for oil benchmarks developed by the
International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) at the
G20’s request. We are working within the EU to ensure that any
new regulation of PRAs under their proposed benchmarks regulation
enhances the robustness of energy benchmarks</hs_Para>

in the energy market is another important element of our overall
approach to deterring market abuse. That is why I have asked Ofgem to
carry out a detailed assessment of energy suppliers’ financial
reporting practices and set out the necessary steps to improve
transparency. This assessment will be delivered by spring 2014. In
addition, the Prime Minister has announced that Ofgem, OFT and the new
Competition Markets Authority will lead a new annual review into the
state of the competition of the
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110745000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/wmstext/131107m0001.htm#13110745000022">Ofgem
and FCA work independently of Government to ensure that regulations are
not being breached. In this case, they have concluded that they could
find no evidence of manipulation and Ofgem considers the interests of
consumers have therefore not been harmed. But it is right and proper
that they continue to be vigilant and we will continue to support them
by ensuring the right regulatory framework is in place and that there
are appropriate
deterrents.</hs_Para><hs_6bDepartment UID="13110745000003" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/wmstext/131107m0001.htm#13110745000003"><DepartmentName xid="54">Justice</DepartmentName></hs_6bDepartment><hs_8Statement UID="13110745000008" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/wmstext/131107m0001.htm#13110745000008">Transforming

funding transferred to English local authorities and the Scottish and
Welsh governments, to deliver new local welfare provision. The new

These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI)
data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses
disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD
equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income
measure as a proxy for standard of
living.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">2.
Relative low income sets the threshold as a proportion of the median
income, and moves each year as median income moves. It is used to
measure the number and proportion of individuals who have incomes a
certain proportion below the median. Someone is considered to be in
relative low-income if they live in a household whose income is below
60% of median income for all
households.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">3.
BHC refers to income before housing costs have been deducted: Housing
costs include; rent (gross of housing benefit); water rates, community
water charges and council water charges; mortgage interest payments;
structural insurance premiums (for owner occupiers); ground rent and
service
charges.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">4.
A household is defined as a single person or group of people living at
the same address as their only or main residence, who either share one
meal together or share the living accommodation. A household will
consist of one or more benefit
units.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">5.
Adults are defined as all those individuals who are aged 16 and over,
unless defined as a dependent
child.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">6.
A dependent child is defined as an individual aged under 16. A person
will also be defined as a child if they are 16 to 19 years old and they
are not married nor in a Civil Partnership nor living with a partner;
and living with parents; and in full-time non-advanced education or in
unwaged Government
training.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">7.
The State Pension age is currently 65 for men. For women born on or
before 5 April 1950, State Pension age is 60. From 6 April 2010, the
State Pension age for women born on or after 6 April 1950 is increasing
gradually. A pensioner is defined as a person of State Pension age or
above.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">8.
Workless households are those where no-one aged 16 or over is in
employment.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">9.
All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a
degree of uncertainty. Small differences, particularly at the bottom of
the income distribution, should be treated with caution as these will
be affected by sampling error and variability in
non-response.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">10.

Rogerson:</Member></B> As part of the EU regulatory framework for
pesticides, statutory Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) are set on an EU
wide basis under EC Regulation 396/2005. They apply to all foods that
are placed on the EU market, irrespective of whether they have been
produced inside or outside the EU. The MRLs reflect the highest amount
of pesticide residue expected in food when pesticides are applied
correctly in accordance with authorised conditions of use. It is
important to note that MRLs are not safety limits, and are always set
below, often far below, the safety limit.</hs_Para>

ensuring marketed food complies with all statutory MRLs set, and there
is a substantial Government programme of testing for residues in food

Gauke:</Member></B> HMRC does not require dormant companies, or
companies that are otherwise outside the charge to tax (for example,
charities), to file a company tax return because this would give rise
to wasteful costs for companies and HMRC. The Department does, however,
deploy an increasingly sophisticated range of risk assessment tools,
including IT systems such as Connect, with real time information from
banks and credit card companies, to manage the risk that a company is
active and has failed to notify chargeability. The tax status of all
companies that have not been asked to file a company tax return is
reviewed at least every five years. HMRC may issue a notice to file a
company tax return to any company at any time if it judges there is a
risk that they may have failed to notify that they are within the
charge to
tax.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13110791000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/text/131107w0001.htm#13110791000152"><B><Member PimsId="1568" UID="13110791000549" xid="1022" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/text/131107w0001.htm#13110791000549">Caroline

about any costs that will be incurred when changing energy supplier.
Ofgem has recently completed a thorough review of the retail energy
market and introduced reforms so that consumers face simpler tariff
choices, receive clearer information and are treated fairly. Under
Ofgem's new rules suppliers will have to include key information about
tariffs in a tariff information label, which will include any
termination fee that suppliers charge on fixed term contracts. The
tariff information label will appear on customers' bills and annual
statements and marketing material about the tariff. Clearer information
on termination fees will allow consumers to take them into account when
they are considering
switching.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13110791000031" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/text/131107w0002.htm#13110791000031">Energy:

data underpinning this analysis has been extracted from the Ministry of

by MOD commercial staff when most contracts are established. The
contracts database covers the majority of such payments and reflects
transactions made by the MOD'S Defence Business Services in Liverpool,
which handles about 95% of all payments made by the MOD and Defence
Agencies. Payments not included are those which may have been made (a)
on behalf of other government departments, (b) by the MOD'S Trading
Funds and Executive Non Departmental Public Bodies (which lie outside
the MOD's accounting boundary), (c) locally by the Department, (d)
through third parties such as prime contractors or other government
departments and (e) in relation to collaborative projects where the
payments are made through international procurement agencies or
overseas governments. Government Procurement Card payments are also not
included as they are not procurement contracts. Also excluded from our

Suicide is defined using the International Classification of Diseases,
Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes X60-X84 (Intentional self-harm) and
Y10-Y34 (Events of undetermined intent), excluding Y33.9 where the
coroner's verdict was pending for the year 2004-06. From 2007 onwards,
deaths which were previously coded to Y33.9 are coded to U50.9 and
automatically excluded from the suicide
definition.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>2</Sup>
Deaths of non-residents are included in figures for England and
Wales.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>
Rates are calculated using 2011 Census based mid year population
estimates for the years 2007 to
2012.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>4</Sup>
Confidence intervals are a measure of the statistical precision of an
estimate and show the range of uncertainty around the estimated figure.
Calculations based on small numbers of events are often subject to
random fluctuations. As a general rule, if the confidence interval
around one figure overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot
say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between
the two
figures.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>5</Sup>
Figures are for suicides registered, rather than suicides occurring
between 2007 and 2012. Due to the length of time it takes to hold an
inquest, it can take months for a suicide to be registered in England
and Wales. Further information is available on the ONS

funding for legacy projects which further their own departmental
objectives. Many of these relate to devolved functions and therefore
the UK Government's remit does not cover Wales. But Wales has benefited
from a number of UK Government initiatives, including UKTI's work to

elite athletes and Join In's work to promote volunteering, especially
sport-related.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110794000461" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131107/text/131107w0003.htm#13110794000461">The

Timpson:</Member></B> Free schools are run by academy trusts, which are
charitable companies. A trust can only conduct its affairs in line with
its Articles of Association and its funding agreement, which in turn
requires them to have regard to the Academies Financial Handbook. Both
the articles and the handbook describe the expected conduct of academy
trusts regarding conflicts of interest. The handbook makes it clear
that academy trusts are required to openly procure any
externally-sourced services and that if a business controlled by, or
belonging to, a trustee of an academy trust wishes to bid to deliver a
service to that academy they must do so at cost.</hs_Para>

assertion of widespread “land banking” by certain
politicians is not backed up by the evidence. Indeed, the policy
solutions recently advocated by HM Opposition may actually have an
adverse effect in reducing house building. If developers fear new
development taxes or state confiscation of land, they will be less
willing to undertake complex land assembly projects; they will let
their existing planning permissions lapse; or they will simply be more
cautious in applying for planning permission in the first place. The
result would be a slower planning system and fewer

housing crash under the Labour Government certainly led to an increase
in unimplemented planning permissions, as house builders unsurprisingly
stopped building due to lack of finance, reduced demand and due to a
