Benjamin:</Member></B> My Lords, Barnardo’s and other leading
children’s charities have found that children of prisoners are a
very vulnerable group. They are twice as likely to experience
depression, mental health problems and drug and alcohol abuse, and to
live in poor accommodation. Many go on to offend and yet these children
are unlikely to be offered any targeted support. Barnardo’s
found that the courts keep no record of them and that there are no
requirements to identify them to children’s services. Will the
Government create a statutory duty for courts to identify defendants
who have dependent children and agree that, by collecting those data,
they will be better placed to detect vulnerable children with a parent
in prison and ensure that they get the support they need from
children’s
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:08:01"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

guarantee of a statutory function for the courts but our
reforms for probation will mean that the important function
of advising the court prior to sentencing —which will outline
the offender’s personal circumstances, including
dependants—will remain with public sector probation services.

through-the-gate services for those given custodial

appreciate the point that my noble friend makes; it is a worrying
factor that many of the young people who come into the criminal justice

Touhig (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, in replying to a debate on this
matter on 12 November, the Minister offered a meeting and I certainly
look forward to that. I have since read his remarks from that day. When
an elderly or disabled person’s carer is sent to prison, the
cared-for person often suffers the most as, in many cases, the courts
do not even know that they exist. Although I accept that there is the
safety net of pre-sentence reports in certain circumstances, when bail
is denied there is no pre-sentence report and the court may not know
that there is a cared-for person around at all. The consequence is that
the cared-for person becomes an unintended victim. How are we going to
stop
that?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000008"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:09:31"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13112089000314" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000314">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I appreciate very much the point that
the noble Lord is making, and I look forward to meeting him and the
Prison Advice and Care Trust. In some ways, it is amazing that we are
in the 13th or 14th year of the 21st century and that we find these
gaps in our care provisions. I often think that it is not that the
state does not care but that we are not yet good enough at connecting
bits of the state so that people do not fall through the net. As part
of the exercise of bringing forward this basic custody screening tool,
I hope that by bringing in the expertise of organisations such as PACT
we will be able to make sure that people do not slip through the net in
the way that the noble Lord
suggests<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:10:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lord Bishop of Birmingham:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may press
the Minister a little further. When a court is aware of a child whose
parent is imprisoned and that child is in a vulnerable
state, will he ensure that the court refers the child to the

that child is

McNally:</Member></B> I go back to what I would expect to be common
sense in these areas. Courts already have a duty, in every case, to
take account of any mitigating factors, including that the offender has
primary care responsibilities for children or other dependants.
However, it is important that the presence of such dependants is
brought to the attention of the court. Again, I can only
emphasise that the direction of travel we are going in is to try to
make sure that the prison and court authorities are aware of
their responsibilities and that they link up with the supporting
organisations needed in these
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:11:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Corston (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, 17,000 children a year are
affected by their mothers’ imprisonment. Given that the
Government plan to close two women’s prisons, which means that
there will be only 12 women’s prisons in England and Wales and
which will lead to much longer journeys for those visiting their
mothers and, often, to catastrophic breaks in the relationship between
mother and child, will the Minister confirm that the mother and baby

McNally:</Member></B> I am not aware that there is any plan to do that
but, if there is, I will write to the noble Baroness.
However, such decisions are taken for operational reasons in the
region. I have visited the Holloway unit and I know that it is valued
because while it is not the most modern prison, it is close to
people’s homes. The noble Baroness says that we are closing two
women’s prisons, but the major complaint about those prisons
which we plan to close is that they are a long way from anywhere, never
mind not being close to home. We are developing the custodial estate so
that women will be in the prison closest to their home. We have found
from all the research that that is the factor which women in prison
want. With that, coupled with the rehabilitation reforms and
through-the-gate care for women, we hope to be able to address a number
of the problems that the noble Baroness is concerned
about.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_20_PT_1/7A70A747AD272E81E848DC59D1016A431D705D0A" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 November 2013">Wednesday,

which sentences are reported can cause that reaction—but the
courts are required to impose a sentence that reflects all the
offending behaviour in every case, for both single and multiple
offences. With concurrent sentences, the guidelines make it clear that
the courts should normally aggravate the primary sentence to reflect
the additional offences. These guidelines are about ensuring that the

Marks of Henley-on-Thames (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the Sentencing

generally works well in securing a uniform approach to sentencing for
multiple offences that balances the need for reflecting overall
criminality with the need for sentences that are just and
proportionate. But does the Minister agree that, as the noble
Baroness’s Question illustrates, much more needs to be done to
explain this to a public who are very
sceptical?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000021"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13112089000328" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000328">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> Yes, I would agree. The totality principle
requires that courts review the aggregate sentence against the totality
of the offending behaviour and adjust it to ensure that it is a
proportionate overall sentence. The noble Baroness who asked the
Question made the point that the public, as they read these reports,
are often dissatisfied with what they consider to be soft justice. I
think that the more they understand the sentences, the more they will
have confidence in them. Another reform by the previous Administration
requires that judges more fully explain their judgments, and that is a
welcome step in giving people greater confidence about why a particular
sentence was given. I confess to a certain reluctance about televising
the courts as I am worried that there could be the kind of slippery
slope that we see in the American courts, but the changes that I have
seen so far should give the public a better understanding of the
system, and that can only be to the
good.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_20_PT_1/34C2CDB0A2D2DC5F388E527A06878B9E0E98B5B8" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 November 2013">Wednesday,

that she was required to give. In a democracy, wholesale untargeted
state intrusion into the private lives of all the people, such as
Project Tempora, is unacceptable unless it has the informed consent of
the people via their Parliament. However, Parliament has not been
informed and has not given its consent to Tempora; nor has the Cabinet,
the National Security Council or even, it seems, the ISC. Will the
Government acknowledge that the much vaunted oversight of the security
services has failed spectacularly, as underlined last week by the
feeble public performance of the ISC? When will the Government at last

Accountability in relation to these sensitive matters takes a number of
different formats. We have laws in this country which are completely
compliant with the Human Rights Act and which set out the parameters
and the remit of the intelligence services. Some of the highest
politicians in this land—the Foreign Secretary and the Home
Secretary—have to sign off on each and every warrant presented
before them. We have parliamentary accountability in the form of the
Intelligence and Security Committee. Again, it would be inappropriate
for me to comment on what its views were after its visits. We also have
the tribunal, where individual cases can be
presented.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000030"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:25:01"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Butler of Brockwell" PimsId="2394" UID="13112089000337" xid="1120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000337">Lord

Howe of Aberavon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is good to be
reminded that Britain played a significant part some years ago in
helping to secure for Spain membership of both NATO and the European
Community. When that was taking place, I was able, with the assistance
of my opposite Spanish number, Fernando Moran, to secure a foundational
solution to the long-existing Gibraltar dispute. There was a signature
on agreement for the reopening of Spain’s land border with the
colony, which had been closed as long ago as 1969 by General
Franco.</hs_para>

that understanding. By 1988, each of the two monarchs was able to make
a state visit to each other’s country, and Margaret Thatcher
herself paid a successful visit to Madrid. With all of that sensible
conduct of removing the historic obstacle, is it not now time for the

Warsi:</Member></B> My noble and learned friend makes an incredibly
important point. He is right—there have been long periods of
good co-operation and real progress on this issue. Indeed, until 2011
the trilateral process—the forum for dialogue between the UK and
Spain, with Gibraltar as an equal partner—worked incredibly
well. It is sad that, after the election of the Spanish Government in
December 2011, Spain withdrew from that process. We have offered ad hoc
talks as a way of moving this matter forward but eventually we would
like to see a return to that trilateral

Triesman (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the events of the
last couple of weeks—the fishing boat incursions, the border

this House, since the great recession of 2008, concern has

Members will recognise the story of the constraints facing aspiring
entrepreneurs when it comes to accessing finance. These problems were a
consequence of an overreliance on bank finance compared to
international competitors, a hollowing out of business lending units in
the big banks, too much concentration in our banking system, followed
by the biggest banking bust ever faced in this country and
the biggest bank failure in the world in
2008.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000061">A
calamity of this scale cannot be addressed by a single policy, so we
have engaged since 2010 on a comprehensive programme of bank reform:
splitting retail from investment banking; requiring greater capital;
introducing a tax on leverage; introducing much stronger requirements
to check that the people running banks are fit and proper persons, so
we do not get the likes of Fred Goodwin and Reverend Flowers sitting
atop our banks in the future; and we are introducing criminal charges
for those who behave negligently in charge of big
banks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000062">Those
changes are part of a wider drive to change the culture of banking so
that our banks serve the economy, rather than the other way around, but
these reforms alone are not enough. To help companies access finance,
we have introduced the first British business bank, have doubled the
seed enterprise investment scheme and are expanding the enterprise
finance guarantee schemes. Last year, we introduced start-up loans of
up to £25,000 per founder, although more typically about
£6,000, to help budding entrepreneurs access the seed capital to
make their idea a
reality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000063">Britain
has for too long been a home of great ideas that are then
commercialised and developed elsewhere. We want British business men
and women to take brilliant British ideas and turn them into blossoming
British businesses. The first start-up loan was made in September 2012,
and from the start, growth exceeded expectations. More than a third of
loans go to BME entrepreneurs, and more than a third to people
previously unemployed.</hs_para>

the success of this targeted approach within the full age range, we are
now going even further. I can tell the House that we are committing a
total of £151 million to the scheme this year and
next, with a goal of backing 30,000 new businesses by 2015. From 1
January, the Start Up Loans Company will specifically target priority

estimates that one in five of those over 50 now work for
themselves—a growing trend that accounts for the fact that 70%
of the businesses that they start will last more than five years,
compared with 28% of those started by young entrepreneurs. With the
added support of mentors who understand modern media and marketing, new
retail platforms and communications channels, start-up loans can help
bring even more of those in that age group success. That is why I am
tasking them to find the specialist providers who will make start-up
loans a perfect fit for the older

NEETs, I know that Members across the House have seen just how valuable
and popular these loans are proving in tackling youth unemployment.
Working with the new enterprise allowance, start-up loans will now give
specialist support to those who have been away from the workplace for a
long time, who need strong and committed mentors with an understanding
of what it is to start from a very low base. The Prince’s Trust
has already demonstrated just how effective this approach can be, and
much more can be done to create a targeted offer that creates the right
conditions for those businesses to survive and thrive within the safe

new mothers are also turning increasingly to self-employment. According
to Mumpreneurs UK, self-employment for women is rising at three times
the rate for men. So far, 37% of start-up loans have gone to women, and

Minister for repeating the Statement made in the other place. I would
also like to place on record the thanks of the House for the work that
has been done by James Caan and the Start Up Loans Company to support
people in setting up their businesses. It would be good also to record
our congratulations to Allen Martin, the 10,000th recipient of start-up
loans. Mr Allen is one of the first ex-servicemen to benefit from the
Start Up Loans Company and we wish him well with his new
venture.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000073">Small
businesses are the lifeblood of our economy. The £50 million
that has been lent to 10,000 new entrepreneurs is an important token of
that enterprise spirit that we know runs deep in this country. However,
as we examine the performance of start-up loans in the context of the
broader picture for the economy and small businesses, and the support
available to start up, we agree with Mr Caan that there is still much
work to be done. A key lesson from the start-up loans programme in so
far as we have the results is that access to finance schemes is only as
good as the infrastructure that supports them, and relies on a wider
system of business support, mentoring and signposting. This is the very
fabric of support now lacking in so many parts of our country in the
absence of Business Link, after the abolition of the RDAs and with the
deliberate impoverishing of local government, which had a good record
on this issue under the previous
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000074">This
is borne out by the statistics that we are welcoming today. In every
recession, there has been an increase in business start-ups. People
faced with a flat job market and low demand for their skills will often
look to create their own job by setting up a business. Desperation is
not a bad motive for launching a firm, but does the Minister agree that
where business support networks are strongest, as they are in London,
it is noticeable that that is where there have been far and away the
most loans to date? The statistics on the start-up loans scheme that
the Government have released today suggest that some regions are
missing out. Some 15% of the population live in London while 36% of the
loans issued have been in London, and almost half in London and the
south-east. Only 5% of the start-up loans have been issued in the
north-east and 5% per cent in the
south-west.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000075">Can
the Minister explain to your Lordships’ House why the scheme has

the Minister aware that James Caan is on record as saying that the
support and mentoring available under the scheme was a more important
part of the success of the programme than the loan itself? While
providing finance to start-ups is important, mentoring also plays a
crucial role in helping businesses get off the ground. Does the
Minister share my concern that just 17% of those contacting the

the Minister say whether the Government will back Labour’s plans
to cut and freeze business rates to help start-ups and save 1.5 million
businesses across the country an average of £450? A cost that
places burdens on new start-ups is rising energy costs. Under
Labour’s energy price freeze, start-ups and other businesses

Minister explain why the scheme has not been delivered? Is it because
the Government have not kept their promise to make the spaces available
to start-ups? According to the statistics released by the Government
today, almost two-thirds of start-up loans have gone to men. Given the
failings that we have seen under this Government with the Aspire Fund

business investment is the biggest problem facing the economic

business loans but recognise that it is one of many channels required
to stimulate investment in small business. I have three questions. Are
the Government sure that enough is being done to mentor, support and
help networking for business people to take full advantage of these
schemes and are they doing their best to make these schemes as simple
as possible? Are technical and further education colleges being made
the focus for small business development and for courses on how these
loans can be used and how specific small businesses can take advantage
of them? As well as technical and further education colleges,
universities should be involved in this as well. Are the banks,
particularly the state-regulated banks, being pressurised to redevelop
their local and regional systems and get back to their historic

Popat:</Member></B> My Lords, on business investment, I am pleased to
say that there is a return of consumer and business confidence in the
economy. Bank lending to businesses is going up. In fact we had a
large increase in gross domestic lending to businesses in
the past 12 months, a lot more than we had in the early part
of 2012. Although net lending has dropped compared with the peak of
2008, it has just started to increase, 
<?notus-xml column=967?>so there is some business confidence and
that will help business investment, which will help our growth. As I
mentioned yesterday, our growth forecast has gone up from 0.6% to 1.4%,
which is good news. With regard to bank lending, we have a large number
of schemes. Once again, we are marketing very strongly awareness of
these schemes, which will enable a number of businesses to borrow money

both in business and in corporate finance. The business growth fund is
a welcome initiative, with five or six clearing banks putting together
some £2.5 billion to lend money to new and growing
businesses. I imagine that it will do a very good job for special and
medium-sized businesses, which can borrow money on the basis of venture
capital. Therefore, we welcome the initiative. The good news is that

back to the third point made by the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham. Is it
not the case that, the way that banks have been operating in recent
years, the pendulum has swung from golf course lending to computer
program lending and there is no balance between the two? Surely there
has to be a regional and more local focus to understand the persons and
the nature of the business for which funding is being sought. Is it not
the case that the standard approach of banks of using the same computer
system, whichever bank you go to, has to be broken up? The banks should
focus more on localised issues, including pension funds such as local
government officers’ superannuation funds. They should be
encouraged to use locally collected money to benefit local
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:57:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000089"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Popat" PimsId="5792" UID="13112089000366" xid="2062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000366">Lord

ran an SME I had easy access to my branch manager. To borrow money was
not that difficult and the turnaround of applications was very quick. I
agree with the noble Lord that we need to focus at regional as well as
at local level. What is now happening is that a large number of
clearing banks have a central office which does underwriting through
computers. I am sure that servicing the customer at a local level will
become more important. The good news is that we have brought
competition into the banking world. Aldermore, Metro Bank and Cambridge
&amp; Counties all have branch managers, so a large number of SMEs 
<?notus-xml column=968?>can deal directly with the branch manager rather
than having an application going to the central level. With the demand
for money and banks hungry to lend more, I am sure that, given time,
banks will surely set up a branch manager network. That was a
successful model in the 1970s and

Bilimoria (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the Government on
the start-up loans scheme. It is an excellent initiative and I am
delighted that the Minister, a fellow entrepreneur himself, is
answering these questions from personal knowledge. I started a business
from scratch. I know how difficult it was to raise those first few
thousand pounds. To get my first overdraft of £7,500 was
amazing. I see that the sums involve an average of £6,000. The
average start-up loan is up to £25,000. I hope that the
Government will increase that figure because the bigger it is, the
better the start-up. I notice that the Prince’s Trust is one of
the delivery partners. Can the Minister confirm what the effect of this
scheme has been on the Prince’s Trust, which has done excellent
work in this area over the years? Is it actually giving out more money
as a result of start-up funds in the scheme or less? Secondly, what are
the Government doing to help the people who get these loans go on to
get the further funding that they need? This is only the start. The
Government’s small firms loan guarantee scheme is excellent. How
many of these start-up loan recipients have gone on to
government-guaranteed schemes, which are absolutely essential? Finally,
are the Government encouraging this group of entrepreneurs to network
in the future, creating environments and events that these people can
attend so that they become a community and the Government can identify
the high-growth companies which will be creating the jobs that will
power this economy
ahead?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000091"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T15:59:36"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Popat" PimsId="5792" UID="13112089000368" xid="2062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000368">Lord

glory, when they operated at local level and were very much available

to make that a reality? The reality is that in many areas the banks
have loads of money to shell out. I recently purchased a new kitchen.
At the end of the exercise, after having decided how much I was going
to spend, I was asked, “But aren’t you going to take the

interest-free loan for 12 months, but it was offered to me, so I took
it. Therefore, Barclays has stumped up all the cash, which has
immediately gone to the German manufacturer that produced the kitchen.
There had been no question at all about any difficulty in paying.

being put in place, this will happen—they will have no choice.

local businessmen, they will have to have a local branch network. On
interest-free loans, I do not have information in my briefing but I
will be very happy to write to the noble Lord on where that money comes
from and how someone is able to give interest-free loans. Perhaps the

Cohen of Pimlico (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister agree
that while loans are quite a good way to start a business, what you
really need is some equity? With all the money borrowed it is hard work
starting a business, and very few of us do that. This is an area where
I know he agrees with me. Would he like to describe what steps we are
taking to encourage equity investment in some of these small start-up
businesses? We used to have something called 3i, which was a very
potent and useful source for small businesses, and there are various
government schemes. However, they have more or less lost themselves.
When we both sat on the committee on small businesses and exporting we
discovered that we are unique in Europe in that so many of our small
businesses—indeed, businesses of any size—are financed by
bank lending. Businesses in most other countries are financed much more
largely by equity investment. Can the Minister describe what, if
anything, is being done to encourage this?</hs_para>

attractive and desirable to a large number of medium-sized businesses,
but equally to small businesses that want to grow. We have a number of
government schemes on equity finance but we also have a new set-up
called equity growth funding run by HSBC and four other
clearing banks. That is really helping. In fact, they had their first
case up north under that scheme. That £2.5 billion
available to lend on an equity basis will make a huge difference to a
number of SMEs, but we have government- backed schemes as well on

Hamwee (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I will also speak to Amendment 21G.
The first of these amendments takes us to Clause 12, which is the
clause giving power to exclude a person from his home in the case
of violence or the risk of harm. This power can be included
in an IPNA—in the injunction—if two conditions are
fulfilled. The first is that the anti-social behaviour giving rise to
the application for the IPNA amounts to violence or the
threat of violence and the second is that there is a significant risk
of harm from the respondent. My first amendment provides for a third
condition, namely that the respondent is aged 18 or over. It seems to
me a very severe sanction to exclude anyone from his home. I accept
that this power is to be in response to a “significant
risk” or behaviour, but if it is so significant as to justify
such an action, are there not other courses of action that might be
open to be
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:09:29"></hs_TimeCode>? It is not
required by the statute to link any of these provisions with a course
of treatment or rehabilitation, as one would hope to see in many cases,
and particularly that of young
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000104">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:10:22"></hs_TimeCode>
Bill is quite properly focused on the victim; we see that not just in
the drafting of the Bill but on almost every page of the draft
guidance, with which your Lordships have been provided. But I suggest
to the Government that while excluding somebody from his home may mean
the immediate protection of the victim, the longer-term protection must
be rooted in addressing the victim’s long-term behaviour. Of
course, excluding somebody from his home does not mean that he will not
meet the victim somewhere else. So I am particularly concerned about
this in the case of young people. I wonder, too, what the local
authority response would be. Would it have obligations if a person
under 18 found himself suddenly

one thing to issue guidance to local authorities—and I do not,

whether it is right as a response to an IPNA, in the absence of
something else justifying this, to allow this at all. I am hoping that

noble friend Lady Hamwee for these amendments, which give me an
opportunity to explain more fully how those responsible for young
people and young offenders can work together. In
Amendment 21D, my noble friend is right to highlight the
impact that something like exclusion from the family home could have on
a young person. It is worth reiterating here that the power
to exclude is available only when a much higher test of violence or
significant harm to others is met. As such, it is a power that is
rarely used in the context of the current anti-social behaviour
injunction and we expect that it will rarely be used with the new
injunction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:15:28"></hs_TimeCode>. This
is especially true with young people. There are a number of examples
where young adults have been excluded from a family home because of the
reign of terror they have created. However, I sympathise with the point
my noble friend raises and I would like to consider it further, without
commitment, ahead of Report. In doing so, I would want to consult with
front-line professionals on this point.</hs_para>

if the provision remained as it is and the court were to
decide to exclude someone under the age of 18 from the
family home, it would also have to consider what additional
support, such as accommodation, would be necessary to make it possible.
There would also be a duty on local authorities to consider what
support they are obliged to offer to the young person in
such circumstances. However, there may be situations where, for the
benefit of victims, alternative accommodation —with other family
members for instance—could be in both the young person’s
interest and that of the community. I should add that there may be
cases where a 17 year-old respondent lives alone and where exclusion
may be an appropriate response to his or her threatening
behaviour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:17:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

21G seeks to put in the Bill a requirement for agencies to use informal

approaches can be successful in stopping anti-social behaviour

agree that when dealing with young people, informal interventions
should be considered first in most cases as they can help stop bad
behaviour before it escalates. Our draft guidance reminds professionals
of the importance of considering informal measures in the first
instance. Informal approaches could include acceptable behaviour
contracts or, as they are sometimes called, acceptable
behaviour agreements. These contracts can be an effective way of
dealing with anti-social individuals, especially where there are a
number of problem behaviours. They can also be very effective at
dealing with young people early, to nip problem behaviour in the bud

more formal measures must be available in the minority of cases where

professionals in the way the amendment suggests because they need to
have the flexibility to respond in all situations. There are, however,
safeguards to ensure that injunctions are used appropriately. Before an
application against an under-18 is made, the applicant must consult
with the local youth offending team. This will ensure that the youth
offending team is involved at the earliest stage in the process. They
can give their expert views on whether an informal intervention would
be more effective in dealing with the anti-social behaviour, rather
than the more formal power in the form of an

Hope of Craighead (CB):</Member></B> Perhaps I may
briefly take the Minister back to Amendment 21D. He made a number of
points to explain how in practice this measure will be dealt
with in the case of people under the age of 18. I was
looking at the draft guidance as he was speaking and some of the points
that he made do not appear there. Certainly, the point is made that
the power of exclusion would not be used often, as is
the point about the high threshold and so on. However, for
example, the Minister mentioned the function of the youth offending
team but that is not mentioned at pages 25 and 26 in this chapter of
the guidance. I can see a value in the continuing duty of the youth
offending team when dealing with young people who are excluded from
their home, but it would be helpful if that were to be put in the draft
guidance. Will the Minister undertake to look at the guidance as well
as the drafting of the Bill when dealing with the

Rosser (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, we have tabled amendments 21E and
21F to seek to clarify the effect of changes made to Clause 12 on
Report in the House of Commons. As I understand it, the effect of those
changes is that the ability to exclude a person who
is the subject of an injunction under Clause 1 from the
place where he or she normally lives in cases of violence or risk of
harm can now apply across all tenures, including owner-occupiers, and
not just the social housing sector, as I think was originally proposed.
Will the Minister confirm whether that is now the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:25:22"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Clause 12 now applies across all tenures equally, what powers are now
given under Clause 13 that apply only to someone with a tenancy
agreement but do not apply to someone normally living in owner-occupied
property who is also the subject of an injunction under
Clause 1? One would have assumed that all tenures were now
being treated equally but I take it that Clause 13, by its very
wording, does not apply to a person in owner -occupied
property. If there is still a difference in the powers available under
Clauses 12 and 13, depending on the form of tenure, will the Minster
say what those differences are and why they are necessary? Will
he also say whether Clause 13 applies to the private rented
housing sector or to just the social housing sector? Presumably the
private rented housing sector is now covered by the changes made to
Clause 12, so if a private sector housing tenant is not
covered by Clause 13, in which ways does it mean that
someone in social housing accommodation is being treated differently
from someone who is a private sector housing tenant and who
is also the subject of an injunction under Clause

Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I totally understand
the noble Lord’s concern that anti-social behaviour powers in
this Bill should be, as far as possible, tenure-neutral. He is quite
correct that this came up during the debate in the other place and
Clause 12, which provides for exclusion, is now tenure-neutral
following amendments made on Report in the Commons. Of course, it is of
no consequence to the victims of such behaviour that the perpetrator is
a tenant of social housing, in the private rented sector, or is indeed
an owner-occupier. What matters is that action can be
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:28:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000125">Clause
13 makes special provision for tenancy injunctions so as to preserve
the powers in housing legislation. For the most part, the housing
injunction can be used in the same way as an injunction to prevent
nuisance and annoyance. However, it makes the express provision for a
tenancy injunction to be made in some circumstances where the tenant
allows, incites or encourages anti-social behaviour by another person
and this constitutes a breach of the tenancy agreement. Such behaviour
could be committed by a visitor or lodger, for example. Front-line
professionals have demonstrated through discussions held that they
value this power and that is why we have retained it.</hs_para>

against tenants in the social and private rental sectors, which are the

what the position is in the light of what the noble Lord has said. As I

the powers to make that application in respect of somebody in the

what the noble Lord was seeking to tell me. That wording appears in

the requirement that the youth offending team be consulted before an
injunction under Clause 1 is sought against somebody under 18. However,
there appears to be no timescale for the consultation with youth
offending teams, and as a result there could be—not necessarily
will be—delay. For that reason, the time taken for consultation
with local youth offending teams should be reviewed. That is the
purpose of the amendment. Surely we need to keep an eye on how long the
process is taking and to check on whether there are hold-ups when the

appreciate that the Government’s view is that the necessary
consultation with the relevant youth offending team will take place
with a proper sense of urgency and should not be unduly delayed by
protracted consultations. A clear commitment to a review would further
strengthen that position and make clear the need to carry out such
consultation expeditiously. That is what those who may be victims
certainly wish. In the light of the statement in the draft guidelines
that the consultation requirement does not mean that the youth
offending team could veto the application, will the Minister say what
would constitute consultation being completed? Does the person applying
for an injunction have to have received a response from the youth
offending team for consultations which have been completed?
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:41:42"></hs_TimeCode> the response

21H is concerned with the duty on applicants for injunctions under Part
1 to consult with the local youth offending teams in the case of
under-18s. Crucially, that consultation must take place before the
application is made to the court. That is an important change to the
process where young people are concerned. Therefore, youth offending
teams will help to ensure that the prohibitions in the order are
appropriate and understood by the young person, and that any positive
requirements are tailored to meet his or her needs. As we all
recognise, as do I from my time in local government, youth offending
teams are an important and established part of the youth justice
system. They are well used to working with young people in these sorts
of circumstances.</hs_para>

sentiments of the noble Lord. Like him, I want to ensure that this
legislation is effective. As was the case under the previous
Administration, it is standard practice to undertake post-legislative
scrutiny—as he is well aware—three to five years after
Royal Assent. It is of course open to us to undertake a review sooner
should there be a case for doing so, and I expect the Government to be
held to account in the House through the usual parliamentary channels.
Based on this, I am therefore not persuaded that there is a case for a
statutory duty to undertake a review of this requirement, as in the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000150">Amendment
21J, tabled by my noble friend Lady Hamwee, seeks to add a further
consultation requirement to ensure that the local authority is
consulted in each case where a young person finds themselves the
subject of injunction proceedings. It is, of course, open to the
applicant to inform the local authority. In the case of someone under
18, it is highly likely that they would. However, there may also be
occasions where this is not necessary and it is certainly not the
Government’s intention to tie the hands of the police or
social landlords in these cases. As such, I believe that
this kind of duty is better served by guidance. As my noble friend Lord
Taylor has already said in response to earlier amendments —and
as I have said previously in Committee—in light of the debates
in your Lordships’ House we are going to review the guidance
that will be issued.</hs_para>

trying to make the new powers as streamlined as possible and that is
why we have included a general duty to inform relevant agencies, rather
than prescribing consultation. The requirement to consult the youth
offending team on applications against young people is the only
exception. We believe that this recognises the particular and vital
role that local youth offending teams play, and we want to ensure that
they are fully involved at an early stage in the process. While it may
be appropriate to inform other agencies, we recognise that sometimes
there is an urgent need to act to stop anti-social behaviour and to

the issue of consultation. The statute book contains many duties to
consult and we leave it to the good sense of the police and other
bodies to consult youth offending teams. Of course, anyone who has

timely manner. I hope, in the light of the explanations and assurances

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, my amendment is grouped with the debate
on Clause 17 stand part and Amendment 22DA in the name of the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. Within the past few minutes, he has sent me a
note asking me to apologise to the Committee. Like many of us, his
anticipation of what would happen, and when, was rather thrown. He said
that he had an impossible diary today with long-agreed speaking
engagements outside the House. However, in case the Minister thinks
that that lets him off the hook from attack from that quarter, the
noble Lord has primed the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, to speak on his
behalf on his later amendments. The noble Lord said that he would not
dream of considering voting before Report anyway, although I think one
might add “ … ” to

amendment is to Clause 17. I have not sought to delete the clause from
the Bill because I wonder whether it might be possible to discuss a
compromise. I am aware that this is a delicate issue on which there has
already been quite a lot of
focus<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:53:32"></hs_TimeCode>. The
clause provides that Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act
1933—it has a long pedigree—is not to apply to
proceedings on IPNAs. That section restricts reporting of proceedings
in which children and young persons are concerned. That provision
restricting reporting also has an exception within it. Is that
exception not sufficient for the Government's purposes? The exception
is that if the court is satisfied that it is in the public interest to
do so, it may dispense to any specified extent with the requirements of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:54:36"></hs_TimeCode> section. Is
that not sufficient? That is Section 49(4)(a). Section 49(5) provides
that the court can similarly dispense with the requirements of the
provision if it is appropriate to do so for the purposes of avoiding
injustice to the child or young
person.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000162">We
have talked on a number of occasions about one purpose of the ASBI
being to avoid criminalising young people, whom we hope to divert from
a criminal career—not to consolidate a criminal career. Given
the way in which reporting would be likely to happen, this provision
would criminalise the young person and have a very unfortunate
long-term impact. “Naming and shaming” is not a term I
like to use—it means stigmatising and putting a negative label
on the young person. There must be a very high risk of perpetuating the

have also talked about positive re-engagement and rehabilitation. I
question whether not imposing reporting restrictions would be a

of course, safeguarding concerns. This had not occurred to
me, but I am told that professionals consider that there is a risk that
children who are identified as having been 
<?notus-xml column=983?>involved in anti-social behaviour may engage in
risk-taking behaviour or be more susceptible to being groomed. This is

all, it seems to me that the risks, quite apart from the concerns that

this is the right way to go; what assessments have been made to

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:57:02"></hs_TimeCode> add just a
short point to what the noble Baroness has said. When one looks at the
draft guidance at page 26, one can see what the Government are thinking
of here. The point is made that making the public aware of the
perpetrator and the terms of the order can be an important part of the
process in tackling anti-social behaviour. One can follow the thinking
behind that proposition. When one reads on, however, one sees that
there will be circumstances in which either the police or the council
may decide not to publicise the fact that an IPNA has been made. It
seems to me that the power—or the discretion, perhaps one should
say—to decide whether or not publicity should be given is being
taken away from the court and given to the police or the council. Will
the Minister explain why that is being done, bearing in mind the point
that the noble Baroness has made about the discretion which exists
within Section
49<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:59:35"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000166">It
is a very big thing to take away from the court the power to restrict
publicity, bearing in mind the reach of the whole of Part 1, which is
what we are concerned with, including Clause 5, which permits an
application for an injunction to be made without notice
being given to the respondent. The court would have no power
to stop the press if they happened to be there reporting what had taken
place. It would be a very serious matter to go as far as the
clause goes without a full explanation why exercise of discretion is
being taken away from the court and being given to the
police or the council, who are not answerable to the court for what
they
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000167"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Paddick" PimsId="7025" UID="13112089000410" xid="2206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000410">Lord
Paddick (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I speak from
personal experience of dealing with the previous regime under ASBOs.
There was a tendency among some local authorities to publicise how many
ASBOs they had been granted by publishing a rogues gallery
of photographs of people against whom ASBOs had been granted. This was
done for political purposes, not to pursue the ends of justice. Some
young people thought that having an ASBO against them—or, in
this case, an IPNA—was a badge of honour that they could show
off to their mates. They were young people with a juvenile attitude. It
almost encouraged them to breach the ASBO because their picture had
been publicised and they had local notoriety. There is a danger that
this provision could make what was a very unhelpful situation under the
previous regime even
worse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:01:21"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:00:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13112089000300" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000300">5

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:00:36"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, this
has been a useful debate. I hope that the Minister can respond
positively to it, because this is causing enormous concern. There is a
great difference between the current regime of ASBOs—we still
have them, and we propose that we keep them—and the new regime
that the Government propose. We are talking about lifting reporting
restrictions widely not for somebody who has caused harassment, alarm
or distress, but someone who has caused merely nuisance and annoyance
and breached the order. A child aged 10 who has been given an IPNA
injunction for causing nuisance and annoyance—as I said earlier
this week, I think that most children of 10 are at some point quite
capable of causing nuisance and annoyance—could breach that
injunction and find reporting restrictions lifted. That lifting of
reporting restrictions does not seem to be a reasoned decision taken in
certain circumstances—it is in every case. I do not understand
why. I share the views expressed by other noble Lords. It is for the
Minister to explain why he thinks that this is an appropriate and
proper measure, because I fail to understand
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:03:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000170">The
noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, made a valuable point about safeguarding:
whether children who receive publicity as a result of having caused
nuisance and annoyance could be at risk. Could they be subject to
grooming? Could they be targeted in any way? Have the Government done
any assessment or evaluation? I cannot believe that such a clause would
be brought forward without a great deal of thought, but I could be
wrong. Have the Government undertaken any assessment of the impact that
that could have on a child aged 10, 11 or 12? Given the naming and
shaming effect of civil orders on children, have the Government
consulted those organisations which seek to protect children to find
out their views and how they think that it would impact on them? We are
extremely worried, particularly given the low threshold level required
for an order.</hs_para>

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> I thank noble Lords for speaking in
this short debate on an important issue, and my noble friend Lady
Hamwee for moving her amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, is
not here, but we are aware of his sentiments through the Marshalled
List, on which he gave notice of his intention to oppose the Question
that Clause 17 stand part of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000173">As my
noble friend Lady Hamwee said, the Bill in its current form
specifically states that Section 49 of the Children and Young Persons
Act 1933 is disapplied. This allows the details of under-18s subject to
the new 
<?notus-xml column=985?>injunction to be reported unless the court imposes a restriction under
Section 39 of the same Act. The same is true of the new
criminal behaviour order, which is covered by a similar, parallel
provision under Part 2.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13112089000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000174">My noble
friend’s amendment would limit this disapplication to 16 and 17
year-olds. We know that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, thinks that
it should apply to all young people. I understand the
sentiments behind these amendments, but there is a strong case for
maintaining the status quo in this area. There is a real need to allow
reporting on under-18s in certain cases where it is necessary and
proportionate, primarily to allow for effective enforcement of the
order, with communities able to play their part in tackling
the anti-social behaviour by alerting the police if, for
example, the offender breaches the conditions of their
order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000175">There
are further legitimate reasons for lifting reporting restrictions.
Publicising that action has been taken against anti-social individuals
can also provide reassurance to the public that action can and will be
taken, and can act as a deterrent to other individuals behaving without
due consideration for their community. However, these legitimate aims
must be weighed against the effect on the young person of making it
known to their community that they have been subject to a formal court
order, albeit a civil one. We made it quite clear in the draft guidance
that we published last month, of which noble Lords are aware, that
local agencies must consider whether it is necessary and proportionate
to interfere with the young person’s right to privacy and
whether it is likely to affect a young person’s behaviour, with
each case decided carefully on its own
facts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000176">Furthermore,
the courts are used to making sensitive decisions, having been dealing
with such cases since the reporting arrangements for ASBOs were changed
by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The courts
reinforced this position, as illustrated by the wealth of case law on
the issue, by upholding the legislation that allows for reporting of
under-18s and makes it clear that it is sometimes necessary. The
legislation that we are examining today has been drafted to mirror
these same provisions. This has worked in the past, and the case law
provides further guidance on the factors that should be considered, and
on how the court should go about making such
decisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000177">However,
the Bill has made some changes that go further towards ensuring that
the rights of young people are always properly considered. We see the
role of the youth offending team as key. These front-line professionals
work directly with young offenders to tackle the underlying causes of
their behaviour. The Bill states that the youth offending
team must be consulted before an application may be made for either an
injunction or a criminal behaviour order. It will be able to give an
invaluable insight into the effects that reporting would have on a
young person, to allow for more informed decision-making by applicants
and the courts on this
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112089000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#13112089000178">It is
worth pointing out that once these powers are in place, all
applications for injunctions will be heard in the youth court, which is
not currently the situation for ASBOs. The youth courts are best placed
to make such decisions, so this move will also ensure that the right
outcomes on reporting for the offender and the 
<?notus-xml column=986?>community are achieved. The noble and learned Lord,
Lord Hope, is quite right. Discretion rests wholly with the court. The
applicant for an injunction can express a view to the court on this
matter, but the decision rests with the court.</hs_para>

Paddick asked whether there would be a presumption that reporting was
permissible unless stated otherwise by the court, meaning that you

the way we deal with anti-social young people. We are focusing on
working with the young person. All the debates we have had on IPNAs
show how this new system provides a fresh approach to this issue. It
will allow the youth offending team to be party to the decision-making
process. The team is likely to be working with the young person already
and will be able to advise on what current interventions are in place,
whether the young person is engaging and what effects publicity may
have. I think that covers the point made by my noble friend Lady

important to show that there has been a degree of unanimity on this

behaviour is acceptable and when it is unacceptable. It is in the
absence of those clear messages—those clear dividing
lines—that young people get into the habit of the abusing
behaviour that can have such a profound and damaging impact in our

discretion. Of course it is right that the court will have discretion
as to whether to grant an injunction. In the case of an application
made without notice, the clause is perfectly clear; it gives wide
discretion to the court as to what to do. My concern is that if the
court decides to make an order, where is its discretion if you remove
the provision in Section 49 to restrict the publicity that is given to
it? It is that element of discretion that I think concerns the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and the noble Baroness. There are two
discretions here. One is certainly there, very properly, in the way
that the whole of Part 1 is drafted as to whether orders are to be
made. It is the particular point about the discretion as to whether
publicity should be given that is of

incidents, or crimes, at approximately 2,000 per day. I do not
believe—and perhaps my noble friends can correct me if I am
wrong—that that includes fly-tipping on private land, and
private farmland in particular, which is an increasing phenomenon. That
is a great deal of criminal activity but, in the same statistics
pamphlet that the department has produced, there is an equally
startling statistic. In the same period, only 2,200 prosecutions were
undertaken. Another way of looking at it is that only crimes committed

recent Saturdays, when we have had the rugby at Twickenham. I have made
endless attempts to convince my wife that rugby is a respectable
pastime and not the equivalent of being found in bed with a supermodel
on a Saturday afternoon, as she has often thought—although,
given the way in which England have played recently, it is a good
alternative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:34:34"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:33:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:32:46"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, I persuaded my wife to come to Twickenham with me on each of
the last three Saturdays and she was totally horrified at the sight of
the school buses coming down the road full of children indulging in a
pastime which is, I believe, called mooning. I am not going to explain
it to your Lordships because we are in mixed company, but the sight of
some 40 children mooning simultaneously is not a pretty one.
My wife is a youth justice officer and as she watched the police
motorbikes zooming past these kids, giving them a friendly wave, she
said: “We have a law against this sort of thing. Why are they
not being brought into court? I would put them away for a year if I got

the amendment tabled by my noble friend in that it does not deal
adequately with the bad behaviour that can come out of vehicles and
interfere with others. That was one example, but there was another this
week of which your Lordships should be aware. In its wisdom, the
<I>Times</I>—I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Finkelstein,
is not here to take down this message—is pursuing, to a
ludicrous degree, the cause of cyclists to the point where they are
creating a new and separate society in London, in which cyclists think
they have a superior law and control over everybody in a motor car.
This is going to lead to some catastrophic accidents very soon. On
three mornings, driving up the A3 in the Balham and Clapham area, I
have seen cyclists put their cycles up against the central
reservation—not the line where the bus lane is—stand in
the middle of the road with a camera and defy you to run them down
while they photograph you doing it. That is what they are longing for.

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> I could not agree more with the noble
Baroness about the importance of behaviour regarding the environment.
All noble Lords would join in that sentiment. I do see this as an
ongoing debate on how Parliament, the Government, and communities as a
whole can deal with what is manifestly a big problem. I am grateful,
therefore, for the opportunity to debate these issues through the
amendments tabled by my noble friends Lord Marlesford and Lord Goschen.
My noble friend Lord Marlesford has come back on this issue following
his Private Member’s Bill and the amendments that he made to
previous legislation on similar
grounds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120105000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#131120105000002">I
shall<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:47:38"></hs_TimeCode> address
his amendment first. I know that littering from vehicles is something
that he feels about passionately. I have been in the House when he has
raised this issue previously and I also know that many noble Lords
share his concerns, as I do myself. I consider it a source of
considerable annoyance to see the roadside littered—if I may use
the word—with discarded litter, discarded by people who do not
seem to care about the visual and other impacts on the environment and
other people’s
neighbourhoods<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:48:27"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, I come from a position of saying that littering should be
treated seriously. My noble friend Lord Crickhowell is absolutely
right. It is simply unacceptable to drop litter. Littering from
vehicles can also present a danger by distracting or even injuring
other road users or by obstructing the highway. Littering is
anti-social and this is an anti-social behaviour Bill. It demonstrates
disrespect for the community and it incurs costs for the taxpayer. In
many communities, a lot of litter collecting is done by voluntary
community groups. In my own area, the local civic society takes on
responsibility for clearing up irresponsibly discarded litter. The
Highways Agency
spends<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:49:32"></hs_TimeCode> around
£10 million a year clearing litter and this often involves
closing lanes, which also causes delays to other road
users<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:45:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120105000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#131120105000003">As
my noble friend explained, his proposed new clause seeks to make it
easier for local authorities to fine people when littering is witnessed
from their vehicle. My noble friend feels that more people must be
punished for this anti-social behaviour and that, if more people were
or could be punished, fewer people would commit the offence in the
first place. The Government are at one with my noble friend’s
intentions. However, as my noble friend Lord De Mauley advised my noble
friend Lord Marlesford during the Second Reading debate on his
Littering from Vehicles Bill earlier this year, we do not believe that
the approach 
<?notus-xml column=996?>he proposes is likely to contribute significantly to
the resolution of this problem, and I think that I owe it to the
Committee to try to explain
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120105000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#131120105000004">At
present, because littering is a criminal offence, we advise local
authorities not to issue fixed penalty notices for littering unless
they are confident that the evidence against the offender would stand
up if the case went to court. It is, of course, for local
authorities to satisfy themselves about this and to assess the strength
of each case on its merits. The amendment would also mean that, as a
matter of law, the registered keeper of a vehicle could be punished for
an offence committed by someone else, such as a passenger, or a family
member who also had the use of the vehicle. The amendment makes clear
my noble friend’s intention that the registered keeper should be
held liable whether or not they gave instructions or allowed the
contravention to take place. People who are innocent of any offence
would therefore have either to pay the fine or take on further
inconvenience and expense in challenging it, while the actual offender
would go unpunished. It is hard to see how this approach is going to
change offenders’ behaviour if someone else bears the punishment
for their wrongdoing. In law, fairness and proportionality are crucial
in gaining public support for the use of fines to punish this type of
behaviour, but under the amendment an innocent party might be punished
for the crime of
another.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120105000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#131120105000005">I
accept that there is a place for keeper liability when it comes to the
enforcement of traffic-related offences, but it is a very big step to
extend this principle to other categories of offences. Government
guidance on the use of fixed penalties is very clear that people should
be fined only when it is proportionate and in the public interest to do
so, and fining the registered keeper for any littering offence
committed from their vehicle, regardless of their guilt, is neither
fair nor proportionate.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="131120105000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#131120105000006">Enforcement is the
issue, and I agree with all noble Lords who have spoken that we want
the message to the public to be loud and clear: littering is a crime.
However, the amendment would distort that message by essentially
decriminalising littering from vehicles, and at the same time it would
create a legal anomaly. Littering while standing on the pavement would
remain a crime, but dropping the same litter from within a vehicle
would be treated as a civil offence. That risks sending the wrong
message—that littering from vehicles is not really so
serious.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120105000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#131120105000007">More
importantly, we also doubt that this proposal will achieve my noble
friend’s desired aim, as it relies on the offence being
witnessed. Its effectiveness would be limited by the number of
enforcement officers available to the local authority, and
they cannot be everywhere all the time. It will not be of any help when
the offence takes place in an isolated area, in the dark or at such
speed that the vehicle registration cannot be recorded. In some cases,
CCTV may help, but even CCTV has limits as to the level of detail that
it captures.</hs_para>

London Local Authorities Acts have been in force in London for a year
and that we should therefore have had time to assess their operation by
now. However, the current evidence suggests that these powers have not
been widely used. It has taken a long time for the boroughs to put in
place the necessary appeals system and paperwork. Barely a handful of
civil penalties have been issued so far, and the new threat that
registered keepers will be fined does not seem to have made much of a
difference to the
behaviour<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:54:57"></hs_TimeCode>—</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="131120105000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#131120105000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Crickhowell" PimsId="2774" UID="131120105000102" xid="1186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#131120105000102">Lord

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> I apologise to my noble friend because
I do not have such figures. I am not quoting any figures here; I was
saying that I understand that only a handful of civil penalties have
been issued. I shall certainly write to my noble friend if I am able to
obtain the answer for the number of littering crimes that have been
committed. As I said earlier, enforcement is the issue. The new threat
that registered keepers will be fined does not seem to have made much
of a difference to the behaviour of the general public. After this
debate, it would be interesting for me to talk to my noble friend Lord
True about his experience in his borough and to find out how useful he
has found these provisions under the London Local Authorities
Acts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120105000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#131120105000011">The
lesson we have learnt so far is that the evidence does not support this
approach as being so effective in tackling the problem as to justify
rolling it out on a national scale. While we share my noble

support this amendment and I hope that he will withdraw
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120105000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#131120105000012">We have

now turn to the amendment from my noble friend Lord Goschen. He alluded
to a number of matters on which I can now inform the Committee. This
amendment brings to our attention the problem of fly-tipping. Like
littering from vehicles, this is another example of individuals having
little care or concern about the impact of their actions on the
environment.</hs_para>

able to reassure my noble friend that there are currently seizure and
disposal powers in respect of vehicles used for illegal waste disposal.
These are set out in Section 6 of the Control of Pollution (Amendment)
Act 1989 and they apply in Scotland, England and Wales. However, we
will be improving on these powers when we commence provisions in the
Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 to repeal and
replace them.</hs_para>

new, wider powers relate to the seizure of vehicles used or about to be
used in the commission of offences under Section 33 of the
Environmental Protection Act, which relates to the unauthorised deposit
of waste 
<?notus-xml column=998?>and includes fly-tipped waste, under Section 34,
which imposes a duty of care to ensure that waste is transferred to an
authorised person, and under Regulation 38(1) or (2) of the
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010, which
require waste operations to be carried out in accordance with a permit.
It will also make it easier for local authorities
and the Environment Agency to exercise their powers—for example,
by removing the need for a warrant before seizure and for the retention
of the vehicles pending investigation or completion of court
proceedings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120105000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0001.htm#131120105000016">The
new, wider powers also provide for the forfeiture of seized vehicles
following convictions for offences under Section 33(1) of the
Environmental Protection Act or Regulation 38(1) of the Environmental
Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations. The new Environmental
Protection Act powers have already been commenced in relation to Wales
and are in the process of being commenced for England. The related
secondary legislation is in the process of being drafted and finalised.
Subject to the normal clearance procedures, these powers are due to be
brought into force as early as possible in 2014. Given that the powers
sought by my noble friend’s amendment already exist and are in
the process of being improved, I do not think the amendment is
necessary and I hope that he will feel able

Marlesford:</Member></B> My Lords, it really is not good enough to say,
as my noble friend has said, “We can’t do everything, so
we should do nothing.” If we took what he said literally,
absolutely nothing would happen this side of the election. That is not
an impressive record for any Government to stand on. I wish one of the
legal experts would intervene, but I do not believe that it would be
seen as disproportionate or unfair for the keeper of a vehicle to face
a small and moderate civil penalty fine of about £80 for having
a vehicle from which litter is thrown if that would act as a
deterrent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T18:01:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120105000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120105000018">My
noble friend said that nothing is happening in the London area at the
moment, but I understand that two London boroughs, Wandsworth and
Redbridge, have agreed to pilot the new legislation. One of the
problems is that only the Government can ensure that legislation is
effective, and they clearly have the responsibility to resolve one
particular legislative anomaly: local authorities can contact the DVLA
for information on a registered keeper only when it is suspected that a
criminal offence has occurred. There is no reason why the amendment
could not be redrafted so that, even for a civil offence, local
authorities could get the details of the keeper if rubbish had been
seen to be thrown from a vehicle. There is nothing undemocratic, unfair
or disproportionate about that.</hs_para>

fact, I would say that my proposal is a great deal more proportionate
and effective, because if it were accepted, something would be
happening. At the moment nothing is happening and the Minister is
saying that absolutely nothing will happen. If the public listened to
what is said in the privacy of your Lordships’ Chamber, I am not
sure that they might not go out with joy. They would not, perhaps, do
as my noble friend Lord James suggested, but they might feel, 
<?notus-xml column=999?>“Well, this is the moment when we can throw out any bits of
paper, because we’ve not only been told that nothing can be done
about it—because it can’t be proved that it was
us—but we’ve also been told that the Government have
absolutely no intention of doing anything about it”. The message
seems to be that if we cannot be the cleanest country in Europe, let us
ensure that we are the dirtiest. I reject that. I shall, of course,
withdraw the amendment, but I shall expect to have talks with my noble
friend and I hope that something will be brought back on Report. I may
well then test the opinion of the House. I seek leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para>

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a probing amendment
on a subject not too dissimilar from the issue raised by the noble
Lord, Lord Marlesford. Our new clause is about corporate anti-social
behaviour. Other than the community protection order, which includes
the power to close premises that cause severe problems associated with
anti-social behaviour, the Bill’s emphasis is not on the
corporate but on the
individual<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T18:04:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

feel, sometimes justifiably, that although they as individuals have to
obey the law or be taken to task, companies seem not to be targeted
until things get very serious and action is taken that could lead to
their closure. A corporate anti-social behaviour order would be
targeted at actions by a corporation or company that are deliberately
socially harmful, and cause harassment, alarm or distress at a local
rather than a national level. It would not target legitimate businesses
or business activities—even businesses that some might regard as
unpalatable. For example, there is a lot of talk about payday loans,
and some people do not like gambling. The order would not focus on
business activity, and there is no intention to comment on business
activities that may cause distress at a national
level<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T18:05:09"></hs_TimeCode>; it would
be used only where local disregard for the public and for the
environment could cause harassment, alarm or

purpose of such an anti-social behaviour order would be preventive. It
could identify low-level behaviour and seek to prevent it increasing in
frequency or becoming more serious, as is often the case. Some of the
examples I shall give tie in with the comments about litter in the
previous debate—examples such as 
<?notus-xml column=1000?>takeaways and other businesses that fail to deal with rubbish outside
their premises, or premises that are unnecessarily noisy. I remember,
when I was a Member of Parliament in the other place, dealing with a
business in a residential neighbourhood. It had to have delivery
vehicles coming and going—but at 5 am, did those vehicles really
need to leave their engines running, causing considerable distress to
those who could not sleep, or were woken first thing in the
morning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T18:06:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120105000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120105000023">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T18:10:04"></hs_TimeCode>
could also be a pre-sanction stage, with an acceptable behaviour
contract, to deal with problems.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T18:06:18"></hs_TimeCode> think that
such a provision would be welcomed by businesses that do their best to
deal with such problems, but find themselves up against other companies
that cut corners and do not fulfil their obligations to local
communities. An anti-social behaviour order for local businesses would
complement the community protection order by offering sanctions
targeted at businesses, which might be used before more serious action
that could lead to closure of the business was
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T18:06:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

anti-social behaviour order would be business-friendly, because it
would nip the problem in the bud and give the business the opportunity
to deal with it before it faced far more serious action. It also gives
the opportunity for preventive measures; I am thinking particularly
about littering and noise pollution. At the moment the legislation
focuses on individual behaviour—that is where the community
protection order comes in—rather than on the actions of
companies. It is a preventive measure, designed to be more effective,
more helpful and more friendly towards business. It could also lead to
better engagement between businesses and the local authority, which
would have a reason to hold early discussions about problems that could
arise and how it would deal with them, and also to better relations
with local residents, by nipping any such problems in the bud before
they get too serious. I beg to

I agree with her that, where businesses act in a way that is likely to
cause harm to others, they should be held to account. However, the
Government feel that a corporate ASBO is unnecessary. We believe that

community protection notice replaces litter and graffiti notices, it
can be used for much more, including noise and other behaviours. What

new closure powers that we are introducing, to which the noble Baroness

the business owner or a store manager—and not the business as a

Clause 4 could apply to the court for an injunction against the

Lord for his explanation. I am not sure whether it will be helpful to
probe the matter further when we get to community protection notices,
because they deal with individuals. If there is a persistent litter
problem in certain premises, it would not be possible 
<?notus-xml column=1002?>to have a community protection notice against every
individual. My worry with his other proposal, the closure of
premises, is that it would deal with the problem by closing the
business. Often, it might be better to take preventive action with the
corporate body, the business, to prevent closure and to deal with the
problem, rather than to act against individuals and then, if that does
not work, close the business. I am trying to find a pre-emptive way to
prevent the problem rather than deal with it once it had happened.
However, I am grateful to the noble Lord for taking the point
seriously. Perhaps we can return to it and discuss it further when we
consider community protection. I beg leave to withdraw the

criminal behaviour order. I will deal with Amendments 22C and 22D
first, but on Amendment 22B the Government expect that the courts will
follow the reasoning in the McCann case and apply the criminal standard
of proof—that is, beyond reasonable doubt—to the first
condition of the test for the criminal behaviour order. We acknowledge
that the criminal standard is apt in this case because of the serious
consequences that flow from a breach of the order, namely a criminal
conviction attracting a maximum sentence of five years’
imprisonment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120105000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120105000046">For
that reason, we did not consider it necessary to specify the standard
of proof for the order in the Bill. The clear ruling of the House of
Lords applies equally here as it does to ASBOs under Section 1C of the
Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Clause 1 specifies the standard of proof
for the new injunction because, in that case, we are applying a new
civil standard. That is not the case here. The approach we have taken
in Clause 21 is exactly the same as that taken in the provisions in
Part 9 of the Bill which provide for the new sexual harm prevention
orders and sexual risk orders, which we have of course already debated.
However, I am very happy to confirm that the criminal standard of proof
will apply in this instance, a point that is already made in the
Explanatory
Notes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120105000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120105000047">Amendment
22D seeks to add a test of reasonableness to the first limb of the test
for issuing a criminal behaviour order. As my noble friend has
explained, this amendment imports Section 1(5) of the Crime and
Disorder Act 1998 and it has the same purpose as Amendment 20H, which
we have already debated in the context of Clause 1. As I said when we
debated that amendment, we expect that the courts will consider, as a
matter of course, whether it is reasonable on the facts to make an
order. However, we will consider the matter further so that we have
done everything necessary to ensure that this is the case.</hs_para>

Amendment 22C would introduce a test of necessity for the order. I am
afraid that I cannot be so conciliatory on this amendment. The explicit
additional inclusion of a necessity test could in practice raise the
evidential burden on the prosecution, since the requirement may be
interpreted in a way that the order cannot be granted unless the court
is absolutely sure it will reduce anti-social behaviour. That is not an
appropriate test, since whether this is the case will not always be
clear and the court should be able to take action where it considers
that the order “will help” with the prevention of such
behaviour. In all, I fear that this amendment could unnecessarily
complicate the application process and delay the bringing of respite to
victims. The Government want to make it easier to help victims. This
amendment would prevent that. That is why I do not agree with
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="131120105000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120105000049">The
noble Lord, Lord Rosser, asked a number of questions. We believe it

this further in advance of Report and meanwhile I may well write to him

am puzzled as to why, if the Government expect the criminal standard of

did indeed intend to raise the evidential burden regarding Amendment

Monday, when we were discussing the relationship between provisions in
the Bill and statutory nuisance, I explained that I had been asked to
raise the matter by the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, of
which I am vice-president. I will speak briefly to my amendments today,
but I also ask the Minister whether we can discuss the matter before

assure the Minister that we are willing to contribute to the guidance

lot of requirements and restraints, which could, if they go on

22E seeks to require a court to consider the proportionality, as my
noble friend said, of positive requirements for including them in a
criminal behaviour order. Positive requirements are of course an
important element of both the criminal behaviour order and the
injunction to prevent nuisance and annoyance. As currently drafted, the
Bill states that the court must receive evidence about the suitability
and enforceability from the person or organisation that will be
supervising compliance with the requirement. Proportionality will
therefore routinely be considered by a court as part of this
decision.</hs_para>

Bill sets out clear limitations on courts when determining whether to
agree any positive requirement proposed in the application. The court
must not impose any requirement that conflicts with, for example, an
individual’s religious beliefs, or interferes with their work or
education. Ultimately the court will have regard to an
individual’s human rights—for example, Article 8
rights—when deciding to include positive elements. Such
qualified rights can only be infringed where to do so is necessary and
proportionate in pursuit of a legitimate
aim<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T18:43:26"></hs_TimeCode>.

22G, which the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, focused on as well, would
remove the ability of the court to grant a criminal behaviour order
that lasted longer than five years. Of course, I understand the
reasoning behind this. However, where the courts are dealing with the
most anti-social individuals, they should have the option of imposing
an order for a longer period. The courts, as I am sure all noble Lords
will agree, will always consider the reasonableness and proportionality
of a longer order before granting it. They will have access to relevant
information about a particular case. We believe they are best placed to

<?notus-xml column=1009?>make a judgment about the appropriate length of an
order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T18:44:04"></hs_TimeCode>. What is
more, the offender has the ability under Clause 26 to apply to the

I understand that Amendments 22H, 22J and 22K are designed
to ensure that all orders are reviewed annually. As your Lordships are
aware, we have ensured that this is the case for under-18s. We
recognise the importance of frequent monitoring as a young person
matures during the duration of an order. However, in respect of adults
we have left the decision open to the relevant police force as to
whether there should be such a review. In such cases where an
individual is behaving in a way that is seriously anti-social, it may
not be appropriate to review the case after 12 months, as
this would be too soon and would simply result in an unnecessary burden
on the police and
courts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T18:45:13"></hs_TimeCode>. Again,
we wish to make sure that such decisions are made by those on the front

agree that this must not be a case of making an order and then
forgetting about the respondent. We would expect the applicant to
monitor it over time to ensure it is still valid. The CPS is able to
review the order at any time and, if circumstances change, apply to the
court to vary or discharge it. As we have already debated today,
positive requirements that aim to address the underlying causes of
anti-social behaviour are central to both the criminal behaviour order
and the injunction to prevent nuisance and annoyance.</hs_para>

areas where we should rely on the good judgment of the police to decide

Lordships will be aware, the new police dispersal power to tackle
anti-social behaviour is introduced by the Bill. Children who breach
the order and are convicted of failing to comply with the police

bit of background, currently, nearly seven in 10 children breach their
anti-social behaviour orders. That is typically due to a lack of
support, rather than wilful non-compliance. It is a much higher breach
rate than for adults. Imprisonment is imposed as a sanction for

purpose of the amendment is to remove imprisonment as a sanction for
children when they fail to comply with a dispersal order. The
amendments replace imprisonment with robust community alternatives. I
have mentioned several times my concern about the guilt that many of
those young people will carry with them. They will feel responsible for
the failures in the family. I have spoken to young men who have made it
their job to be at home when their father has returned home from the
pub so that they can stand between their mother and their father at the
time. I have already spoken about those boys who grow up without a
father in the home. Of course, there are young men who are beaten by
their father on a regular basis. Those young men feel responsible for
having to stand up to their father and protect their mother, for being
beaten by their father or for having their father absent from the
home.</hs_para>

wide experience of this is that children do not think rationally in
those times. They tend to think that they are responsible for those
failures. Being too harshly punitive of young children may be
counterproductive. I spoke recently to a lawyer with several years of
experience of working as a defence lawyer for such children. To get
them prepared to stand up in the witness box and give a reasonable
case, he would say to a child, “Look, Richard, I know that there
is good in you. My partner, Margaret, knows that there is
good 
<?notus-xml column=1012?>in you. You can make the choice. You can do the
good, the right thing or you can choose not to”. By speaking in

concern is that if we are overly harsh, if we imprison children, if we
punish them too severely, they will be confirmed in their belief that
they are bad to the bone, that they are responsible for all the bad
things in their life and will go on to be a nuisance to society and
cost society a large amount of money when they are later imprisoned. A
further problem, to which I just alluded, is that once children get
involved in the prison system, there are much more likely to get
involved with it again. They will be returnees. I look to the Minister

Linklater of Butterstone:</Member></B> My Lords, I support these
amendments wholeheartedly. We are talking about punishment. Punishment
must, as a fundamental, be appropriate, proportionate and likely to
succeed. I suggest that the provisions have none of those things right.
It is entirely wrong to have a sanction which involves the potential
imprisonment, which is the ultimate sanction for breach of a CBO, of

successful work that we have seen and in which I have been closely

incarceration of children. This is simply because it does not succeed;
the noble Earl has indicated why. In all cases, incarceration should be
for the most dangerous, severe and violent behaviour. Those

long-term 
<?notus-xml column=1013?>ASBOs, compliance over a long period is difficult.
For young people around the ages of 12 to 18, up to 12
months is an impossibly long time. In my side of the criminal justice
business, alternatives to custody for people who have got into
offending behaviour have been the absolute driving force. The range and
skills of what is now increasingly available in working with young
people, children as well as adults, are producing the results that we
need to see. We do not need to see children being drawn into the world
of the criminal through detention. We should be looking at where we can
develop and encourage alternatives to custody. Where restorative

22KB and 22KC seek to restrict the sanctions on breach of a criminal
behaviour order for under-18s so that a youth rehabilitation order must
be made. Breach of a criminal behaviour order is an offence. There is
no danger of this criminalising someone for the first time because an
order can be made only once they have been convicted of a criminal
offence. It is worth remembering that the criminal behaviour order is
aimed at tackling the most serious offenders, and that by the time that
it is breached an offender may already have failed to respond to
positive requirements aimed at addressing the underlying cause of their
anti-social behaviour. They may also already have had a youth
rehabilitation order made in respect of their offending. We would
expect the youth courts to do all they can to ensure their
rehabilitation when considering the sanction for a breach. This may
well be a rehabilitation order but it is right that they have the
discretion to impose the most appropriate penalty in a given case,

appropriately and proportionately in accordance with sentencing

to the court and it may impose a lower sentence if appropriate,

to the ASBO and the sanction of imprisonment applies to young people as
it does to adults. Like the previous Administration, we believe that

staff are really well supported and very thoughtful. They get in there
really early on, before the child starts acting out, and prevent the
escalation to where the police are called and the child gets reported

Amendment 22L would add the term “proportionate” to the
period during which a dispersal order would apply so that the use of
the power is both necessary and proportionate. When this matter was
discussed in the Public Bill Committee in the Commons, the Minister
said that he was confident that the powers will not be used
disproportionately and referred to the need for authorisation by an
officer of at least the rank of inspector. My amendment would insert a
degree of objectivity into the clause. This is not intended to be
critical of police officers, but if the power is intended always to be
used proportionately, should that not be spelled out and be capable of
being challenged?</hs_para>

Amendment 22N, would provide that the authorisation must clearly
identify the locality in question. That is a matter of clarity, but
rereading the clause over the past few minutes, it strikes me that the
term “locality” could be understood in different ways in
Clause 32(1), which is the specified locality to which the order will
apply, and Clause 32(2)(a), where we are directed to
reducing the likelihood of members of the public in the locality being
harassed, alarmed or distressed. In the second case, the normal meaning
of “in the locality” would be in and around the area, not
in the specified locality referred to in Clause 32(1). I have only just
thought about this.

do so on two main grounds. One is to revert to a topic that we
discussed in Committee on Monday, which concerned the importance of the
powers in the Bill being exercised as part of a wider pattern and a
wider agreement with local government and other interested parties.
That is a general principle that we should not move away from. However,
the main issue is that this is clearly a power that relates to a
specific locality. It might relate to, for example, aggressive begging
in a particular park, square or precinct. Therefore, you would expect
the local authority or the custodian of the public space concerned to
have very clear responsibilities and interests. There may well be
community implications. There may well be a need to listen to what the
local authority may feel will be the community impact of such an action
or, indeed, to consider the local authority’s view on whether
the community benefits from such an
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:21:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="131120110000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120110000023">I
understand that the local authority should be the custodian of those
public spaces and that these are the circumstances in which this power
may be used so it is appropriate that it be involved. I understand that
the parallel of this power, the old anti-social behaviour order regime,
did involve consultation with the local authorities concerned, yet the
Government have specifically excluded it in this Bill. I would be
interested to know a little more about the rationale behind why this
has happened in this particular case as this seems to me an obvious

the argument is that local authorities have been slow in responding to
consultation and that this has led to a continued problem, I would be
surprised because local authorities usually are well aware of concerns
that are being expressed by local communities about a problem in a
particular area. If that is the case, I suspect there are some faults
on the side of the local authority. These could be remedied by some
expectation of what the normal period is within which the local
authority should respond when asked for its views on these matters.
However, I think there is an extraordinary weakness in the way that
these powers could be pursued. The way in which the legislation is
framed, this is a quite a broad power. The authorisation could come
from a police officer and would proceed solely on the basis of the
authorisation of a police inspector. This is not something that would
have necessarily gone to court, although obviously it relates to people

argument is that there have been unconscionable delays associated with
that, can the Minister give us some examples of where they
have occurred, and can the Minister say why it would not be possible to
build in to the legislation something which required a specific time

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak to Amendment 22M
and also comment on whether Clause 32 should stand part of the Bill. I
will make a very similar point to that made by my noble friend Lord
Harris. We do not have an issue with the principle of dispersal powers.
In fact, we introduced such powers back in 2004, although I recognise
that they were pretty controversial at that time. Our worry
is that the new power now being proposed by the Government can be
authorised much more easily than the existing one and also for longer.
The issue we are raising is that of proper and effective
democratic oversight. Local authorities must and should be
consulted by the police before the issuing of dispersal
orders. That is the process that currently
exists<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:25:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120110000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120110000027">What
I find curious is that the Home Affairs Committee, in its
pre-legislative scrutiny, recommended that there should be a duty to
consult local authorities on applications for dispersal powers of more
than six hours. The Government’s response to that comment by the
Home Affairs Select Committee in the other place was that they would
ensure that the legislation allowed for that. In fact, it does not. It
would appear that the commitment that the Government gave in their
response to the Home Affairs Select Committee has not been brought
forward in the Bill—unless it is in the pile of amendments that
were issued very late last night for debate today, but I do not see
them grouped here at the moment. Unless an amendment is coming forward
from the Government, can the Minister explain why a response was made
to the Home Affairs Select Committee to do something that does not
appear to be in the Bill
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:26:23"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120110000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120110000028">When
evidence sessions were held during the Committee stage of the Bill in
the other place, there was no suggestion that the existing power was
not working properly. The police have also said that working with the
local authority really helps them get community consensus and support
when a dispersal order is needed. That is why we consider Amendment 22M
to be so important. Why fix something that is not broken? If there is
an issue, why try to change the process? If the Minister can tell me
that he and the Government have received representations from
organisations or individuals that suggest that the current provisions
are inflexible and inadequate, that would help to explain why the
Government have made such changes. If he can tell us who those
organisations or individuals were, what changes they sought and for
what reasons, that would perhaps help to explain why a power has now
been proposed that is different from the existing

have a couple of other points. The 48 hours that the Government propose
for these dispersal orders are twice the period in the Anti-social
Behaviour Act 2003. I understand that the only other
legislation that permits dispersal powers in this way is the Violent
Crime Reduction Act. I would understand why a longer
timescale would be used in connection with violent crime. However, we
are not talking about violent crime but about anti-social behaviour.
There must be some evidence base for why the Government think that 48
hours rather than 24 hours is
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:30:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120110000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120110000034">It
would be helpful if the Minister could talk us through
“Directions excluding a person from an area”. I have had
conversations with those who could be practitioners in this area of
legislation, and some of them seem to be slightly confused by how it
will work. It is quite clear how the current process works, but how
will such a direction to exclude an individual or group of individuals
from an area work? If they are to be excluded from a locality for 48
hours, does somebody draw a handwritten map—“This is the
area that you’re going to be excluded from”—to
make clear where it is? Who else should be notified? Forty-eight hours
is quite a long time. If there has been no local authority 
<?notus-xml column=1020?>consultation and it has all been done very
quickly, how do the person and other authorities know that
they are to be excluded for 48 hours? If the direction is to be
withdrawn or varied, how will they and others be notified?

authority gives rise to a number of practical questions. I

new dispersal power will allow the police to deal quickly—I
emphasise that word—with anti-social behaviour centred on a
particular locality, nipping such behaviour in the bud
before it escalates and providing immediate respite to the victims of
the anti-social behaviour that is the cause of the difficulty. The new
power combines the best elements of the current legislation into a
single, more effective and less bureaucratic tool. When I come on to
the business of liaison with local authorities, I think that the noble

current process can be very slow, and as a result victims
and communities can suffer for a number of months before the police can
act. Part of the problem is that the existing dispersal power can be
used only once a dispersal zone is in place, and a zone can
be designated only following consultation with the local council. The
new power will not require prior consultation, so it can be
used more quickly. However, we recognise that there should be some
supervision of the new power, and in this respect the
provision has benefited from scrutiny by both the Home Affairs Select
Committee and the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Responding to points
made by the HASC, we have included the safeguard that the dispersal
power must be authorised by an officer of at least the rank of
inspector. The authorisation may be given if the officer is satisfied
on reasonable grounds that use of the dispersal power may be necessary
in a specified locality during the specified 48-hour period.</hs_para>

the officer to be satisfied “on reasonable grounds” was
included on the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Human Rights.
We had intended it to be part of the test when the Bill was introduced,
and we believed it to be implicit. However, in this instance we agreed
with the committee that it would be clearer to have that explicit in
the Bill. I am grateful to the committee for drawing this to
our attention. The addition of “reasonable grounds”
further emphasises that the test for authorising use of the power is
objective.</hs_para>

tabled by my noble friend Lady Hamwee, the two elements of the test
will mean that officers consider whether use of the dispersal power is
a proportionate response to the problem at the particular time and
locality. As a public authority, 
<?notus-xml column=1021?>the police must also exercise their powers proportionately under general
public law principles and human rights obligations. It is not,
therefore, necessary to include “proportionate” in the
Bill. I am firmly of the view that the safeguards in the legislation
will ensure that the dispersal power is used appropriately, based on
local knowledge of the area and on intelligence that there are likely
to be problems at a specific
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120110000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120110000040">I
return to the question of locality. My noble friend has put forward
Amendment 22N to ensure that an authorisation clearly identifies the
locality where the dispersal power can be used. The authorisation for
the use of the power must be given in writing, must be
signed by the officer giving it, and must specify the grounds on which
it is given. These grounds must include the specified locality and time
period for which the authorisation applies. My noble friend’s
amendment is therefore provided for in Clause 32(1), which states that
the time and location for which the dispersal may be used are as
specified in the authorisation. Perhaps I can elaborate on
that.</hs_para>

32(1) and (2) are concerned with this authorisation process, so the
intention is that the reference to locality in both subsections has the
same meaning; i.e. they cover the same geographical area to be
specified in the authorisation. As drafted, the Bill makes this clear.
The new dispersal power will allow the police to respond swiftly and
flexibly. For example, on a particular housing estate where there is
likely to be anti-social behaviour at the weekend, an inspector could
pre-approve use of the new power by his or her officers. Alternatively,
if an incident occurred at a different time of the week when
it had not been anticipated, a police officer could contact an
inspector for authorisation to use the dispersal in that specific
instance.</hs_para>

As noble Lords know, I have had meetings with the Local Government
Association Safer Communities Board. The association has expressed some
concern about the impact of these dispersal powers on community
relations and has therefore argued for them to be subject to democratic
oversight. I understand this point, but to require consultation would
seriously undermine the flexibility and utility of the power and would
reinstate precisely the difficulties we seek to remove from the current

guidance states that the authorising officer may wish, where practical,
to consult with the local council or community representatives before
making the authorisation, in particular where there are concerns about
community relations and the use of the dispersal in a particular area.
Therefore, for example, when planning the policing of a football match,
the police might decide to authorise use of the dispersal in the area
surrounding the stadium. It is likely that the
police already work with the local authority in

forces can share data about the use of the dispersal power with

the right authorisation has been given—a police community
support officer, rather than a warranted officer, to carry out the
exclusions concerned. What would then happen, if I am right, is that an
area would be defined and police officers and police community support
officers would be deployed with maps in their pockets to give to people

low-level authorisation. There would be no requirement to
consult. It was said that it would be good practice to
inform the local authority; but I think I heard the Minister
say that this would be after the event, rather than before.</hs_para>

could have an enormous impact on community relations. I can think of
parts of London where the sudden arrival of police officers clutching
maps and saying, “We are going to exclude you from this area for
48 hours”, would cause serious problems and disruption. Even if
it were a proportionate response to the problem that had occurred the
previous evening, it seems that this is something that should be
exercised with proper consultation with the community representatives
concerned. I have ended up being more disturbed by these provisions in
the Bill following the Minister’s very careful and helpful
explanation than I was beforehand. It would obviously have been better
had he not tried to explain it to

open with the Committee about what these proposals entail and what they
mean. Perhaps I have not emphasised that the whole Bill is built on
good working relations between the police and local authorities. That
is the whole purpose behind so much of this legislation. The reason why
prior consultation has been eliminated is not because of the situation
where the fairground had trouble the night before and it has been
decided to put in place a dispersal order to deal with the problem the
following evening, because clearly that would be a case where the
authorities would talk together about how to deal with the problem. The
situation we are dealing with is where there is
disorder in an area at that time and where consultation with a local
authority would impede a prompt response to that situation, and prompt
dispersal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:48:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_20_PT_1/570CA7E6429BA8B07CAAF83DB5D4269213C6C407" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 November 2013">Wednesday,

Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> That is even more disturbing because
it implies that if, at 11 am, there is a concern that there is about to
be disorder, that is the point at which an inspector could authorise
police officers. It is always difficult to see how they are going to
have the maps in their pockets to serve to people if they are dealing
with a situation of that degree of urgency. I just think that what we
are being told describes a series of situations where you really wonder
how this is going to work in practice. The danger is that a
misjudgment —and I am sure it would not be common—made
by an officer of the rank of inspector could cause really
serious community disruption. I can envisage circumstances where this
would happen and this would provoke riotous behaviour in a wide area
far worse than the disorder that was originally
expected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:49:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000002"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="131120112000085" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000085">Lord
Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> The noble Lord is concerned about the
rank of inspector, but of course operationally, inspectors are the rank
that has local knowledge and information. That is one of the key
elements of this legislation; we are talking about locality here, and
that is one of the main reasons why the rank of inspector was included
in the Bill, in response to the Home Affairs Committee’s
legislative scrutiny. I should emphasise that these powers already
exist, and the way in which they are being used in this Bill comes as
no surprise to the police nor to local authorities. The powers are used
on a regular basis; they are familiar with the issues raised by the
noble Lord, and the PCCs are in a position where they provide
democratic accountability on the use of these
powers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:50:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Harris of Haringey" PimsId="853" UID="131120112000086" xid="1743" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000086">Lord

Lords<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:50:26"></hs_TimeCode> are
present for the next debate and I am sorry that this is holding them
up. The way in which the legislation is framed—and I cannot
immediately see how it could be done in a different way—does not
necessarily mean that the inspector who authorises it is the one with
knowledge of that particular community or locality. I use the word
“locality” to make sure that I get it exactly right for
the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. The provisions simply say, “an
inspector”. I can conceive of circumstances in which a police
force might decide to have an expert at the rank of inspector who will
deal with dispersal orders for the whole force, who would then not have
the local knowledge or input, which local councillors or neighbourhood
officers might have, about the likely community reaction under those
circumstances. There are some serious issues here which I hope the
Minister will take away and
consider<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:51:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="131120112000087" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000087">Lord

he is saying is that all those different bodies will of course be
working together. But that will be in the absence of an overarching
plan in which the local authorities must necessarily engage—we
debated that on Monday night. And it is in the absence of the specific
power that used to exist whereby a local authority had to be consulted
before the powers were used. That is not a recipe for saying that there
will automatically be that degree of co-ordination and working
together. That is the ideal, and I am sure that it is what everyone
will strive to achieve, but we are talking now about things that will
almost be happening in the heat of the moment, and I question how, in
the heat of the moment, it will be possible to have a map that will
clearly define the locality from which individuals are being

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord is forgetting
that anti-social behaviour is a concern for all public authorities,
whether they are police and crime commissioners, who place it pretty
high up their list of priorities, or local government and elected
councillors or serving police officers. All those authorities place
anti-social behaviour high up their list; they are not going to be
negligent about dealing with the practical application of those powers.
There will be pre-discussions between those authorities on the way in
which all those powers are

do not need in this Bill to tell people what to do or where their duty

need to explain to them what power they have and the methodology
whereby that power can be legitimately exercised. We are doing that in
this Bill. I hope that the noble Lord will understand exactly the point
the Government are coming from in this legislation. If I may say so, he
has a mischievous side to his nature, and I think that he is seeking to
make difficulties for the legitimate aspirations of people in
authority, in local government and the police, who will clearly make
sure that these powers are used effectively in the interests of
preventing anti-social behaviour. That is why I am so resilient in

behaviour under the provisions in the Bill. We believe that this clause
and the dispersal power that arises from it are useful. The current
Section 30 dispersal power has worked well in dealing with longer-term
issues. Those powers are held by the police with local authority
consultation. We have acknowledged the important role that local
authorities have played in this and have designed the public spaces
protection order to be used in much the same way by local authorities
to deal with persistent, long-term problems. The arrangements set out
in Clause 32 balance the need for safeguards with the flexibility vital
to dealing with a wide range of anti-social behaviour. I commend the

peripheral policy issue. It is estimated that 13 million
households—45% of the total—have at least one pet,
including between them over 17 million cats and dogs. The vast majority
of owners are responsible families who love their pets and want to see
all pets treated with the same affection. We are a nation of animal
lovers and are all the better for it—as President Lincoln, who
is much on our minds this week, nobly put
it:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="131120112000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000072">“I

cats and dogs, which are present throughout life’s
journey—from the time children are taught to care for animals,
to the companionship that pets give those in their final
days—are the key to that “whole human being” and
their role is growing in importance. More people live alone and live
longer, often in isolation. Family structures are changing and, for
many, pets fill the gap. They contribute to good health, reduce blood
pressure, and teach the young about the values of a civilised society.
They are central to the lives of many families. That is why this debate
is
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:02:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="131120112000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000021">Today
we face a crisis in animal welfare, as charities struggle to cope with
a tide of unwanted pets, or pets that families can no longer afford to
keep. Blue Cross has reported a 40% increase in abandoned pets since
2010, while the Cats Protection helpline receives four calls asking
them to take a cat in for every one seeking adoption. The reason is
simple: there are too many pets, and not enough good homes where
families understand a pet’s welfare needs and can afford the
cost of looking after them. Policy needs to change and I want to
highlight four areas—breeding and sale, microchipping, companion
animals and anti-social behaviour—where we can take action to
improve the welfare of those who give their love
unconditionally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:02:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000022">I
will deal first with breeding and sale. Seven years ago, the Animal
Welfare Act was put on the statute book. It was landmark legislation,
and I pay tribute to 
<?notus-xml column=1028?>the Labour Government who put it there. However, the legislation has not
fulfilled its ambitions because many of the regulations promised under
the Act have never materialised. One key example is the Pet Animals Act
1951, which protects the welfare of cats and dogs sold as pets. It
became law when people bought animals from a pet shop. However, more
than 60 years on people now buy pets online, which has created a whole
range of problems with back-street breeders churning out kittens and
puppies in an unregulated way. Too many loving pets are subjected to
repeated breeding for sale online. There is some protection for dogs
under the Breeding and Sale of Dogs (Welfare) Act, although this needs
amending to reduce the number of legal litters from five to two, but
there is no equivalent protection for cats, which often get overlooked
in
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000023">I
welcome the Government's support for the Pet Advertising Advisory Group
which aims to make online pet ads more responsible. The noble Lord,
Lord de Mauley, has played an important role in that, but it is only a
start. The promised regulations under the Animal Welfare Act need to be
brought forward; there needs to be a review of “hobby
breeders” of kittens and puppies; and the work of animal
charities in encouraging neutering needs support. When you consider
that one unneutered female cat can be responsible for 20,000
descendants in just five years, you understand how central this issue
is. The role of animal charities is vital here but a government-backed
national neutering day might be an admirable way to support their
tremendous
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000024">Secondly,
microchipping is critical to the welfare of animals because it allows
strays to be reunited with their owners. At present only 33% of dogs
and a woeful 10% of cats arriving at Battersea are chipped. Cats
Protection had to chip 86% of the cats it re-homed last year. This
causes huge pressure on charities, which often have to re-home strays
unnecessarily. It is good news that microchipping is to be compulsory
for all dogs in England from 2016. However, what about the cats?
Arguably it is even more important for them as so many of them roam
freely and are out at night. Without making microchipping of cats
compulsory, Defra could strengthen advice under the cat code, and if
breeding was more tightly regulated, as I suggested, breeders could be
obliged to microchip kittens before
sale.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000025">The
third issue is companion animals, which I raised in Committee on the
Care Bill, when I pointed out the huge role that cats and dogs play in
the care of the elderly and the sick. My noble friend Lord Howe was
encouraging in his response at that time and I hope the Government will
ensure that guidance on the implementation of the legislation makes it
crystal clear that the needs of individuals’ beloved pets, and
the wishes of those individuals—who may often be very vulnerable
or old—to keep them if taken into a care home, are included in
individual care
assessments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000026">Finally,
I turn to anti-social behaviour and attacks by dogs on vulnerable,
often elderly, cats. I know and hear of far too many distressing
incidents where cats are set upon and killed by dogs. Cats Protection
has logged 88 reported attacks this year so far, 89% of 
<?notus-xml column=1029?>them fatal. These incidents—I was going to read out some of them
but they are actually too distressing—can have a devastating
impact on the lives of those who see a beloved cat killed in this way.
The noble Lord, Lord Trees, set out the issue extremely well in his
speech at Second Reading of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and
Policing Bill and I endorse everything he had to say. I ask the
Government to reconsider whether bespoke dog control notices to prevent
attacks on protected animals are needed under the legislation, and to
look at guidance to be issued under the Bill to ensure such appalling
attacks are
prevented.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000027">These
are the most crucial policy areas that need tackling and there are
others I do not have time to address, including the important issue of
updating the licensing regime for catteries and kennels and the role of
animal welfare in the national primary curriculum. I know the Minister
appreciates the breadth of these issues and I am delighted that Defra
has established a canine and feline steering group to co-ordinate
activity. Could the Minister ask that group to review the way existing
legislation and regulation is working and to identify areas where
out-of-date legislation needs overhauling or new regulations need
bringing forward? Might it also be tasked with considering how future
legislation impacts on the welfare of cats and dogs before it is
brought to this
House?</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000028">No
speech on this subject could be complete without mentioning the
charities that do so much in this area: Cats Protection, whose
wonderful work I have seen at first hand; the Dogs Trust; Battersea;
Wood Green; the Blue Cross; and the RSPCA. Their often life-saving work
in looking after, neutering, microchipping and re-homing abandoned
pets, as well as their educative work in schools, is beyond price. Much
of that work— fundraising, fostering and running adoption
centres—is volunteer-based. I pay tribute to everything
volunteers and professional staff do to care for tens of thousands of
defenceless and vulnerable animals. They are a crucial part of a
civilised society and we applaud their dedication and
commitment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000029">This
is a subject about which I feel passionately. I have always believed
that it is the priceless role of this House to give a voice to the
voiceless, and what better example is there than to give a voice to our
friends in the animal kingdom who have perhaps been cruelly treated, or
abandoned, and in need of a caring home? For those of us lucky enough
to live with a cat or a dog, their unconditional love becomes one of
the most precious things in our lives. I have always sought to return
that, but I want to ensure that all cats and dogs are as loved as those
my partner and I have been privileged to share our lives with. This
debate is a wonderful way to do just that, and I look forward greatly
to hearing the contributions
ahead.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_20_PT_1/FB728C9E3B1273A0FA8AC721DCA69B0605CFAD73" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 November 2013">Wednesday,

Hoyle (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, in opening I wish to say something
that may be considered trite but which is nevertheless true. There is
no such thing as a bad dog; what we have are bad owners. It is worth
stressing that particularly now, coming up to Christmas time, when many
people bring in pets that they believe they will love for life and then
find out that the pets are 
<?notus-xml column=1030?>difficult and tiring and need a lot of work. It is right that we are
having this debate at this time and I congratulate the noble Lord on
tabling his Question. While we may not want pets to be treated in that
way, it will happen and a few months after Christmas there will be a
lot more dogs and cats put out on the street. The emphasis being placed
on this issue tonight will be helpful for the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:11:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about the breeding of fighting dogs. Perhaps the Minister can help me
on this: why is the law not enforced more vigorously? For instance, I
would like to know how many people have been prosecuted in the past 10
years for breeding fighting dogs. What about the people who organise
the dog fights at which betting takes place? How many of those have
been prosecuted? These are the problems that we need to look at,
particularly when a good breed such as the Staffordshire bull terrier,
which can be a lovable dog and a good family dog, is used in this way.
Owners, particularly in London, use the dogs for their own protection.
We ought to give attention to that in this debate.</hs_para>

number of incidents involving injuries caused in attacks by dogs that
are out of control has increased by 94% in the past 10 years. That is a
very large increase. The number of people who have died since 2005 as a
result of attacks by dogs totals 16. That is an increase to which we
must pay attention. I was pleased that the noble Lord mentioned attacks
by dogs on cats because it is nearly always fatal for them—and
when it is not fatal, the cat is often badly damaged and frightened,
and becomes even more timid about going out. That is another matter to
which we must pay
attention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:13:26"></hs_TimeCode>. I

it happening.</hs_para>

emphasised too much that one of the main priorities is that cats and
dogs should be neutered whenever possible, and a national neutering day
would be a very good idea. We must get through to people; why should
there be unnecessary puppies and kittens, a lot of which come as a
result of people who do not understand the importance of having their
animals neutered? I join in paying tribute to the charities that are
doing a wonderful job in providing neutering for no cost, which is

importance is the fact that more and more people are going overseas on
their holidays and are putting their dogs and cats into kennels and
catteries. We must try to ensure that these institutions and the people
who run them are of a high standard. Many of them are—in fact
the vast majority are and the people who run them do so because of
their interest in animals. However, in many places the conditions are
not as good as they ought to be. We ought to express an interest in
that and do what we can to improve the standard of care that is
provided by kennels and catteries. Let us try to bring them all up to
the standard of those that are doing their best and are outstanding in

because my time is up, how effective has the Animal Welfare Act 2006
been? I should like the Minister to comment because we can do an awful
lot to improve the lot of our animal friends, who, as the noble Lord

taking part in the debate but millions of pet owners outside. I thank

not to say that I do not understand the many benefits that cats and
dogs bring to homes in our country in terms of companionship, health,
and animals’ ability to encourage people’s better nature.

a huge duty of care to animals, and the way that we treat them is
important. We should reflect on how we do so because it is also an
indication of how we treat our fellow humans. Like others, I pay
tribute to the welfare organisations that do so much for our companion
animals. As a former head of campaigns and former vice-president of the
RSPCA, it is no surprise that I shall focus on that organisation at a
time when it is being targeted because of what is seen to be more
political campaigning. I dispute that, but it nevertheless means that
the vital work it undertakes in re-homing cats and dogs can be put to
one side. The RSPCA is now re-homing more than 11,000 dogs and nearly
30,000 cats a year; we should remember that and pay tribute to the
organisation and its volunteers who carry out that

work that this coalition Government have done on the welfare of dogs.
As has been noted, it is this Government who will bring in compulsory
microchipping for dogs, which will be incredibly valuable in reuniting
pets with their owners; and it is this Government who plan to clear up
some of the confusion in the legislation around the definition of a
public place, so that criminal liability can be extended to private

to cover relates to the welfare of dogs and specifically the
consolidation of dog legislation. As many Members will be aware, it is
presently scattered among 10 pieces of legislation—soon to be 11
if the Bill that made us begin this debate late reaches the statute
books. That plethora of legislation leads to confusion among the law
enforcement agencies—dog wardens, RSPCA inspectors and
others—about which legislation is right to use in different
situations, be it dog fighting, straying, prohibition types or
dangerous dogs. It also means that there can be some lack of clarity
for the general public to know who they should report incidents and
complaints
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:19:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

number of arguments in favour of dog legislation consolidation; I will
concentrate on just four. The first is that the legislation we have at
the moment tends to be very reactive, so does not prevent 
<?notus-xml column=1032?>accidents from happening. It is interesting to note that
both Northern Ireland and Scotland have recently
passed legislation to make earlier intervention possible. Secondly,
most of this legislation was drafted prior to the Animal Welfare Act
2006 and may not take account of the current understanding of dog
behaviour and welfare. That is particularly true in the area of
dangerous dogs, where it is generally accepted that there are critical
developments and environmental influences which affect aggression, and
that it is not just about the breed types. It is interesting that in
America, in October I think—certainly this
autumn—President Obama said that breed-specific legislation was
ineffective and that the right approach should be to encourage
responsible dog ownership regardless of breed.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="131120112000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000042">Thirdly<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>,
the existing legislation is incredibly complex and has required an
awful lot of legal testing. There is nothing wrong with that; court
cases can often be very helpful in understanding what the legislation
was seeking to achieve, but in the area of the Dangerous Dogs Act it
has become extremely complex and expensive to enforce. The seizing and
kennelling costs associated with enforcing that legislation in England
and Wales alone for the police force is £4 million every year.
We are also getting a ballooning number of prosecution cases, which is
making the costs much, much higher for our hard pressed law enforcement
agencies, including the police. Fourthly and finally, the trends in
animal welfare are clearly all moving in the wrong direction. Cruelty
prosecutions are up, the number of dog bites is up, the number of
prosecutions for prohibited types is up, and the number of prosecutions
for people not keeping their dogs under control is up as well.
Something is clearly not working. We are not only compromising animal
welfare but putting human safety at
risk<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:22:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000043">In
conclusion, there are loud voices in favour now of consolidating the
dog legislation. In a recent 2010 consultation for the Government, 78%
of the public said that they were in favour of it, the EFRA Select
Committee said that it was in favour of it, and we know that ACPO is as
well. I ask the Government: what is their current thinking on the case

Lexden (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I come from a family of proud dog
lovers. My long standing personal friend and noble friend Lord Black of
Brentwood, to whom we are all deeply indebted for this debate, has
spoken eloquently of his lifelong devotion to cats. There is ample room
in the human heart for both. Churchill regarded both cats and dogs with
great affection and from time to time brought them together in happy
co-existence. During his peacetime premiership, he had for some while
the exclusive companionship of a fine poodle, named Rufus. Then in
October 1953, a pretty black kitten was found on the steps of No. 10
where, over the years ahead, under Conservative, Labour, and coalition
Governments, a succession of felines would turn up. The 1953 kitten
rushed to Churchill and jumped on his knee to begin deep, contented
purring. “It has brought me luck,” Churchill declared.
“It shall be called Margate,” he added, without further
explanation. He presumably had in mind the seaside town where he had
recently delivered a triumphant 
<?notus-xml column=1033?>speech to the Conservative Party conference. Rufus went off
to bed in a sulk, but swiftly came to terms with the new situation and
contented to share his world famous master with the new

is fitting that we should discuss in the same debate the welfare of two
animals that have given so much companionship to so many people, and

happily relates to the entire United Kingdom and so provides an
opportunity for me to make brief reference to Northern Ireland, a part
of our country to which I am particularly attached. Animal welfare
issues come within the ambit of the Northern Ireland Assembly, but that
is no reason to exclude them from consideration here. At every level
there is much that Belfast can learn from Westminster and vice versa. A
new chapter in the history of animal welfare in the province opened
last year with the implementation of the Welfare of Animals Act
(Northern Ireland) 2011, which introduced—very belatedly
it must be said—the major new legislative framework
of protection created in England and Wales by the landmark 2006 Act.
Enforcement of the law, which had previously rested with the police,
has passed to Northern Ireland’s 26 local councils. They have
banded together to appoint five—just five—animal welfare
officers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:25:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

group of five to do. A rising tide of abuse and neglect is plainly
apparent to the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, the world’s second oldest animal welfare charity,
founded in 1836 and to whose work I pay tribute. All sections of the
community have always been served with unwavering dedication both in
times of turmoil and in the better times that now exist. The USPCA
backs wholeheartedly the calls being made throughout the country for
action in schools, particularly primary schools, to equip the young

cases of cruelty have been uncovered by the USPCA. For example, a
single family in North Down now faces some 200 charges arising from the
attacks it unleashed first on badgers and subsequently on pet cats,
using dogs including illegal pit bull terriers. In its most recent
report, the USPCA expressed profound concern about the increasing
number of puppy farms, which nothing is likely to halt while
advertising on the internet remains unregulated. As an officer of the

just one person was successfully prosecuted. The USPCA is concerned
that undue use is being made of improvement notices in cases where

number of cultural, social and economic developments have dramatically
affected the well-being and welfare of our pet dogs in the UK. Many of
these changes are associated with the breeding of dogs and their
subsequent fate, and it is this aspect of canine welfare on which I
want to

evolving over many years—notably the breeding of dogs with
exaggerated physical conformations, which are detrimental to health.
Indeed, this was an issue that worried me greatly when I was in
practice some 40 years ago. The matter was thoroughly reviewed by Sir
Patrick Bateson’s independent inquiry into dog breeding in 2010,
and remedial action is being taken by, among others, the Kennel Club
and the Advisory Council on the Welfare Issues of Dog Breeding, which
was set up as a consequence of the Bateson report.</hs_para>

action is very welcome, but I have to say that it is at the very least
an embarrassment that this matter was brought to a head by a TV
programme and not by those working closely with pedigree dogs,
including the Kennel Club, the dog charities and, regrettably, the
veterinary profession. We have all been complicit in creating animals
that have been so deformed that they have suffered unnecessarily
because of physical conformation. I am not talking here about the more
complex genetic diseases which affect a proportion of some breeds and
which require genetic and epidemiological investigation to predict; I
am talking about anatomical deformations, plain for anyone to see.
Sadly, there is still a culture which regards dogs as fashion
accessories. We must ensure that in future the whims of human fashion
do not dictate animal structure to the detriment of the health of those
animals.</hs_para>

more recent development has been the emergence of puppy farming, which
is now taking place on an alarming scale. For example, the
counties of Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire alone,
according to Puppy Alert, have a total of 162 licensed premises, which
are thought to produce some 28,000 puppies a year destined for the pet
trade in England. The RSPCA estimates that some 50,000 dogs are
imported from Ireland alone, and then there are imports of unknown
quantity from mainland Europe. The conditions under which these animals
are bred are often totally inappropriate, with overcrowding, lack of
hygiene and lack of attention to the social needs of the animals. This
supply chain leads to a complete separation of the dog breeder and the
parent bitch from the puppy offspring and the ultimate dog owner. This
is bad for the ultimate owner and certainly detrimental to the
well-being of the pup. This dissociation is further exacerbated by the
now widespread practice of selling puppies over the internet, to which
several noble Lords have referred. One has to ask whether the internet
is an appropriate way of selling a dog, but I fear that there is little
that we can do about that.</hs_para>

commercial exploitation and proliferation of dog breeding, often by
criminal gangs, has been accompanied by a huge increase in the number
of stray dogs. The Dogs Trust estimates that around 126,000 stray dogs
were seized by local authorities in the year to March 2011, and the
financial burden on charities and local authorities of dealing with the
stray dog problem has been estimated at nearly £60 million.
Finally, the growth in cross-border trade—especially illegal
trade—exposes the British dog population and, indeed, humans to
the increased risk of imported diseases, some of which are unique to
dogs but others, such as rabies, are fatal to
humans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000057">What
can be done? First, there is much that can be, and is being, done by
bodies interested in the welfare of dogs voluntarily to improve the
situation by education, information and co-ordination. Defra has
published on its website excellent guidelines to follow when buying a
cat or dog. The BVA Animal Welfare Foundation and the RSPCA have
collaborated to launch the Puppy Contract and the Puppy Information
Pack, which provide advice and, on a voluntary basis, have the buyer
and seller agree on their responsibilities with regard to the
animal’s health and well-being. Furthermore, the Pet Advertising
Advisory Group has provided guidelines for websites that advertise
puppies for sale, and those guidelines have been adopted by at least
two of the websites
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000058">However,
there is a need for some strengthening of statutory controls, and I
submit that it would not need new primary legislation. The potentially
excellent Animal Welfare Act 2006, to which many noble Lords have
referred, has laid down clear responsibilities for all animal keepers.
In addition to the provision of adequate food, water and living
conditions, it requires owners to cater for the social needs of
animals, to allow animals to express their normal behaviour and to
provide,</hs_para>

dogs—would be required

Fookes (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, before I get launched and forget,
I must declare an interest as a vice-president of the RSPCA and
president of one of its local branches. I also chair a charity that
seeks to raise funds and channel them to the Companion Animal Welfare
Council, which was set up originally by my noble friend Lord Soulsby
and others, with the object of providing expert advisory guidance on
all matters relating to companion animals. The idea of the noble Lord,
Lord Soulsby, was that eventually it would become like the Farm Animal
Welfare Council, with some government support. Unfortunately, finances
are such that this has never happened. Indeed, we are now finding it
difficult to raise funds, at a time when it is so difficult for all the
animal welfare charities that previously contributed to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:37:22"></hs_TimeCode>. It has
produced a number of interesting reports, one of which went to Defra
when it was considering, in its embryonic form, what became the 2006
Act. It has also considered dog registration and other
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:37:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

delighted that dog registration will become compulsory, with
microchipping, in 2016, but I have to tell the Minister that I
personally, like many others, have waited a long, long time. When the
old dog licensing legislation was abolished in the 1980s, I suggested
that compulsory registration, brought up to date with the then
new microchipping, would be a good idea. In the other place I
sought on two separate occasions to attach it to other Bills, with a
total lack of success. So I am very pleased now, because I think it
will do more than anything else to improve the welfare of dogs and help
to deal with the appalling problem of strays, which has been so
distressing to many of us for years, and also the unwanted dog
population<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:38:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000064">The
noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, mentioned dog fighting—a particularly
horrible and barbaric so-called sport. He wondered why there were so
few prosecutions. I fear that the reason is that the very secretive
groups of people who undertake this are very good at finding distant
places where they may engage in it. For example, when I was a Plymouth
MP, we knew that Dartmoor often provided ideal opportunities for people
to hide away and engage in that barbaric practice. I know 
<?notus-xml column=1037?>from talking to RSPCA inspectors that they virtually had to go
underground, practically in disguise, to penetrate such groups. It is

of great concern to me at the moment is the use of electronic collars
for the so-called training of dogs. As far as I am aware—unless
the Minister can tell me otherwise—it is still legal, but I
think it should be outlawed. The matter could well be embraced in one
of the codes under the 2006 Act. I hope that the Minister will look
into that as a matter of
urgency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:40:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120112000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120112000066">There
are innumerable other matters with which one could concern oneself, but
let me now turn to the subject of cats. Like my noble friend Lord
Black, I am a great lover of cats as well as dogs. One of the most
miserable parts of my life in animal welfare has been seeing how many
cats are unwanted. Sometimes they become feral. The animal welfare
charities are unable to deal with them all properly, and one of the
most miserable things one can do is to go to one of the welfare
establishments where there are cages upon cages of animals waiting to
be re-homed. They all look adorable, and one wants to take them all
home. In fact, years ago when I chaired the RSPCA, my mother was still
alive and I used to take her round on visits—until finally she
said, “I can’t bear to see any more of these unwanted
dogs and cats. Please don’t ask me to come with you
again.” We still have the problem; it never seems to go
away.</hs_para>

hope that the Minister will look again at the issue of unwanted
animals, particularly cats. I am sure that, as other noble Lords have
suggested, a lot could be done with a really good neutering programme.
The animal welfare charities do their best, but I believe
that the Government themselves should be taking a more urgent look at
this. Dare I suggest that they might put a little money towards it? I
am probably addressing deaf ears—very deaf ears. None the less I
shall make the point, because it is time that Governments took more
responsibility, rather than waving it off to local authorities, animal
welfare charities—you name it. I am aware that my time is up, so

vets, pet shops, pet insurers or other media.</hs_para>

we ask people about the welfare of dogs and cats, many ask what we can
do about breeding and better regulation of breeders. The Breeding and
Sale of Dogs (Welfare) Act 1999 provides protection for dogs
used in breeding establishments. Under this legislation, any person who
keeps a breeding establishment for dogs at any premises and carries on
at those premises a business of breeding dogs for sale must
obtain a licence from the local council. Those people who
are not in the business of breeding dogs for sale—the
so-called hobby breeders—and produce fewer than five litters in
any period of 12 months do not need a licence. I would be
interested in whether the Minister agrees with the noble Lord, Lord
Black, and others who argue that this should be lowered to two litters
in 12 months and whether that should be extended to
cats.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120115000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120115000006">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:45:16"></hs_TimeCode>
local council has the discretion under current legislation whether to
grant a licence and, before doing so, must satisfy itself that the
animals are provided with suitable accommodation, food, water and
bedding material; that they are adequately exercised and visited at
suitable intervals; and that all reasonable precautions are taken to
prevent and control the spread of diseases among dogs. Local councils
are responsible for enforcing the legislation. I am interested to know
the Minister’s judgment as to whether he believes that councils
still have the resources and expertise to do
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:45:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120115000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120115000007">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:45:50"></hs_TimeCode>
addition to ensuring that dogs are kept in suitable accommodation, the
law also places limits on the frequency and timing of breeding from a
bitch. Bitches cannot be mated before they are one year old, must have
no more than six litters in a lifetime and can have only one litter
every 12 months. Breeding records must be kept to ensure that these
requirements are adhered to. Puppies produced at licensed breeding
establishments can be sold only at those premises or a licensed pet
shop. There is no mention of the internet. Does the Minister agree that
this regime needs to be
revisited?</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120115000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120115000008">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:46:21"></hs_TimeCode>
Welsh Assembly Government are acting: they began a three-part
consultation in 2010, which ended last month. It seeks to repeal the
Breeding of Dogs Act 1973 and replace it with regulations made under
Section 13 of the Animal Welfare Act in relation to Wales. The policy
intent is to improve the animal 
<?notus-xml column=1039?>welfare of all dogs on licensed breeding establishments. Importantly,

this side, we therefore call on the Government to follow the leadership

Pet Animals Act 1951, as amended in 1983, protects the welfare of
animals sold as pets. It requires any person keeping a pet shop to be
licensed by the local council. That council may attach any conditions
to the licence, may inspect the licensed premises at all reasonable
times and may refuse a licence if the conditions at the premises are
unsatisfactory or if the terms are not being complied with. Councils
are responsible for enforcing the law in this area and anyone who has
reason to believe that a pet shop is keeping animals in inadequate
conditions should raise the matter with the council. However, much of
this Act, which was written in 1951, is still relevant but much is out
of date. Even its 1983 revision predates internet sales of pets, which
we have heard is rife. Pets cannot be sold in the street, on barrows or
at markets but they can be sold on the internet. Will the Minister

My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lord Black on securing a
debate on this important subject. I echo the generous comments made by
him and other noble Lords about the wonderful charities operating with
pets. My noble friend reminded me, as did the noble Lord, Lord Knight,

Minister with responsibility for companion animal welfare, my
ministerial remit applies only to England. As noble Lords will know,
animal welfare is a devolved policy area in the United Kingdom, so I
hope my noble friend Lord Lexden will forgive me if I therefore focus

pet ownership—something referred to by the noble Lord, Lord
Hoyle—remains a clear element of the coalition commitment. More
responsible pet owners lead to improved welfare for all pets. The
comprehensive legislation providing for and underpinning the welfare of
all pet animals is the Animal Welfare Act 2006, and my noble friend
paid a fitting tribute to the previous Government for so legislating.
That Act not only introduces offences for animal fighting and cruelty,
but offers a preventive element by placing a duty of care on owners to
provide for the welfare needs of their animals. There are statutory
codes of practice on the welfare of cats and dogs that summarise the
important things to consider when making decisions on how to care for a
pet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:50:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120115000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120115000016">A
number of noble Lords, including my noble friend, spoke of the sale of
pets and in particular the Pet Animals Act 1951. I understand that
there were proposed plans under the previous Government to review
existing legislation following the introduction of the Animal Welfare
Act 2006. However, they did not pursue the matter. This Government are
not pursuing an overhaul either. Having said that, legislation is
already being looked at under the red-tape challenge. In the context of
my noble friend Lady Parminter’s broad question, perhaps I can

addition, noble Lords are well aware of timetabling pressures. We need
to focus on the most urgent changes necessary to protect public safety.
We see those changes now in Clauses 98 and 99 of the Anti-social
Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill currently before your Lordships.
Rather than take time now—and we will be short of time—I

someone is in the business of selling animals as pets in a pet shop or
through any other medium, they must be licensed under the 1951 Act.
Despite being more than 60 years old, the Pet Animals Act still

well as important legislative changes we are making to improve the
welfare of cats and dogs in United Kingdom, we are also taking forward
important non-legislative policies and tools. The key issue here, as my
noble friend Lord Black said, is the advertising and selling of cats,
dogs and other pets online, which is increasingly controversial as the
use of the internet to facilitate such sales increases. We have seen
prohibited dogs for sale and cats and dogs kept in unacceptable
conditions being advertised. I know that some organisations have called
for the advertising of pets online simply to be prohibited. However,
having considered this very carefully, my position is that such an
approach would be very difficult to enforce and indeed would be likely
to increase the risk of pushing unscrupulous advertisers
underground<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:53:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120115000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120115000020">We
stand a much greater chance of success by engendering an improved

be done by better education of buyers, sellers and those in

Lord Hoyle, I am conscious that we are approaching the festive season

Trees<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T20:55:50"></hs_TimeCode>, and

the Breeding and Sale of Dogs (Welfare) Act 1999, local authorities
have the power to license those in the business of breeding dogs. I
reiterate that the so-called five litter test, which is referred to in
the legislation, is a maximum, not a minimum limit. Whether someone
needs a licence is first and foremost about whether they are in the
business of breeding and selling dogs. There is an obvious read-across
into how HMRC defines trading for tax reporting purposes. It helpfully
provides nine indicators to aid individuals and authorities in
determining whether their earnings are from trading. If some of these
indicators are met by dog breeders, then they are in the business of
breeding dogs and must be subject to licensing conditions. 
<?notus-xml column=1042?>But even if someone is not in the business of breeding, anyone producing
five litters or more per year must be

further clarity, I think it is worth addressing the issue of so-called
“hobby breeders”, which some noble Lords have referred
to. Where hobby breeders are in the business—for instance, there
is a profit-seeking motive or a systematic selling
system—then these too should be licensed, even if they breed
only two litters per

should also emphasise that all breeders of dogs and cats, regardless of
their licensing status, may be investigated by local authorities under
the Animal Welfare Act where there are welfare concerns. It is for
local authorities to prioritise such activities in their area and
demonstrate the level of necessary resource that should be allocated.
The public should alert their local authority where they have welfare
concerns on any breeding establishment or if they believe an unlicensed
breeder should be

“as I was saying”. I apologise again to the Committee for
some confusion about an earlier amendment. Members of the Committee
were either excessively polite, in the manner of your Lordships’

interrupt me for some time. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Ahmad, for eventually doing
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120115000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0002.htm#131120115000036">I

22NA, which provides that the detriment under Clause 40(1) should be

unlike the earlier amendments, seemed desirable to me—I do not
mean that the others are not desirable but that this is my drafting,
not someone else’s. I suggest that the community protection
notice should explain not only the points set out in Clause 40 but the
remedial action proposed given the powers to be provided under

what kind of things are community protection notices intended to deal
with? Clearly, they are intended to deal with different things from
injunctions to prevent nuisance and annoyance. There is a hint in
Clause 54, which talks of repeals and transitional provisions of litter
abatement notices and two other litter notices under the Environmental
Protection Act 1990, and of defacement removal notices under
the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, which refer to graffiti really.
What else is there? Is this just about litter and graffiti? I am sure
that it is not, but for what other things do the Government envisage
that this potentially wide-ranging power could be used?</hs_para>

be used to deal with accumulations of rubbish in the back yards of
empty houses, or of houses where tenants do not care too much about
such things? Could it be used to deal with odour, if someone was making
regular bonfires and causing lots of smoke in the area? Could it be
used for animal nuisances, such as dog dirt? Could it be used for
somebody who insisted on hanging out their washing across the front
street rather than in other appropriate places at the back? Could it be
used against gatherings in the street—for example, if people
wished to use it, in the complaints being made at the moment about Roma
people in Sheffield? Would this be an appropriate way of dealing with
that or, whether or not it is appropriate, could it be used for that?

are some concerns that a number of these powers and the

are concerns about the lack of resources, and of new
resources, for local authorities to use it. As I keep saying in debates
in this Committee: tackling anti-social behaviour and nuisances, and
helping to make our residential streets more civilised places at local
level, is resource-intensive. It means lots of different agencies
co-operating.</hs_para>

ward, every month there is a local environmental audit. People from the
local neighbourhood policing team, localities officers, councillors and
people from the council’s anti-social behaviour unit and its
refuse collection and litter sections go round with a little wagon. If
there are any accumulations of rubbish, they do not bother serving
notices on anybody; they just stick it in the wagon and take
it away. That kind of thing is quite resource-intensive and,
at a time when all local authorities are under real pressure, it is the
kind of thing that will be found difficult to keep going. Yet these
powers will be no good whatever unless there are people on the ground
who can investigate reported problems, see problems for themselves and
have the resources to serve the notices, follow them up and deal with
the people.</hs_para>

what happens in a slightly interesting situation. If you serve a notice
in relation to a nuisance that refers to a piece of land and the person
who you are serving it on transfers its ownership from, for example,
one company that they own to another that they own or are involved in,
or to their wife or their husband, you have to start all over again
because you are dealing with different people. The proposal I am
putting down here does not work but is there to probe. Have the
Government got any ideas about how to deal with this? A remarkably high
proportion of anti-social behaviour problems are caused by a few
individuals who just enjoy playing the system and opposing the council.
They regard it all as a great game. How on earth we deal with these

mischievous, to some extent I am going to be. When the Minister
responds to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, with his list of 10 things
that local authorities might use these powers for, he might tell us
whether the powers would extend to a local authority issuing community
protection notices in respect of, say, a string of shops down its high
street that promote payday loans. That is conduct having a detrimental
effect of a persistent or continuing nature on the quality of life of
those in the locality. Would it apply to the behaviour of a series of
off-licences? In many high streets the only shops are betting shops,
off-licences and payday loan companies. Would it be open to the local
authority to serve community protection notices on those businesses
setting a requirement that they should, effectively, cease to do
business?</hs_para>

anybody is acting mischievously in trying to seek or impose these
notices. I am sure that when the Minister responds to the debate he
will assure us that everybody will use them intelligently and everybody
will work together in a great, grand partnership. That has been his
basic theme throughout our debates but, of course, the Minister has no
idea whether that will actually happen. I am sure that it will happen
in the vast majority of cases, but it certainly will not happen in
every case. The Minister must know that it is almost certain that,
before long, the provision for community protection notices will be

to ensure that any detrimental effect on an individual is
“significant” in order for the test to be met and the
notice issued. I appreciate that a community protection notice should
not be issued lightly. However, the test already includes appropriate
safeguards. Not only does behaviour have to be persistent or continuing
as well as unreasonable, but the individual in question has also to be
served with a written warning. That is on top of any formal
interventions that the council or a police officer may have already
tried. By the time a community protection notice is issued there can be
no doubt in the perpetrator’s mind that their behaviour is
unacceptable. At that point the council or the police should be able to
act, and quickly, to prevent further harm being caused to victims or
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T21:21:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120115000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0003.htm#131120115000056">I
do not believe, given the multi-limbed test and written warning, that
trivial or benign behaviours will be dealt with using the new notice.
Not least, it is hard to see how those could be considered
“unreasonable”. As my noble friend is aware, we have
already published draft guidance for professionals, which provides some
information on how the test should be interpreted. We are working
closely with professionals and victims’ groups over the coming

22NF is well intentioned and I can understand why my noble friend
raises it. When a community protection notice is issued, she is right
that the person issued with it should fully understand the consequences
of what is happening. In fact, as the draft guidance outlines, we would
consider it good practice for some of this detail to be also included
in the written warning. Under Clause 40(7)(b), the effects of Sections
43 to 48, including the possibility of remedial action and the
financial implications of that, have to be outlined in the CPN, so that
is already covered. Councils or the police should not be required to
outline exactly what remedial action could be undertaken in case the
situation changes. However, there is certainly nothing to stop the
local agency from including it if appropriate. The purpose of a
community protection notice is to require the person on whom it is
served to take specified action. The power for a local authority to
take remedial action is very much a
fallback.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120115000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0003.htm#131120115000058">Amendment

22QD and 22QE seek to clarify the powers of the court when an
individual appeals against a CPN served on them. I agree with my noble

the notice by reducing the requirements. However, I believe that this
is already covered in Clause 43(4)(b), which allows for the notice to
be modified<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T21:24:54"></hs_TimeCode>. I
can also understand the point made by Amendment 22QD. It is hard to
envisage a situation where an appeal would result in a notice being
modified in a way that was not in favour of the appellant. However, the
courts should have the flexibility to modify a notice in this way if it
thinks that it is appropriate. Therefore, I do not believe that we
should make this change to the

22NE bring us back to the subject of statutory nuisance. As my noble
friend explained, the amendments are designed to ensure that
there is no overlap between the new CPN and the statutory

Protection Act
1990<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T21:25:46"></hs_TimeCode>.
Amendment 22ND would ensure that the new notice was not used
wherever conduct was already subject to a control under another
statute. Amendment 22NE goes further still and seeks to carve out noise
nuisance from the new CPN. This goes completely against what we are
trying to achieve through these reforms, and I hope my noble friend
will now understand the way in which we see this working alongside the
existing powers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T21:26:20"></hs_TimeCode>.
Victims do not care which power is being exercised or from which
statute it is derived. They do not really care who deals with their
problem or who answers their telephone call at 3 am. They just want
anti-social behaviour to stop. That seems like a pretty reasonable wish
to me; that is what this Bill is seeking to provide. Those tasked with
stopping the behaviour should be able to respond quickly and
effectively, using more than one power where this is appropriate and
justified. This is not least because the community protection notice
can cover behaviour which does not fall within the ambit of statutory
nuisance, even though there may be some
overlap<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T21:27:03"></hs_TimeCode>. These
amendments could result in officers being unnecessarily risk averse,
potentially not using the new power and so allowing anti-social

necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T21:27:22"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T21:27:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

give him three—I have three prepared already—and no doubt
a certain amount of inventiveness will allow me to write to him with
another seven, but at least these give an idea. They can be issued to
any individual or body persistently behaving in a way that has a
detrimental effect on the quality of life of people in the locality.
That is the essence. For example, there is no current notice system to
cover an individual who regularly allows their dog to foul a communal
garden. A group regularly taking the same route home late at night
while drunk, making noise and waking their neighbours: this behaviour
is not covered by the statutory nuisance regime. A third example might
involve a takeaway which persistently allows its customers to drop
litter on the pavement outside and causes noise nuisance late at night.
It could be required to put bins outside the shop and ensure that
customers leave quietly after 10 pm. Current notices can only be used
to deal with one particular type of behaviour. I am trying to give
illustrations of the sort of issues that have considerable anti-social
consequences and which can be dealt with through a CPN

have to say to my noble friend that we have acknowledged the importance
of the statutory nuisance regime in guidance. We have acknowledged the

have transferred their interest in the issue to another person. I do
not think that my noble friend was referring to transferring dogs but,
if he were, I can give him an absolute assurance that, as currently
drafted, it is not possible. A community protection notice would be
issued to the person responsible for the dog and any conditions
associated with the owner—for instance, attending a training
course on how to look after the dog—would still apply.
Ultimately, the notice would remain valid. I am happy to consider the

Greaves:</Member></B> I refer to a real case, which has been dealt with
by serving planning notices, particularly Section 215 tidying-up
notices, which are similar to the kind of notice that we are talking
about now. The problem is associated with inappropriate use of land
which is causing problems to people living adjacent to it. It is the
use of the land that is the problem, but notices have to be served on
the owner of the land, and the owner simply keeps transferring the
ownership

at whether a community protection notice could be served on the land in

the problems on it. If the problem is a dog, it is not associated
directly with

regarding various parts of this and for which we thank him very much.
One of the things we talked about was our mutual wish to speed up this
Bill a little and move into a gallop. The slightly languid, if not
sleepy, feeling in this Committee means that it will not happen this

reason is that it is absolutely essential that the district council or
unitary council, which is at the centre of the community protection
notice regime, should know what is going on. It is about the role of
the district council—as I call it—or the unitary council
in dealing with these kinds of things. If constables are to go off and
issue them on their own, or indeed if other people designated by the
local authority are to do this, there is a risk of duplication of
effort—and a risk of confusion for the people subject to the
problems that the activities are causing, particularly if more than two
or three agencies are trying to deal with it. There is also the
essential co-ordinating role of the local authority.</hs_parafo>

Smith of Basildon (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I would comment briefly
that having looked at these amendments, Amendment 22QA seems to be a
particularly reasonable and sensible way forward. If you think of the
local authority as being at the centre of its place—not just
part of the local council but managing the area—it seems very
reasonable and sensible. This is perhaps a case, as the noble Lord,
Lord Greaves, and my noble friend Lord Harris said earlier, of wanting
the parts of the Bill that are useful to work. This may well assist the

Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 22NC and
22QA are proposed by my noble friend to change the process at the point
where a community protection notice is issued. Currently, when issuing
a community protection notice, an authorised person—be that a
police officer, an officer of a local authority or a person that the
local authority has designated, such as a social landlord—would
have to inform any body or individual that the person issuing the
notice thinks appropriate. Amendment 22NC seeks to remove this
requirement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311211000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0003.htm#1311211000023">Amendment
22QA, in my noble friend’s name, then seeks to impose a
requirement that an authorised person who is not the local authority
must inform the relevant local authority of its issuing of a notice. I
recognise that it is important that a local authority is aware that
community protection notices are in operation in its area but,
conversely, it is also important, as I am sure noble Lords will agree,
that local authorities notify the police. The reality is that police
and local authorities will be working together to tackle local
anti-social behaviour and therefore it is not necessary to put into the
Bill the requirement to inform the local authority. The existing
provision in Clause 40(6) states that the authorising officer
“must … inform” any appropriate individual or body
of the issue of a community protection notice, and it is difficult to
imagine any case where the relevant local authority would fall outside
the definition of “appropriate”. I do not think it
necessary to specify that the local authority must be
informed.</hs_para>

be others whom it would be appropriate to inform as well. As I have
suggested, the police will often have an interest. I fear that the

requirement to informing the local authority
only.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311211000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0003.htm#1311211000025">Our

remedial works carried out by the local authority where there has been
a breach of a community protection notice. Remedial works may be
carried out if a person fails to comply with the terms of a notice
served on them. The local authority may carry out the remedial work
without the consent of the owner or the person who had defaulted on the
notice on land “open to the air”, and Amendment 22QF
would prevent this. The local authority cannot simply enter premises at
will; I am sure that my noble friend knows that to be true. It must
seek the “necessary consent” of the defaulter and the
owner of the premises if that person is not the defaulter. However,
there may be circumstances where the local authority has taken all
reasonable efforts to find the owner but has not been able
to do so. I do not believe that communities should continue to suffer
in such circumstances, and that is why it is important that the
authority is able to carry out remedial
works.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311211000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0003.htm#1311211000028">I hope

you want to take them out but because you want the Government to

the reason why councils will have to be notified is that they have many
years of experience. That is true but it is not why they have to be

are the most important central body as far as community protection
notices are concerned. I am not suggesting that the police are not
important—they clearly are very important indeed—but the
council is the body that has the staff and the ability to go on to the
ground and do something about these problems, and remedy them if that
is required. The Minister said that the Government have faith that
these agencies will continue to work well on the ground as we move
forward. I have no doubt that where this is working well already on the
ground it will continue to do so, and I hope that it will be brought in

about this, but in many parts of the country it is precisely those
council staff and the local neighbourhood policing teams, who are so
vital to this operation, whose employers are wondering how long they

That is just a fact. I am not making a political point. If I were on
the Labour Benches I would be making a horrible political point and
attacking the Government over this, but I am not doing that now; I am
just stating that this is the fact that we have to live with. Many of
us are fighting hard to ensure that in our own patches the mechanisms,
the structure and the networks continue, but with every year that
passes that gets more difficult. It is one thing to pass legislation
like this that puts forward exciting new ideas and measures to deal
with the problems, but if we cannot do it on the ground because there
are no staff left, it is very difficult. Having moaned in that way, I

Environment Agency has described Japanese knotweed as the most invasive
species of plant in Britain. The problems are well known: on river
banks, on pieces of land, invading people’s gardens, on building
sites and on built sites, it is dreadful. It is an incredibly strong
weed, which can grow up through concrete and split it, and cause the
foundations of buildings to require attention. It can do all sorts of
things, and it spreads very
easily<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T21:58:36"></hs_TimeCode>. It does
not spread in the normal way, by sexual reproduction—not in this
country, anyway. In this country the whole thing is apparently 
<?notus-xml column=1057?>one huge female clone: it is all the same plant. It
spreads vegetatively, and if you take a small part of the stem, the
root or the leaf and just drop it, the odds are that you will have an
infestation in that location before
long<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T21:59:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

huge problems. Local authorities attempt to deal with it on their own
land—certainly my local authority does, perhaps because I nag it
all the time—but it is much more difficult when the weed is on
somebody else’s land. What is the law that applies to it?
Because of its invasive nature, Japanese knotweed is listed in Schedule
9 and subject to Section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside
Act 1981. All that does is make it an offence to plant Japanese
knotweed and cause it to grow in the wild. That is all very well if it
is in the wild and growing as a weed on waysides or wherever. It does
not apply to Japanese knotweed which you have not planted but which is
growing on your property and you are not
dealing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T21:59:59"></hs_TimeCode> with it.
Under cross-compliance rules, if a farmer receives the single farm
payment, he is required to take reasonable steps to prevent its spread.

not easy to get it removed but it is possible. It may take two or three
years and several sprayings. There are lots of technical aspects to it.

I would really like to see when this legislation is passed, as it no
doubt will be, is joint advice. I realise that the legislation will not
refer to specific problems, whether Japanese knotweed, littering or
anything else because the whole purpose of the CPN is to be general.
But it would be very helpful if the Home Office and Defra could issue
joint advice—together with CLG or anyone else—to councils
and people about how to deal with this when the legislation is passed.
There is a huge reluctance on behalf of many councils because they are
frightened of the problem. They think that it is too expensive and that
it cannot be solved. It is absolutely crucial that there is a war
against Japanese knotweed throughout this country to get rid of it as
far as
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311211000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-0003.htm#1311211000047">I

height of cool, Lucky Strike. I was terribly tempted, I must say, by
Balkan Sobranie, which were wonderfully coloured little cigarettes with
gold filters. I had a friend, Brian, who smoked them and I used to sit
there with one unlit, toying with this beautiful, chic sophistication

difficult it is to break the habit once you have formed it. I was a
smoker in my youth. I progressed to a pipe, and on one occasion I was
in some gathering with fellow young people when the bowl of my pipe
dropped off into a pint of beer. I realised that this was a message
from God and that one or other had to stop. I had little difficulty in
choosing beer with which to continue. We all have these experiences. I
am sure I am not alone in remembering with some guilt that, having
joined the smoking culture—certainly the presentation of tobacco
and cigarettes was an important part of the wooing of a person into the
habit—I used to take tremendous pride in choosing the right
cigarettes for my father on his birthday or at Christmas. That was very
important, because he was a smoker and I was able to present him with a
well wrapped packet of what he would like. Later in life, he suffered a
severe stroke which left him speechless for the rest of his life, and I
have always had an element of guilt about the fact that I no doubt
contributed to that development in his

Lord Bishop of Chester:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak very
briefly. Over the years I have been attracted by
most vices, but never to smoking, so in the circumstances it is easy to
speak against it. I will add that it is not just a domestic issue. The
noble Lord says that he has an interest in BAT. What astonishes me is
the way in which the growing awareness in this country of the dangers
of smoking seems to be so slowly taken up in the developing world. We
have a moral need, not only in relation to our own children but to the
developing world, to make clear the dangers of smoking. It really is a
global issue. It behoves particularly the wealthier
countries—not least if the interests of big business are
engaged, as undoubtedly they are, or those of the Exchequer—to
give a proper lead. I think these amendments do just
that.</hs_para>

Howarth of Breckland (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I want to speak
briefly because the health arguments have mainly been made. I want to
make two rather different points. I support both of these amendments. I
have a long-standing reputation for campaigning in this area. I find it
interesting that the industry has suggested, from time to time, that
packaging makes no difference. If it makes no difference, why is it so
important? Let us get on and take it off the shelves. We have all the
evidence to show that children are attracted to packaging and we all
know our own instincts. I have never smoked, but both my parents died
from smoking related diseases. My mother was addicted and said that I
should stop anyone else I could from smoking.</hs_para>

the smoking in cars amendment. Having said that the medical arguments
are substantially made, which the Minister knows whatever the position
he has to take on this, there is also a clear safety issue about
smoking with children in cars. Anyone who has driven with two arguing
children strapped in the back of their car—because children
argue in the backs of cars, and if yours do not, then they are
remarkable—will know how distracting it is and how you have to
absolutely keep your concentration up. So I have always found it
strange that we do not stop people being distracted by fiddling into a
bag or a pocket for a packet of cigarettes, finding something to light
up with and taking their eye off the road—we have all seen
it—while they light a cigarette. They then have a cigarette in
one hand while they are driving their children in their cars. This is
an added reason for ensuring that people cannot smoke with children in
cars. You might say that where there are two people one of them may
smoke, but there is the medical reason and this additional safety
reason. I have no idea whether there are any statistics on accidents
because people have been smoking in cars, but when you think of the
legislation we have to stop people using mobiles, which in some ways
are much more automatic, I cannot understand why we do not have similar
legislation to protect children, not only for the medical issues in
relation to their health but also for sheer practical safety
reasons.</hs_para>

don’t want a nanny state. We don’t want people telling us

are particularly vulnerable to second-hand smoking as they breathe more
rapidly and inhale more pollutants than adults. ASH has shown that
parental smoking is a causal factor of asthma in children, and that the
prevalence of asthma increases when the number of smokers in a car or
in the home increases. Children exposed to second-hand smoking also
have an increased risk of lower respiratory infections, bronchitis,
middle ear disease, bacterial meningitis and sudden infant death
syndrome. There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:06:16"></hs_TimeCode>
is also a very social issue, one that is directly related to making our
society fairer. Evidence has shown that children living in the poorest
households have the greatest levels of exposure to smoking and that
passive smoking has been shown to affect children’s mental
development and school absenteeism. That clearly undermines our efforts
to increase social mobility. Experts have suggested that banning
smoking in cars while driving with children is an important step in
limiting the effect of second-hand smoking.</hs_para>

those more interested in the economic side, the numbers are staggering.
The health disorders caused by smoke-generated disorders cost the NHS
about £23.3 million a year. In particular, £4 million is
spent on asthma drugs for children up to the age of 16. The future
treatment costs for smokers who take up smoking as a consequence of
smoking by a parent could be as high as £5.7 million each year.
Parents need to consider that, in choosing to smoke, they will find it
difficult to explain to the children why they in turn should not smoke.
The NHS has shown that children who grow up with a parent or family
member who smokes are three times as likely to start smoking
themselves. As we can see, the issue has implications for public health
and our society in general, and ignoring it would mean ignoring the
poll in 2009 which found that a majority of adults in England were in
favour of banning smoking 
<?notus-xml column=409?>in cars, with 74% opposed to smoking in cars with
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:07:51"></hs_TimeCode>. The

Tyler of Enfield (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I rise extremely briefly
because I had my go on Monday. I want to add just one point to what my
noble friend Lord Storey has said. Some people are saying,
“Let’s start with an awareness-raising campaign.
Let’s see what we can do there. We don’t need to go
straight to legislation”. I do not agree with that. The most
effective example that I can cite was the introduction of legislation
for the wearing of seatbelts. Awareness-raising had been tried, but it
achieved only 25% compliance rates, but soon after the legislation was
introduced, alongside the awareness-raising effort—you need
both; it is not one or the other—91% of adults started to wear
seatbelts. As my noble friend said, it is clear that it has saved
lives. I think that very few people in this country, and certainly the
polls show it, now think that that is an infringement of civil
liberties<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120100000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#131120100000036"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" PimsId="1076" UID="131120100000099" xid="1755" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#131120100000099">Lord

my noble friend Lady Hughes said on Monday, ever since the advertising

Amendments 265 and 266 build on the excellent Amendment 264.
Essentially, we seek to strengthen that amendment by requiring the
Secretary of State to make regulations rather than by simply giving him
the discretion to do so. It is important that Ministers are left in no
doubt that they need to introduce standardised packaging, which is why
I hope that those noble Lords who have proposed Amendment 264 and
spoken so eloquently to it will accept our amendments to strengthen the

plain packaging on cigarette packs would bring to children’s
future prospects. Indeed, we have already had clear evidence from other
countries of the benefits of taking this measure, as we have just
heard, and I need not repeat it. We have also been told of the serious
and life-limiting impact that passive smoking in cars can have on young
people’s lives. Children often do not know the true risks of
passive smoking in vehicles until they have already been exposed to it
and certainly cannot be expected to make informed decisions about
smoking, particularly not those from the most vulnerable backgrounds.
For many the very real risks are not understood until, crucially, they
are already

knowledge that more than 200,000 children in the UK started to smoke in
2011 should alone be quite enough to urge us to take this preventive
action. Awareness campaigns and sharing information are crucial

clearly not enough. Surely, we have a responsibility to protect

that I have a history as regards smoking as I used to be a chain smoker
but gave it up when I was six. About 15 years ago in your
Lordships’ House I introduced an amendment to ban smoking in
public places. I put it on the back of a criminal justice Bill, which
is a convenient way of moving things. I was amazed that the House was
full right up to midnight when my amendment was discussed. I fondly
imagined that everyone had come to listen to my wisdom, but little did
I know that the House had filled with smoking barons waiting to pounce.
However, I got my own back on them because at the end of the debate I
thanked everyone for their contributions and, instead of saying,
“I beg leave to withdraw my amendment”, for some reason
or other I said, “Amendment not moved”. They all looked
very puzzled because we had just spent hours discussing it. However,
the noble Baroness on the Woolsack quickly said, “Amendment not
moved”, passed on and they lost the opportunity to vote. They
were furious and I was very
pleased<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:19:25"></hs_TimeCode>. As a

and let me say immediately that I have listened carefully to all the
contributions, both today and on Monday. Perhaps I may start by
addressing Amendment 263. I should say at the outset that I have
enormous sympathy with the aim of this amendment, which is to protect
children’s health from the harm that can be caused by
second-hand smoke, and I am grateful to the noble Baronesses, Lady
Finlay and Lady Massey, and the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, along with

all agree that we do not want to see children exposed to second-hand
smoke anywhere. The evidence of the harm caused by second-hand smoke is
clear, but many children continue to be exposed to it, both in the
family car and in the home. The question posed by this debate is
whether legislation is the most proportionate and viable means of
addressing the problem. We need to consider that question carefully and
I must say that, while supporting the spirit of the
amendment—which I certainly do—the Government are not
convinced that creating new criminal offences is the right
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:21:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

people’s minds there are civil liberties considerations, which
might include what is often perceived as state intrusion into
people’s private space. That is a complex area worthy of a
debate on its own, but of course I acknowledge that any arguments on
that score need to be balanced against the need to protect children.
Since 2007, evidence shows that smoke-free legislation has been
effective in reducing exposure to second-hand smoke in virtually all
enclosed work and public spaces, public transport and work vehicles.
Compliance with the law is high and we now benefit from clean air at
work, in pubs and restaurants, and on public transport. However, it
does not automatically follow from that that it is right to extend the
scope of legislation to cover private cars.</hs_para>

are many practical issues to be considered, particularly around
effective enforcement, which is not something that we have heard much
about during the course of the debate. Smoke-free legislation in
England is enforced by local authority environmental health officers.
They do not hold powers to stop vehicles or to detain people in
vehicles that are already stationary. Consequently, it would be very
difficult for them to take effective enforcement action without the
assistance of the police. Since this is a public health issue rather
than one of road safety, I expect that such an additional duty on top
of their many other responsibilities would be a cause for concern for
the police. The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health has
identified other practical difficulties around enforcement. These
include accurately identifying which vehicles are required to be
smoke-free. For example, small children may not easily be visible from
outside the vehicle. Further difficulties include obtaining evidence of
smoking, identifying the driver and passengers, and proving the age of
the child.</hs_para>

hope that the Committee agrees that there would be real practical
difficulties in effectively enforcing such an offence. If we cannot
credibly enforce the law, then the credibility of the law itself is
called into 
<?notus-xml column=413?>question. That is why the Government firmly believe that, rather than
focus on what would be a complicated and resource-intensive enforcement
process, we should continue the non-legislative approach that the
evidence shows is working; namely, encouraging positive and lasting
behaviour change among adults who place children’s health at
risk. My noble friend Lord Storey urged us to do this. Our
comprehensive tobacco control plan states:</hs_para>

Health England, building on last year’s success, ran another
hard-hitting marketing campaign in June and July this year. The
campaign aimed to encourage smokers to stop and think before smoking in
front of children, whether in the home or in the car. It also
encouraged smokers to order an NHS smokefree kit with tips on making
the home and car entirely smoke-free spaces, together with support to
help quit smoking

year’s campaign is currently being evaluated, but emerging
findings are encouraging. They show that the campaign has been

behaviour, with almost three-quarters of those surveyed agreeing that
smoking out of an open door or window was not enough to protect
children from second-hand smoke. Of those surveyed, 37% reported that
they had taken action to reduce their children’s exposure to
second-hand smoke, compared with 29% in 2012. In addition, 73% agreed
that the adverts made them realise that smoking out of an open window
was not enough to protect children, and there were nearly 85,000 orders

noble Lord, Lord Palmer, suggested that the Government ought to
introduce an offence of proxy purchasing. I know that shopkeepers and
others are interested in making it an offence to buy tobacco for young
people under the age of 18. I am sympathetic to that concern, but even
were such an offence to be introduced, it would not stop family and
friends sharing cigarettes with children. Therefore, we get back to the
argument about behaviour change, which I think is more relevant

noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, made an interesting point about this
being considered as a road safety issue. I agree that any activity such
as smoking—getting out a cigarette, lighting it, disposing of
hot ash or stubbing the cigarette out—is likely to distract the
driver, particularly if carried out in a moment that is critical for
road safety. However there are a host of things drivers do that have
the potential to be equally distracting, be it eating, drinking,
adjusting the radio, consulting directions or whatever it may be. First
and 
<?notus-xml column=414?>foremost, it is the driver’s responsibility to drive safely at
all times. Section 41D of the Road Traffic Act 1988 already provides a
perfectly adequate offence if a driver fails to maintain proper control
of a vehicle while driving. While a specific offence has been created
for driving while using a hand-held mobile phone, the Government do not
believe that there is any need to introduce a new and separate offence
of smoking while
driving.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120100000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#131120100000055">I

We are not complacent but we remain to be convinced that legislation is
the most effective and proportionate way of achieving this.</hs_para>

the other amendments that we have been debating. The noble Lord, Lord
Faulkner, the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and my noble friends Lady
Tyler and Lord McColl have tabled Amendment 264, which aims to
introduce standardised packaging. I say immediately that I am very
sympathetic to their aim of protecting children and reducing the harm
from smoking. However, as noble Lords know, the Government have decided
to wait before making a decision on standardised tobacco packaging, and
I shall come to that point in a second.</hs_para>

standardised packaging set out in Amendment 264 relate to those
individuals under the age of 18. Importantly, the amendment would not
regulate all packs, meaning that it would still be possible for
retailers to sell branded packs if they did not also sell products
aimed at, or which might be attractive to, under-18s. Preventing young
people starting to smoke is of course very important, but we should not
forget the need to support adults in quitting. There are over
8 million adult smokers in England alone, and we would also
want them to benefit. Therefore, should the Government decide to
introduce standardised packaging, we would want the freedom to draw up
provisions that focused on the packaging itself rather than on the type
of shops where the packs were sold.</hs_para>

concerns are magnified by Amendment 265 and 266, which make this an
obligation on the Secretary of State rather than a permissive power.
Again, I understand the desire on the part of the noble Baronesses,
Lady Hughes and Lady Jones, and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings
Heath, to introduce measures to standardise tobacco packaging but, with

Committee an absolute assurance that that policy is still very much
under active consideration; we have not ruled out its introduction.
However, we are taking the time to consider the possible impact in
detail and to learn from the experience in other countries. The noble
Baroness, Lady Young, asked me to expand on the reasons for that. In
broad terms, introducing standardised packaging may sound like a simple
measure and it is one where the principle 
<?notus-xml column=415?>may sound attractive. However, there are complexities that we are
discovering in the detail that it would be important to get

Lords have helpfully set out the evidence on standardised
packaging. We are of course looking carefully at
that evidence base, and I am not able to add anything to the points
that have been made in the debate today regarding that evidence.
However, as noble Lords may be aware, the Department of Health
commissioned a systematic review of the evidence that was published
alongside the 2012 consultation document. The academics who carried out
that review have recently published an updated report covering the
additional studies published since then, and we are considering those

aspects of the amendment as drafted. Ministers are often advised not to
go into the technicalities but I thought it might be helpful in this
instance if I did so, so I shall share some of the Government’s
thoughts. As drafted, the amendment would make it an offence to sell
tobacco products that did not meet the specified provisions and were
sold by businesses that also sold products that might also attract or
be aimed at under-18s. In practice, this would impose sanctions solely
on retailers and suppliers rather than on the manufacturers. It could
be argued that it allowed branded packs to be sold in adult
environments, such as nightclubs and betting shops, so children would
still be exposed to the effects of branding, particularly at home. This
is a good example of the complexity involved in drafting such
provisions. It is the sort of issue that the Government would need to
look at in detail if we were to introduce such
measures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:33:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120100000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#131120100000062"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Young of Old Scone" PimsId="4704" UID="131120100000103" xid="1797" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#131120100000103">Baroness

because the Government would not come forward with a more general
provision, this amendment has been hitched on to the Bill in
desperation because it seemed to be a sensible place to try to get it
into. The convolutions that the Minister is rightly pointing out would
be solved at a stroke if there were to be a ban on differentiated

taken the opportunity of this Bill to raise the dangers of smoking,
particularly of passive smoking for children, and I have no issue with
that. I merely point out that there are problems with the amendment as
drafted. I am not saying that it would not be possible to draft another
amendment which noble Lords might care to consider between now and
Report<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:35:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Being
able to enforce these provisions as drafted is also a significant
aspect. For example, it may be hard to judge whether a product could
reasonably be expected to attract children, as the amendment would
require, or to determine what might be aimed at or would attract 18
year-olds but not, let us say, 17 year-olds or 13 year-olds.</hs_para>

but if we were to bring in such a measure, we would not want it to be

am most grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken. I am grateful that
nobody has spoken against the amendment that would prevent people
smoking in cars when children were there. The evidence is overwhelming.
This must fall squarely within this Bill; it is about protecting
children from harm. If I may draw on the analogy of a tin box used by
the noble Lord, Lord Storey, that would be classified without doubt as
child abuse. It would fall to the police to prosecute in such a
case—indeed, with other traffic offences, it falls to the
police<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:39:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that the Minister places so much faith in the public education campaign

Wales there has been a public education campaign since 2012 to try to
stop people smoking in cars when children are present, and it is
currently being evaluated. I live there and I can tell noble Lords that
it is not working. In supermarket car parks you see children being
offloaded into the back of the car, the shopping offloaded into the
boot and a cigarette offloaded out of a packet into the driver’s
mouth before they set off. I would dearly love to tap on the car
windows of those people and say, “You can’t do
that” because they are endangering the children in the vehicle.
I also refute the notion that it would be very difficult to identify
who is smoking when there are children in the car. The
Government are committed to children’s health and well-being and
have shown that commitment in many different ways—for example,
through sporting initiatives—yet they allow a practice to
continue which permanently damages children’s lungs and physical
development and leads to premature death in some cases. Indeed, the
instances involving asthma sufferers cannot be
ignored<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T16:41:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="131120100000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#131120100000072">I
remind the Minister that the legislation on smoking in public places
has brought about huge behavioural change and been extremely
successful. I have been repeatedly thanked for that legislation by
smokers and non-smokers, as must have happened to other noble Lords who
campaigned prior to that legislation going through. That legislation
has made it easier for them to attempt to stop smoking or to cut down.
I can honestly say that nobody has been angry with me about the
legislation having gone through, although some anger was shown when it

who are interested in this issue to explain what problems may arise in
this area. I am grateful to him for his critique of the amendment and
see exactly what he means. We certainly need to take it away, redraft

regards the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, in relation to

amendments due to come up shortly, that the Government do not want to
weaken the engagement of fathers in raising their children. We accept
that there is strong evidence that the early engagement of fathers in
caring for their children leads to positive outcomes for children.
However, the amendment is really about exceptional circumstances,

There are many arguments in favour of part-time leave, which is a
feature of many parental leave schemes elsewhere in Europe. It would
help low-income parents who may not be able to afford full-week periods
of leave for any length of time. The TUC points out this week that
inadequate financial support for new parents impacts disproportionately
on low-income families. Indeed, more flexible leave that could be used
to complement part-time work was proposed in a Joseph Rowntree
Foundation report on tackling in-work poverty published just last
week.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="1311213000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000020">It

<?notus-xml column=422?>change of culture of redefining early parenting as a joint
responsibility that the Government keep talking about and that many of
us want to see. I shall expand on this when I move Amendment 266B. It
could provide parents with flexibility and could make it easier for
employers. It is worth noting that, in a recent survey by the Family

difficult to afford long periods of leave, particularly if they are

play here. It seems perverse not to permit people who may have a
complicated and difficult transition between full-time caring and going
to work to do that in chunks of less than a week. Although this has
been explained to me by two notable experts, I still do not quite get
why it is so difficult to calculate pay in terms of less than a week. I
understand the complications of doing it on a shared-parenting basis,
because there are two sets of employers and two sets of payments to be
looked at and, obviously, the Government are the third person in the
room. Even so, when I was last involved in serious payroll work, we had
pretty good figures for what it cost to operate in terms of an hour, a
day or a week. That came up particularly in relation to strike action.
I am sure that the noble Viscount will have been in similar situations,
although I am sure that workers in his businesses were never on strike
against him. However, when workers go on strike and you have to deduct
pay for it, you have work out exactly what it is, otherwise you get
into trouble. In the systems that I was operating, we had a clear view
of what the cost was at that level. If you can calculate what it costs
per hour to employ somebody, you can presumably also make the system
flexible enough to allow them to work in less-than-week blocks, which
is one of the proposals in the

fathers no choice but to stay at work in the early stages of their
child’s life. This approach maintains the outdated perception
that a mother’s place is in the home and a father’s place
is at work. It is known to damage women’s career prospects,
because employers expect young women to take large amounts of time out

unsupported in caring for a child, and fathers do not feel involved in
their child’s upbringing.</hs_para>

the weekly entitlement to shared parental pay that should be paid when
an individual takes one day off would be complex for an employer.
However, this is magnified when a parent decides to transfer their
remaining part-week entitlement to their partner for them to use. It
would be even harder for small businesses, without access to an HR
resource, to administer. The Government are mindful that shared
parental leave and pay will be an innovative system. To add into the

Government instead propose to allow shared parental leave to be taken
on a part-time basis, using a principle that is already well used and
understood by employers. Under existing maternity leave provisions,
mothers are able to return to work for 10 individual working days
without ending their maternity leave or losing their entitlement to
maternity pay for that week. These are called keep-in-touch, or KIT,
days. The Government propose to give parents on shared parental leave
additional keep-in-touch-style days to allow part-time working on
shared parental leave without affecting entitlement to statutory shared
parental pay. It is intended that these days will have a different name
in the context of shared parental leave, which I hope addresses one of
the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, because the
intention for shared parental leave would be different from the
intention for maternity leave. The name would reflect the fact that

the Minister has any figures now—perhaps he could let me

Touhig (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the purpose of my Amendment 266AAA
is to replicate vital existing protections afforded to women on
maternity leave within the new system of shared parental leave. It
provides protection to parents for the entire period during which they
are entitled to take shared parental leave, rather than simply the
period when they are actually away on leave. The amendment replicates
the approach taken by Regulation 10 of the Maternity and Parental Leave
etc. Regulations 1999. This states that in the case of a redundancy,
women on maternity leave must be offered any appropriate alternative
vacancy. Such protections have been crucial in giving women the
confidence to take the statutory maternity leave to which they are
entitled, thus overcoming the fear that in so doing they may be
adversely affecting their job or career
prospects.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000043">It
is important that the new system of shared parental leave allows
parents to feel a similar level of confidence when taking leave. The
intention of the new system is that parents can take leave in short,
discontinuous blocks. Consequently, for this to happen, protection must
not be limited to those periods when a parent is actually on leave, as
this would discourage parents from using the new system of shared
parental leave in the way in which the Government hope and intend that
it should operate.</hs_para>

designing appropriate protections for parents taking leave under the
new system has already been acknowledged by Ministers in the other
place. This amendment not only creates the necessary 
<?notus-xml column=427?>protections to ensure that parents have the confidence to use the new
system of shared leave as intended but creates a system of protections
that is easy for both employee and employer to understand. The clarity
and scope of the protection offered by this amendment will give parents
the confidence they need to fully utilise this new scheme of
shared parental leave. I beg to

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 266AB, 266AC
and 266C in this group stand in my name. Taken together, these would
ensure that existing protections in relation to redundancy and leave
are not lost by requiring rather than permitting regulations regarding
redundancy during shared parental leave to be made and to include
provision requiring an employer to offer alternative
employment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000046">Amendment
266C would enable a parent who has taken a period of leave of 26 weeks
or less to return to the same job, and not just a job within the same
employer. My noble friend Lord Touhig has set out the general case for
where these amendments would take us. I would like to pick up a
particular aspect of that which is the growing concern about
discrimination. Maternity rights and employment regulations that enable
parents to balance work and family responsibilities have been key
drivers in giving women greater access to work and, importantly, an
independent income. Over the past few decades, thanks in no small part
to changes to workplace protections, women have entered and stayed in
the labour market in unprecedented numbers. However, there is still far
to go. Our workplaces have not adapted to meet the needs of this
changing and gender diverse workforce. Women pay a penalty in the
workplace as a result of spending time away from the labour market to
have and care for children, and this time away often negatively affects
future career prospects and earnings. This “motherhood
penalty” helps hold the glass ceiling intact and reproduces
gender stereotypes about women as the “caring sex” that
fuel occupational segregation, to which the Minister referred in a
previous debate. People often talk about jobs being characterised as
men’s or women’s work. For too many women, this still
culminates in pregnancy discrimination more generally in the
workplace.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000047">One
of the cumulative impacts of the effects of the “motherhood
penalty” is that it ultimately leads to a lack of women in
positions of power at the top of all quarters of political, public and
professional life. We surely all feel that that is out of date. Even
before the recession began, it was estimated by the Equal Opportunities
Commission that up to 30,000 women lost their jobs due to pregnancy
discrimination each year. There has been no similar research into the
incidence of pregnancy discrimination following the economic downturn,
but all the indications are that it has increased significantly. In
times of austerity, when employers cannot afford to take any perceived
risk to making profit and growing business, discrimination against
women in the workplace is likely to rise as women, particularly of
child bearing age, appear to be the riskier and less affordable choice
for
employers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:17:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000048">Working
Families, which has been helping us with research in this area, has
evidence that many women are subject to discrimination while pregnant

attitudes among employers and more blatant discrimination taking place.
This includes women being sidelined or left out when promotions are
being considered, demoted on return from maternity leave, and in some
cases women suffer harassment and pregnant workers are sacked. These
are unacceptable practices and these amendments would help to remedy
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T17:17:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000049"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="1311213000438" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000438">Viscount
Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I am glad that these
amendments give us the opportunity to debate the detail of how shared
parental leave will work in practice for families. Shared parental
leave will offer families new choice and flexibility about how they
manage their childcare arrangements in the first months of a
child’s life. It is true that this opportunity will be used by
parents only if they feel confident that they will continue to be
treated fairly in the workplace when they
return.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000050">Current
maternity and additional paternity leave provisions provide protections
to parents against dismissal; additional support when parents are
absent from the workplace during a redundancy process and the right to
return to work into the same job, or in certain cases if that is not
reasonably practicable, a similar job that is suitable for them and of
equal standing. These protections are important to parents and will
directly influence the decisions they make in whether to take maternity
or paternity leave. Mothers on maternity leave and fathers taking
additional paternity leave currently have protection from detriment
while taking leave. Parents taking leave also have the right to be
offered a suitable alternative vacancy in a redundancy situation, where
there is one available. This alternative must be suitable and
appropriate for the
individual.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000051">The
Government recognise that it is important to provide employees with
protection from discrimination and detriment when they are absent from
the workplace for parental reasons. I am grateful to the noble Lord,
Lord Stevenson, for raising this. I believe that we think alike on this
important issue. Furthermore the Government believe that pregnancy
discrimination and discrimination against parents taking leave to care
for their children is unacceptable in any form. This is why the
Government have recently announced new research into the attitudes of
employers on pregnancy and maternity leave as well as the prevalence
and causes of pregnancy discrimination in the workplace. This research
will be jointly funded by the Commission for Equalities and Human
Rights, the Government Equalities Office and my department, the

like to reassure the Committee that the Government intend to make
regulations to provide appropriate protections for employees in the
case of shared parental leave. The Government recognise that it is
important to provide protections for parents who are absent from the
workplace on parental leave and are currently considering the most
appropriate way to protect parents taking shared parental leave from
being disadvantaged in a redundancy situation. The Government intend to
publish draft regulations in the coming months on all key elements of
the shared parental leave policy. This will include the details of the
protections 
<?notus-xml column=429?>while on shared parental leave. The Government’s approach will
recognise the difficulties that parents may face when taking shared
parental leave. Any protections will be proportionate to support
parents in an effective way, enabling them to take leave with
confidence that they will not be disadvantaged. This will be balanced
with the needs of employers to be able to manage their employees
effectively.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311213000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000053">I
turn now to the right to return to the same job. Mothers returning from
a period of ordinary maternity leave have the right to return to the
same job. This protection is also applied to fathers taking additional
paternity leave. Where mothers return to work after a period of
additional maternity leave they have the right to return to the same
job, or where this is not reasonably practicable, the right to return
to a similar job which is suitable and appropriate, the point that the
noble Lord, Lord Touhig, made earlier. The Government consulted on how
to apply these important protections to parents taking shared parental
leave in an appropriate manner. Shared parental leave will create
different challenges for employers. An employee will be able to take
short, discontinuous absences from the workplace under shared parental
leave and this means that employers will have more opportunity to
engage an employee in any reorganisation at work while they are in the
office.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000054">The

Meacher (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak very briefly, having
not participated in this Bill because of other commitments, in support
of the noble Baroness, Lady Lister. As others have said, we are
pressing here for a change of culture. We are looking for fathers to 
<?notus-xml column=434?>play a much more active role in the upbringing of their children.
Clearly, as my noble friend Lady Lister has rightly said, if fathers
are involved right at the beginning, they bond with the baby and will
then be much more involved throughout the child’s early life.
This has to be good. In my view, we are seeing that change of culture:
more and more fathers are bonding with children in the early stages and
being much more involved throughout the child’s
life.</hs_para>

the link between this and what I regard as the Government’s very
helpful inclusion in this Bill of a recognition of the equal importance
of both parents to a child if the tragedy of divorce strikes. If you
involve fathers very closely at the beginning of a child’s life,
they bond, they become involved and they care for that child, but they
are cut out after a divorce—which happens, as we know, all too
often in this country year after year. This is actually very cruel.
Maybe it was okay in the old days for men to remain outside the family,
unattached, but if we are all working towards greater equality of
mothers and fathers in terms of their involvement in the
family—and therefore greater equality for women in the
workplace—we have to follow through, as I believe the Government
are trying to do, to the post-divorce situation, should that tragedy
arrive. Having been through it myself, I know exactly how that feels
for everybody. I strongly support the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, but

bringing her expertise to bear on it and for analysing the case so
well. It is curious that we are stuck on the horns of a dilemma here.
We all agree that we are trying to bring in a new system which rightly
promotes joint responsibility for children, in terms of the various
histories that we have heard about already, and the future we wish to
carve out in our country in which parents jointly take greater
responsibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000074">The
underlying strain in that point, which has been brought up by the two
recent conclusions from the noble Baronesses, Lady Tyler and Lady
Meacher, is that we are coming from a position where fathers have not
actively played a part, although there are notable exceptions and some
of those might be present today. However, the generality which is
revealed by the research is that fathers, despite what has been
available to them up to now, have not taken advantage of it and, to
misquote an earlier comment, they have “lost it”, in the
sense that they have not taken what is available.</hs_para>

expectation that the new arrangements will be a step in the right
direction. However, will they be enough? That is the question. In
particular, I was struck by the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady
Meacher, about divorce situations, which we regret but which are a
natural part of all this. Without the bonding early on or even quite
late on in the growth of the child, the loss of the relationship
between fathers, mothers and children in a divorce is tragic and will
have a lifelong impact.</hs_para>

is a big picture here; there is a lot of activity and change. This is a
new system and the Government are rightly defensive of it, but the
Achilles heel in their 
<?notus-xml column=435?>approach is the statement in the impact assessment that the take-up of
the proposed new shared parental leave by fathers is expected to be
very low—this has been mentioned already—at between 2%
and 8% of those eligible, or between 5,700 and 22,800 fathers,
representing less than 3% of all maternities a year. Is that really all
that our expectations are for that? If it is, it is up to the
Government to defend why that represents a satisfactory situation
compared to the rhetoric that we have been listening to from the
Minister, which tells of a glorious engagement of a much higher
percentage where people would expect joint caring. It is not joint if
only 2% or even 8% of those eligible are taking up what is available,

not.</hs_para>

is indeed disappointing, as my noble friend Lady Lister has said, that
the scheme of the parental leave model, which is good and which we
support, seems to be suboptimal if it does not include anything new for
fathers in their own right. It provides an enabling power for the
Government to extend paternity pay by regulation, and there is already
a power to extend paternity leave by regulation so it may be that the
Minister can give us more hope that this will happen. However, the
commitment does not seem to deliver the same outcome as the proposal in
the amendment that we have just heard about. A father quota would mean
that a father could take leave, as has been pointed out, on a much more
flexible basis later on in the first year rather than in the early
stages and perhaps even later, particularly when the mother is making
the difficult transition back to work. The time would be at his
choosing and the leave would not reduce the mother’s
entitlement; those seem to be very important elements in this debate. I
admit that I myself am not sure whether or not more is needed here but
the case is certainly there to be answered, and I look forward to

of gender equality, and I know that she speaks from a position of great
experience 
<?notus-xml column=436?>when debating these issues. As we are on the subject of gender equality,
the noble Baroness raised the issue of the gender pay gap, quite
rightly, through encouraging fathers’ involvement in home life.
The Government agree that this is extremely important. That is why
we are extending paternity pay powers in this Bill and will
look to extend paternity leave and pay at a later date if we need to
encourage fathers’ take-up, but I will be saying a little bit
more about that later in my comments.</hs_para>

involvement brings enormous benefits to parents and children. Fathers
who are engaged in caring for their children early on, as has been
mentioned, are much more likely to remain involved as their child grows
up. This involvement means that their children benefit from better peer
relationships, lower criminality, fewer behavioural problems, higher
self-esteem and higher educational attainment and occupational
mobility. The Government are aware of the international evidence that
demonstrates that fathers are more likely to take leave if it is
reserved specifically for them and paid at a higher rate. The
Government’s original ambition to extend leave reserved
exclusively for fathers was set out in their Modern Workplaces

concept of a so-called “daddy month”, which would have
reserved a portion of shared parental leave for fathers in a very
similar way to the “father quota” leave entitlement

review the decision on whether to extend paternity leave and pay by
using information on the take-up of shared parental leave and pay from
the series of surveys on maternity and paternity rights and work-life

extension of paternity leave rather than introducing a new type of

to encourage a long-term culture change in the UK to enable and

assessment of the outcomes of the policy needs to understand how
employee and employer attitudes, as well as behaviours, are changing.
There needs to be flexibility in how this is monitored. The best source
of information to understand employee attitudes is through surveys of

Touhig:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 266D and 266E deal with
multiple births. Amendment 266D seeks to allow additional leave and
Amendment 266E seeks to allow additional maternity pay, both in
proportion to the number of
births.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000098">I
believe that these amendments are necessary due to the intense
additional pressures that parents of multiple births face over those of
single births. As a grandfather of twins, I can certainly testify to
the truth of that. Currently both groups receive the same entitlements
to pay and leave. Maternal stays during birth admissions are 60% to 70%
longer for multiple births than single births. Even prior to birth,
expectant mothers of multiple births are six times more likely to be
admitted into hospital and more than twice as likely to be admitted
into intensive care as expectant mothers of single
babies.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311213000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000099">In
addition, twins are 10 times more likely to be admitted to neonatal
special care units; 44% of twins and 91% of triplets are born
prematurely and spend time in neonatal care. On average, parents of
multiple births spend a larger proportion of their maternity and
paternity leave in neonatal units, and both mothers and children are
more likely to face serious health complications. All this reduces the
amount of time that parents have to bond with their children and settle
into parental life. They have less time to do what parents of single
children have to do, even though they have more children to do it with.
It is an alarming fact that 20% of mothers of multiple births suffer
from postnatal depression, double the proportion of mothers of single
children.</hs_para>

births do not merely face additional emotional and health issues but
financial ones. They are far more likely to experience economic
hardship in the first 18 months of their children’s lives than
parents of a single child. A report published this year by the Twins
and Multiple Births Association, titled <I>Multiple Births
Parents’ Experience of Maternity and Paternity Leave</I>,
revealed that 61% of respondents did not have enough maternity and
paternity pay to cover the cost of their leave. In order to get by, 32%
stated that they 
<?notus-xml column=440?>put money on their credit card and they could not pay it off in full at

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a long group,

listened to my noble friend Lord Touhig’s very eloquent
contribution on the question of multiple births, I wondered whether it
might have been better to have a separate debate on each of them

amendments in my name in this group remove the limit on fathers’
or secondary adoptive parents’ time off to attend antenatal
appointments, which is currently restricted to two occasions of six and
a half hours each. Amendments 267F and 267H introduce an alternative of
“reasonable” time off for fathers or secondary adoptive
parents. Amendment 267K proposes that additional time off should be
provided for fathers or secondary adoptive parents where the pregnancy
is of twins or multiple births, so in that sense it reaches out to the
points that my noble friend Lord Touhig was
making.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000105">The
introduction of time off for fathers and adoptive or surrogate parents
to attend antenatal appointments is very welcome. However, the Bill not
only limits the unpaid time off to just two appointments but prescribes
the maximum amount of time that fathers can spend away from work to six

by regulations—if at all—and should not be in the

is a rule of thumb that Governments try to take Henry VIII powers
whenever they can in legislation and Oppositions traditionally oppose
them but I am afraid I am turning the cart round this time. I think the
Government are being too detailed here. This area requires a sensitive
regulatory approach; for example, the amount of time you need to go to
an antenatal appointment largely reflects the complexity of the
pregnancy and, indeed, whether it is a single or multiple pregnancy. If
it is multiple, we know that that requires more scans. Having the time
to do that is not just about the forthcoming child but is a chance for
the other parent to be involved in looking after existing
children.</hs_para>

situation here. We think it would be more sensible to try to find a
formulation—which we have tried to set out in the amendments

which fathers and secondary adoptive parents are allowed reasonable

already that pregnant women are entitled to reasonable and paid time
off to attend antenatal appointments, so we are looking for a bit of

of my own time and I could take the time off, but I recognise that if I
had been responsible to another employer it might well have been
difficult to get the sort of time that I felt was important to spend
with my partner. I have a personal interest in that but it is not the

some rough edges to what one might want to do here, but the Government

wish to encourage the involvement of fathers and partners in pregnancy
from the very earliest stages. Attendance at antenatal appointments
forms a key part of this involvement. Research demonstrates that the
greater the involvement of the father in the pregnancy, the more likely
he is to remain an active father when the child is growing
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000112">Antenatal
appointments are essential in all pregnancies to care for

pregnancy, however, can develop complications. This can happen at any
stage and is always distressing for the parents involved. It is also
likely to mean that the pregnant woman will need to attend additional
antenatal appointments, often at short notice. Many fathers will wish
to accompany their partners to these appointments to give
practical and moral support. The Government wish to
encourage them to do so.</hs_para>

and certain intended parents in surrogacy arrangements. This is a
significant step forward.

work in the Highlands, for example, that the employer will take a

turn to the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Touhig. These
relate to additional maternity provision for mothers who have multiple
births. The early months after the birth of a child are often a 
<?notus-xml column=443?>joyful and exciting time, but I think everyone in this Committee would
agree that they can also place great demands on parents. These demands
are amplified when there is not just one new baby to care for, but two
or more. Straightforward tasks such as feeding, changing nappies or
leaving the house can pose enormous challenges. Multiple pregnancies
often result in premature births, bringing additional health
complications for the babies and stress for the
parents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000121">Financial
pressures on families with more than one baby increase as well. Having
a baby is expensive, but when the costs double or triple it can be very
daunting for the individuals involved. I can understand the desire of
the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, to ensure that parents who have multiple
children from the same pregnancy receive support at this challenging
time. I applaud the fact that he produced some interesting statistics
to support his comments. It is important, however, to bear in mind that
the period of maternity leave to which women are entitled in Great
Britain is one of the longest in the world. The purpose of this leave
is to enable the mother to recover from birth and to bond with her new
baby or, in the case of a multiple birth, her new babies. The amount of
time off work that mothers take will vary depending on the needs and
wishes of the
individual.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000122">The
current maternity leave entitlement is 52 weeks per pregnancy, to which
all employed women are entitled. The Government believe that this leave
entitlement allows all women sufficient time to recover from all birth
circumstances and care and bond with the baby or babies prior to
returning to work. The vast majority of mothers choose to return to
work before the end of the maternity leave period. Eligible mothers are
also entitled to up to 39 weeks of statutory maternity pay or maternity
allowance. Statutory maternity pay is paid at 90% of earnings for the
first six weeks of maternity leave, and at the lesser of 90% of salary
or £136.78 per week for the subsequent 33 weeks. Maternity
allowance is paid at the lesser of 90% of earnings or the flat rate of
£136.78 for the full 39 weeks. As with statutory maternity
leave, this entitlement is per pregnancy rather than per child
born.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000123">Multiple<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T18:12:33"></hs_TimeCode>
babies will mean additional expenditure for families. It is important
to emphasise, however, that statutory maternity pay and maternity
allowance are not intended to go towards the additional costs of new
babies. They are intended to provide a measure of earnings replacement
to enable the mother to be absent from the workplace on maternity
leave. The financial needs of different families will vary. The level
of a mother’s income while she is absent from the workplace may
also depend on contractual pay enhancements that are available to many
women for part or, in some cases, all of their maternity leave. The
eligibility of an individual for these statutory payments is
underpinned by their labour market attachment and their relationship
with an individual employer. The Government do not therefore consider
it appropriate to link the amount of pay available with regards to any
statutory pay following birth or adoption to the number of children in
a pregnancy or adoption arrangement. I hope that noble Lords are
reassured by this explanation and ask the noble Lord to withdraw the
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T18:13:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

300,000 children are being raised by relatives and friends. Only an
estimated 6% of children who are raised in family and friends care are
looked after by the local authority and placed with approved foster
carers. Children in kinship care do better in terms of attachment and
achievement, but their carers are under severe strain—95% of
family and friends carers say so. In the previous debate I called them
heroes, and so they are. We are not really addressing the inequalities

Kinship Care Alliance attributes this strain to three major factors:
kinship carers are not entitled to local authority financial or other
support—financial support is discretionary; many kinship carers
have to give up jobs to support the children and they have no right to
specific services and benefits. Despite guidance to local authorities
in 2011 which stated what support they should provide by September
2011, 30% of local authorities do not have a family and friends care
policy. Financial costs include the immediate cost of a child coming to
live with a carer, the costs of applying for a legal order to provide
the child with security and permanence, loss of income and pension
rights and, finally, the considerable costs of raising a
child.</hs_para>

would bring family and friends carers and special guardians in
employment within scope for statutory entitlement to pay and leave when
taking on the care of a child. The Bill extends the right that adoptive
parents have to take ordinary and additional adoptive leave to approved
adopters who have looked-after children placed with them. By contrast,
the vast majority of family and friends carers who are raising children
outside the looked-after system are not currently entitled to even a
day of statutory paid leave when they take on the indefinite care of a
child. Many have no entitlement beyond a few days’ unpaid
emergency leave. That is a public policy that conveys that kinship
carers have less value or make a lesser contribution than other carers
of children, even though the children they care for often have complex
needs. That cannot be

take on the responsibility, often in very difficult circumstances and
at considerable cost to themselves, saving the taxpayer considerable
amounts of money and achieving better outcomes for the child than if
they had entered the care system. It is irrational in so far as the
statutory rights to leave for parents, adopters or prospective adopters
have been or are being improved, but no statutory rights are extended
to the kinship carers of thousands of our most vulnerable children. It
is inconsistent with current welfare policy in that the absence of a
statutory right to leave, on taking care of the child, raises the
barriers to carers’ continued workforce participation and
increases the likelihood that they will become long-term unemployed and
dependent on benefits. That undermines participation in the workforce

that kinship carers face do not lie only in the requirements of the
welfare system, they also suffer from the complete lack of recognition
in employment law. The imbalance in their right is inconsistent with
the protection of child welfare, in that kinship carers need to take
leave to settle the children, who have often been through so much. This
often comes after a long period of family crisis; the children can be
traumatised and insecure, and they need to know that someone is there
for them. That is precisely why social workers often want or require
carers to take time out of work. There are also the practical
requirements of making appointments with schools, solicitors and social
workers, arranging legal orders and so on. Often, the children arrive
unexpectedly in just the clothes they are wearing, but there is not
even the most modest statutory provision allowing employed carers leave
from their employment. Yet kinship care is the most common permanency
option for children who cannot live with their birth parents. The same
arguments apply to the extension of parental leave to kinship carers as
were advanced for the introduction of adoption leave in the Employment
Act 2002: the need for time for children to settle with and bond to
carers and the advantages of enabling carers to remain in the labour
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000136">To
scope the problem, an estimated 60,000 kinship carers have dropped out
of the labour market to bring up children. The reasons for this include
the needs of the child, but the fact that they are not entitled to time
off increases the likelihood of their leaving the labour market, so
contributing to the high proportion of kinship carers living in
poverty. Family Rights Group research found that one-third were living
on incomes below £350 a week. Grandparents Plus found that 73%
of kinship carers were working before the children moved in, but that
almost half of those who had been working left their jobs when the
children arrived. Some 83% of those who gave up work say that they
would have liked to have remained in work, while of those who gave up
work just 13% are now back in work. Similarly, a Family Rights Group
survey found that 38% of family and friends carers had left their job,
lost their job or taken early retirement when they took on the care of
the child.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311213000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000137">The

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak briefly to
make two points. First, as the noble Baroness indicated, this is both a
short-term and long-term financial issue. The previous Government and
the present one, I fear, have taken the same position, which is that
paying kinship carers in the short term would be too expensive.
However, as many noble Lords have pointed out, it has tremendous value
and advantage in the longer term. I only wish that a Government could,
if not introduce the whole package, at least take one
step.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000143">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T18:34:46"></hs_TimeCode>
remind noble Lords that the Select Committee on Adoption Legislation,
which I was part of, pointed out that there was very little difference
in outcomes— 
<?notus-xml column=451?>indeed there might be better outcomes—for children who were in
special guardianship orders compared to those who were adopted.
However, we treat those two groups in a totally different way. That is
irrational. If we could just make a start with special guardianship,
where there is an order and it is quite clear that the care is going to
continue, we would feel we were taking a step
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0001.htm#1311213000144">Overall,
we spend very little these days. The news today is that we are almost
unable to meet our commitments to protect children with child
protection procedures and that social workers are under tremendous
pressure. I notice that the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, glanced at me,
because I am a social worker by background, when she said that social
workers are actually insisting that people take the time off—of
course they are, because, as the noble Baroness pointed out, they have
a responsibility to make sure that these children are properly cared
for. Most of those social workers would be delighted if they could
recommend that they were paid for that. The old Section 1 of the 1963
Act, which used to help with this, has long gone, and there are very
few provisions now to help these families get through even the initial
difficult times, never mind the longer period of caring for a child who

children in their family—as they would wish to rather than let
anyone else take over the care of the children—and somehow the
state does not see it in its purview to give help to these families.
With the changes in the benefits system, these families are finding it
more and more difficult to survive. Consequently, as noble Lords know,
more children will come into care. These situations will break down as

267A proposes a new form of unpaid adjustment leave similar to parental
leave—a modest entitlement of a one-off period of at least four
weeks for a kinship carer during the first year after a child moves in.
Often children arrive without notice and it may be unclear how long the
child will be staying or whether it will be a long-term arrangement.
However, the children have immediate and complex needs. Friends and
kinship carers often lack parental responsibility when children first
arrive because it takes time to arrange a legal order.
Adjustment leave would meet kinship carers’ urgent need for time
to adjust to the upheaval in the children’s lives, apply for a
legal order, a residence or special guardianship order to secure the
care of the child and attend numerous meetings, and would reduce the
prospect of the carer being pushed out of their job as a consequence.

legal orders, kinship carers may not fulfil the prescribed

a society, we face an emerging care gap in informal care, which arises
because of the cost of care, the lack of affordable childcare, more
older women working, an increasing dependency ratio and people living
longer. An increase in the number of elderly people,
government policies and socioeconomic influences, driving an increase
in older people’s and mothers’ participation in the

a resulting childcare gap, which could adversely affect maternal

but female employment has plateaued in recent years. The high costs of
formal childcare and lack of high-quality part-time work act as a
significant barrier to maternal and second-earner employment. Low- to

267 seeks the extension of emergency leave entitlement to grandparents,

would prefer a working grandparent to be able to take time off to

Lister of Burtersett:</Member></B> My Lords, I support Amendment 267B,
particularly from the perspective of carers for adults, although, of
course, I also support it with reference to carers for children. A
Carers UK/YouGov poll found that 22% of UK adults had seen their paid
work negatively affected as a result of caring, including 2.3 million
who had given up work as a result and about 3 million who had reduced
their working hours to care at some point in their

that the point at which caring begins to have a significant impact on
carers’ ability to work is when 20 hours a week or more is
provided, with some analysis indicating that the tipping point may be
even lower at 10 hours. Without the right support, millions of workers
are leaving work to care and the cost of this to individuals, business
and the economy is huge. Recently, research by the Personal Social
Services Research Unit at the LSE calculated the public expenditure
costs of carers leaving paid work at a staggering £1.3 billion a
year, based on the cost of carer’s allowance and lost tax
revenues. Additional analysis by Age UK indicates that the economic
cost rises to £5.3 billion when lost earnings are taken into
account. One quarter of working carers report that they feel they
receive inadequate support to enable them to combine work and care and
only half think that their employer is carer-friendly. The survey of
carers found that nearly two-thirds of carers in work have used annual

this seems to have all the hallmarks of an irresistible force that is
moving forwards. These are pressing and important areas of activity in
our social arrangements. They are suffering badly because they have not

shall address each of these amendments in turn, beginning with
Amendment 267BA. This amendment would require the Secretary of State to
review the provision for kinship carers and special guardians, as moved
a moment ago by the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson. As I have said in, as
he put it, a carefully worded, but, I hope, clear response to the
previous amendment, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
will undertake research into kinship and friendship carers and special
guardians and their participation in the labour market in order to

address these people’s
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0002.htm#1311213000190">The

now to Amendments 267A and 267B regarding adjustment leave for kinship
carers and leave for carers, as I am sure noble Lords will agree,
carers play a vital role supporting and caring for their children or
loved ones, and they reduce the need for state funded care. These
points were made with great passion today by a number of noble Lords.
These individuals can often struggle to balance their work and caring
responsibilities effectively and without support may not be able to
stay in work. It is important that we recognise this contribution and
provide carers with the support that they need to remain in the
workplace. From time to time, carers may need time off to manage
emergencies or breakdowns in care. Many kinship and friendship carers
also experience a period of adjustment when a child comes to live with
them. The noble 
<?notus-xml column=461?>Baroness, Lady Massey, gave the Committee a rather heartbreaking example
of an occasion when a parent died of a drug overdose. If I read her
correctly, the child appeared on someone’s doorstep.</hs_para>

circumstances can happen suddenly and families may come under great
strain to adjust quickly to the caring needs of a child who may be
facing many complex issues and emotions. The right to time off for
dependants enables them to take time off to make arrangements for their
care. Once the child is living with kinship or friendship carers, he or
she becomes their dependant, and any carer who is an employee will be
entitled to time off. This enables the carer to take a reasonable
period of time off work to take the action necessary to deal with
specified short-term emergencies, and this is a day one right that is
available to all employees. The employee does not necessarily need to
give their employer advance notice of their intention to take leave
under this provision as long as they inform their employer as soon as
is reasonably practicable. This is because emergencies rarely come with
notice, and again examples were given earlier in this debate.</hs_para>

may not meet the needs of all individuals in all circumstances. Many
employers provide additional forms of leave for compassionate reasons
to enable employees to deal with sudden and often traumatic changes in
circumstances. Caring is often a long-term responsibility. All carers,
including kinship and friendship carers, may need to consider long-term
changes to do with their changed circumstances. The Government believe
that the right support for carers is to allow them to change how they
work to better accommodate their caring role on a long-term
basis.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311213000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0002.htm#1311213000194">Carers

the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, has been working
closely with the Department for Work and Pensions and their private
sector working group to encourage more employers to consider flexible
working practices when they are designing and advertising jobs. They
have developed, for example, a strapline to use when advertising jobs:
“Happy to talk flexible working”. This should increase

time off for dependants was debated during the passage of this Bill in
the other place. The Minister for Employment Relations and Consumer
Affairs outlined the qualification criteria for this type of time off,
and for the benefit of noble Lords I shall do so again here, albeit
fairly briefly. This provision is intended to give employees a
statutory entitlement to time off work to deal with an emergency
involving a dependant. The qualification criteria for this type of time
off are deliberately broad, and this is to ensure that any employee on
whom a person reasonably relies to make arrangements for the provision
of care is able to qualify for this type of time off in circumstances
where there has been an unexpected disruption or termination of care
arrangements. It is important to emphasise that the legislation enables
all employee grandparents who are relied on to make arrangements for
the provision of care for their grandchildren to qualify for this time
off in such circumstances.</hs_para>

and employees must be able to understand the law in order to apply it
in the real world. Guidance plays an extremely important role in
ensuring that individuals who are legally entitled to this time off are
able to take it. When this issue was debated in the other place, it
became evident that the guidance on the Gov website was limiting the
amount of time off that employers were enabling employees to take. The
guidance stated that in most cases “two to three days”
should be sufficient to deal with an emergency involving a dependant.
In fact, the legal entitlement is to a “reasonable”
amount of time off. The definition of “reasonable” will
depend on individual circumstances, and in some cases a longer period
of time off may be appropriate. I reassure the noble Baroness, Lady
Drake, that for this reason the Government have amended that guidance
to reflect the statutory entitlement to “reasonable” time
off. In addition, the “Your Rights” section has also been
amended to include “grandchild” in the example list of
potential dependants. That change makes it clear to employers that
grandparents may qualify for this entitlement.</hs_para>

Lords may wish to amend the law in order to clarify the rights of
grandparents. However, it is important to remember that the crucial
factor that gives rise to this entitlement is the nature of the
relationship between the employee and the dependant. It is right that

care are entitled to 
<?notus-xml column=463?>time off to deal with the unexpected disruption of care arrangements for
a dependant, whatever their familial relationship to that individual.

Drake:</Member></B> I thank noble Lords who have spoken in this debate.
I thank the Minister for his response, and I shall respond to some of
his points. Obviously, it is welcome that the Government are looking at
the issue of kinship carers and employment but, like my noble friend
Lady Massey, I have to ask how long that will take. The issue is now
pressing and urgent, and it is not a new one; the question of the lack
of protection for this group of people was well aired during the
Welfare Reform Bill.</hs_para>

says about scoping the project, but a lot of work was done by the noble
Lord, Lord Freud, and the DWP team to identify this community and the
challenges that it faces. Hopefully, that is banked and does not have
to be repeated. The issue here is that, at the moment, maybe with
the exception of getting a bit of emergency leave, the
statutory provisions in this country do not protect individuals by
giving them a statutory right to leave and an ability to keep their
employment contract in place. It is welcome that the Government are
going to return with a likely timetable before Report.</hs_para>

are familiar with the emergency leave provisions, but those do not
address the kind of fundamental challenges that kinship carers face
when they take on a child at very short notice, with all the complexity
and problems that go with that, and subsequently become confirmed as
the permanent long-term carer of that child. It is a little drop of a
contribution and does not really start to tackle the fundamental
challenges that many of them face. It still does not address the
glaring imbalance between the support provided to prospective adopters,
parents and surrogate parents when it comes to statutory protections.
They are the Cinderellas and, consequently, so are the children they

working proposals are clearly welcome. They are very important in
allowing carers to balance their relationship with whoever they are
caring for and to stay in work on an ongoing basis, but they do not of
themselves provide the statutory right to leave, which is the essential
issue for many people when they are either facing a pressing caring
need or taking on a child in urgent circumstances. The flexible working
arrangements do not necessarily address the immediate problem of the
requirement for leave while allowing the employment contract to stay in
place.</hs_para>

Viscount says about grandparents. I have read the statutory provisions

phrase “reasonably relies” will have to be defined by
case law. Therefore, there is a hurdle that grandparents have to first
meet before they can say, “I will be the one that goes and helps
the child. I am a person who that child reasonably relies upon for care
in an emergency situation”. If the Government want grandparents
to be supported and enabled to take emergency leave to provide that
support for families, I struggle to see why one does not simply deal
with it straightaway by a simple, modest little provision that would
remove any ambiguity on that

Knight of Weymouth (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 267D, which

leave. The amendment seeks to give the Secretary of State a

come as a surprise to many that there is no statutory entitlement to
such bereavement leave, but that is the reality. The other elements of
the proposed new clause are there for your Lordships to read. The
current legal position, for those who do not know it, is that at
present parents may be entitled to time off for dependants—there
is a legal right to unpaid leave to cope with family emergencies, to
which some reference has been made. There is no upper limit to the
amount of time specified. It should be “reasonable” and
should be only the amount that is sufficient to deal with the
situation. The government guidance
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1311213000382" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0002.htm#1311213000382">“There

the bereavement of a child is a problem that would need more than one
or two days. Everyone’s grief is different, so quantifying this
is slightly challenging, but I contend that we need to give everyone
some certainty that they are entitled to a minimum amount of leave on a
paid basis. In my mind, that is two weeks, which I will talk about in a
moment.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="1311213000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0002.htm#1311213000210">Having
said all that, I also want to pay tribute to Lucy Herd, who I first met
two and a half years ago when recording an edition of “The
Politics Show” in the BBC’s Southampton
studio—occasionally, appearing on these shows does some good.
Lucy, who I talked about in my contribution at Second Reading, suffered
the loss of her child, Jack, in an accident in the garden. He drowned
in their garden pond. Her husband, who at the time was in Australia,
was given the opportunity to fly back. Obviously it takes a while to
fly from Australia to Cumbria, but he was not able to stay around for
very long because his employer needed him back at work within a week.
As a result of that experience, Lucy started campaigning, supported by
the Lullaby Trust, Bliss, Cruse, Child Bereavement UK, the Childhood
Bereavement Network and others. She has discovered that hers is not an
isolated example of people suffering from unsympathetic employers. I
think the vast majority of employers are reasonable, but clearly there
are examples where some are not. I am grateful to the Minister for
meeting Lucy last month to discuss this, and to my noble friend Lord
Stevenson for accompanying her. Unfortunately, because of my caring
responsibilities—I listened to the debate on the previous
amendment with care—I was not able to attend.</hs_para>

of her campaign, Lucy put up a petition on the Change.org site. I

maternity leave can be used, so that this is not such an issue. Bliss
has said to me that there are emotional reasons why parents might feel
more comfortable taking bereavement leave rather than maternity or
paternity leave, because it is a focused recognition of their loss.
Removed from the emotional associations of parental leave without a
child, they can feel more able to take the leave that they need.
Ensuring that they are entitled to bereavement leave would also help
them, when dealing with employers and other outside agencies, to be
clear about their situation and ensure that they get the appropriate
support. Although Bliss has sent me some bad examples, it has also sent
me some very good examples of how employers can work sympathetically

size—1,508—and the results are clear: when asked whether
there should be a national guaranteed minimum entitlement to
bereavement leave for a close family member, 70.8% agreed. Although I
do not for a second want this to be party political, for those who are
interested in the politics of it, 74.5% more women than men agreed and
75.2% of people who voted Conservative at the most recent election
agreed, so there may be some electoral and political 
<?notus-xml column=467?>reasons to agree to this. Another question that the survey asked was
whether it was unfair that bereavement leave for close family members
was unpaid, and of course 62.9% agreed with that too. I contend that

simplify costings, they assumed that all were full-time employees,
although of course the reality is that full-time employees are only 63%
of all people in employment, and that the median gross weekly earnings
for full-time employees in Great Britain were £508 as of
April 2012. So they would say that the cost to the Exchequer
for one week’s bereavement pay would be £3 million to
£3.2 million, as a generous estimate. I think that that is a
reasonable cost to pay to give the people I have talked about, such as
Lucy, Ian and Karen, the certainty that they will be given a bit of

breakdown. I know that across your Lordships’ House we are

complete lottery for a grieving parent, probably in deep shock, in

a slightly different example from the one given just now by the noble
Lord, Lord Knight, and focus on an extended illness of a child. Jane, a
junior manager whom I know, had a three year-old with leukaemia. The
charity she worked for believed itself to be a caring and reasonable
organisation, but the head of the charity objected to allowing further
compassionate leave as the child was dying or when the child died, nor
did they want to give leave to prepare for the funeral. They said that
the parent should take unpaid leave, having used up her annual leave to

eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Knight of Weymouth, at Second

majority of employers respond to such an event with compassion and
understanding, offering their employees the support that they need to
take time off and to begin to deal with the consequences of
the tragic event. I am pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Knight,
recognises this. However, I accept that this is not the case for all
parents. Even if such refusals of time off are very rare, they are
naturally extremely upsetting for the individuals involved. I emphasise
that an employer who does not enable a parent to take time off in order
to take action that is necessary in consequence of the death of a child
is acting unlawfully. The law is clear that the entitlement to
emergency time off for dependants enables parents to take time off to
take necessary action following the death of a child. The noble Lord,
Lord Knight, raised the issue of the guidance on time off for
dependants, which states that one or two days is sufficient. I reassure
him that, as I mentioned in my response to the previous debate,
we have recently amended the guidance to make it clear that
the entitlement is to a reasonable amount of time

a child dies, many processes need to be completed. These would be
complicated and distressing at the best of times. I am sure that when a
parent is trying to deal with shock and grief following the death of
their child, this can be extremely challenging. It is right that
parents are able to take time off to deal with these arrangements, and
the law clearly provides for that. There is, however, no legal
entitlement to statutory time off to grieve. Grief is an extremely
personal issue and affects people in very different ways and at
different times. For some people, returning to work immediately after a
death is a distraction from difficulties at home. Others may need time
off at a later date. Parents are best placed to understand their
individual needs, and good employers will respond to requests made by
their employees in the most appropriate and sensitive way. It would not

267E and also Amendment 268A, I can be brief because the ground we have
covered today has been leading up to a number of the points that I
would have made if I had had more time and needed to break new ground.
The essence of much of what we have heard from the Minister is that the
spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. Often, as I anticipated in my
opening remarks, he accepts the arguments for the direction in which we
want to travel but he does not feel that the economic circumstances or
alternatively the particularities of the individual point are
absolutely in tune with the willingness of the Government to move on
the point. I am not sure that metaphor will read well in <I>Hansard</I>
but you will understand where I am trying to get to. This amendment
therefore provides an opportunity for the Government to sign on to what
we hope would be a narrowly focused and specific review, not general
but tied to the various pinch points that we have encountered in our
journey through these amendments
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:50:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0002.htm#1311213000236">For
example on the question of paternity pay, could we have a review that
picked up the particularity of the point that was made in another
place? The Minister’s counterpart in the other place said that
the although the powers to allow the extension to paid paternity leave
would be in the Bill, there would be a delay in making the extension
until flexible parental leave had been fully embedded and we could
assess the impact on shared parenting. Okay, let the review assess both
whether parental leave has been fully embedded and the impact on shared
parenting, tying it in to that arrangement. The question would follow
naturally for the review as to whether the objective of encouraging
more fathers to take leave had worked, and whether the amount of paid
leave available to fathers in their own right was suitable in the light
of the
objective<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-20T19:49:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000237" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0002.htm#1311213000237">The

for working parents who do not meet the qualifying criteria to receive

point—to ensure that it interacts appropriately with the new
universal credit system. As we all know, the new universal credit
system is not moving along at 
<?notus-xml column=472?>quite the pace that its originators would perhaps wish, so that may
impact on the timing of the review, but I hope that it will not. Again,

are a number of particularities within the debate that we have had

make this legislation better, and it would be greatly informed if we

different. It is to try to inculcate a change in culture—we have
talked about culture a lot in today’s discussions. This is about
the move from a labour market scene that is largely dominated by fixed
hours and fixed-time contracts to one that would be based on the
starting assumption that all employment contracts, in time, could be
flexible. If that were to be the case, we would have a situation where
a number of the issues that we have raised again in discussing
today’s amendments would fall away because the flexibility that
would be innate in any job would allow for care concerns, problems
around bereavement, issues around changes such as the onset of
disability, or the tragedies that happen in families. All those things
would be easier to deal with if the basic paradigm for employment were
flexibility.</hs_para>

is something where we have a shared purpose that this would be a good
thing—indeed, there are many examples I could give of employers

norm, which would allow a number of good things to flow from that. The
question is: how would we do that? Could we have a campaign? Could the
Government put all posts within government services on a flexible
basis? Could they set themselves as a standard bearer for this new
approach? The amendment seeks to probe whether there is willingness
within the operations of government, and more broadly within the
workplace, to get on this bandwagon of moving towards flexible working,

certainly not within one year. Culture change is best measured through
survey data on how employee behaviour and attitudes are changing. For
this reason it is right that any review of flexible working promotion

Lordships will know that the Care Bill enshrines in legislation many
more rights for carers than hitherto. Adult carers featured strongly in
the Care Bill and thanks to the Government being willing to listen and
amend the Bill—and to what we might call a pincer movement
between the Care Bill and the Children and Families Bill—young
carers have similarly been well recognised. However, in spite of much
effort—much of it focused in this Bill by many noble Lords and
noble Baronesses present today—the rights of parent carers
remain weaker than those of other

moved a similar amendment to the Care Bill, the Minister was kind
enough to say that he recognised my concerns and would consider them.
The outcome of those considerations was that the proposal would sit
better in this Bill and it is for that reason I am moving it today.
Briefly, as I know that many noble Lords are familiar with the issues,
the purpose is to strengthen the rights of those who care for a

having their needs assessed as part of their child’s assessment
under the Children Act 1989. The existing rights for parents to have
their needs assessed separately were introduced in three Private
Members’ Bills, with which I was involved and which will be
familiar to many of your Lordships. The three Acts were taken through
Parliament with cross-party support, in recognition of the huge

of a carer’s assessment is to look at the impact of
the caring on the parent and on their ability to provide care for the
child. It is not about putting the needs of the parent before those of
the child but about ensuring that, where parents have support needs
relating to their caring role for a disabled child, those needs are
assessed and met. It has been recognised by successive Governments and
by all sides of the House that parents caring for
disabled children have different needs from other parents. They have
different responsibilities and different barriers to accessing
employment, for example. Your Lordships will be familiar with the fact
that it is three times more costly to bring up a disabled
child than a non-disabled child and that parent carers are more likely
to be reliant on income-based state support, more likely to
suffer relationship breakdown and divorce, and three or more times more
likely to suffer ill health and health breakdown than
parents of non-disabled children. A striking statistic has
come into my hands today from the <I>State of Caring</I> survey,
carried out by Carers UK, which surveys 350,000 carers. It found that a
third, or 32%, of all full-time carers go without any practical
support, rising to almost a half—47%—of carers who are
caring for a disabled child aged

understand that Carers UK is meeting officials from the
Minister’s department shortly and that the Minister has agreed
to a meeting with Paul Burstow, from another place, who is also
concerned with this issue. I must emphasise that the most common reason
for parents being turned down for an assessment is that
children’s services are seen as being responsible for assessing
the children’s needs and not those of the parent. The current
law is not well understood nor is the limited existing legal right to a
separate parent assessment well understood by social care
practitioners. If changes are not made to bring these rights into this
Bill, it will become more difficult for those working with disabled
children to understand and use the law. Not only will parent carers not
have their rights enhanced but they will find it harder than ever to
use the existing legal
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000257" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0002.htm#1311213000257">I

Minister will not only agree to the meetings that I have mentioned but
will also act on the recommendation of the Law Commission that existing
duties to assess parent carers should be amended to make them
consistent with the adult social care statute. I would also like his
response on how the existing rights to a separate assessment for parent
carers are to 
<?notus-xml column=476?>be reflected in the regulations and guidance accompanying this Bill. If
nothing is done, the parents of disabled children under 18 will be left
with the lesser and inconsistent right to assessment and support that
will remain only in rump legislation. Front-line professionals will
have to navigate complex legislation in order to assess and provide
support to those caring for children. Parents of disabled children
under 18 who already have difficulty in accessing support will find it
even harder in the future. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment

There seems to be confusion over this. Both the Minister’s

Government’s response to the Joint Committee on Human Rights
referred only to the Children Act and not to the rights that exist in
the carers legislation. The point has been made that we run the risk of
burying this important entitlement under layers of law and a confusing
web of guidance. It almost seems as if it is so deeply buried that the
Government themselves are not totally aware of the nature of all these
rights. This is an opportunity to clarify and to bring it into the new
legislation so that it is not left behind in what my noble friend has
called “rump legislation”. This is a vital opportunity
that we really must not lose. I am glad that there is going to be a

one of that band of noble Lords who were involved at all stages of the

Bill and the Children and Families Bill. I salute Ministers for having
done that. I particularly pay tribute to Ministers for what they have
done on young carers. We now have a set of rights for young carers
which is so much stronger than before and that is a real landmark.
Through the Care Bill, we have got improved rights for adult carers to
assessment and support, and I applaud the Government for doing that. We
have got much improved rights for young carers through the Children and
Families Bill, linking in nicely with the Care Bill, and again I
applaud the Government for doing that. We just have this one group
left: the parent carers, who generally care for disabled children. If
we could just get that missing bit of the jigsaw all sorted out so that
all carers had the same set of rights to assessment and support, I
think that it would be a tremendous step forward for carers in this
country. I am encouraged to hear that meetings are still taking place

Hollins (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, parents of disabled children often
do not see themselves as carers, but they are. Their need for support
has been argued and won over the past 20 years. They really are
different from other parents. Their right to be able to have a life
alongside caring for their disabled child has been fought for very
successfully. Parent carers are often so focused on the needs of their
child that they forget about their own health and well-being. It could
be argued that failing to recognise the needs of the parent carer is
against their right to a family life under the Human Rights Act. I was
involved with a WHO/Europe declaration, <I>Better Health, Better
Lives</I>, which was about the health and well-being of children and
young people with intellectual disabilities across Europe
and their families. It was signed by all the
Health Ministers, including our own, in 2012. One of the 10
recommendations was about identifying the needs for support of parent
carers. I join my voice to that of the noble Baroness in this
amendment. What is the Government’s rationale for allowing that
the carers of a disabled 13 year-old would effectively have rights
inferior to those of the carers of an 18 year-old? I hope that the
Minister will be able to respond.</hs_para>

right in saying that 
<?notus-xml column=478?>the framework is there in the present legislation or, at least, it
should be there. The difficulty is that, because the focus among those
who make assessments is split between adults and children and we do not
have holistic family assessments, often the parents are lost. A family
whom I met recently had just, after many years, been given a period of
respite care, but the parent carers had not realised that that would
make the difference in their being able to continue to care for their
son, an extremely difficult young man. A series of workers had never
suggested to them that their needs might be met in order to meet the
needs of their child. That is the important message that front-line
workers need to understand. This amendment would help them to
understand that, unless you meet the needs of parents, you do not meet
the needs of children.</hs_para>

when I heard that it had been commented that to assess parents would
undermine the rights of children. Assessing parents enhances the rights

work with and meet families see it regularly. We also see when people
fail to notice that parent carers are beginning to fail, simply because
of their exhaustion and the fact that they have had no relief and no
assessment for any kind of services, sometimes quite small ones that
would make all the difference to their being able to
continue.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311213000266" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0002.htm#1311213000266">I
support this because we should have a family approach whereby children
with disabilities will be maintained in their own homes rather than
having to go into caring facilities because their parents are unable to
look after them. I am losing my power of speech, like most of us at

the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler, made a passionate speech about

there is a strong framework of support in place to support parent

parents, and as adults caring for children, parent carers are in a very
different position from adults caring for adults or young carers. We
should be wary of simply replicating arrangements that are in place for
those other carers without understanding the interrelationship with
other legislation and the potential for unintended consequences. Unlike
for young carers, where we have responded to specific concerns and
substantial evidence, there is a lack of evidence for the need to
change the type of support or the way in which it is provided for
parent carers of disabled children. That is not to say that everything
is perfect,

that any change to the Children Act 1989 to assess the needs

Williams have shown starkly what can happen when the needs of parents
are put ahead of those of the child. Our approach to legislation and
statutory guidance is that the needs of the individual child are
paramount. That support for parents is important to improve outcomes
for the child. The Government have invested significantly in support
for parent carers of disabled children. That includes committing over
£800 million for local authorities to invest in short breaks for
disabled children between April 2011 and March 2015 through

Pitkeathley:</Member></B> My Lords, I had hoped that we were making a
bit of progress, but I am having a kind of throwback moment. When many
of us first started getting the issue of carers on to the social policy
agenda—many noble Lords here will remember that—I used to
be told, “Oh, you can’t think of the needs of carers. The
needs of the disabled person or the older person have to be paramount
and you’ve got to think of those first. If you look at the
rights of carers, you’re going to undermine those roots”.
I am hearing the same argument tonight and I find it extremely
disappointing. However, we made progress on the other matter: everybody
now understands that you can look at the rights of the disabled or
older person and the rights of carers and not undermine either of
them—the two are inextricably entwined. Therefore, I continue to
hope that we will still be able to make progress. We have fundamentally
failed to get Ministers and their officials to understand that there is
a difference between being the parent of a disabled child and being a
parent. There is a fundamental difference and it needs to be looked at.
Having had the support of so many of my noble colleagues tonight, I
feel that I have a window to come back to this on Report. However, in
the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="1311213000546" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0002.htm#1311213000546">Amendment

As the noble Baroness said, we are all losing our marbles, if not our
words. Trying to get through the Bill at this late hour when there are
still two very substantial amendments to go is not what was agreed
through the usual channels and certainly was not the basis on which we
came into this discussion. I continue, but I do so with the feeling
that this is not in the spirit of the best use of our time, and your
Lordships’ House will be the worse for having to debate late
into the night issues that should have seen the fresh light of
day—perhaps next Monday, when of course there will be
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311213000278" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0002.htm#1311213000278">Clause
104 was in my mind when I started the debate earlier—it seems a
long time ago now but was in fact earlier this afternoon—by
saying that while the Opposition were broadly happy with the measures
contained in Parts 6, 7 and 8 of the Bill, there were one or two bits
of grit, and this is one of them. Amendments 267L and 267M
and the clause stand part Motion are grouped together in one place so
that we can have a debate about them. While they all bear on the same
area, they obviously have different impacts. My preference would be for
the clause to stand part because I believe that what the Government are
trying to do here is antipathetic to the very spirit of British law,
which has always recognised the need for a person with a legal case to
have the chance to make that case in a court of first instance but,
where there have been problems or difficulties with that, the person
would then have the right of appeal against decisions taken in the
first instance. However, the Bill as it is drafted removes the process
by which an employer must respond to an employee’s flexible
working request and replaces it 
<?notus-xml column=481?>with a requirement to respond in a reasonable manner and within a
timeframe of three months. We had a debate earlier about the word
“reasonable”, and on that occasion the
Minister felt unable to accept that word because he felt it was not
appropriate for the context in which we were discussing it, although it
has come back several times since and he has been quite happy with it.
We have a situation here where reasonableness, which in the earlier
amendments was a burden on employers, is now okay for employers to
use.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311213000279" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0002.htm#1311213000279">The

history to this is interesting. ACAS consulted on a draft code of
practice for the extended right to request flexible working, and
employer bodies such as the CBI, the FSB, recruiters, the TUC, EHRC,
Opportunity Now and Working Families acted as advisers on the draft
code. The group agreed, and the draft code recognised, that an appeal
is important. The draft code
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1311213000400" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-gc0002.htm#1311213000400">“If

would recognise its antecedents in criminal law and civil law where
clearly those who have cases—as I have said—can make them

and reconsidered. We believe it is important that the Bill and the code
are consistent to provide clarity to employers and certainty to
employees that appeals are to be allowed. The amendment would make it
clear on the face of the Bill that appeals remain an important part of
the process of considering flexible working

Committee in the Commons, the Government argued that the amendment
would mean that an employee always had a right of appeal, and that this

it was an absolute right of appeal, that might be the case, but appeals
are usually constrained by matters of fact or law and one would expect
that normal processes would be applied. We argue that a very small
organisation would be able to deal swiftly with an appeal, but allowing
an appeal is important for procedural fairness and may reduce the use
of grievance procedures instead. Sometimes employers do not give a
statutory business reason for refusing a request, and that could give
rise to an appeal. In addition, once the employee understands the
employer’s business reasons for refusing a request to work
flexibly, they may be more able to negotiate a solution, so it is a

replace it with a duty on employers to consider applications in a
reasonable manner. Many employers like the structure and confidence
that the current procedure gives them when considering applications.
Those employers will be able to continue to use this procedure even

to a draft Agreement between Canada and the European Union to allow the

Competent Authority. PNR is a record of each passenger’s travel

reservations to be processed and controlled by air carriers.</hs_para>

first-hand the benefits of PNR through its own border systems programme
(formally e-Borders), which has already been used to arrest suspects
wanted for serious offences such as murder, rape and kidnap. For this
reason, the Government remains committed to the use of PNR as a way of
tackling serious crime and terrorism but not at the expense of data

that Canada shall ensure that its competent authority processes PNR
“strictly? for the prevention, detection, investigation and
prosecution of terrorism and other serious crime that is transnational
in nature. Such processing constitutes a legitimate objective for the
purposes of Article 52 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the
European Union. PNR data has a clear value in combating these types of
crime, which goes to the necessity of the measure to protect the
public.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112099000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131120-wms0001.htm#13112099000014">The

PNR data rests. They are required by Canada to provide such data
