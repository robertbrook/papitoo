reviews the need to get that analysis right so that in the future we
see fewer of the problems of the past resurfacing. The Secretary of
State will be making a speech later this week on precisely this issue

pay tribute to the hon. Lady for her work in bringing teachers together
in Birmingham to introduce the Birmingham baccalaureate, which is a
perfect preparation both for the world of work and for further and
higher education. One problem in Birmingham for many years has been a
culture of underperformance in far too many schools, and that has been
insufficiently challenged by the local authority. It should not have to
fall to her to do the job that the council should have been doing, but

highest-performing school in Bradford is, I believe, an academy. New
free schools that have arrived in Bradford have, until recently, been
welcomed on by hon. Members on both sides of the House. Increased
choice for parents and an increased range of schools has helped to
drive up standards across the UK. It is striking that schools in
England have consistently improved over the past few years in a way
that schools in Wales have not. That is because we have not only
parental choice, free schools and academies, but a rigorous
inspectorate and league tables, which enable us to identify good
practice and spread it more

is in one of the weakest areas of school improvement of any local
authority. In consultation with the EFA, we will ensure that every

them in context. Of the first 24 free schools to be inspected,
75% were good or better, whereas in the first tranche of new local
authority schools set up in the same period, only half reached that
quality threshold. It is also important to recognise that the local
authority in Derby has a poor record of helping to challenge
underperforming schools, and that outside providers such as Barry Day
of Greenwood Dale have done far more to improve education in Derby than
the local authority has ever
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:29:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

him to rely on the evidence that he had given to the Select Committee,

action, that will severely damage the ability of Select Committees to

including Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif. He is a tough but
constructive negotiator, who displayed a sincere and open approach
throughout the talks. He and I took the opportunity to discuss further
the bilateral relationship between Britain and Iran, and today both our
Governments have formally appointed our new chargé d'affaires. I
expect the new UK chargé to make his first visit to Iran this
month.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000203">The
Government are firmly in favour of reaching an interim agreement with
Iran, as an essential step towards a comprehensive settlement. But
given the extensive nature of Iran’s programme and the history
of its concealment, the detailed terms of any agreement matter greatly.
An agreement has to be clear and detailed, cover all aspects of
Iran’s programme, and give assurance to the whole world that the
threat of nuclear proliferation in Iran is fully addressed. Such a deal
is on the table, and there is no doubt in my mind that it can be
reached. I am convinced that the agreement we were discussing would be
good for the security of the entire world, and we will pursue it with
energy and
persistence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:40:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000204">An
interim agreement would involve offering Iran limited, proportionate
sanctions relief. In the meantime, however, we will be vigilant and
firm in upholding the international sanctions which have played an
indispensable part in creating this new opening with Iran. Sanctions
are costing the Iranian economy at least $4 billion a month and this
cost will be maintained until we reach 
<?notus-xml column=643?>an agreement. Until such a moment, there is no question of us relaxing
the pressure of sanctions in any
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:40:40"></hs_TimeCode>. We are
determined to take every opportunity to reach a diplomatic settlement
to the Iranian nuclear crisis, because the alternatives—nuclear
proliferation or conflict—could be disastrous for the peace and
security of the world, including the stability of the middle
east<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:41:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000205">That
stability is being severely undermined by the deepening crisis in
Syria. Our objectives there remain to reach a political settlement to
the conflict, thereby also protecting UK national security, to
alleviate the desperate humanitarian suffering, and to prevent the
further use of chemical weapons. On 22 October I hosted a meeting of
the Foreign Ministers of the 11 countries of the core group of the
Friends of Syria, as well as the president and senior leadership of the
Syrian National Coalition. We gave our united support to the UN-led
Geneva II process, which should establish a transitional
governing body with full Executive powers, formed by mutual consent.
There was unanimous agreement that Assad and his close associates can
play no role in a body formed by mutual consent. We also agreed to
provide the National Coalition with additional political and practical
support to give the Geneva conference the best chance of success, and
urged the Coalition to commit itself to taking part in it. It has now
done that, which I strongly welcome.
Last<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:42:05"></hs_TimeCode> night, its
members agreed by consensus at a general assembly to attend the
Geneva II talks, on the basis that this meant that Assad and
those with blood on their hands would have no role in a transition.
They also rightly called for humanitarian access and the release of
detainees ahead of Geneva II. We continue to push for a date
for a peace conference to be agreed, and UN and Arab League envoy
Lakhdar Brahimi has reiterated that he is still trying to convene a
conference before the end of the
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:42:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000206">In
the light of this decision by the Coalition, we will provide practical
and political support to help it prepare to lead the opposition
delegation. I will shortly lay before Parliament a proposal to increase
our non-lethal support to the supreme military council of General
Idris. This life-saving equipment will take the form of communications,
medical and logistics equipment. There can be no peaceful settlement to
the conflict in Syria without a strong role for the legitimate,
moderate opposition. I also welcome the vote last night by the National
Coalition to confirm the inclusion of the Kurdish National Council in
its ranks, which adds further to its broad representation of Syrian
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:43:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000207">We
are also particularly determined to ensure that the peace talks include
a direct role for women’s groups, in accordance with Security
Council decisions on women, peace and security. It is vital that women
participate fully in the future Government and institutions of Syria,
as they have an indispensable role to play in rebuilding and
reconciling Syrian society. We are ready to work with Mr Brahimi, his
team, international NGOs and other countries to make this a reality.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:43:46"></hs_TimeCode> will also
work with the UN and its agencies to ensure that we give the
women’s groups the support they need to participate effectively.
In addition, we are encouraging the Syrian National Coalition to
include women members in its

far we have committed over £20 million to support opposition

humanitarian situation in Syria is one
of unimaginable distress and suffering. Well
over 100,000 people have died, and 11.5 million
people—more than half of Syria’s population—are
now in desperate need of assistance, either inside the country or as
refugees in the region. The UN estimates that 2.5 million people are
trapped in areas in Syria that aid is not reaching, including
an estimated half a million men, women and children living under siege
conditions. Severe acute malnutrition is emerging among children, and
polio has reappeared, 14 years after the country was certified

human rights violations are being committed, including the use of
incendiary bombs against civilians, torture, rape, massacres and
summary executions, and attacks on hospitals, schools and aid convoys.
The regime has shown that it can facilitate access to chemical weapons
inspectors when it wishes, and it could do so for humanitarian relief
if it showed a shred of humanity and wished to do so. We need to
address this crisis to save lives, and also to improve the prospects
for the Geneva talks. On 2 October, we helped to secure a UN Security
Council presidential statement which said that humanitarian aid must be
able to reach all Syrians. That statement is clearly not being
implemented. I spoke last week to Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov
urging his Government to try to persuade the regime to stop blocking
the delivery of aid, and we would like to see stronger action in the UN
Security Council, including a resolution, if
necessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000211">In
the Security Council, and through all other avenues available to us, we
will press for: full humanitarian access and freedom of movement for
trapped civilians; the evacuation of civilians from besieged areas;
safe passage for medical personnel and convoys; the creation of hubs
for the delivery of aid; cross-border assistance; and the lifting of
bureaucratic burdens imposed by the regime. We will also work with the
Coalition to improve access to aid in areas under its control. The UK
is contributing £500 million to relief efforts, much of it to
assist neighbouring countries, and the international community has
provided $3 billion in funding for this year. But the fact that the
existing UN appeal for this year is still nearly $2 billion short
underlines just how extreme the humanitarian crisis is, and we call on
all countries to do
more.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000212">The
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has confirmed that
the destruction of Syria’s declared chemical weapons production,
mixing and filling equipment is now complete. But some warheads and all

but it is vital that diplomacy succeeds, and we will persist undeterred

support the middle east peace process, which remains central to
international peace and security. We do not underestimate the
challenges, but firmly believe that if Prime Minister 
<?notus-xml column=645?>Netanyahu and President Abbas show further bold leadership, a negotiated
two-state solution is possible. We are working with European partners

May I thank the Foreign Secretary for his statement and for advance

generously to the efforts of Baroness Ashton, who played a crucial role
in driving forward these latest talks, and pay tribute to the clear
commitment shown by all the P5 plus 1 Ministers in attendance at

remains of the view that a nuclear-armed Iran poses a real threat, not
just to Israel, but to regional and international security. Therefore,
we believe that the United Kingdom Government should continue to pursue
the twin-track approach of sanctions and diplomacy. President Rouhani
campaigned, and was subsequently elected in June, on a platform of
taking the necessary steps to ease the pressure of the sanctions that
are currently putting the Iranian economy under strain. So I do believe
that sanctions have been effective and continue to be important.
However, alongside continued sanctions sustained diplomatic engagement
remains key, so I welcome the news of the Government’s
announcement that a chargé d’affaires has now been
appointed and hope that the British embassy in Tehran will be reopened
as soon as it is safe and practical to do so.</hs_Para>

the light of the somewhat conflicting reports, will the Foreign

such a deal is on the table and that there is no doubt that it can be

deal begins to emerge it will increasingly be called into question by
those parties that have so much at stake. In the light of that
reaction, will the Foreign Secretary set out what assurances have been
offered to regional partners, particularly Israel, who are 
<?notus-xml column=646?>concerned that the principle of an interim deal will, by definition, not
provide sufficient guarantees that Iran will cease all activity that
could contribute to it developing a nuclear weapons

me turn to the issue of Syria. The humanitarian situation in Syria
remains desperate and continues to deteriorate. Clearly, the most
effective way to ease the suffering in Syria is to end the war, but
while efforts to broker a peace deal continue it is vital that the
international community lives up to its responsibility to protect those
most in need. I welcome the important work that the UK Government have
been doing, but despite the UK’s contribution, the UN appeal is
still less than half-funded. Will the Foreign Secretary therefore set
out what steps the Government will be taking to try to help ensure that
other donors deliver on their unfulfilled pledges?</hs_Para>

the last time the Foreign Secretary addressed the House on the issue,
the OPCW has confirmed that Syria’s declared equipment for

destroyed. Syria now has until mid-2014 to destroy the remaining
stockpiles of chemical weapons. Given that the OPCW team confirmed that
it was not able to visit two of the 23 chemical weapons
sites in Syria, as they were simply too dangerous, will the Foreign
Secretary say what assurances are being sought for the protection of
OPCW personnel who are due to carry out further work in conflict zones
across the country?</hs_Para>

biggest breakthrough that is needed to most improve the situation on
the ground is a diplomatic initiative. As the Foreign Secretary stated,
women will have a key role to play in peace talks and in rebuilding and
reconciling Syrian society as the conflict concludes. It is welcome
that the SNC has today voted to accept the invitation to attend
Geneva II as the representative of the Syrian opposition,
but that acceptance is, as the Foreign Secretary has just told us,
conditional on Assad and those with blood on their hands having no role
in a transition and on the provision of humanitarian access and the
release of detainees ahead of the conference being convened. In the
light of those specific conditions, will the Foreign Secretary set out
his assessment of the likelihood of those conditions being met

Saturday had been amended in the light of comments from various of the
parties concerned, but it is entirely 
<?notus-xml column=647?>permissible for members of the E3 plus 3 to put forward their own
comments, amendments and positions. There are six sovereign nations
involved—as well as the Iranians, who will put forward their
positions, of course. A completely united position was put to the
Iranians at the close of our discussions, so reports of vetoes by one
country, or of obstruction by any country, should be seen in that

right hon. Gentleman asked what assurances we had given to other
countries, and referred to Israel’s concerns about the concept
of making an interim deal, rather than going straight to a
comprehensive final settlement. We have discussed that. During the
talks, I spoke to the Israeli Minister responsible for international
relations and security, Mr Yuval Steinitz, and this weekend, the Prime
Minister spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu, to give them our assurances

faced that attempts to go straight to a comprehensive final settlement
would be dramatically more difficult than even this process, and it is
quite evident from events over the weekend that this process is
difficult enough. An interim agreement would be designed to give us the
time and space to negotiate a comprehensive final agreement—time
during which Iran would take concrete actions in relation to its
nuclear programme, in order to give greater assurance and confidence to
the international community, and we would offer proportionate and
limited sanctions relief in return, but the pressure would still be
there to conclude a comprehensive final settlement. There are concerns
about this, but all of us in the E3 plus 3 countries believe that this
is the most effective and practical way to reach a settlement with
Iran.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000228">On
the question about humanitarian relief, the UK has been very active, as
the House knows, including through the meeting that the Prime Minister
convened at the G20 and all our diplomatic efforts around that, in
getting other nations to step up their humanitarian assistance. About
$1 billion of additional assistance has, one way or another, been
associated with the efforts that we have made. We will continue to make
those efforts, but that appeal is $2 billion underfunded for this year,
and of course we are in the middle of November and approaching the time
for another UN appeal. We will strongly support the donor conference
that has been called in Kuwait for the middle of January. My right hon.

chemical weapons inspectors have now, one way or another, inspected all
23 sites, but of course their security during the continuing work is
important. That has to be taken into account in the decision that the
OPCW executive council needs to adopt by 15 November —this
Friday. The decision is still under negotiation, but it is expected to
set out the detailed requirements, including intermediate milestones,
for the complete elimination of chemical weapons in Syria in the first

stipulations made by the National Coalition regarding their support for

obstacles to assembling a Geneva II peace conference. The
statement—it is a view that we share—that
Assad cannot be part of a 
<?notus-xml column=648?>transitional authority formed by mutual consent is not surprising. Any
authority formed by mutual consent in Syria is unlikely to include
those whom the other side regard as having very extensive blood on
their hands. The calls for humanitarian assistance and humanitarian
access, and for prisoners to be released, are calls that we should all
be able to support in any case, so I do not think that those things
should be seen as making a Geneva II conference more
difficult. We now need the regime to respond in the same
spirit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000231">Finally,
the right hon. Gentleman asked about the inclusion of Iran in the
talks. We believe that the starting point for a Geneva II
conference is the outcome of Geneva I last year, and that
all parties to the talks should be able to accept that. I continue to
urge Iran to adopt that position; it would make it much easier for the
rest of the world to embrace it in the

Menzies Campbell</B> (North East Fife) (LD):</Member> I welcome the
statement made by my right hon. Friend in respect of both these
difficult issues, but may I invite him to return to the question of
refugees? Is he aware that the refugee camp on the Jordanian side of
the border with Syria is now the fourth largest city in Jordan, and
that there are reports that within a few months medical services in
Jordan may simply collapse under the weight and impact of the refugee
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T15:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>? Does my
right hon. Friend understand that if irreparable damage is done to
Jordan, it is in no one’s interests, particularly not the United
Kingdom, because Jordan is a very important ally of ours in the middle
east? Will he give the House an assurance that the particular issue of
Jordan and other neighbouring countries is within the contemplation of
those with whom he is discussing
Syria?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000234"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Hague" PimsId="3707" UID="1311114000483" xid="245" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000483">Mr
Hague:</Member></B> Yes, absolutely. My right hon. and learned Friend
is quite right. Of the assistance that we have allocated so far,
£175 million has been allocated for the neighbouring countries,
and the largest single slice of that goes to Jordan. My right hon.
Friend the Minister for the middle east was there last week, and
visited some of the affected areas. My right hon. and learned Friend is
right that the refugee camp of which he speaks is now the fourth
largest city in Jordan and the second largest refugee camp anywhere in
the world. That is the scale of what we are dealing with. I discussed
the position with His Majesty the King of Jordan two weeks ago. We
regularly say to the Jordanians, “Is there anything else that we
can do to assist?”, and we will continue to provide additional
assistance as they need
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:01:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000235"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Peter Hain" PimsId="3711" UID="1311114000484" xid="246" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000484"><B>Mr
Peter Hain</B> (Neath) (Lab):</Member> Does the Foreign Secretary agree
that although his hard-headed but constructive response to the Iranian
negotiations is the right one, if they do not succeed and the Iranians
go back to Tehran without a deal, that will strengthen the
Ahmadinejad-type hawks in Iran, so every opportunity must be taken to
get that agreement while preserving the vital interests at stake? May I
also ask about the Syrian situation? I worry about an apparent veto in
advance as a precondition being struck by the opposition. Yes, they are
willing to take part, but they seem to have imposed a precondition on
that. Whatever the transition agreed—if there is one—I
find it inconceivable that there will not be some elements of the
existing regime in place, like it or not, in order to get an
agreement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:02:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Hague:</Member></B> On the latter point, let us remember that what is
envisaged in the communiqué of Geneva I is a
transitional authority formed from the opposition and the current
regime, but by mutual consent, so when the right hon. Gentleman refers
to elements of the regime in a transitional Government, yes, that is
accepted in the transitional Government, but the composition has to be
by mutual consent. As I was just saying to the shadow Foreign
Secretary, <hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:02:39"></hs_TimeCode>I do
not believe that the opposition, in setting out their view of that, are
setting preconditions or an unreasonable position ahead of Geneva. It

seemed very unlikely just a few short weeks ago, and we should not miss
the significance of what has happened. However, he will be aware that
the nuclear file is not the only issue with which the international
community has problems in relation to Iran. In his bilateral
conversations, did he get any inkling from the Iranians that they
understood the problems caused by their sponsorship of international
terrorism, their participation in Syria and their appalling human
rights record? Will this be addressed as a matter of urgency by our new

sort of constructive meeting that came even close to an interim
agreement at the weekend would have been hard to envisage a few months
ago. That represents an important diplomatic advance. It is not, of
course, good enough to have nearly got there; we have to really get
there, but it is a big change in the atmosphere. My right hon. Friend
is also right that we have many other difficulties with Iranian
policies. I referred to those in my opening meetings with Mr Zarif.
Certainly, our newly appointed non-resident chargé will be
approaching all these issues across the full range of our
relations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000240"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:05:00"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jack Straw" PimsId="4165" UID="1311114000488" xid="570" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000488"><B>Mr

the point made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:05:05"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Neath (Mr Hain), there is a danger, which I saw
myself some years ago, that negotiations quite close to a deal lose
momentum, and it is not only the hard-liners in Tehran who then get in
on that, but, bluntly, those in Israel and in Washington, of both
parties, and I think now in France, who start to undermine the pace and
substance of those negotiations. May I offer the right hon. Gentleman
full support, as my right hon. Friend has done, in resisting those
clarion calls, for example from some elements in Israel, and some in
Washington, 
<?notus-xml column=650?>which will have the effect of undermining the best chance that we have
had for decades to secure a proper deal with
Iran<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:05:59"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000242"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Hague" PimsId="3707" UID="1311114000489" xid="245" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000489">Mr
Hague:</Member></B> Yes, we will remain very much committed. The right
hon. Gentleman can hear from what I am saying that we are very
committed to maintaining this momentum. It is a pity that we did not
secure agreement on an interim agreement this weekend, because even
losing 10 days implies some loss of momentum here. But as the right
hon. Gentleman can gather, we will pick that up as quickly as we
possibly can. We have scheduled another meeting immediately. It is
important for everyone when they think about this to understand that
the pressure is on all of us to reach an agreement—it is on
Iran, because the sanctions are really biting and having a very serious
impact on it, but it is on all of us if we want to see an agreement on
this before the Iranian nuclear programme passes further very important
stages in its development. We all have to bear that in mind. That means
that an interim first step agreement is in the interests of the whole
world<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:07:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000243"><Member ContinuationText="Richard Ottaway" PimsId="2223" UID="1311114000490" xid="460" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000490"><B>Richard
Ottaway</B> (Croydon South) (Con):</Member> On Iran, no deal is better
than a bad deal, and I wish my right hon. Friend well in bringing the
Iranians back to the negotiating table. On Syria, as we are witnessing
complete deadlock, does he agree now that the danger is the break-up of
the region’s national boundaries, established after the first
world war, as the different entities compete for territory and
resources and build alliances along ethnic and cultural
grounds<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:08:15"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:07:29"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000244"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Hague" PimsId="3707" UID="1311114000491" xid="245" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000491">Mr
Hague:</Member></B> That is one of the dangers, yes. That is absolutely
correct. There are many dangers here, but the conflict in Syria
becoming more sectarian in its nature and then exacerbating such
tensions in neighbouring countries, with a greater and greater
disregard for national boundaries, is absolutely a central danger here.
That is why it is so important that we give the support to neighbouring
countries, including the support that we give to the Lebanese armed
forces, which I have described on other occasions, and it is the
urgency behind the efforts to come to a political solution to the
conflict before it does even greater damage to the entire
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311114000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000245"><Member ContinuationText="Mr David Winnick" PimsId="4647" UID="1311114000492" xid="643" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0001.htm#1311114000492"><B>Mr

Syria is indeed appalling, and everyone will endorse what the Foreign
Secretary said and the need for humanitarian aid. On the talks with the
Iranian Foreign Minister, is it not a fact that the Israeli Prime
Minister has been very active in trying to gather opposition, including

Hague:</Member></B> It is important that the talks should succeed. It
is very important that we pursue a steady course through this to an
agreement that is demanding, of course, and which gives the necessary
assurances and brings about concrete actions in Iran’s nuclear
programme. We should not be surprised that in different countries
people have different opinions about this. That is what we have to deal
with as politicians and Ministers. We have to persuade other countries
as best we can. We will continue to be very active, talking to Israel
and other

therefore does not exclude everyone in the current Syrian regime, but
it would clearly be impossible—on the basis not only of
Geneva I, but of any practical political

not think it is unrealistic to try to assemble a peace conference,

the Arab League and its individual members. When we are looking for
greater contributions to humanitarian support, it comes bilaterally
from the individual Arab nations. Many of them are substantial

Christian representatives, not only among its membership, but among the
leaders of the national council, which is a component of the national

with the Assad regime. However, I believe that it is important for

that we will be able to make a deal—a first step

twofold. First, it is worth saying that this House voted for the

would prevent any kind of restructuring or reorganisation within an

probation service to provide supervision for these offenders. We have
come up with a way of doing that. Labour said that in 2010—just
before the last election. That is the reality of what we are dealing

£46 in their pocket and little or no support. Some engage with
voluntary rehabilitation programmes after their release, but at the

observed, in a good piece of work, that the present system was far too
bureaucratic, and that only a minority of probation time was spent on
working with offenders. We are seeking to create a simpler system in
which we give much more professional freedom to those on the front
line. We want to deliver an environment in which we can mentor and
support people, and we want to bring together the best of the public,
private and voluntary sectors, not only to make the system more
efficient but to deliver high-quality
mentoring.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311119000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0002.htm#1311119000029">The

some of what the Bill will actually do. Clause 2 provides for this
group of offenders to spend the second half of their sentences subject
to licence conditions in the community, like all other prisoners.
Clause 3 creates an innovative period of additional supervision, which
is added to the licence to make a total of 12 months' mandatory
rehabilitation and support after release. I think that that is the
least that we should have in our system; it is extraordinary that we do
not have it
already.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311119000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0002.htm#1311119000031">The
supervision period is there not to punish offenders, but to help them
to move away from crime. We want those who work with offenders to try
new, innovative approaches to rehabilitation. I look forward to seeing
the voluntary sector, for example, playing a much larger role. We all
see good work done in that sector, and I want to see more of it being
done in our formal systems.</hs_Para>

flexible requirements can be imposed during the supervision period.
They are set out in schedule 1, and include participating in
rehabilitative activities including restorative justice, being tested
for drugs, and attending appointments to address drug misuse. Those
requirements are designed to give those who work with offenders the
ability to steer them during the months after their release from
prison. The freedom to innovate will be critical to the driving down of
reoffending rates in this group.</hs_Para>

focusing particularly on drug use, which is common among offenders who
are serving custodial sentences. Two thirds of those who are serving
sentences of less than 12 months have used class A drugs, while three
quarters have used class B or class C drugs. Drug use among prisoners
is also strongly associated with reconviction on release. The rate of
reconviction among prisoners who report having used drugs in the four
weeks before custody is more than double the rate among those who have
never used drugs. That applies to drugs in class A, class B and class
C.</hs_Para>

expands the current power to test offenders for drugs while they are on
licence to include class B as well as class A drugs. Schedule 1 creates
an equivalent testing condition for the supervision period that will
follow the licence period. All that is an essential part of trying to
ensure that when people come out of prison, we do all that we can to
move them off drugs as quickly as possible, in a regime in which they
are obliged to take part.</hs_Para>

explain what will happen if an offender does not engage with
supervision. Breach of any of the supervision requirements will be
dealt with by the magistrates courts, and there will be an important
new role for lay justices and district judges. Clause 4 provides a
flexible set of sanctions that magistrates may—not
must—impose if a breach is proved. They can impose a fine,
between 20 and 60 hours of community payback, a curfew with an
electronic tag, or committal back to custody. There is no
“escalator” approach requiring a more onerous sanction to
be used if a lighter-touch one has been imposed before.</hs_Para>

makes reforms to the two types of sentence that are served in the
community—suspended sentence orders and community orders.
Reoffending rates following those sentences are less stark than those
following short prison sentences, but it is no less important for us to
address them. Nearly everyone who ends up in our prisons has previously
served a community sentence, and many of those people experience
problems similar to those experienced by short-sentence offenders:
problems involving mental health, alcohol consumption and drug misuse.
Clause 15 creates a new rehabilitation activity requirement to mirror
the new supervision condition that will be available for offenders who
are released from short prison sentences. As with the top-up
supervision period created by clause 3, that will provide maximum
flexibility for those working with offenders, enabling them to instruct
them to attend appointments or participate in
activities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311119000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0002.htm#1311119000037"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T16:59:41"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Mr David Burrowes" PimsId="4754" UID="1311119000176" xid="839" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0002.htm#1311119000176"><B>Mr

different is that having a 12-month supervision period—a period
of mentoring—for people once they have left prison, or for those
going through a community sentence, will provide much more of a

fundamental changes to the way in which probation works in
England and Wales.  
<?notus-xml column=670?>The motivation that the Justice Secretary relies on in public is his
frustration that reoffending rates are too high, which he says means
that something bold and radical needs to be done. He is in serious
danger, however, of doing something that, bold and radical as it is,
might make matters worse and increase the risk to the

know that probation works, as those under supervision are less likely
than those who are not to go on and commit more crimes. The
MOJ’s figures for the most recent full year show that among
those who received a sentence of between four and 10 years who were
released and supervised by probation, 30.7% reoffended; among those who
received a sentence of between 12 months and four years who
were released and supervised by probation, 36.2% reoffended; and among
those in custody for less than 12 months who were released and not
supervised by probation at all, 58.5% reoffended. By the by, it is a
shame that the Justice Secretary is not suggesting payment by results
for the public probation
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:11:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:11:24"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, I welcome the fact that he appears, at least on this
particular aspect, to want to follow the evidence and to use it to
inform his policy making. Offenders who receive probation support do
better than those who do not. That must be why he wants to extend
probation to those who receive a custodial sentence of less than 12
months. But why does he want completely to dismantle our probation
service?</hs_Para>

can all agree that too many people are stuck in a cycle of reoffending.
Just over a week ago, on a visit to the Justice Secretary’s
flagship Oakwood prison, I met one young man who had previously been in
prison six times and who could not have been more than 25 years old. It
is precisely that group of people whom we need to get to grips with. It
is not only a waste of taxpayers’ money, although we know that
on average it costs £40,000 a year to keep someone like him in
prison. There is a cost to society, too, as crime is estimated to cost
the country £12 billion a year as well as creating, as the
Justice Secretary said, needless victims of crime, heartache and
misery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:12:30"></hs_TimeCode>. It is

receive probation supervision. Rather than supporting probation, what
are his plans for it? Those plans are: abolishing local probation
trusts and instead commissioning services direct from his desk, in
Whitehall, on behalf of local communities; splitting responsibility for
offenders on the basis of their risk level, despite risk not being
static in 25% of cases; handing responsibility for serious and violent
criminals to G4S, Serco, Carillion, A4e and the like; imposing an
untried and untested payment-by-results model on providers; and, as I
said, all at breakneck speed, adding up to a half-baked, reckless
reorganisation of probation, without any evidential base—a
monumental gamble with public
safety<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:23:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311119000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0002.htm#1311119000083">Let
us be frank. The Justice Secretary has wanted to keep all the major
changes he is making to probation below the radar, purposely avoiding
bringing those plans before Parliament. If not for the Opposition day 
<?notus-xml column=674?>debate, MPs would never have had the chance to debate them. He said in
the Chamber 12 days ago that he was not afraid of debating his plans,
but he left the Chamber almost immediately after his speech, not
staying to hear any of contributions from worried and concerned MPs in
all parts of the House. That is not debate in anyone’s book.
Instead, it shows a disdainful arrogance towards Parliament and towards
genuine concerns at his proposals. If he had stayed, he would have
heard in the time-limited debate l8 MPs from all parts of the House
express concern. More MPs wanted to speak, but there was insufficient
time. Just three Members spoke in favour. I can see that he has done a
better whipping operation today than he did 12 days ago. Many MPs,
stakeholders, prison and probation staff and charities are labouring
under the false impression that this is the privatisation of probation
Bill. It is not. The Justice Secretary is trying to use the 2007 Act to
do

speak to the probation trusts, he would know that in Manchester, for
example, the trust is already working with the voluntary sector, the
private sector and charities to address those who receive sentences of
less than 12 months. If he had spoken to those in Avon and Somerset, he
would know that the probation trust is already doing that. If he had
spoken to the South Yorkshire trust, he would know that it is already
doing that. If he took the trouble to speak to them, rather than G4S
and Serco, he would know what works and what does not work. Instead, he
wants to give contracts to untried, untested private companies, with no
experience in criminal justice. If I were the Justice Secretary, I
would have consulted the probation trusts.
What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:27:39"></hs_TimeCode> does he do?
He does not wait for any evidence or trials. Forget testing or rigour;
he cancels the pilots and does a complete somersault, hoping that no
one will notice either his change of mind or the fact that it is being
done without any evidence, taking huge risks with public safety and

important issue is how the plans will be resourced. A number of Back
Benchers, reading the script, have asked about resources, and how we
will we do this in the public sector and not use G4S and Serco to save
money. As I have already said, extending supervision to those on short
sentences is to be welcomed, but this cannot be taken as a
resource-free commitment. An additional 50,000 offenders on top of the
current 250,000 a year would need support and supervision. The impact

says
that</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="1311119000153" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0002.htm#1311119000153">“the

basically, the Government are asking for Parliament’s support,
but will not say what the cost implications are of implementing the
plans. Call me old-fashioned, but I would like to know how much it will
cost before I decide to vote for
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T17:28:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311119000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0002.htm#1311119000095">That
is important for two reasons. First, if it is the case that there is
going to be a considerable additional resource demand for these plans,
but the Government do not want to commit more money—they may
indeed wish to save money—existing resources will have to be
spread more thinly. So while the Justice Secretary refers to the 3,000
short-term offenders committing offences, that could increase
exponentially, because medium and low-risk offenders will be supervised
less well because of his plans to increase supervision without proper
resources. There are implications for the quality of supervision, and
it is important that Parliament debates
this.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_11_PT_1/D381A67FA78E0B06F50B0852F1EC019E48EBA047" __version__="1.13"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 November 2013">Monday

with rehabilitation being the end product. A key element of the Bill on
rehabilitation and reoffending is clauses 12 and 13. Compulsory drug
testing for class B drugs expands existing provisions, and
clause 13 introduces compulsory attendance at appointments on licence
for drug treatment and testing, which did not exist before. The key
part is helping people who need help. The ones who are addicted to
drugs are the ones who continue to go in and out of the criminal
system. Clauses 12 and 13 deal with rehabilitation on that basis, and I

Friend the Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan) has said that the Opposition
do not object to some of the Bill. Additional requirements as part of
supervision orders are sensible. Extending the supervision requirement
to those who are released from custody after short-term sentences is
sensible. My argument is that the legislation is part of a wider
programme, the policy purpose of which lacks evidence and
justification, but not the ideology that drives the Justice Secretary.

probation services. It is not about the means to a better probation

Probation trusts want to do the work they already do, including with
offenders who serve custodial sentences of less than 12 months. They
require all their officers to be qualified to work with medium-risk
offenders—the group the Government want to put out to the
private sector—which is one reason why the results for reduction
in reoffending have been so good in the past five years. I see no
reason why probation trusts should not be able to bid to provide the

Justice Secretary, and I am interested to hear what he says about
Greater Manchester. I suspect that the point is the same with regard to
south Yorkshire: the Government’s proposed changes are all about
taking on the extra work that is already being done effectively. Many
of the 35 probation trusts are now saying, “Give us the
challenge and the opportunity to do this extra work and we will do it
without the extra cost.” I ask the Minister: why destroy this
local probation service, which the combination of privatisation and the
Bill will do? Why dismantle the working relationships in place with
partner agencies? Why privatise out of existence the people with the
proven expertise and dedication to help the short-sentence offenders,
whom he, in the Bill, rightly wants to support? Why run the terrible
risk to the safety of the public with these changes?</hs_Para>

risk that Ministers talk about does not relate simply to the original
crime committed. With these offenders, the risk changes, often rapidly
and in response to personal circumstances—their stopping taking
medication, breaking up with a partner, or suddenly falling into a
circle of old friends and bad habits. Last year, one in four offenders
moved, one way or the other, between the high and medium-risk
categories. They are exactly the group that the Government want to see
moving between the public and the private sectors—between the
probation service and the contracted services. These individuals are
likely to yo-yo between agencies, which will result in extra cost,
paperwork and risk.

Friend the shadow Secretary of State, I broadly support some of the
provisions in part 2, including the ones that seek to reduce the
reoffending rate among those who serve less than 12 months in custody,
for whom the probation trusts do not have supervisory responsibility at
the moment. That reoffending rate is around 60%. It is too high and the
Government are right to want to tackle it, but this could have
consequences for a rising prison population. First, the courts might
well choose to make more use of short custodial sentences with this
extra 12 months’ supervision added by the Bill. Secondly, if the
new licence conditions available under the Bill are too tight, more
people might breach them and be sent back to custody. The Justice
Secretary has not, and cannot, answer such concerns—as he cannot
the other concerns—because he will not test his
plans<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:12:25"></hs_TimeCode> in

want to move on to the meat of the debate. The current system of
tackling reoffending is not working, and we all need to accept that it
requires fundamental change. The reforms represent one of the most
important and effective developments in the drive to reduce reoffending
that we have seen in this country. It has been fundamentally wrong to
leave those on short-term sentences without support for so long, and I
am delighted that we will see changes in that area.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:20:09"></hs_TimeCode>For years,
people have claimed that short terms of imprisonment do not work, and
they have held up reoffending rates as proof of that assertion. The
reality, however, is that short terms of imprisonment can work, but
they are less effective if there is no support for the prisoner on
release.</hs_Para>

should be proud of that. We have achieved that through Government
initiatives as well as through initiatives involving the police and,
yes, the probation service, but there is so much more that could be
done, particularly for those serving short sentences. 
<?notus-xml column=691?>Prisoners who serve sentences of under 12 months are the most likely

the Justice Secretary likes it or not, we are debating two issues here

important questions have been raised that the Minister will need to
address in his response; I am sure he will. The second issue is the
fundamental change to the probation service 
<?notus-xml column=692?>that Justice Ministers are bringing about. It is all very well for the
Justice Secretary to say that all this is being done under legislation

link between the two issues has been made explicit in two
ways—first, by the amendment tabled by Her Majesty’s
Opposition and, secondly, by clause 1, which was thoughtfully
introduced by the House of Lords, and under which there should be no
reform of probation without the approval of both Houses. I was
surprised by the rather dismissive attitude of the Justice Secretary
towards clause 1. If, on the one hand, there is growing concern among
those who lead and deliver the probation service, the police and crime
commissioners and many others, while on the other hand Ministers have
real conviction that their approach will work, what does the Justice
Secretary have to be afraid of? If he cannot put his proposals with
confidence to both Houses, subject them to scrutiny and gain an
affirmative vote from both Houses, he should not be bringing these
proposals before us at all. If he is so convinced that his proposals
will be so successful, he should get behind clause 1 and be supportive
of it.</hs_Para>

proposals are unpopular; they know that there is widespread concern
about the changes they want to make; and, frankly, they are running out
of road. This headlong rush to introduce a wholesale change to
probation has to be achieved within a year’s time in order to
fit the political timetable of getting it done before the general

is interesting and instructive to look at the figures put out over the

prison sentences of less than 12 months committed serious violent
offences, while 2,482 offenders serving the same term came out and
committed serious acquisitive crime, including robberies, which are
serious crimes against people. Those are serious crimes carried out by
people who sound to me as if they might be—no, must
be—high-risk criminals. Unless the Minister is going to correct
me, under these proposals, when such individuals come out after serving
their short-term sentences of  
<?notus-xml column=693?>less than 12 months, they would be among the low and medium-risk group,

Goggins:</Member></B> I agree with the right hon. Gentleman, who is an
excellent Select Committee Chair. I hope Ministers will still be
listening to him and his Committee colleagues when they produce their
report following the inquiry they are currently conducting. Many
women’s centres are facing cuts at a time when we need them more
than ever, so there is a very real difficulty, but I think all the
points that have been made about women offenders are well
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T18:53:16"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope

mentioned offenders who are mentally ill. The Ministry of Justice and
the Department of Health have made a very impressive commitment to do
more to try to help people with a mental illness who get caught up in
the criminal justice system. The national liaison and diversion scheme,
which was introduced following a 
<?notus-xml column=698?>recommendation by our noble Friend Lord Bradley, who
has done some fantastic work in this area, is very welcome. Again,
however, I put it to the Minister that there are real dangers of the
policy he is trying to introduce in this Bill running headlong into the
more positive policy towards people with mental illness that he and the
Department of Health are trying to introduce. Again, I am looking for
reassurances about flexibility in the way people with mental illness
are treated at the point where consideration may be given to returning
them to prison, which might not be the most appropriate

I have a concern about care leavers. Some young people in care might go
into prison as a child and come out as an adult and a care leaver. That
could produce additional difficulties, because who will have the prime
responsibility? Will it be the private provider of the supervision that
comes after a prison sentence, or will it be the local
authority which has continuing responsibilities for those who leave
care beyond the age of 18?</hs_Para>

done by probation staff. We have heard about the long hours they work,
and how they deal with complex cases and issues. They cannot just tick
a box to get someone off the cycle of crime, and probation service

hon. Members would like to see more mentoring to ensure that people
actually get “through the gate”. I understand that 65% of
offenders say, “If I had that mentor who took me through the
gate, it would have a dramatic effect on my offending.” We
cannot just have the status quo. As I mentioned in an intervention,
there are cases where the private, voluntary and public sectors provide
mentoring, but they are all too infrequent and the mentoring is
voluntary, not mandatory. At its heart, the Bill is saying that there
will be mandatory supervision, and that is about mentoring. We will not
just have the same situation, whereby what people see through the gate
is not that mentor who takes them into rehabilitation, but the drug
dealer waiting for them, or their mates who are going to get them back
into the same cycle of crime. For the sake of these people, we are not
going to put up with the status quo tonight.</hs_Para>

62% of these offenders will not get into employment after their

get into jobseeker’s allowance, and attempts will be made to get

too often, they get back into the only career they know, which they
have learned all too well in prison: a repeated career in crime. That

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:03:01"></hs_TimeCode> status quo

We know that 64% of prisoners will have taken drugs in the four weeks
before going into prison. We can intervene and do all we can in
prisons, and good work is going on in rehabilitation wings.
RAPt—the Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners trust—and
other agencies are doing good work trying to ensure that we turn people
around in the captive community of prison. However, what we need to do
is ensure that when they get out of prison they are released into the
hands of drug treatment providers and have the appointment that is
going to be mandated in this legislation. That matters greatly and it
shows why the status quo is not acceptable for these people, too.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:03:48"></hs_TimeCode>Too often, not
only are they not getting off drugs, but they are getting more addicted

from family—when they are in prison and, crucially, continued
support when they are released, it would have a dramatic effect on
whether they reoffend. The status quo is unacceptable not only for the
offenders, but for their families—their children. The evidence

appropriate skills to appropriate tasks. We must ensure that the skills
of probation staff are properly matched, not only so that they can deal
with serious criminals, but so that we can use the best people around
to secure rehabilitation for short-sentence offenders. Of course
probation staff are going to be needed. They are going to be in the
front line, because they are the experts, to ensure that the new
organisations that are working to deliver payment by results
are going to do the job. Of course, they are not going to ignore these

a little more detail about that mechanism because I have some
experience of it. We should not ignore the value of paying for success.
It may provide an opportunity and, indeed, a profit for some companies,
but success will be measured by a mechanism of ensuring that offending
is reduced, but that has a dramatic effect on people’s lives, on

hearing this debate will think the current situation extraordinary.
They will say, “Is it the case that in law we do not have to
rehabilitate or supervise 
<?notus-xml column=702?>released prisoners who were serving less than 12 months? When we look at
the cohort of the most prolific, who are causing the most damage in our

this amount of debate on and scrutiny of different criminal justice
Bills, for us to have, at last, a principle that we must
mandate supervision of this category? Why was this never in place

the experienced people who moved clause 1, it is more in line with an

this area is complicated, that such schemes take careful local design
and that the matter must be handled with care. I recognise that, but it
is also important that we are not fixated by the price mechanism, the
amount that is paid and whom it is paid to. One lesson learned from the
pilots has been that the service has been transformed. They have linked
together not just the drug treatment providers but those who want to
support people into housing and employment. The service change brings

Burrowes:</Member></B> My point is that there have been many different
pilots in the past few years that have considered different ways of
ensuring that we are more driven by outcomes than by process. One of
the great failures of the previous Government, not least on drug
treatment, was that it was all based on process and on ticking a box.
Indeed, the so-called payment by results was payment by activity,
driven not by rehabilitation and outcomes but by the numbers of people
getting into treatment. That is why it is important to recognise that
payment by results has a crucial role to play across all public
services, but will vary from service to service. We must therefore
handle with care how we deliver payment by results on criminal
justice.</hs_Para>

want to offer some advice on the LASARS, or the local area single
assessment and referral systems—we are all into acronyms when we
have service changes. They have had a particularly good effect, not
least because they are locally based. They are also based on single
assessments and many of us involved in the criminal justice system will
be all too aware of the repetitive assessments throughout the system
that lack continuity and delivery of change. LASARS allow a single
assessment in the criminal justice and non-criminal 
<?notus-xml column=704?>justice worlds. Payment by results offers us the opportunity to get away
from the criminal justice mindset in that regard. Public health
interest concerns, mental health concerns and educational concerns must
be dealt with under a wider remit than that simply required by a
criminal justice model. That is why we need to make the most of the
opportunity offered by the LASARS, which would help refer people to the
right places through a single assessment.</hs_Para>

question of value for money. I encourage him to consider the
consultations on secure colleges, with the opportunities for us to
upscale what has been lost in Feltham. We talk about training and
education, and we should try to ensure that we have more intensive
rehabilitation that, although it takes place in custody, does not take
place in custody on the same model as at Feltham. I agree that Feltham
is another example of an institution that is past its sell-by date and
needs change and radical overhaul, but that is why we recognise that we

point is that a very small proportion of these contracts, it seems,
will genuinely be payment-by-results contracts. Substantial elements of
these contracts will be subject to meeting court requirements, which
means that there will have to be enough money in those contracts to
ensure that those court requirements can be adequately met by the
contractors. That, for a start, will leave relatively little room for
manoeuvre in pricing a more discretionary element and an element that
is about payment by
results<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:30:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:31:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

a further perhaps 50,000 within the context of the same funding
envelope. That is not credible. It means either that we will have a
very poor quality of intervention and/or cherry-picking, with a
substantial number of those offenders receiving no support of any value

of external pressures and circumstances—bereavement, loss of a
job, ending of a relationship, becoming homeless and so on—all
of which can take a relatively stable low to medium-risk offender and
suddenly catapult them into being high risk. At that point, we
understand that the low or medium-risk offender would switch from being
supervised by a non-statutory provider into the public probation
supervision system. They would be supervised within the statutory

points that she raised, in relation to what happens to the
income for the provider if someone moves out of the medium and low-risk
category and into the high-risk category, the answer is that that
individual will stay within the cohort for payment-by-results purposes,
so there is no financial incentive—that is the purpose of
this—for the provider to move someone on to the public sector.
On the second issue that she raised—how the public sector

It seemed that the private provider would retain any income attached to
the result—the outcome—although we do not know what
proportion of that overall payment to the private provider will be for
the result and what will be a fixed payment for having to carry out the
basics of supervision. It is welcome that the Minister says that
resources will follow the offender, and therefore that if there is
extra activity to be carried out in the public sector, the public
sector will receive the necessary resources to carry out that work, but
I am not quite clear where that funding will come from if the private
provider is also to be remunerated in full for the work that it has
carried out and for any ultimate outcome that may be achieved. Perhaps
the Minister will be able to provide more detail as the Bill proceeds
on its parliamentary passage. It would be useful to understand the cash

innovative. As I say, in my discussions with Greater Manchester, the
trust was preparing for exactly this approach, at least a year ago, and
had the brakes put on. It was told that it would not be able to bid in
the process in the way that it had planned, so I would be interested to
understand, as I think the hon. Gentleman would, what Greater
Manchester and other such trusts will and will not be able to bid for,
what sort of entities they will have to establish to enable them to bid
and potentially to take a leading role in that bidding process, and
whether there will be time for them to create those entities and put in
bids, given that as I understand it, the preliminaries of the process
are already under way this month. He and I look forward to some

number of my colleagues have pointed out that the Lord
Chancellor’s proposals mirror the structure and approach of the
Work programme, which he introduced as Minister of State, Department
for Work and Pensions. Leaving aside the pretty poor performance of the
Work programme to date—I am prepared to give it the benefit of
the doubt; it may achieve improved outcomes over time, although it is
getting off to a depressingly slow start—in the light of
everything that has been said in the Chamber this evening about what we
have seen from the Work programme and what seems to be being replicated
in these contracts, I am concerned that we will have a nationally,
top-down driven system, when what we have heard from both sides of the
House, about innovative experiments in different parts of the 
<?notus-xml column=711?>country, is that a localised, bottom-up, partnership approach across a
range of local agencies has been what has worked best.</hs_Para>

providers, who are likely to bid for these contracts—indeed may
be the only people qualified and able to take the risk inherent in
bidding for these contracts—is that they are not good at
developing supply chains down the local agencies. As hon. Members may
know, many voluntary and charitable organisations have complained
bitterly about their experiences with the Work programme. They complain
that they have been used as so-called bid candy, but have not been
given any opportunity to deliver activity. They complain that they have
had very few referrals, having been included on bids by the large prime
contractors. There are real concerns that we are seeing a model that
looks very like the Work programme in terms of top-down, Department-led
contracting. There are also concerns about whether we can be confident
that those problems and pitfalls will not occur in these contracts in
the way that they did in the Work

Members have talked about some of the innovative programmes in their
own probation trusts. As has been said, Greater Manchester has had a
number of particularly innovative programmes. One in particular speaks
directly to the Government’s proposals for post-release
supervision for those serving short custodial sentences. I am sure the
Minister will be familiar with the Choose Change programme that was
developed in Greater Manchester. It has been running for a number of
years and we await its final evaluation. I hope that the Government are
drawing some interesting and important lessons from that experience, on
which I would like to hear the Minister’s comments
tonight<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:43:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111128000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#13111128000126">It
is clear when we look at Choose Change—a through-the-gate
programme, working with offenders in prison, as they left prison and on
release—that it depended heavily on being a multi-agency
programme in which private, public and voluntary providers
were all comprehensively engaged. That included the prison and
probation services, corporate partners, the voluntary and community
sector, and, crucially, local authorities. I am very unclear how local
authorities will fit into the model of provision in this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:44:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111128000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#13111128000127">It
was instructive from Choose Change that the range of interventions
needed was extensive. They included interventions in relation to
employment, education and training. Many offenders, as the Minister
will be well 
<?notus-xml column=712?>aware, have exceptionally poor levels of literacy
and numeracy, so investing in routing them to the right educational
opportunities and continuing their education commenced inside prison
consistently on release is an important element that will need to be
designed into any provision. Income and access to financial services
have been a key element of what the Choose Change programme has
identified as being important for offenders on release.
Housing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:49:36"></hs_TimeCode> needs
are an exceptionally urgent priority for many on release, as are health
needs, particularly mental health needs. It often transpires that
offenders have no registered GP to whom they can turn for health care,
and their engagement with the health service has been
sporadic.</hs_Para>

need for a package of interventions, bringing together a number of
agencies and players, and beginning that work inside the prison and
continuing it as part of a continuing process—not a broken
process whereby the prison services does this inside prison and someone
else does it post-release—will be an incredibly important
feature of what the Government seek to achieve. I am pleased to see the
Minister nodding as I say that. I hope that he will be able to reassure
us this evening that there will be a continuum of support, not a form
of support that begins only as someone leaves the prison gate. There
has been a lot of encouraging discussion this evening about
through-the-gate models, but we need to understand how those will work
within the prison as well as after
release.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111128000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#13111128000129">We
also need to understand that the interventions will be made in the
right sequence. Some things can only happen easily post-release. It is
quite difficult to do much, for example, about housing until someone is
near to the point of release. But other things, such as education and
preparing for employment, can be started much earlier. The sequencing
of interventions inside prison and post-release will be very important,
and I would be grateful if the Minister said something about how he
sees that working in these new
contracts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:46:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111128000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#13111128000130">It
will also be important to know how the programme that will be put in
place through the contracted provision will work with other programmes
already running in the community in relation to criminal justice. That
includes how it will work with prolific offender programmes, integrated
offender management programmes and programmes such as Spotlight in
Greater Manchester, which enables the police and other criminal justice
agencies and social services to keep close tabs on those in the
community, perhaps not serving sentences but known to the system. How
does the Minister envisage those different community-based initiatives
will be linked into what is being
proposed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:47:47"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111128000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#13111128000131">The
Minister will also want to look carefully at the learning from Choose
Change, which shows that intervening with offenders who have long
histories of offending behaviour is particularly challenging. Some
offenders who are serving their eighth, 10th, 15th or even their 20th
short custodial sentence will be particularly difficult to work with on
release. Therefore, it would be useful to understand how the Minister
envisages these contracts being able to cope with, on the one hand,
those who may have had one experience of custody, where it is to be
hoped that with good post-release supervision they could be quickly
taken off the track of offending behaviour and we could see some
effective rehabilitation, and on the other hand, those who may have 10,
15 or 20 years of offending history. The lessons from Choose Change 
<?notus-xml column=713?>are that that is a very challenging group of offenders to work with, and
simply wrapping some fairly basic post-release supervision around them
is unlikely to be sufficient to change the course of their offending
behaviour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:49:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111128000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#13111128000132">How
does the Minister envisage the contracts being structured to

women’s organisations and centres producing extremely strong
support programmes for women offenders. In Greater Manchester we have
the extremely successful Women MATTA—Manchester and Trafford
Taking Action—initiative, which has worked with the Pankhurst
Centre, the local authority, the probation service and so on. However,
many of those women’s projects are now under severe funding
pressure. They are not cheap to run. I hope that the Chair of the
Select Committee agrees that women’s special needs and
circumstances mean that cut pricing will not necessarily be very
effective for women offenders. I am therefore keen to hear whether the
Minister is confident that the structure of the contracts will reward
providers for working with the especially challenging circumstances
faced by women offenders and how they will be incentivised to make use
of the very good practice and experience of the women’s centres
across the country that have been delivering such programmes in recent
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111128000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#13111128000134"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:50:45"></hs_TimeCode>In
conclusion, I must say on behalf of the Greater Manchester probation
trust and a number of Opposition colleagues that our opposition to
giving the Bill a Second Reading is not the result of wholesale
opposition to introducing a mix of private and voluntary providers,
which has been a feature of the effective working we have seen in
Greater Manchester and across the country in recent years. We are
concerned that there is little evidence that that particular approach
to wholesale contracting out with an arbitrary cut-off point at the
level of medium to high-risk offenders is the right way to structure
the participation of private and non-statutory providers.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T19:50:15"></hs_TimeCode> seems to
be little opportunity for the very good programmes that have been run
by the public probation service to compete effectively in a rapid time
scale and continue to be major players in the provision of the services
that the Government are now seeking to introduce. There are real
concerns that strong local relationships and structures will be
disrupted by the bidding process. Finally, as my right hon. Friend the
shadow Justice Secretary said, there are real concerns about the risk
consequences for the public. I hope that the Minister can offer more
reassurances in that regard than we have had so far this
evening.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_11_PT_1/F845A46B06A3D11FE9C7704A3D1289BDC232EBCF" __version__="1.10"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 November 2013">Monday

consumption of class B drugs. For example, people might go back to
their old haunts to obtain them and take up associating with other
offenders. Some 48% of offenders who go on to reoffend use class B and
C drugs in the month before custody, compared with 30% who never used
drugs before imprisonment. Why tempt fate?</hs_Para>

privy to the analysis the Government have used. I am prepared to go

consortiums of private businesses, charities and not-for-profit

the probation trusts will be able to tender for private sector
contracts, but I understand that it is not appropriate for them to do
so, because they are Government funded and such contracts involve risk.
However, could my hon. Friend the Minister explain under what
circumstances existing probation trusts or, indeed, existing probation

limited to a reduction of 5% as anything more than that would require

that in the so-called negotiations, that was reduced to less than 10%.
As the think-tank points out, the companies will earn a vast amount of
their money by winning the contract. That is how they will make their
profit. To extend the payment beyond that would be a bonus. Any
suggestion that payment by results can have that effect therefore flies

Serco—partnership is crucial in this area of our

partnerships have been destroyed by the actions of that private

piloting and evaluation, and we need a far more cautious approach for
two reasons, the first of which is the danger to the public, which has
been mentioned extensively during the debate. I am in the Chamber
representing 120,000 people —men, women and
children—in my constituency, just as every other Member is
doing. I have a responsibility to look to their safety, and these
proposals will lessen that safety. My constituents will be more likely
to become victims of crime as a result of dangerous,
volatile, difficult-to-predict, sometimes professional criminals and
offenders being supervised by untrained, unqualified, poorly paid,
temporary, unmotivated, so-called probation staff. There is an enormous
danger to the public inherent in and right at the heart of these
proposals.</hs_Para>

think that so far in the debate—I have been here since the
beginning—no one has mentioned the danger to the criminal
justice system. There is the idea that we can take on work with at
least another 60,000 offenders a year and that the whole
system will not become swamped, even though we are cutting
resources at the same time—well, we are told that it will be
within the same cost envelope, but that is 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 or
70,000 extra offenders a year to be dealt with within that same cost
envelope. I am trying not to say that this does not add up, but it does

much more cautious approach because the Bill is being introduced with
the lie that it is about high-minded aspirations to provide a service
for petty offenders, those on short-term sentences and the like. We
know, however, that the proposals are a blatant attempt to take public
money and transpose it into the coffers of private companies. We also
know what happens if we introduce legislation on that basis. Think of
the Child Support Agency. How many years has it taken to get the
CSA—which was introduced by the previous Tory Government, on a
lie—back to something fit for purpose? How many lives
have been ruined? How many injustices caused? Yet that is exactly what

considerable concerns about the Bill, and to conclude I would
like to place on record a few of the issues that cause me
particular concern. First, the Government’s own impact
assessment is one of the most vacuous documents that I have read for a
long time. There is no costing anywhere in it: “We don’t
have to cost it because we know what the cost will be, but we are not
going to tell you. If we told you, the private companies involved might
know.” There are estimates and guesstimates about the
implications for the number of offenders, including those in breach of
an order or going back to prison—the spectrum is so wide that it
is rather like the weather report: “Tomorrow, there’s
going to be weather.”</hs_Para>

are told that 600 extra prison places will be needed
—we are talking about a new prison. We were told as recently as
last month that in a prison estate of 85,000 places, there
were 800 vacancies on the day in question. In fact, earlier in the
debate, we were told that the figure is now down to 600. Is every one
of those places to be filled by someone in breach of an order under the
proposals? Surely not, yet that is the logic of 13,000 to 17,000 extra
breaches leading to 600 extra prison places being needed. Any
suggestion that that will be achieved by the expenditure of £15
million of extra public funds is, as again we all know,
nonsense.</hs_Para>

bear the cost, so we can be fairly sure that they will not choose to
test very often. A Government Member has said that extending testing to
class B drugs was to catch people who are on cannabis. That might be a

costing the economy between £7 billion 
<?notus-xml column=723?>and £10 billion a year. There is an urgent need to tackle
reoffending, and robust reform of the system is required if we are to

concerns regarding the demarcation of high-risk offenders and movement
between categories and it would be helpful if the Minister underscored
those points. Secondly, it is right to make the unprecedented move to

the time available, I would like to focus on two areas of the Bill: the
assumptions made in rehabilitation, and the calibration of the payment

“Transforming Rehabilitation” and in the Bill, have shown
a wise awareness of the pattern of drug use and chaotic lifestyles
among many offenders, including those who serve short sentences. They
are right to want to tackle that within the rehabilitation process. I
am pleased to see, therefore, that provision has been made in the Bill
for drugs testing and to tackle drug dependency, within the limits set
out in clause 15, and that this has been expanded from class A drugs to
classes A and B.</hs_Para>

customised support to individuals, including support for independent

Government have already been told that there is a common-sense answer,
namely to extend the remit of the probation service so that probation
trusts can supervise offenders sentenced to less than 12 months in
prison. However, the Government have chosen not to do

is a pleasure to speak on the Second Reading of this Bill, and there
have been some useful contributions so far. Like
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T21:01:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Salisbury (John Glen), I regard myself as a critical
friend of these proposals. No one can dispute the figures, and I make
no apology for arguing that something must be done.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T21:01:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Batley and Spen (Mike Wood) appeared to suggest that that was a bad
approach. I think that when we have a cohort of prisoners who are
getting no rehabilitation support because their custodial sentence is
less than 12 months, something should be done. I think there is general
agreement on that on both sides of the House. We cannot go on giving
people £46 cash-in-hand and just hope for the best. That is why
these proposals are an important first step.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13111139000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#13111139000005">None<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T21:04:22"></hs_TimeCode>
the less, I recognise the level of concern that exists on both sides of
the House and in the wider community, which is interested in these
issues, not least the Prison Reform Trust, of which I am a trustee.
There is a deep underlying concern that these proposals may
inadvertently lead to an increase in the prison population as
sentencers play safe and send people to custody in order to access
rehabilitation services that they fear may not be available if they go
for a community sentence. That is a genuine fear that we have heard
expressed today, and I would like the Minister to try to nail it. What
guidance can he issue to the judiciary and magistrates to remind them
that existing sentencing guidelines will remain in force, so custody
remains an option only when the offence justifies it? Furthermore, can
he ensure that that guidance makes it clear that the level of support
available to an offender does not vary depending on whether it is in a
custodial or a community
setting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T21:03:39"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T21:03:36"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111139000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#13111139000006">Those
assurances would help many who are concerned that these proposals may
lead to an increase in the prison population, and it will underline
that these reforms should not be portrayed as being to the detriment of
community sentences. Indeed, given these concerns, I would welcome
hearing from the Minister how he sees community sentencing playing a
greater role in the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111139000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#13111139000007">We
have also heard a lot about the probation service’s fears about
the changes, and I want to raise a couple of points that may alter the
balance of the debate somewhat. For a very long time now the probation
service has argued for parity of esteem, within the Ministry of
Justice, with the prison sector. The 35 local probation trusts have
never felt that they have argued with one voice in the way that the
prisons sector can in the Ministry of Justice. Creating a national
probation service, and creating a probation institute to enhance that
profession’s qualifications and opportunities, is a good thing.
It provides an opportunity for the thousands of well-respected, highly
professional probation officers who are out there.</hs_Para>

can all refer to excellent voluntary organisations that engage in
rehabilitation work. As Christmas is coming, I can recommend Fine Cell
Work. It produces excellent embroidery, cushions and needlework, which 
<?notus-xml column=730?>can be fantastic for relatives or friends. I suggest
that hon. Members visit its website today. Fine Cell Work has a
purpose, because it trains people for a career after they leave
custody. The Clink is another good example of an excellent voluntary
organisation. It is about to open its third restaurant inside a prison,
at HMP Brixton—perhaps we can all go for a Christmas dinner at
some point, if it opens early enough. Its reoffending rate is 12.5%,
which is one that many would dream of in terms of this
debate.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13111139000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#13111139000009"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T21:05:42"></hs_TimeCode>I
recognise the concern expressed by hon. Members on both sides that the
smaller community groups may struggle to cling on in this new
competitive environment. A fortnight ago I made this point, but I will
make it again: Ministers and Opposition spokespeople must look
carefully at what is being proposed by Clinks, which is the trade body
for the hundreds of voluntary providers in our prison system. It has
some specific proposals about where risk can be located in the supply
chain to enable more of these many smaller groups to play a crucial
role. That particularly relates to the point made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T21:06:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green) about the smaller groups that
help women offenders and other minority groups of offenders. That is an
important thing and I hope that the Minister can respond to
it.</hs_Para>

speed of reform is certainly daunting and ambitious, and I would be
naive not to suggest that. In a way, it makes me think of the work
capability assessment, although I would rather not necessarily have to
do that. The previous Government sensibly asked Professor Harrington to
undertake regular reviews into specific aspects of the WCA that were
causing concern—one year it was mental health, another year it
was fluctuating conditions. That tweaked the WCA to improve it, perhaps
not to the extent that Labour Members might like but it was a useful
self-correcting mechanism to improve a process. I would very much like
to see something similar in this area. I recognise that we have Her
Majesty’s inspectorate of probation, but how will the Minister
task it to provide regular reviews on the progress of these reforms,
identifying thematic areas that might need attention? Such an approach
would greatly enhance the House’s confidence that these reforms
will be properly scrutinised and improved as they go along. The
iterative element to these proposals will be crucial, just as it was on
the WCA.</hs_Para>

am also highly concerned about the potential for large numbers of
breaches, with the impact assessment talking about a need for 600 extra
places and a cost of £16 million. Nobody who is concerned about
the size of public spending should treat that lightly. I want
to hear a bit more from the Minister about how we can ensure that
breach is not an automatic conveyor belt. Provision was made in the
Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 to allow
offenders to go before a court to explain why they did what they did
and then the court would have the option to do nothing if it thought
that what it had heard so convinced it. Disappointingly, I understand
that that was not commenced—indeed, it was removed in the Crime
and Courts Act 2013. Will the Minister say whether that can be
looked at again to ensure that we do not have this automatic escalator
of breaches, whereby we end up with more people in prison than should
be there? I am particularly concerned about the much younger
age group, who often have learning disabilities or 
<?notus-xml column=731?>communication delay of some sort. They often seem to
be in a Catch-22 situation, where they have a complex set of
requirements placed on them which they cannot possibly hope to
understand. I know the Government, in the other place, made a
commitment in response to Lord Bradley to have “easy
read” statements of what the requirements are going to be. Can
the Government update us on the progress of that, because I fear that
without them we will see far more breaches that cannot be explained in
front of a court to the satisfaction of the court?</hs_Para>

remain slightly concerned by the role youth offending teams will play

importantly, in terms of the numbers involved, we all frequently

addiction problem or a dual diagnosis is significant. It is striking
that, despite the fact that we have a specific mental health
rehabilitation order, for the last year for which I have figures only
1% of disposals consisted of such an order—that is only 783.
That cannot be because we are not aware of the problem; clearly, we
are, and many detailed reports have considered the structural issues

strike lightly—certainly not in this service. These are
dedicated professionals. The National Association of Probation Officers
have been pressing for years to be able to supervise those on
short-term sentences, and the irony is that that will be used
to privatise their jobs. The tragedy is that probation officers have

come together and work with offenders with a high risk of reoffending.
Sheffield Hallam’s independent study showed that in 2012-13 the

waiting expectantly for the full results and evaluation of the
Peterborough scheme next year. That is what we were promised: an
objective assessment of what worked, and evidence-based policy making,
which seems to have gone out of the window. It is not that the

creative to enable that to happen. The London community payback scheme
has been mentioned; in my area, we have lost invaluable staff and
volunteers as a result of the scheme’s mismanagement. Hostel
accommodation was privatised but had to be brought back into the public
sector because it was so bad. If the question is what happens to staff
in future, we should look to the prison privatisations: wage rates in
privatised prisons are 23% lower than in state prisons, and the
conditions—there are issues with the level of training and high
staff turnover—are undermining the service.</hs_Para>

not an acceptable market. In the probation market, we may be down to
two players. If the Serious Fraud Office’s investigation keeps

additional offenders? There will potentially be 600 in a new prison. I
think that there will be significantly more breaches than has been
suggested, because we are dealing with people with chaotic lives. More

professionals gave us for prison growth: we were told that the number

some of them—not all—have arrived at the barracks in a

for that purpose. Aircraft that may have outlived their usefulness on
the front line can be used in the air. Those who have served in the
Army can join the third force and represent the third force on the
land. I know, because I have seen it work, that when young men and

is what worries me. That is the risk element. We have to accept that
there is an element of risk, but there is risk in whatever we do. Have
we balanced the whole argument to ensure that the risk is as minimal as
possible? In this case—I do not like using this
expression—only time will tell. I hope for all our sakes that it
works.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311122000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#1311122000034"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Deputy Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="1050" UID="1311122001463" xid="293" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#1311122001463">Mr

hon. Member for South Dorset (Richard Drax) has just given us an
interesting vista of a militarised future for young people about which
I have some serious doubts. If he wants to consider the consequences of
the kind of solution that he proposes, he need look no further than the
USA, which imprisons more people than anywhere else in the world per
hear of population, has a higher recidivism rate, has more brutality in
its prisons and has a very large number of privatised prisons in which
unbelievable brutality is carried out against individual prisoners.
That does not work; it is not a solution.</hs_Para>

requires responsible officers in future to be qualified, experienced or
even trained. In summary, Ministers are not at all interested in the
competence or quality of provision.
Colleagues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T21:47:38"></hs_TimeCode> in
the House are not assured that the Secretary of State and his
Department can answer questions about the safety of their
constituents—questions that the Government do not want to
answer.</hs_Para><hs_Para tab="yes">Opposition
Members are deeply concerned by the lack of detail from the Government
on the cost of the Bill. What resources will the Department need to pay
for the supervision of 50,000 extra offenders each year, how much will
the contracts cost and what percentage will be paid by results? Even
more concerning is the lack of knowledge, owing to a disinterest in
testing the model on the operational side. For example, how long will
it take to swap responsibility for a high-risk, volatile offender
between G4S and the national probation service?</hs_Para>

of State should be able to come to the House and answer those basic
questions, and he should certainly answer them before he asks the House
to nod through the sell-off of the probation service. The core of the
Bill is welcome, but by cancelling the probation pilots, the Secretary
of State has pulled the foundations from beneath it. The Government are
abolishing local trusts, preparing to accept bids from providers under
investigation for fraud and contracting an untested model in a
Department that has repeatedly had rings run round it by G4S and
Serco.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311122000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0003.htm#1311122000063">In
the light of that, the Opposition are right not to trust the Secretary
of State’s gut feeling. There has been no piloting, no
parliamentary scrutiny, no commitment that those under criminal
investigation cannot bid, no costings and no interest from the
Government in the competence of providers. Ministers cannot say that
they have not been warned. For those reasons, I hope hon. Members vote
in favour the
amendment.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_11_PT_1/BA83514C97D1E93B8D0B0641DC318C831889003D" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 November 2013">Monday

maintain local partnerships in the criminal justice system. They are
right. Included among those relationships is the relationship with

Members have made a great many comments on the pace of the reforms,
which we discussed two weeks ago in the Opposition day debate. I repeat

right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul Goggins) raised
understandable concerns about sentencer behaviour. As he would expect,
we have spoken to senior sentencers. A number of points are relevant, a
couple of which were made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T21:54:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Blackpool North and Cleveleys. First, sentencing
guidelines remain in place. All sentencers are expected to follow them
and sentence to custody only when they believe it is appropriate.
Secondly, the same level of supervision will be provided from the same
provider whether someone receives a community order or a custodial
sentence. There is no distinction and it is important to bear that in
mind.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston was right to focus on
through-the-gate provision. A broader part of our reforms is to
institute what we call resettlement prisons, to enable all prisoners to
be met by a rehabilitation provider in the closing stages of the
custodial part of their sentence, and then be supported by that same
provider through the gate and out into the community. That will provide
the continuity she is looking for.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (John Glen) made the point that it
is important to design a payment-by-results system that does not
involve cherry-picking. We will do that through a combination of
mechanisms that will reward those who stop reoffending altogether, but
reflect an element of reward for reducing the amount of reoffending in
the cohort—that is crucial. It is right that we pick up on the
specific needs of women. As I think has been recognised,
that is already covered in the Bill.</hs_Para>

right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East was straightforward in
saying that. We propose a simpler system. We propose not just the
opportunity for innovation to be brought into the management of
offenders—by the voluntary sector, and, yes, the private
sector—but, crucially, the opportunity to make the savings
necessary to provide for looking after the 50,000 offenders a year who
everyone who has spoken agrees should be looked after.</hs_Para>

for Darlington (Jenny Chapman) tells us that there may be savings to be
found in the estates part of the probation budget. I hope she
appreciates that that part of the probation budget involves the
provision of probation facilities and premises. If she is suggesting
closing some, I look forward to seeing a list. I am sure she will
explain to the probation service why it is right to close them. The
Opposition say this can be done without competition, but they do not
say how. They sign up to a reasoned amendment that declines to give the
Bill a Second Reading</hs_Para>

am pleased that this debate has been called to discuss whether the EU
Commission’s proposals for regulating new psychoactive
substances, commonly called legal highs, comply with the principle of
subsidiarity. I am aware that the other place held its own debate on
this issue earlier this evening, following evidence that I
provided to one of its European Sub-Committees on 16 October. I also
note the European Scrutiny Committee’s report on these
proposals, and its questions for the Government. I will be writing to
the Committee with detailed answers to those questions
shortly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T22:44:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311128000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0004.htm#1311128000005">I
am aware of a dangerous perception held by some that since many new
psychoactive substances are legal, they must be safe to consume. This
is absolutely not the case, and while research on these substances is
limited, the number of people who have ingested them and come to harm
demonstrates that doing so is a risky, potentially life-threatening,
activity. There is also no guarantee that what is being sold is
legal—evidence has shown that around 19% of products sold as
legal highs on the internet actually contain controlled
drugs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T22:45:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311128000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0004.htm#1311128000006">The
proposals involve a draft regulation and a draft directive, which
together seek to enhance the EU’s ability to respond to the
threat posed by these substances. We believe the regulation would
require all member states to adopt the same level of control for a
substance that is causing concern at the EU level, within a tiered
framework of low, moderate and severe risk. While a framework for
EU-level risk assessment and control of new psychoactive substances
currently exists, member states can adopt stronger or weaker controls
if they believe this to be appropriate. The directive would expand the
definition of what the EU considers an illicit drug to include new
psychoactive substances classed as severe risk under the new
regulation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T22:46:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311128000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0004.htm#1311128000007">In
recent years, the growing role of these substances in the recreational
drug market has presented policymakers and legislators across the world
with significant challenges. They are generally synthetic drugs,
designed to mimic the effects of drugs listed under the UN conventions
and intended to fall outside the law. They are unlikely to have ever
been tested on humans, and thus their short and long-term effects are
largely unknown. However, the hospitalisations and deaths that have
occurred due to the ingestion of some of these substances makes this a
problem that Governments across the world cannot ignore, and we
certainly do not do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T22:47:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

UK has played a leading role in tackling this threat. Our temporary
drug control orders allow substances causing concern to be banned in a
matter of weeks. Our forensic early warning system provides the latest
intelligence on what substances are available in the UK, and our use of
generic definitions under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971
allows us to ban entire families of substances. These and other
measures have enabled us to ban the majority of such substances seen in
the EU and since 2010 we have banned in excess of
200<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T22:47:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311128000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0004.htm#1311128000009">The
UK has also provided international leadership in this field. We have
sponsored an international early warning system and a platform for
sharing data on this threat via the United Nations Office on Drugs and
Crime, as well as sponsoring two resolutions at the UN on the
identification and reporting of new
drugs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T22:48:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311128000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0004.htm#1311128000010">Any
EU-level action is required to comply with the principle of
subsidiarity, meaning that decisions should be taken as close to EU
citizens as possible. Article 5 of the treaty of the European Union
states that, in areas where it does not have exclusive competence, the
EU should only act if two conditions are met: first, where the
objectives cannot be achieved by member states, and secondly, where
EU-level action can add value by meeting the objectives more
effectively. This Government does not believe, and I do not believe,
that the EU proposals meet these conditions. In our view, the measures
do not comply with the principle of
subsidiarity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T22:48:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311128000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0004.htm#1311128000011">To
explain why, it is necessary to consider the legal base for the draft
regulation. The Commission cites an internal market legal base, on the
premise that there is a substantial
licit—legal—trade in new psychoactive substances which
requires a harmonised regulatory approach. The Government does not
accept this premise, as our experience has overwhelmingly been that
these substances are sold for recreational purposes and are
closely tied to the illegal drugs trade, with only a small handful
having legitimate use in industry. We believe, therefore, that the
regulation should cite a justice and home affairs legal base,
reflecting the illicit nature of the trade.</hs_Para>

I stress that the position I am setting out is influenced not by

me make some progress. On our reading of article 4 of the proposed

measures—this is the point raised by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T22:56:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)—in relation to substances
that are not the subject of EU restrictions. Where the EU has acted,
member states would not be free to impose their own standards. Given
that the new regulation provides for a tiered scheme of restrictions,
it is entirely 
<?notus-xml column=760?>possible that the EU may decide that a measure merits a moderate
restriction, whereas our own scientific evidence and domestic concerns
suggest that it should require a severe restriction, with the ensuing
categorisation under domestic drug control legislation. The reverse, of
course, equally applies. This scenario further demonstrates our belief
that the proposals as they stand are incompatible with subsidiarity, as
member states must have the flexibility to impose the appropriate level
of controls as circumstances within their borders
merit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T22:56:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311128000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0004.htm#1311128000033">Given
the experience since 2005, it is difficult to see how enhancing the
EU’s prerogative in controlling these substances would meet the
second condition of subsidiarity, namely that objectives can be better
achieved at EU rather than member state level. Under the current risk
assessment and control framework, only 13 risk assessments on such
substances have been carried out by the EU since 2005, with nine
substances subsequently coming under EU-wide control. Of these, the UK
had already controlled eight, and we have since controlled the ninth as
well. The control of just nine substances in eight years is woefully
insufficient to keep pace with the fast-moving marketplace. Although
the current proposals would involve an accelerated risk assessment and
control process, that would still be a reactive model in which it would
take time for sufficient evidence of harms to emerge to trigger a risk
assessment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T22:57:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311128000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0004.htm#1311128000034">Furthermore,
the vast majority of these substances seen in Europe in recent years
have already been classed as illegal drugs in the UK. With many other
member states also being well ahead of the EU-level response to this
threat, we simply do not accept that the Commission’s proposals
would add any material value at all to the domestic approaches already
being
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T22:58:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311128000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0004.htm#1311128000035">We

Schengen-building measures, a view which is not to date accepted by the

areas of the Schengen agreement in which the UK participates—and
thus is able to opt out of—that does not necessarily mean we
would exercise that power. The proposals as they currently stand, and
as they develop through negotiation, will be judged on their merits,

proportionality of the

said all that, I readily acknowledge that we have benefited greatly
from the EU-level monitoring and identification systems put in place
for these substances, and support strongly a role for the EU in
facilitating the sharing of information and best practice in responding
to developments. Indeed, I suggest that an enhanced role for
information exchange is where the true value of EU action lies.
However, we do not believe that the current proposals for common
standards in relation to controls on new psychoactive substances are
consistent with the principle of subsidiarity, as sanctions in this
area are best determined by member states responding flexibly to
national circumstances. It is for that reason that I commend this

risk will not be restricted; those deemed a moderate risk will be
prohibited from the consumer market; and the most dangerous drugs will
be prohibited altogether, with a possible exception for medical use. I

drug classification to the EU, and I press the Minister about the

with—one psychoactive substance could form part of a compound
street drug that is far more dangerous. That is a problem for the UK,

That draws attention to a failing of the Government’s response
to legal highs—the failure to address the emergence of regional
drugs, meaning drugs going under a generic street name, but often

can assess only two or three substances a year. It is clear that it
will never be able to keep up with the number of new drugs on the
market, so the UK Drug Policy Commission and others called for a joint
EU-wide laboratory to provide advice and information to relevant
authorities. We support that. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs
and Drug Addiction has long produced lists of new substances that have
always been far ahead of the Home Office’s forensic early
warning system. I have repeatedly asked Ministers why substances that
are identified by the EMCDDA as being on sale in the UK are not

proposal is neither necessary nor desirable. We would like the
Government to be more precise about the consequences of adopting the
directive on the UK’s current system of drug regulation. We do
not want the Government to use tonight’s debate as an excuse to
avoid greater EU co-operation to assess the dangers posed by legal
highs, particularly to our young
people.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_11_PT_1/2F45DFE26B89196DC947A8FE0379A433A96744C4" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 November 2013">Monday

William Cash</B> (Stone) (Con):</Member> We have had an interesting
exchange of views, resulting in the Government and the Opposition
agreeing with the European Scrutiny Committee’s assessment that
there is a breach of the principle of subsidiarity in these matters.
There are two issues: the draft regulation and the draft directive,
both of which have already been described, so there is no need for me
to go into them in detail.</hs_Para>

draft regulation would fetter the flexibility that member states
currently enjoy to determine the level of risk associated with a new
psychoactive substance, and to implement appropriate national control
measures. The draft directive, on the other hand, would require member
states to introduce criminal sanctions for a new psychoactive substance
deemed by the Commission to present a severe health, social and safety
risk.</hs_Para>

draft reasoned opinion concludes that the proposed legislation breaches
the principle of subsidiarity simply because it would fetter member
states’ action to an unacceptable degree. It highlighted the
following concerns: the absence of reliable market information on the
volume 
<?notus-xml column=766?>of trade in new psychoactive substances for legitimate rather than
recreational use; different cultural and societal attitudes towards the
regulation of drugs and new psychoactive substances and the need to
accommodate different regulatory approaches at national level; the
limited scope for unilateral action by a member state when faced with
evidence of social or health harms which exceed the level of risk
identified by the Commission when implementing market restrictions; and
insufficient evidence of disruption to legitimate trade, or
displacement of the harmful effects of the new psychoactive substances,
to warrant market intervention on the scale envisaged in the proposed
measures or the imposition of additional constraints on members
states’ freedom of

reality, however, is that we still have to get a substantial number of

is this Government who have been going and listening to the legalisers.
I suspect that the European Commission is making an attempt over time
to pull together these strands, backed by several senior police
officers in this country, so that they can evaporate the problem of
drugs and say that crime will reduce, because if we legalise lots of
things and do not criminalise others, we will not need to spend as much
money on policing, because crime will be falling all the time. What is
happening with this Government—it is why the Minister has
encouraged this proposal from the EU and now wishes to demolish
it—is an attempt to block legal highs being made into illegal
highs so that crime does not go up, because they are not providing the
police in areas like mine that are disproportionately impacted by the
current legal highs.</hs_Para>

carried out my own public inquiry in Worksop town hall this January
into the question of legal highs, asking the young people, the police,
the health service and others what was going on. It was interesting to
find out that it was not only young people who were taking these
substances. It was also middle-aged people, although not perhaps
elderly people. It was the people who participate in what the
Government call the night-time economy and what I would call pubs with
late licences.
People<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T23:25:10"></hs_TimeCode> are
tanking up at home on cheap alcohol then going out to the pubs and
nightclubs and taking these substances. The owners of the pubs and

alcohol.</hs_Para>

the way, allowing pubs to have late licences was the worst error of the
last Labour Government. My biggest error in this place was not to speak
out and try to alter that policy as it was going through because
applying a city solution to areas like mine was totally inappropriate.
One pub in my area is open till 5 in the morning, but nobody is
drinking beer or spirits; they are allegedly—according to all
the information I have—taking all sorts of substances that the
Government will not deem illegal because they do not want the police to
arrest people, though the police are not there anyway, because the
Government have cut their numbers; and 
<?notus-xml column=768?>there are not even any police cells left in my area
to put people in, and the police community support officers are about
to take over neighbourhood policing. But nobody is being arrested for
using legal highs in the pubs, and of course they are not because the

Julian Huppert</B> (Cambridge) (LD):</Member> I shall try to be

the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John
Mann).<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T23:35:05"></hs_TimeCode> I think
that it was the first speech that I have heard in which someone has

is clear that a huge problem is posed by new psychoactive substances.
As that has been reiterated so many times, I shall not go into it in
detail now, but I will say that the rise in the number of such
substances is partly our fault, because our prohibition-led policy has
made it possible to be sentenced to years in jail for possessing one
tablet of known harm, but to receive no penalty for possessing
something else of unknown harm, which could be far more
serious.</hs_Para>

know that some of the new substances are more harmful than substances
that we have already controlled. Our use of the term “legal
highs” suggests to the public that it is all right to take such
substances, because it implies that they are safer than others. If
ecstasy is a class A drug and another substance is legal, that suggests
that we have made an assessment of the risk, which is deeply
misleading. It flies in the face of any evidence-based policy, but it
also flies in the face of what we all want to do, which is to reduce
the harms from drug use. All substances of this kind, whether legal or
illegal, have harms, and we must try to reduce those
harms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T23:36:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111214000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0004.htm#13111214000012">I
agree with the Minister that the European proposal is not the right one
to adopt, but what is the correct way in which to deal with all these
substances? On the general subject, I follow the Portuguese line. I
think that decriminalisation has worked very well there. Only those on
the far right in politics opposed it originally, and now it is
supported by people throughout the political spectrum and by the police
themselves. The Home Affairs Committee conducted a detailed study of
all the issues, and that was our very clear finding.</hs_Para>

included making the 
<?notus-xml column=771?>sale of caffeine, including coffee, illegal. I do not think that that
was the intention of the new clause, but it illustrates the problems
that arise when we try to ban things. Coffee is a psychoactive
substance. I will not ask how many Members who are present have
consumed some of that psychoactive substance today, but quite a number
will have done so. That illustrates the danger of being extremist and
banning
everything<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-11T23:37:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111214000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0004.htm#13111214000014">What
we should do is adopt an alternative to the European proposal, and
emulate, for example, what has been done in New Zealand. When the New
Zealand Government asked the New Zealand Law Commission to look at
their drug laws—the Select Committee report goes into this in
much more detail—the commission proposed the establishment of an
independent regulatory authority to test substances, so that
manufacturers and importers would have to demonstrate their safety. I
am pleased to see that other members of the Select Committee are
present. We proposed that urgent action should be taken, based on
existing trading standards and consumer protection legislation, to deal
with the sale of untested substances. The onus should be on the person
selling a substance to check that it is safe. That is the right way to
tackle the huge number of new psychoactive

Johnson:</Member></B> Perhaps I could correct the record. The new

exactly the problem that he has raised by building on the work that had
already been done in relation to young people who were sniffing glue. I
believe that it was a Conservative Government who had previously
legislated to put the onus on shopkeepers who sold substances that
could be used for that purpose, and the new clause was intended to put
the onus on the seller in the same way. I take exception to the way in

true to say that we are not seeking to ban substances to reduce police
activity. We have banned 200 such substances in recent times, compared
with just the nine banned by the EU in eight years. So we have been
very active in banning substances in this country. The hon. Gentleman
talks about cuts in the police, but he might reflect on the fact that
crime is down by 10% under this Government since 2010. So that was also
a nonsensical point to make in justifying his case. I agree with him,
however, that people sometimes take legal highs instead of alcohol.
That is a matter that we are dealing with, which is why we have banned
200 substances, or thereabouts, in recent times.

debates in the House are on topics of purely general importance, but
this one specifically concerns two villages in a remote part of my
county of Herefordshire. The issue, however, is of huge importance to
those villages and their residents. Indeed, it would not be too much to
say that it gravely affects their well-being as well as that of a local
school. It also raises a general issue relevant to other village
communities as well as wider questions of fairness and responsibility
that directly concern the Government. For all those reasons, I thank Mr

and Moccas are isolated villages on the western and northern edges of
my constituency. Both are blessed with village halls that are well-used
and well-supported by local people. In early 2011, both communities
were awarded grants from the Big Lottery Fund, which distributes moneys
on behalf of the national lottery, to install solar photovoltaic panels
on their village halls. The motivation in each case, which was clearly
stated throughout the application process, was to claim feed-in tariff
payments to help meet the running costs of the

£9,603, which covered the full value of the works. In spring
2013, however, two years after the original awards, both communities
were told that their eligibility for feed-in tariffs was under threat
as grants from the Big Lottery Fund had been reclassified as state aid.
The communities were presented with two options: to pay back the
funding received from the Big Lottery Fund and continue to claim
feed-in tariffs; or to keep the Big Lottery Fund money and give up any

investigating the matter and that it was for Ofgem, which administers
the scheme, and its licensed suppliers to determine eligibility for

That is to be welcomed but it does not address the underlying problem,
which is that a change in the scheme administered by Ofgem is causing
tangible hardship to the villages. It is even having a negative effect
on a lovely local school. Clifford primary school is located on the
same site as the village hall and was a partner in its solar panel
project. Indeed, the project is a key part of its eco-schools

turn of events was entirely unnecessary. Both hall committees and
Clifford primary school entered the agreements in good faith and, to
put the matter in the kindest light, appear to have been let down by
poor communication somewhere along the line. The question goes deeper,
however, and raises issues of fairness and accountability and of
management within Government. So far, both the Department and Ofgem
have disavowed any responsibility for the mishap. Each has placed
responsibility with the other. My question is simple: who is

is it possible that Moccas and Clifford hall committees were notified
only in spring 2013 of the change in legislation that happened two
years earlier? How can it be right for the Government to have allowed
national lottery funding to be classified as state aid when its moneys
derive from private gambling on the lottery? The question becomes still
more pertinent when one considers that the statutory body is the
National Lottery Commission, which does not give out any money at all.
The lottery is, in effect, a trading name for Camelot, a private
company. Clicking on “About us” on the national lottery

how grants of money raised from private individuals by a private firm

licensed suppliers and parish councils or other grant recipients
notified? How were they notified? Was any effort made to ensure that
they received and understood the notification? Was any attempt made to

struggle to maintain the viability of their village hall. The financial

tariff scheme is intended to replace, not supplement, public grant
schemes as the principal means of incentivising small-scale, low-carbon

subsidise the entire cost of eligible installations, and to provide
investors with a reasonably attractive rate of return of between 4.5%
and 8% a year. For those reasons, and to ensure compliance with
European Union rules on state aid, it is generally not possible for a
generator to benefit from both feed-in tariffs and a grant from a
public body, except in exceptional circumstances, some of which concern
environmental considerations, such as the provision of fish ladders.
That position, together with the various minor exceptions, has been
clearly stated on both the DECC and feed-in tariffs websites since May
2011.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111214000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0004.htm#13111214000068">National

As such, an installation cannot receive feed-in tariff support where
national lottery funding has been accepted in support of purchasing
and/or installing. I am sure my hon. Friend will accept that it is
difficult to justify giving a double subsidy to individuals and
organisations at any time, but particularly in the current fiscal

Government recognise that some communities believed that it was

been working with Ofgem and the lottery to try to find an acceptable
solution for all sides. Recipients of lottery Awards for All grants who
were also claiming feed-in tariffs were given the one-off option of
repaying their grant to the lottery or converting it to a loan. The
latter means that the income from feed-in tariffs could be used to pay
back the loan over time. If the recipient did not take up one of the
two options by 20 September, they faced being suspended from the
feed-in tariff scheme and having their payments stopped. I understand

to him in detail in writing. Let me conclude by outlining some of the
other measures that the Government are taking to support community
renewable energy. My hon. Friend and those in his constituency who have
already gone down this path are fully aware that our transformation to
a low-carbon economy requires a huge national shift in the way we
generate, distribute and buy our energy. By investing in local energy
projects, communities can generate a healthy and stable return to cover
the costs of installing small-scale renewable or low-carbon
technologies. Such an opportunity can help drive local growth,
redevelopment and even jobs at the larger
scale<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T00:03:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111214000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/debtext/131111-0004.htm#13111214000074">Large
low-carbon energy infrastructure, such as nuclear power stations and
offshore wind, play a major role in our energy system. They are an
important part of a diverse energy mix, but they are not a complete
recipe. We also need a society-wide shift involving individuals, local
communities and other organisations. I therefore know that, although my
hon. Friend has been disappointed by the way in which the two
applications have been handled, he will be delighted at the fact that
the number of small-scale energy systems in homes, businesses and
community facilities has leapt from a few thousand to nearly half a
million since the feed-in tariff scheme was introduced in
2010.</hs_Para>

applicants are afforded ample opportunity to establish the reasons they
fear persecution, including where that fear is based on the grounds of
their sexuality. Asylum decision makers are trained to make sensitive
and appropriate enquiries to explore the sexual orientation of an
applicant where that is relevant to a claim. But the Home Office does
not require evidence of an explicit nature to support asylum claims

made by all agencies, including the police and the Crown Prosecution

response to child sexual exploitation in April 2013. The National
Policing lead has developed a further plan of action for the police to
tackle child sexual exploitation which sets out measures all forces
need to take to effectively tackle this issue. This plan has been
published on the Association of Chief Police Officers website. The
College of Policing and the Director of Private Prosecutions launched a
public consultation on revised guidance for sexual violence victims on
11 June which ran until September. The new guidance is designed to
ensure that victims are listened to, and that consideration by the
police and others should focus on the credibility of the allegation,
rather than the credibility of the victim.</hs_Para>

Difference (CfD) will reduce barriers to the UK energy market for
independent renewable generators by reducing long-term price risk from
the generator. Reducing this risk will make it easier to provide
long-term contracts for independent generators' power. Under the CfD,
when buying power, companies will not need to provide a 'price floor'
to generators and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) will not need to
cover generators' Renewable Obligation Certificates so the contracts
will become simpler. This will make it easier for a wider range of
companies to offer PPAs, improving competition and encouraging new
entrants to the market, which should provide a better deal for
independent renewable generators. We are also working with stakeholders
to prepare the market for the introduction of the CrD, by considering
contracting approaches and a code of practice for the PPA market which

public sector bodies within the National Accounts. As there are
frequent changes in the names and number of bodies within the public

employment associated with the public sector organisations which have
been reclassified to the private sector between October 2012 and
October 2013 is less than 2,000 employees. Jobs may have transferred
from public sector organisations to the private sector for reasons

by investigating all complaints made about employers suspected of not
paying the minimum wage, in addition carrying out targeted enforcement

ensure a flexible response to eRGF awards which are urgent, exceptional
cases, they are funded from existing Regional Growth Fund (RGF)
budgets, rather than through a separate allocation. This funding is
available either because a previously selected bidder has withdrawn
their project, or because during the award negotiation, both parties
agree to a lower RGF offer than was originally requested. In both

million to programmes and projects to date. The pace of drawing down
Government funding is dictated by a beneficiary's needs. Companies do
not need the money in their bank accounts in order for an RGF offer to
make a difference—just having our support can be enough to get
projects started and to trigger private investment that also drives up
employment. Many projects have been able to start work as soon as they
received confirmation of RGF funding. RGF money paid to beneficiaries
has generated £1.12 billion of private sector investment to

available in regard to betting shops. Where there are permitted
development rights to allow change of use a local planning authority
can consult on and make an article 4 direction where there is an
adverse impact on local amenity. For example, the London borough of
Barking and Dagenham has been consulting on an Article 4 Direction and
associated supplementary planning guidance to address the proliferation
of betting shops in the local area. A betting shop must comply with its
licensing conditions, and where they are breached the local licensing
authority has powers to intervene including removing the licence to
operate.</hs_Para>

inspectors to check carefully that local authorities have made an

collectable from ratepayers in the Barrow in Furness borough council
area in respect of each of the last five years are shown in the
following table. The figures shown are the amount the authority would
have collected in the year if everyone liable for non-domestic rates in
that year had paid. This includes not only those who are liable to pay
for the whole year but also those who are liable to pay for part of the
year and takes account of the amount of relief

further year—making three and a half years in total—so
that the higher level of relief will apply throughout 2013-14;
announced a new measure which will mean that empty new builds will be
exempt from empty property rates for up to 18 months up to state aid

Lamb:</Member></B> The Government believes that falls prevention
strategies are best developed locally so as to reflect the needs of
local communities and to make best use of local infrastructure,
expertise and other assets. Local authorities would take the lead in
commissioning services to support falls prevention, working in
partnership with local clinical commissioning groups, general
practitioner practices and acute hospitals, and as an integral part of
the health and well-being strategies overseen by local health and
well-being
boards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311124000288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/text/131111w0003.htm#1311124000288">The
Department has strengthened the power and responsibility of local
authorities by extending their remit to public health and by providing
a total of £5.46 billion of ring-fenced funding over

Department has also made provision to go further by introducing a duty

peripheral fractures among older people living in the community. The
Prevention of Fall Injury Trial is funded by the NIHR Health Technology
Assessment programme and the report of the trial is expected to be
published in March 2016. The trial is sufficiently large to determine
whether falls prevention can reduce fractures, not simply falls, and to
provide insight into approaches which are most effective,
cost-effective and acceptable to the population, it will provide
answers that can be used by primary care practices to determine how
they best advise and refer patients who are at risk of falling, but may
not yet have had a

because there is no method to link fathers and their offspring in an

the fact that there is only very rarely an entry in a father's medical

This has been provided according to NICE's classification of appraisal

material effect on the use of a drug or technology, and it is
recommended for a smaller subset of patients than originally stated by
the marketing authorisation. This test of materiality takes into
account advice from clinical experts on the anticipated use of the
technology in routine clinical

framework of support in place for parent-carers of disabled children.
There already exists legislation to assess parent-carers' needs within
the Children Act 1989 in so far as it meets the needs of individual
children in need. Local authorities can provide services to the family
members of a child in need with a view to safeguarding or promoting the
child's welfare. Unlike for young carers, where the Government has
tabled an amendment to the Children and Families Bill, there is a lack
of evidence for the need to change the way support is provided.
Amending the Children Act 1989 to assess the needs of parent-carers
separately from children would risk the needs of the children becoming
second to those of their
parent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311124000669" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131111/text/131111w0004.htm#1311124000669">Government

each winter season (31 March). Expert advice is sought from the Met
Office and changes made where appropriate before the start of the next
winter period. As well as reviewing the structural parts of the scheme,
we also consider representations made during the previous winter about
the suitability of individual weather stations and the links with
postcode districts. We will be reviewing the coverage of weather
stations in consultation with the Met Office again in the summer.
Individual Members' comments, such as whether there is a need for a
weather station at Arfon, will form part of that review. Following
completion of the review, Members will be informed of the outcome
separately, in writing.</hs_Para>
