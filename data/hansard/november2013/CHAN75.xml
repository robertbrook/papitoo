Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Jeremy
Wright):</Member></B> The Government should manage the prison estate in
the most efficient and effective manner. As my hon. Friend is well
aware, Wellingborough prison closed in December last year. Since then,
we have looked carefully at whether the site should form part of our
long-term capacity plans, and we have concluded that it should not. It
is therefore in the taxpayer’s interest to avoid unnecessary
holding costs and to dispose of the site.</hs_Para>

Bone:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his response, but he is
completely and utterly wrong. Wellingborough prison is on a brownfield
site, and there is massive room for expansion. People want an expanded
prison there, and millions of pounds have been invested in the prison.

disastrous mistake?</hs_Para>

indeed, I am scheduled to do so on Monday next week. I look forward to
discussing this with my hon. Friend in more detail. I am afraid that I
do not accept that this was the wrong decision—we will discuss
it in more detail on Monday—but the original decision to close
the prison, as he knows, was based on the fact that substantial
financial investment would be needed to bring it up to the required
standard. The decision not to retain the site was, as I say, made after
careful consideration.

Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone) on his
energetic campaign to save Wellingborough prison, may I gently suggest
to the Minister that Government papers must have become muddled on this
prison, because it is extremely cost-effective? It has one of the
lowest costs per prisoner across the prison estate. The Minister says
that lots of money is needed to improve the site but, having gone round
it myself, I simply do not think that that is the case. May I urge him

Wright:</Member></B> First, I agree entirely with my hon.
Friend that our hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone) has
done a first-class job in advocating for his constituents, as he always
does. That is his job, but my job is to look at the prison estate
across the country. I am afraid that my hon. Friend the Member for
Kettering (Mr Hollobone) is not correct about the costs of running a
prison, which are made up of several components, and a significant one
is the cost of maintenance and the cost of maintaining accommodation
standards. On our estimates, it would cost £50 million to bring
that up to standard, which is why we concluded that it was right to
close the prison. There is a separate consideration about whether it is
right to retain the site, but for reasons that I have explained we have
decided that it not the right thing to do.</hs_Para>

Wright:</Member></B> I can reassure the right hon. Gentleman that we
are nowhere near requiring the provisions of Operation Safeguard. I
have to remind him that his Government needed to use Operation
Safeguard which, for those who do not know, is about using police cells
because we have run out of prison cells. Not only did the previous
Government need to do that but they had to let people out early because
they so mismanaged the prison population. It takes some cheek for him

According to the Mayor, the reason for the cut in London is that the
Justice Secretary has decided to use a formula based solely on
population, while failing to take into account crime levels and the
number of victims in police force areas. That means that London loses
more than £3 million a year, according to the Mayor of London.

areas, including accident and emergency departments, NHS 111 centres
and other emergency telephone services, ambulances, minor injury units,
and urgent care centres. The review is being led by Professor Sir Bruce

commissioning guidance and demonstrator sites. Another progress report

on changing services are made at a local level by commissioners and
providers, in consultation with all interested parties. That is exactly
as it should be, as only then can the system be responsive to local
needs. It is vital to ensure that both urgent and emergency care and
the wider health and care system remain sustainable and readily
understandable to patients. A and E performance levels have largely
been maintained, thanks to the expertise and dedication of NHS staff. A
and E departments see 95% of patients within four hours, and the figure
has not dropped below the 95% target since the end of April. However,
urgent and emergency care is falling behind the public’s needs
and expectations.</hs_Para>

number of people going to A and E departments has risen historically,
not least because of an ageing population. A million more people are
coming through the doors than in 2010. Winter inevitably challenges the
system further, which is why we are supporting the most under-pressure
A and Es with an additional £250 million. Planning has started
earlier than ever this year,

Friend for his local hospital, despite the incredible tragedies and
difficulties that it has been through and the pressures that has
created for the people of Stafford. He is absolutely right: if we are
going to solve the problem, we must consider the system holistically
and consider how different A and E departments can specialise services.
We need much more of a hub-and-spoke system, rather than one where
every A and E has to offer exactly the same menu of services. If we do

it not the case that at the heart of the Government’s NHS

patients—to the producers of services? When the

producers”, it is not surprising that services have been
reorganised in a way that does not benefit patients. May I suggest that

to spend more money out of hospitals, which means finding efficiency
savings in hospitals. We do not want to duck those challenges, which is

We have cut mortality rates by 20% as the result of a strategy to

eloquently. Under the previous Government, we had a top-down,

happened. There are very few firsts in this place; most things have
happened before at some stage or another. I am not sure that it is
within my bailiwick to insist upon the deposit of the report today, as
the hon. Gentleman rather earnestly beseeches me to do. I hope that he
will not take offence when I say that he is rarely satisfied about
anything. He is an experienced parliamentary hand and he knows that
Members apply for permission to put urgent questions, and it is for the
Speaker to decide whether to grant the urgent question. I did grant the
urgent question, which carries its own message about my sense that it
was important that the issue should be aired in the Chamber today. The
hon. Gentleman took part, I believe, in the exercise, and I think we
will leave it there for
today.</hs_Para><hs_2cBillTitle UID="13111276000002" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/debtext/131112-0001.htm#13111276000002">

basements as vast subterranean pleasure palaces. Some people call them

incidents arising from these excavations are, thankfully, still rare,

damning verdict on the lack of safety in building sites across west
London neighbourhoods where downward extensions were taking place. In
April, the HSE reported that one in three of these luxury bunkers is
being built with reckless disregard to the safety of the builders. It
made unannounced visits to 110 domestic basement extension sites in the
capital in March. It served 50 prohibition notices and
stopped work at 34 sites. Poor excavation or structural support was
found to be a recurrent problem, along with unsafe working at height,
which is perhaps ironic for sites below ground level. The inspectors
also visited 291 other sites during their month-long blitz, and of
those 59 failed to meet approved safety standards—a failure rate

seems to be that the policy is pernicious and evil when it affects

private tenants. There are two coherent positions: one is the
Government position that asks anyone on benefits to contribute towards
the cost of an extra bedroom, and the other is to state that anyone on
benefits will receive housing benefit, regardless of the size of house
they need; that would cost a lot of money but it would be coherent. The
Labour party’s position is incoherent. It states that social
tenants should not have to pay towards an extra bedroom, but that
private tenants should. We have heard cases of people who need extra
bedrooms, for example for dialysis machines. Social tenants need an

The problem is that people in the private rented sector were not

flexibility of the housing market because to hear Labour Members one
would imagine the market was static. When they talk about the
availability of one-bedroom properties—someone said a moment ago
that there were 10 available or something—those are empty
one-bedroom properties. If one looks, for example, at social housing
swap websites, significant numbers of social tenants are looking to
free-up small properties and exchange with those looking for
family-sized accommodation. There is plenty of evidence of fluidity.

overcrowding, because strangely that was an omission from the Labour
motion. It is almost as if the voice of the overcrowded has not been
heard. To give him a sense of scale, based on the English house
condition survey we estimate that more than a quarter of a million
households in social accommodation are overcrowded. Census data, which
offer a different definition, suggest there are getting on for 400,000
overcrowded households. The research the Government are undertaking as
the policy is rolled out will monitor the extent to which people are
trading down and moving from overcrowded accommodation, and the extent
to which they take jobs, take in lodgers or use discretionary housing
payments. People can respond to the policy in a whole raft of ways, but

me address the amendment, because the shadow Secretary of State did not

context of the debate is a deficit in 2009-10 in excess of
£150 billion a year. The previous Government were
spending £4 for every £3 they raised in taxes—that
was not investment for the long term, but borrowing money to pay
today’s bills. There is nothing progressive or fair about asking
our children to pay the costs of current spending to benefit ourselves.

deficit was £150 billion. How can we address that? The biggest
area of public spending is the Department for Work and Pensions. More
than half of that budget goes on pensioners and pensioner-related
benefits, which we had pledged to protect. That meant that a very
substantial budget—the working-age welfare budget—had to
be addressed. The biggest income-related benefit is housing benefit.
The biggest group of housing benefit recipients comprises social
tenants. We are told that Labour party would have sought to address the
budget deficit, but if we are looking to do so, housing benefit for
social tenants must be looked at. If we have to make savings in that,
where do we do it? We look at spare rooms in the social housing

some people legitimately have a need for an additional room or should
not be asked to move. The issue of adapted accommodation was raised. We
could have dealt with adapted accommodation in two ways. First, we
could have written in a long, complicated statutory instrument what is
and is not adapted accommodation. Clearly, just a hand rail would not
constitute adapted accommodation and a whole extension probably would,
but what about the properties in the middle? Given that there are often
no records of how much has been spent on adaptation, trying to write
that into the law of the land would not have been an effective way to

me address the issue directly to respond to the hon. Lady’s

to £180 million. That money is what we might call
hard cash for hard cases—the cases to which hon. Members have
referred. I say this sincerely to hon. Members: those who raise
individual cases should be holding their local authorities to account.
The Government have given local authorities the money to help people in
need. In fact, we have gone further. Within year, we have allocated an
extra £20 million for local authorities to bid for. If they have
exhausted, or if they anticipate exhausting, their discretionary
housing payments budgets, they can come to the Government for a top-up.

if the Government do not accept Labour’s proposal to scrap the
tax—I always live in hope—they must extend the
exemptions. I shall propose just two very modest ones that they should
accept, if only because, given how they have been shouting this
afternoon, their Back Benchers obviously think these things are
exempted already. The first exemption should apply to homes
specifically adapted for disabled families, about which I really do not
accept the Minister’s argument: this is a man who thinks that he
will change the whole pensions system in Great Britain, yet he is not
clever enough to come up with a definition of an adapted home. I
don’t think so!
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T14:31:22"></hs_TimeCode>The second
exemption is for situations where it is unreasonable to expect a couple

the first exemption, it is incredibly difficult and expensive for
someone who needs adaptations to their house to move. Council tax
regulations recognise that people who need extra room because of a
disability pay council tax on a lower band, so it is ridiculous that
this space requirement is not recognised in housing benefit
regulations. I know from personal experience how difficult it is to
find suitable housing and how long adaptations take to make, and this
is an exemption that the Government could easily
include<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T14:32:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111276000507" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/debtext/131112-0002.htm#13111276000507">On
the second exemption, whoever in government thought it acceptable to
expect a couple, one of whom is disabled, to share a bedroom clearly
has no idea of the size of the average council house bedroom. It is
certainly not big enough for a hospital bed, possibly some lifting
equipment and a second bed for the other person, and such an
arrangement would not give a good night’s sleep to
someone who might also have an important caring role. Discretionary
housing payment is not a solution. It is meant to be
transitional—to get people from where they are now to where the
Government want them to be —whereas the situations that I am
describing are permanent.</hs_Para>

could talk about disabled children, but those two situations should
certainly be exempted, and those people should not have to apply year
on year either. No matter how much money is made available, it is wrong
that they must apply for a discretionary payment, and the word
“discretionary” is the key, because it means that they
will not necessarily get the money. If Ministers do not accept the need
to get rid of this measure, at least they could extend the exemptions;
these modest measures would not cost more either, if what the
Government say is right, because these people are already getting
discretionary housing payments.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T14:33:49"></hs_TimeCode>The exemptions
would alleviate a great deal of anxiety and make this appalling measure

abolished.</hs_Para>

social housing, as the Minister said, it would be wrong to expect
thousands of homes to sit empty waiting for people to move in. I took
up such a case in my own constituency recently. The local council said
that it was not getting as much new homes bonus as it had expected, and
I wondered whether that was because Suffolk, thought to be prosperous,
was missing out. We looked into it and discovered that 120 of the homes
sitting empty belonged to the local housing association. I found that
extraordinary. So we brought the association in to find out what was
being done to maximise the use of those houses—whether they were
one, two or three-bedroom homes. Not only will Flagship have to pay
more money council tax, if those homes are not used, because we have
allowed councils to charge 100% for empty homes after a certain time,

homes

BBC Wales report earlier this year found four local authorities in
Wales, including Monmouthshire, had no one-bedroom properties at all.
In Wales, Shelter Cymru has argued that the chronic shortage of one and
two-bedroom properties will drive many households into the private
rented sector, where the local housing allowance for smaller
two-bedroom properties outstrips the rents of three-bedroom social
property. The difference is as much as 46% across Wales, and in Newport

people affected by the spare room subsidy. I went along and heard some
very interesting stories. I met a lady in her late 50s who had worked
her entire life. Her family had left and she lived on her own in a
house with too many bedrooms. She was going to have to move. Having
been made redundant, she had gone out and got herself another job in an
area where it was difficult to do that. I had a great deal of respect
for that lady, and I still do. I feel sorry for her. I think one would
have to have a heart of stone not to feel sorry for somebody in that

looking after millions of people and that system then changes, there

took me to meet three groups of people, whom it had chosen. The second
lady whom I met was looking after four children. They were not her own
children; she was their grandmother. The mother, because she was not
the main carer for the children, was going to lose out on housing. What
those people wanted were two large houses to look after the same
family. While I felt sorry for everyone involved, including the
children, I have to say that the state is not there to provide not one,
but two sets of very large houses for people with large numbers of
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T15:01:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111276000582" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/debtext/131112-0002.htm#13111276000582">Another
question arose while I was meeting that lady, and it is a frank
question. I never use the term “single mother” because I
think that it is pejorative, and it has affected people in my own

hesitation in talking about feckless fathers. Those children had been

having to give up other essentials as a result. As others have pointed

not be subject to the bedroom tax but who are nervous of taking the

children’s schooling, their church, and their social and family
networks—from everything—and go to alien places. Even in
Cornwall there are places which many Cornish folk would find alien to
them. That is the only option for them, however, other than having to
face extremely penal charges in order to carry on living in their
current home.</hs_Para>

was involved in building affordable homes for local people before I was
elected to this place. We tried to introduce new schemes with
sufficient three and four-bedroom accommodation to ensure that the
community would in future have the flexibility to meet the range of
needs that might arise. That was important because these properties
would be available for decades. This tax will discourage housing
associations and others who want to build housing in years to come from
making sure they build a broad range of properties and thereby provide
the flexibility to meet future needs. They will instead build smaller
properties, which will result in increased overcrowding in future. If
we go in that direction, we will end up with further ghettos. The
ghettos of the future will be built as a result of this policy. That
will be the consequence of going forward on this basis. If this

from the Front and Back Benches, we have heard arguments against the
bedroom tax, all of which were predicted and laid out by the Government
in their impact statement. The impact statement made it clear that if
this policy worked, in so far as it allowed people to downsize and
their properties to be occupied by 
<?notus-xml column=864?>other social tenants, it would not save money, and that savings would
come about only if the policy did not work. Contrary to the statements

impact statement showed that an estimated one in three of those
affected would go into arrears. The Government knew that arrears were
the likely consequence of this policy, and that is what we have seen.
What we have not heard is another truth, which is that two thirds of
those people affected by the bedroom tax are also affected by the
Government’s cuts in council tax benefit. Out of their very low
incomes of £75 or £105 a week they are having to make a
contribution of £14, or in some cases £20-plus, for their
bedroom tax and their council

Buck:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I was about to
make that point. The impact assessment also told us—as has been
mentioned already this afternoon—that the distribution of
properties across the country does not match the two objectives of
downsizing and dealing with overcrowding. In the north-west, in
Yorkshire, 43% of social tenants are affected by the bedroom tax, and I
think the figure is worse in Wales. That is more than double the rate
for London, yet it is London that has the most serious problem of
overcrowding: one in six properties is overcrowded. So the policy is
predicated not just on people moving from one property to another in
their neighbourhood or community, which might have some sense to it,
but on people moving from one part of the country to another, from one
end of the country to another. Frankly, that is not how people live.
People are not sticks of wood. People are not crates of dry goods that
can be put in a container and taken from London to Liverpool or Wales,
because that is how the distribution of property suits their
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T15:48:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

of the impacts of this and other housing and welfare policies impacting
detrimentally on seaside towns, in the say way as happened in the 1980s
and 1990s. But the fact is that this policy simply cannot achieve the
objective of tackling overcrowding because the larger properties are in
the wrong place, and the numbers demonstrate that. It will work only if
people do something that they do not want to do, which is to leave
their homes, communities, networks, grandchildren, and
families—to leave the people for whom they provide

is also why those Government Members who have repeatedly made the

a lot of sentimentality connected with my home… because I lived
here with my brother, who sadly passed away… This is my last
link to him and I really couldn’t envisage living anywhere else.
I’m feeling increasingly fatalistic and helpless and my thoughts

lower rate that was increased gradually over the years as additional

Williams:</Member></B> The hon. Lady makes a telling point and the
group in Gwynedd is certainly concerned about that. It goes to the very
heart of the cash-limited nature of the fund, which is something that I
objected to when the social fund was introduced: it pitted one payment
against another, bringing an element of competition to something that
should be there to fulfil people’s basic needs, and that is one
reason why I object to this policy. I hope there will be no evictions
and that the Minister will clear up uncertainty about the fund’s
future.</hs_Para>

like to hear those on the Labour Front Bench pledge to adopt a
“no evictions” policy—the subject of my
amendment—where they have the power to do so. Labour’s
policy of abolishing the bedroom tax will not come into force until at
least 2015, should it win the general election. However, Labour is in
power in 77 councils, and the Welsh Labour Government
have power to adopt a “no evictions” policy
with immediate effect.</hs_Para>

serious about scrapping the bedroom tax, it should also be serious
about preventing the worst effect it can have on tenants. For me, that
is particularly true for the Welsh Government, where the Welsh First
Minister has the power to stop evictions. For example, Labour in
Rhondda Cynon Taf voted with Plaid Cymru for such a policy. The
Scottish National party in Scotland has pre-eviction procedures, and I
understand that Labour colleagues in the Scottish Parliament are
proposing a Bill to bring in a “no evictions”
policy—I think they are; possibly they are not.

Members have been talking all afternoon about the private rented
sector. It is important to understand the difference between sectors,
and it is clear that some people do not. The method for calculating
housing benefit in the private rented sector is local housing
allowance, which is entirely different. It is a fixed allowance paid
depending upon household size and circumstances, with no reference to
the size of home occupied. A tenant can choose to use the fixed
allowance to under-occupy a larger home in a lower value area without
any reduction in benefit. Rents in the private rented sector are not
regulated. It is necessary to impose tighter benefit restrictions to
curb excessive market rents. Social rents are regulated and are

Labour party would hand out £500 million of taxpayers’
money while presiding, as it did, over record low levels of housing
development. It failed to provide the housing needed during its term of
office, and this Government are now trying to turn that around after
many years of neglect. The last Government allowed social rents to
increase, knowing that housing benefit would pick up the costs for the
vast majority of tenants: about 80% of tenants were receiving the
maximum housing benefit. That is fine while people are fully occupying
those properties—they will be in need, because they will have
been assessed as being in need—but once they are under-occupying
those properties, it becomes right and proper for Governments and
councils to say, “It is time for you to move on and for a family

someone challenged the position in the private sector. On average, home
owners occupy their property for seven years before choosing to move
on, but of course some people fall on hard times and have to sell their
property in a rush or lose everything when they lose their job or
become disabled. We have to have sympathy and ensure supply for those
people across the board. In the private rented sector, on the other
hand, we need longer tenancies, because currently they are often for
six months or less. Clearly, however, we need some equalisation between
the private and social rented sectors.</hs_Para>

on. That is the right sort of approach. There should be a carrot and
stick approach. If someone chooses to under-occupy, they will get less
benefit. If they choose to occupy a property that they no longer need,

inadequate. It is wrong when, according to the Local Government

pensioner living in a four-bedroom property brought that home very
clearly to me. The council is giving priority for a move locally not to
people like her, although that would be logical, but to people who are
hit by the benefit cut of the bedroom tax, because it is only right
that those people should be given priority, to protect them from the

have heard about the other perverse consequence—the extent to

there is of it is too expensive. The only way meaningfully to reduce

did not happen on the watch of the previous Government, but it is
happening at least in part on this Government’s watch. Although

must be right, at a time of acute overcrowding co-existing with a great

Government to take action to encourage change. A broad policy of this
sort will inevitably throw up real-life difficulties when applied in
the particular, but the Government have been very careful to deal with
as many of them as possible and have made many exceptions to the
general rule. They have also made substantial amounts of money
available through discretionary housing payment to ease the transition

that does not mean it is not fair in principle and that it is not
necessary. In this case, it is both, and I will certainly vote for the

disabled adult and requires around-the-clock care, including overnight

he is not the tenant of the property. Therefore, they are subject to
the bedroom tax. After many weeks and months of anxious worrying,
Elizabeth finally, after my intervention, was awarded the discretionary
housing money. However, this does not take away from the fact that she
is not sure what is going to happen next year or the year after that.
That is the kind of anxiety people are facing. On the discretionary

Government Members have talked about how it deals with overcrowding and

introduced, because all the slack of 
<?notus-xml column=881?>available property is being taken up by people doing housing swaps. The
only properties becoming available are two-bedroom properties in blocks
of flats, which are unsuitable for families with children. So those
properties are going to people in band 5—people who are not most

if the Government had done a little more research, analysis and

some of these knock-on consequences. Labour Members are all for looking
at how we can deal with some of the issues relating to under-occupancy

nothing to address that—in fact, it does quite the opposite. We
need a long-term strategy bringing together the housing associations,
other policy makers and tenants to work out how we can best use a
carrot and stick approach to deal with under-occupancy. What we have
from this Government is a morally corrupt policy that does not work and

Rotheram</B> (Liverpool, Walton) (Lab):</Member> In the lead up to the
2010 general election and in a desperate attempt to detoxify the brand,
two words were bandied about to persuade the electorate that there
would be a different kind of Tory if the Conservatives were elected.
Those two words were “compassionate conservatism”,
whatever that is. Wolves in sheep’s clothing—that is what
I call it. No one standing on a Tory ticket in the next general
election should be in any doubt whatsoever that once again it will be
two words that will define their heartless brand of ideological
politics—“bedroom tax”.</hs_Para>

to the Prime Minister’s mantra that we are all in this together?
What happened to the Chancellor’s claim that he would not
balance the Budget on the backs of ordinary people? Whatever happened
to big society? Almost two thirds of those affected by the bedroom tax
in my part of the world are disabled—that is 21,000 people hit
the hardest while millionaires get tens of thousands of pounds every
year in a Tory tax bung. Before the inevitable accusations of being
feckless or unemployable are levelled against any of my constituents by
Members such as the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T. C. Davies),
whose rant should be videoed and played to anyone who doubts that it is
the same old Tories, let me point out that 6,000 people on Merseyside
who are now in rental arrears had never missed a payment in their life
until the coalition’s welfare changes. The majority of those
clobbered by this Con-Dem con trick are ordinary working people on low
wages. This is entirely a Tory and Lib Dem-manufactured hardship
imposed on those who need help the most, driven not by fiscal
constraints but by political dogma.</hs_Para>

Mearns:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right that there is a
significant impact on housing associations. The Home Group, a large
housing association that has many properties in my borough of Gateshead
and thousands of properties across the north of England, has seen a 53%
increase in arrears in the past 12 months, mainly as a result of the
bedroom tax.</hs_Para>

Rotheram:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right. In areas such as
Liverpool and other major UK cities, rent arrears have
increased dramatically, which means that housing associations have to
find a way to combat the decrease in income while, at the same time,
they are expected to commit to building more one and two-bedroom
houses. That has the potential to affect their asset base and their
ability to borrow money to build those houses.</hs_Para>

colleagues have mentioned this—this is a policy that will cost
the Exchequer more than any potential savings. On Merseyside, housing
demand is inversely proportionate to supply. As a consequence of not
having enough of the right housing type it is virtually impossible for
people caught in the bedroom tax trap to move into suitable social
housing, so they are forced to consider renting in the private sector,
even if that costs more than staying in their existing property and
even if no one wants to move into the house that they are kicked out
of. It is the economics of the madhouse, and it is our neighbourhoods
that are suffering, decimated by a reckless and irresponsible
Government inflicting poverty, creating urban blight and breaking up
established communities. They are carrying out Thatcher’s legacy
by causing instability that destroys the very fabric of society on
which established communities are
built<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T16:59:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111276000855" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/debtext/131112-0003.htm#13111276000855">My
final area of contention is the social engineering that this Government
are imposing on the poorest areas. Moving house may mean kids moving
school, as has been mentioned, but it is also about families moving
doctor and dentist, and mothers and older children who used to live
within walking distance having to travel many miles to see each other.
Many families have been forced out of the homes that were theirs for
many decades. If they had been paying a mortgage instead of rent, which
they could have done, they would have owned the property outright by
now. For many they are homes, not houses. Hard-working families have
been penalised simply because they could not afford a deposit. Surely
that is not what is meant by “compassionate
conservatism”—an oxymoron that will be consigned to the
annals of political history alongside “Lib Dem
principles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T17:00:56"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111276000856" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/debtext/131112-0003.htm#13111276000856">Be

does somebody who is told to go out and work in order to pay for that

that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T17:02:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111276000859" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/debtext/131112-0003.htm#13111276000859">The
debate has illustrated the cultural divide that exists between this
Government and Labour. On one side there is an attitude of
responsibility and holding welfare reform to account, and on the other
there is a continuing concept of offering welfare as a lifestyle
choice. That is no longer possible. After 13 years of Labour the cost
of housing benefit doubled to £21 billion. That is
unacceptable. The cost to taxpayers was £900 per household. The
system was getting out of control. There was no house building
programme, leading to overcrowded accommodation, and there was no
management of the housing stock, which left some families receiving

accept that a doubling of housing benefit to £21 billion is
accounted for by the private sector alone. There are other aspects,
such as the type of housing we are building. We were building the wrong
type of houses—60% of new houses built needed to be for single
occupancy, but only 30% were. That is Labour’s legacy. It raises
the fundamental question of today’s debate: in these financially
tough times, should those on housing benefit be allowed to stay in
accommodation with more bedrooms than they really need? This Government
say no and Labour says yes, even though it said no in 2008 when we had

clear that Labour still has not learned from its mistakes. In the last
eight years of government, Labour lived beyond its means. In 2002-03,
it spent £26 billion beyond its means. Four years later that
rose to £33 billion. In its final year of office, the
deficit rose to £156 billion. That always
accumulates, which means that by 2010 when 
<?notus-xml column=886?>Labour departed office we had a debt of more than three quarters of a
trillion pounds. Where are these benefits that Opposition Members
endorse? Where will that money come from? To date, Labour has refused
to support a single reform to the benefit system put forward by the
Government. Aside from failing to recognise, first, the need for reform
of our complex system, and secondly, the consequences to society in
promoting a something-for-nothing culture, Labour has voted against
£83 billion-worth of welfare savings introduced by the
Government, proving that it has yet to learn the lessons of the
past.</hs_Para>

owes the taxpayer an explanation as to how it would afford to keep its
complex, costly and broken benefit system in place. The challenge is
simple. Thanks to the housing shortage, created under Labour, some
400,000 people are in overcrowded housing. Yet there are almost 1
million spare rooms throughout the UK paid for by the taxpayer at a
cost of around £0.5 billion a year. This policy better matches
our housing stock, but also protects the most vulnerable, such as
pensioners, those in foster care, disabled children and those requiring
overnight care. They are all exempt, as indeed are those who have

affected by the policy, as others have made clear, who are living in
larger than necessary housing have four choices. First, they can
participate in a house swap scheme, which has not really been embraced
by all councils. Secondly, they can pay the reduction in housing
benefit, which equates to about £14 a week for a room. Thirdly,
they can sub-let that room. Finally, they could apply for the hardship
scheme, and a couple examples have been given of that. I am pleased to
hear the announcement today that if councils run out of that hardship
funding, they can apply for more. That is a message that needs to be

best they can to bring up their families after relationships break

the needs of children do not appear to have been taken into account at
any level whatsoever. How can we say to a child who has been used to
living with their mother but going to stay with their father at
weekends or during the holidays, “You’re no longer
entitled to sleep in a proper bed when you visit.” That is the
result of this iniquitous bedroom tax. I wrote to Ministers about that
and received a response that seemed completely out of touch with the

been perfectly well adapted and move them to an area where they will
not necessarily have the same care and support systems in place simply

my parents were born in Birmingham council houses, so I understand the
importance of social housing and that there is a value in security of

people are evicted from their family houses for under-occupying,
perhaps because their parents have died. That is sad. However, we find
ourselves in a society with problems. A lot of families live in
overcrowded conditions. Those people come to see me and I cannot just
ignore them. It is not a bedroom tax; it is a bedroom rent. People are
paying rent for the spare bedroom. If somebody buys a house and it has
an extra bedroom, they pay for it. If somebody rents a property, they
pay the rent for the property. If they have a property in the private
sector and they are on housing benefit, the local housing allowance
sets limits based on the number of

Labour party in government recognised that there was a problem with
pressure on housing. We cannot suddenly magic up 1 million more rooms
overnight. The reason there was not a lot of pain when the local
housing allowance was introduced is that it did not affect anyone who
was already on housing benefit; it only affected new claims.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T17:16:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Westminster North (Ms Buck) was very good on that point. To be
fair, if we applied the same approach now, or had done so back in
April, so that this did not affect anyone until they got a new tenancy,
nobody would really bother about it. The problem with that is that we
have a deficit. <I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> Labour Members

cannot move if there are housing arrears. We had a case like that in
Birmingham before the bedroom rent was introduced. People knew
beforehand that it was coming in, so they planned for it and arranged

the number of those on the islands who are suffering from the bedroom

I say that the reality in the Hebrides has always been difficult.
Indeed, I was 17 years old before I first crossed the sound
of Barra to South Uist. In fact, I spent two years in school in Lewis
before I went to South Uist. Communities are distinct and far away from

to place on the islands. I once flew to Stornoway and beside me on the
plane was Michael MacKinnon, an elderly gentleman from the island of
Vatersay who has since sadly passed on. He was travelling to a hospital
appointment and I asked him by way of conversation—in Gaelic, of
course—when he had last been to Stornoway. He said it was his
first time and, had it not been for his hospital appointment, he would
have been very much looking forward to it. I was surprised. Michael was
a well-travelled merchant seaman. I said to him, “I suppose
you’ve been all over the world, Michael.”
“Yes,” he said, “I’ve been to Pitcairn
island in the middle of the Pacific 13 times, but not to the other end
of the Hebrides.” One thing I can say for Pitcairn island is
that it does not have the bedroom tax, although perhaps the Government

that 250,000 tenants are living in overcrowded conditions. What is not

That is not a big ask. That is not beyond the reach of most tenants.

disabled children who are unable to share a bedroom. What is fair is

that the Government identified their largest area of spend—the
Department for Work and Pensions—and decided that pensions were
not going to be touched and so looked at the welfare budget, where they
saw that people on housing benefit were the most expensive and so that
was the area they were going to target. That says that the Government
have deliberately targeted people in the greatest need of support and
help. The Government may call it welfare, but I still call it social
security, because that is what it is: it provides social security for
people who need it. The Government have identified the people who most
need that social security and they are going to take it away from
them.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) called them
“philosophical differences”, but we call them ideological
differences. As many Opposition Members have said, those differences
relate to the fact that the only crime these people have committed is
to be too poor to afford to buy a house. That is the crime for which
the Government are going to be punishing them. In my constituency, 60%
of the people affected by the bedroom tax since April—only half
a year ago—are now in housing arrears. The Minister, in his
opening statement, admitted that the cost of the discretionary housing
payment has trebled. What I want to hear from the Minister of State,
Department for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Wirral West
(Esther McVey), who is responding to the debate, is if the cost of the
discretionary housing payment has trebled, is this not also
taxpayers’ money? It is, indeed, also money that the Government
are spending, not saving, and they are giving it to the people we have
already identified as being in the greatest need. As many Opposition
Members have said, this policy neither saves money nor does anything
about overcrowding.</hs_Para>

review, and I would like to know when it will take place. I would also
like to see the breakdown of the amount of money spent as against the
amount saved. One saving that the Government are making relates to
people who will “float off Housing Benefit”: the
assessment estimates this to be £5 million. That is so to
misunderstand this area of the housing market as to be cruel and

of its observations about this tax, which is bad in principle and bad
in practice. First, it told me that the worst aspect of the tax is that
it is retrospective and that 95% of the problem flows from its
retrospective nature. There are not enough smaller properties for
affected households to downsize to in our area. North Lincolnshire
Homes has about 10,000 homes, with 1,500 households affected by the
tax. If it were to move them to properties that became available, it

people are already moving into more expensive private rented properties
to escape the bedroom tax. Oddly, a two-bedroom property in north
Lincolnshire can rent for £92.41 and rent on a typical
three-bedroom property is £78.35, so the £92.41 will be
paid by housing benefit when people have moved into the private sector,
rather than the other way round. The impact of this tax on the public
purse is thus absurd. People are falling into arrears. Rent arrears
among the 1,500 affected households have increased by about
£150,000 since April. The policy is not working financially and

Thornberry</B> (Islington South and Finsbury) (Lab):</Member> Let me
begin by informing Ministers here that Islington borough council used
all its discretionary housing payment last year and will certainly use
all its discretionary housing payment this year. People are under
attack not only from the bedroom tax but from the limits on housing
benefit, and a large number of those in private accommodation can
simply no longer afford to live where they live at the moment. While we
try to find them somewhere else to live, they need assistance with
their rent, which is paid through the discretionary housing payment. I
know that that was a point of debate earlier and I want to ensure that
if there is any discretionary housing payment going for a song it is
given to us, because in Islington we could certainly use
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T18:13:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311135000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/debtext/131112-0004.htm#1311135000106">I
ask the Minister to imagine living as part of a family of four in a
three-bedroom flat. She is be unemployed and living on about
£240 a week. Her benefits went up 1% this year, and she is now
paying council tax for the first time because of changes to the rules.
The prices of food, heating, fares and clothing have gone up, and she
has the disadvantage of a son who is nine and a daughter who is seven.
She had been in a three-bedroom flat, but now she has to downsize; if
she does not, she will lose £18 a week out of her £240
benefit. Such people exist: they come to my surgery and ask how they
can economise. I would be grateful to hear from the Minister whether
she has any

the frenetic building attempts by the borough council, only 609
two-bedroom flats were let through the waiting list, which is already
under huge pressure with 19,000 families looking for accommodation
through it. Now, many more people need to be moved very quickly as they
are being attacked by the bedroom tax. Islington tenants with an
additional room, as the Government would say, pay £14 to
£20 a week because of the high rents, which causes great
hardship, and they face the disruption of moving, which is expensive
and stressful.</hs_Para>

Thornberry:</Member></B> In Islington, given how small the flats are,
people simply cannot put two single beds in one room, which makes it
difficult in those circumstances for couples to be able to cope. One of
the unintended consequences of the bedroom tax is additional pressure
on the tribunal service. People who appeal their benefits have to wait
a year, and another 30 tenants from Islington are appealing the bedroom
tax. Our housing system is under huge pressure, and we can do without
this.</hs_Para>

people under-occupy—I fully acknowledge that. I was brought up
in a council house. When we all moved out, my mum was under-occupying,
and she had the great benefit, frankly, of having a professional
daughter who bought her a flat. That house was given back to the stock.
Many elderly people are under-occupying, and, as I have said throughout
the debate, I do not understand why the Government have not augmented
the plans of many local authorities. In my local authority, people
about to go into retirement are interviewed and are asked whether they
would like to move somewhere else, like a flat that is available to
them for the rest of their life and that would be appropriate for them.
Even though, strictly speaking, they are entitled only to a one-bedroom
flat, the council will give them a two-bedroom flat so that they can
move out of a house and a family can move in. Indeed, they might be
given compensation if they wish to move.</hs_Para>

Why does the nation need to wait? We need to build more. Why should the
nation wait for my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster North
(Edward Miliband)? Why should the nation wait for a Labour Government

Eilidh Whiteford</B> (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):</Member> I have a very
simple message for the Government in today’s debate. Six months
after its introduction, their bedroom tax is driving up rent arrears
across Scotland; it has caused immeasurable distress to low-income
families; and it has created financial problems for local authorities
and housing associations. What it has manifestly not done is meet its
objectives: it has not tackled overcrowding; it has not delivered
better use of housing stock; and it has not saved taxpayers any money
at all. In Scotland, 82,500 households are affected by this policy, and
80% of them are the home of a disabled adult.</hs_Para>

seem to think that it is okay to take money out of the
pockets of some of the most disadvantaged people in our
communities—but it is not okay. It symbolises just how out of
touch the Government are with the values of decent people in Scotland

iniquitous
measure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311135000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/debtext/131112-0004.htm#1311135000115">Most
social housing tenants have a lot less choice about where they live
than the rest of us, and they are already living in the cheapest
housing available to them. Across Scotland, 60% of tenants need a
one-bedroom house, but only 27% of the social housing stock is
one-bedroom accommodation, so there is a fundamental structural
mismatch that cannot be fixed by crude social engineering. There are
simply not enough smaller houses to go round, and I do not believe that
it is right to punish the poorest tenants for the structural problems
of our housing stock
supply.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311135000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/debtext/131112-0004.htm#1311135000116">We
have seen significant hikes in arrears over the past six months.
According to the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, all but one
of Scotland’s local authorities have reported increases in
arrears that are attributable to the introduction of the bedroom tax,
yet relatively few tenants have moved house. Given that eight out of 10
households are affected by disability, that really should not surprise
us, because people do not want to move away from their family and their
support networks. More than that, they do not want to leave their home,
as my hon. Friend the Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams) eloquently put
it.</hs_Para>

that the Government’s idea of fairness is to bring housing
benefit in line with the local housing allowance available to private

premise and a false comparison. Social housing is allocated not on a

landlords operate systems that take account of a range of factors when

22% in inflation-adjusted terms over the past 10 years, while in the
social rented sector, the increase has been only 6%. A 6% increase in
10 years is hardly out of control, but we know that rents in London are

Scottish Government have topped that up to the very peak of their

Green:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Let us remember
that disabled people’s options are more limited. A number of
hon. Members have said that people should work, or work a few more
hours a week. Often for disabled people it is particularly difficult to
work or to do extra hours, and as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T18:47:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley) pointed out,
that is a particular challenge for carers. One point that I do not
think has been made, but which is extremely concerning for disabled
people, is that many local authorities are treating disability living
allowance as income when calculating someone’s entitlement to
discretionary housing payment. That is a disgrace. I have challenged
the Minister on that before, but he has declined to take action to
ensure that all local authorities of whatever political colour have
clear guidance on how they should treat the
DLA.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311135000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/debtext/131112-0004.htm#1311135000172">As

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T18:47:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hammersmith (Mr Slaughter) pointed out,
because of the extra high cost of rent and therefore housing benefit in
the private rented sector. There are the implications of higher levels
of arrears and the extra cost of advising people in arrears, and of
collecting and managing arrears. There is also, of course, the impact
on the financial standing of housing associations. The policy is
damaging their credit rating and cash flows, and makes it more
difficult for them to undertake the new builds we desperately
need.</hs_Para>

have said, we will see extra costs for local authorities,

were pleased—surprised, I think—to hear the Minister of
State say at the beginning of the debate that if it turned out that the
discretionary housing pot in a local authority was fully committed,
more money would be made available. That was encouraging, and we would
welcome his colleague repeating that commitment. Let us remember,
however, that the discretionary housing payment is temporary,
transitional and—as its name suggests—discretionary. In
many cases, we have instances of local authorities denying people
access to that pot of funding, and actively discouraging people from
going to appeal.</hs_Para>

Opposition’s figures—surprisingly—do not always
stack up. We talked about how we are going to find new homes for
different people and how we are going to support them to move into
accommodation—all the things we should be doing. Yes, 660,000
people are affected by these changes, but only earlier today I spoke to
one of the biggest online home swap companies. It has 320,000
accommodations for people to move to. By the way, it has only 6.7%
market share, so we are easily able, should we be working in this way,
to find houses for people to swap.

McVey:</Member></B> I would like to raise the example of Susannah from
south Yorkshire. She had had four children and did not necessarily want
to move. In the end, she looked around for six months and moved. She
said, “Actually, I wished I’d had that support earlier,
because now I am in an area I prefer. I have downsized. I have a
smaller house, which means that my cost of living is less. I am paying
less on cleaning and less on heating, and I can live within my
means.” I have a list of people like that. I ask Opposition
Members to work with their local authorities and their constituents to
help them downsize so they can live within their means. I know that
living within one’s means is not something Opposition Members
understand, but that is what we all have to do as a

I record my thanks to magistrates and former magistrates, including
Colin Knipe, Chris Smith and Barbara Sykes, for their help and advice.
Magistrates, victims, witnesses and others directly involved with the
court tell me that closure would make it harder for local victims to
testify, harder for local people to volunteer in court and harder for
the press to deter crime by reporting

people in the UK experience hearing loss, and seven in 10 can expect to
be affected by the time they reach their 70th birthday. That means that
10 million people live with hearing loss, and an ageing
population means that that number will rise in the years ahead. To
communicate is to be part of society. Losing one’s hearing is
not just about the absence of sound—if not addressed, hearing
loss can result in the loss of our social life, cutting us off from
family, friends and work.</hs_Para>

adulthood is linked to depression, unemployment, poor mental and
physical health and an increased risk of other conditions, including
dementia. Hearing loss is a constant condition, and in most cases there
is no cure. It is no exaggeration to say that it can destroy lives.
People with hearing loss can find it difficult to negotiate everyday
challenges in the workplace, on the bus, at the supermarket, or in the
local doctor’s surgery, leading to isolation, exclusion and
frustration.</hs_Para>

carried out by Action on Hearing Loss has found that adults who lose
their hearing are likely to withdraw from social activities. When they
do take part, communication difficulties can result in feelings of
loneliness. Hearing loss can also damage personal relationships. Many
deaf people find it difficult to join in with family conversations and
jokes. Couples say that they feel more distant from their friends, and
partners of people with a hearing problem describe feelings of
loneliness and frustration. Travelling on public transport becomes a
challenge, and a platform alteration or a delayed connection can be a
major problem if someone misses the announcement. That can leave deaf
people feeling anxious and vulnerable when travelling, and worried
about being stranded or lost. The debate among policy makers focuses
mainly on quality-of-life issues, but failure to address hearing
problems has implications for society as a
whole.</hs_Para>

as not looking directly at a patient to allow for lip-reading, can lead
to patients with hearing loss feeling unclear about the medical advice

of hearing loss among adults is too often down to chance. Many are
reluctant to seek help, and evidence suggests that people wait an
average of 10 years before doing so. Stigma is a key factor
in this delay in taking up hearing aids, which makes some people
unwilling to tell others about their hearing loss. An Action on Hearing
Loss report found that one element of stigma is the fear that deaf
people are seen as less capable. A 2005 MORI poll of more than 20,000

approved for an implant, and when this was switched on it gave her
new-found confidence. It rebuilt her self-esteem, enabling her to
communicate more comfortably with her husband, family, friends and
colleagues. Having a cochlear implant has given her a new lease of
life, without having to rely on others to help her with communication,
such as by telephone. It has also helped her immensely at work, where
she can now communicate with colleagues on an easier level. It has
helped her gain promotion and do a job that she enjoys. The cochlear

hon. Lady made a good case for why this is so important. She talked
about the importance of basic communication and the fact that hearing
loss can affect mental health as well as physical health and lead to
withdrawal from social activities. She talked about the cost to
society, the impact on employment and the fact that there is poor deaf
awareness among health professionals and that better training is
needed. I absolutely agree with her on all those points.</hs_Para>

million adults in England are living with hearing loss. Some of them
will have been among the one in 700 babies in England born with hearing
loss, but many will be among the growing number who develop a hearing
impairment during their lifetimes. For some people that will be the
sort of age-related hearing loss that many of us will experience as we
grow older and 
<?notus-xml column=934?>that will become increasingly common because of our aging population,
but for many others hearing loss is acquired and should therefore be
avoidable.</hs_Para>

World Health Organisation considers half of all cases of hearing loss
to be preventable—for example, by immunisation, early treatment
or reducing exposure to noise. In fact, it identifies exposure to
excessive noise as the major avoidable cause of permanent hearing
impairment worldwide. In developed countries, it is at least partially
responsible for more than a third of all hearing impairments. As a
result of the UK’s aging population, the impact of working with
noisy machinery and exposure to loud music and other loud noises, the
World Health Organisation predicts that by 2030 there will be an
estimated 14.5 million people in the UK with hearing loss,
and adult-onset hearing loss will be among the UK’s top 10
disease burdens. That demonstrates the scale of the concern.</hs_Para>

have to take hearing loss seriously, which is why we are currently
looking to develop the action plan on hearing loss, which the hon. Lady
mentioned, so that we can achieve better outcomes for all those with
hearing loss and related conditions. The action plan will identify key
actions that will make a real difference in improving health and social

cannot just be about prevention because that is not always possible; it
is also about dealing with the consequences of hearing loss. The
Government are committed to delivering health outcomes that are among
the best in the world for people with hearing loss. We are developing
measures to identify those with hearing loss as early as possible,
including the roll-out of a national hearing screening programme for
newborn babies that enables the early identification of deafness,
providing a clear care pathway for services and allowing parents to
make informed choices on communication needs.</hs_Para>

however, we are focusing
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T19:56:20"></hs_TimeCode>on adults with
hearing loss. I realise that there is currently considerable interest
on hearing loss screening for adults, which the hon. Lady mentioned.
The UK National Screening Committee advises Ministers and the NHS in
all four countries on all aspects of screening policy. Using research
evidence, pilot programmes and economic evaluation, it assesses the
evidence for programmes against a set of internationally recognised
criteria. In 2009, the committee recommended that routine screening for
adults’ hearing loss should 
<?notus-xml column=935?>not be offered because of a lack of evidence to warrant such a screening
programme. However, as part of its three-year review policy cycle, the
committee is reviewing the evidence for a national adult hearing
screening programme. A public consultation will be held shortly and
details will be available on the committee’s website. I
encourage the Ear Foundation and many others to contribute to that
consultation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311135001257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/debtext/131112-0004.htm#1311135001257">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T19:57:30"></hs_TimeCode>
welcome the recent report by the Ear Foundation, which clearly sets out
the benefits of cochlear implants for children and adults.
Abigail’s story, as told by the hon. Lady, demonstrates what a
massive impact that can have on an individual’s life. It
completely transformed her life, and no doubt that experience is
repeated very many times around the country. The report will be of
enormous use to NICE if it decides to update the technology appraisal
that it published in 2009. I encourage the Ear Foundation to engage
with NICE. I am sure that it is already in touch, but it is very
important for it to provide any emerging evidence to NICE to help it to
update, if necessary, the guidance provided on
implants.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311135001258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/debtext/131112-0004.htm#1311135001258">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-12T19:58:25"></hs_TimeCode>
large number of services are already commissioned for people with
hearing loss, and a number of specialist centres in England provide
implants for children and adults. It is important that GPs understand
the criteria for referral, as well as the obvious benefits of this
technology for people with hearing loss. That touches on the hon.
Lady’s point about the importance of health professionals,
whether GPs or anyone else in the health system, gaining a better
understanding of the potential for this technology. There have been
considerable improvements to services for people with hearing loss in
recent years, including reduced waits for assessment and treatment to

public services 
<?notus-xml column=936?>are geared up to help and support them. Public authorities, including
health and social care bodies, are required by the Equality Act 2010 to
make reasonable adjustments for disabled people, to ensure that they

hon. Member for Nottingham South mentioned the specific problems that
people face when travelling and the anxiety caused by worrying about
not hearing an announcement. There will be facilities on platforms for

have been provided with hearing loops since December 2012. In policing,
police link officers for deaf or hard-of-hearing people use and are

level 1 of their training with Action on Hearing Loss, and they

confirmed that they will team up to bid for the franchise. As the

National Society of French Railways—SNCF—which is
France’s state-owned operator. Arriva, which already operates so
many franchises, including the Tyne and Wear Metro in the north-east,
and has received much Government investment over the past few years,
will probably throw its hat into the ring. It is of course owned by
Deutsche Bahn. Abellio, which, with Serco, runs Northern Rail trains in

Instead of profits generated by the franchise benefiting British
commuters through investment in service improvement and dividends to
the Treasury,  the Government prefer profits to be channelled
to other European countries, in some cases to subsidise fares in 
<?notus-xml column=190?>those countries. If we are to achieve the modal shift from cars to rail
that we need to ease pressure on our trunk roads and to reduce carbon
emissions, we must have the investment and the ambitious targets and
standards in place to ensure that services are reliable and can carry
on improving. Unfortunately, it appears that the Government intend to
put that improvement into reverse over the next few years.</hs_Para>

brought to my attention yesterday that in the past couple of weeks, the
Office of Rail Regulation has published a document setting out the
desired outputs for the whole rail network for the next five-year
control period. That document makes it clear that the standards
expected of whichever company wins the east coast franchise will be
significantly lower than the national average, and possibly even lower
than those of most European routes. For example, the national standard
for cancelled or seriously late trains—which I have had some
experience of on the east coast over the past month: the fault for that
lay not with the company but with all the storms and so on—is no
more than 2.2% of journeys. The east coast’s standard will be
4.2%.The national standard for just mildly late trains, which can be
anything between 10 minutes and two hours, will be 8.1% in the first
year. For the east coast, it will be 17%, which is more than double the
national standard, and equates to more than one in six journeys. That
rate will be required to come down to 12% by 2018-19, but it will still
be much higher than the national rate of 7.5%.</hs_Para>

control period, we could see an additional 15,500 trains officially
late and more than 2,500 trains cancelled without the operator being
deemed to be breaching its required standards. Why should the east
coast be given a lower standard? It is way below what the public would
expect, and way below the standards set by Labour for the current
control period. The apparent loosening of the required standards does
not appear in any of the preceding documents on which the public have
been consulted, but has now appeared at a point when they can no longer
have their say. Will the Minister explain why the standards are set so
low and have been revealed in a document on which the public will not
be consulted? Will he give us an assurance today that that is in no way
linked to the tendering process, or the Government’s desire to
get the most money for the franchise to hold up as a sign of success?
If we move  the goalposts and make things easier for whichever
train operator comes in, it makes the deal more attractive to them, and

the Government are to go through with the privatisation, it is
important that the Exchequer get as much cash as possible now and over
the course of the contract. However, we cannot sacrifice performance
standards to achieve that goal, because people will just give up on
trains that are allowed to be late on one in six, one in seven or even
one in eight

the proposal is not linked to the tendering  process, perhaps
it is related to the fact that investment in tackling congestion over
the coming control period will be less than half the £500
million that the Labour Government allocated. That investment has
resulted in improvements in north London, flyovers at Doncaster and
Hitchin, and the upgrading of a parallel route for slow freight between
Doncaster and Peterborough. Will the Minister assure us that service
standards are not being lowered to match the investment the Government 
<?notus-xml column=191?>are prepared to make? Our constituents rightly expect not just a
punctual service but a decent service, particularly when they might be
on the train for three or four hours or more when travelling to or from

the Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson) on securing
this very timely and important debate and on making some excellent
points. On the point about the value of having the east coast main line
within the public sector, are there not lessons to be learned from what
is happening with gas and electricity companies? When the private
sector has no benchmark of public sector provision, does the consumer
not get ripped off? Is there not an overwhelming argument for retaining
at least one main line in public ownership, by which we could benchmark
the other lines?</hs_Para>

Lazarowicz:</Member></B> My hon. Friend might be, but that is not the
issue today. What we are talking about today is giving an alternative
to the private sector. He just referred to other industries, and one of
the issues about those industries is this: to what extent is there real
competition?</hs_Para>

problems is that within the railway sector in the UK, a very limited
number of UK companies are able and willing to put in a bid for a line.
On the east coast and west coast lines, we all know that the major UK
bidders will always be drawn from Virgin, First Group, National Express
and possibly Stagecoach.</hs_Para>

Virgin also runs planes to Edinburgh and Aberdeen, and First Group and
the other companies operate other rail services. Some of them also
operate bus and express coach services. So the issue is ensuring that
there is at least some competition in the system, which the existence
of Directly Operated Railways on the east coast main line would
certainly provide.</hs_Para>

Mearns:</Member></B> It is ironic that, despite the number of

ownership of UK railways, not UK state ownership of UK
railways.</hs_Para>

Lazarowicz:</Member></B> Indeed. However, my hon. Friend is being
perhaps a bit too restrictive, because I understand that one of the
companies shortlisted for one of the Scottish railway franchises is the
mass transit railway system—MTR—in Hong Kong, which I
presume is ultimately owned by the Chinese Government. It appears 
<?notus-xml column=194?>that although the Chinese are able to build our nuclear power stations
and run our railways, the British state is unable to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111244000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111244000057">I
come to the essence of the argument. The Government say that one of the
reasons why the east coast line should go back into the private sector
is the success that there has been since the railway system was
privatised. One of the oldest logical fallacies in the book is to say
that because event B followed event A, event B must have been caused by
event A.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13111244000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111244000058">What the
Government are saying, of course, is that because passenger numbers
have gone up since the railways were privatised, that must be because
they were privatised. However, the fact is that we have not been able
to establish that link between the two. For example, I can look at the
local bus company in Edinburgh, my home city, which is municipally
owned. The number  of bus passengers has gone up dramatically
in the past 20 years. That company is in the public sector, but I will
not say that the rise in passenger numbers is just because of
that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13111244000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111244000059">Equally,
however, saying that the rail network’s being in the private
sector is why the number of passengers has gone up seems a very weak
argument. In fact, the number of passengers on other state-owned
railways in other parts of the world has gone up as well. The argument
about privatisation seems very weak.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Washington and Sunderland West pointed out, Lord
Adonis, when Transport Secretary, made references to privatisation that
are continually mentioned by the Government in defence of their
policies. However, he has made it clear that he has learned from
experience and is approaching this issue in a non-dogmatic fashion, in
a way that the Government are signally failing to do.</hs_Para>

forget that it was a Conservative Government who privatised the
railways in the first place, against the wishes of the Labour party.
Labour colleagues in Parliament at the time voted against that
privatisation. Of course, the Labour Government after 1997 had a large
number of priorities and I can certainly see why the issue was not, at
that time, their No.1. However, as I have said, we are talking about
the situation here and now. We have an opportunity to judge from
experience and to ensure that the public get the best value for money
and the best service, which, in my and my colleagues’ view,
would be obtained by ensuring that the east coast line stays in the
public sector.</hs_Para>

been made to the way in which foreign companies are able to bid for the
franchise. I will not develop that point any further, given that it has
already been raised by other colleagues. However, I will again make the
point that there is a real issue about the lack of genuine competition
within the rail franchising sector in the UK, including among
British-based companies. Also, the point that my hon. Friend the Member
for Easington (Grahame M. Morris) made about comparing rail with the
utilities was very well
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111244000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111244000063">One
of the points made by Ministers when they have argued why the east
coast main line should go private again is that—as I think one
of the Minister’s predecessors, the right hon. Member for
Chelmsford (Mr Burns), said—the record of East Coast trains on
punctuality had “plateaued”. Again, that is another
example of desperation and of the Government trying to grab arguments
to support a weak case.</hs_Para>

that East Coast trains has a good record on punctuality. As we all
know, the main reason why there have been problems with train
punctuality in recent times is certain factors—first of all, the
recent storms, which were clearly beyond anyone’s control. Above
all, however, they have been due to problems with infrastructure, which
have not been the fault of East Coast trains.</hs_Para>

parliamentary question on the issue a while ago. I received an answer
about the 2012-13 split in responsibility for delays on East Coast
trains: 18% of them were due to East Coast itself, 13% were due to
“Other Train/Freight Companies” and 69% were due 
to Network Rail. We know that one of the reasons why 69% of delays were
due to Network Rail was problems with the overhead line system, which
was, of course, put in place on the cheap, and for
which—again—a previous Conservative Government clearly
have to take responsibility.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Washington and Sunderland West referred to the
new targets from the regulator regarding punctuality. One of the things
that the regulator said in its recent report was that there is a
problem with reliability on the east coast main line, and I welcome the
fact that it did. However, like my hon. Friend, I am concerned about
how the performance measurements for the east coast service have been
reduced in comparison with those for many other lines in the
country.</hs_Para>

it only sounds like a marginal reduction if the performance target is
reduced from 90% to 88%, but of course what we want to aim for is 100%
reliability. Obviously, we will never get 100% reliability, but every
time the target is reduced—even by 1% or 2%—we release
the pressure on that operator to ensure that, as far as possible, all
their trains arrive on time.</hs_Para>

that the new target for cancelled or seriously late trains was set at a
rate that would allow 4.2% of east coast line trains to arrive more
than two hours late or not at all. That does not sound like much, until
we put those figures in another context and say that one in every 24
trains could be cancelled without any penalties whatever being imposed
on the operator responsible.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Washington and Sunderland West has said, there
are concerns about the fact that that particular change was not
referred to in draft proposals for the new punctuality performance
targets; it was a change that people could not be consulted on. The
Minister should give an explanation as to why that was the case.
Bluntly, if he cannot provide one today, he should go away and look at
the issue, because it was a major defect in the process.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Edinburgh North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz) and I
were so determined to get here  that we ignored that advice and
soldiered on to Peterborough. That delay was due not to the train
operator, but to the stormy weather; the line was certainly not the
only one affected on that date. Some might suggest that East Coast let
us down, but we were clear that that was not the case. Indeed, when we
tried to take other lines to get from Peterborough to London, we
discovered that they were all affected, whether they were privatised or
not.</hs_Para>

People enjoy their journeys. I have said this before and I will say it
again, because  it is important from a Scottish perspective and
an environmental perspective: the improvements are making inroads into
getting those important business travellers, who otherwise might always
travel by air, to use rail. If we are serious about creating a modal
shift in transport, we have to make rail both attractive and reliable
to get that kind of traveller. That is one thing the service has done

might ask why the public have so little confidence in the
re-privatisation of the east coast main line, and the answer is simple:
for the bulk of the time since the 
<?notus-xml column=197?>railways were privatised, the franchise has been in the hands of the
private sector. The orders for new rolling stock on the line have only
been secured since the franchise has been in the public sector. Much of
the existing rolling stock is 35 or 40 years old. For the bulk of that
time, it has been in private hands with little investment, apart from a
lick of

the opportunity cost of prioritising East Coast over some of the other
long-distance franchises. Under the original franchising timetable from
August 2011, a new contract for the west coast main line was due to
start in October 2012, with Great Western starting in April 2013 and
the east coast main line thereafter. However, following the debacle of
the west coast main line bidding process, a new timetable was announced
in March this year. The east coast main line, which was previously the
last in the trio of intercity franchises to be let, was brought forward
to be the first. That was 
<?notus-xml column=198?>only made possible by the current operator of the west coast main line,
Virgin, being given a franchise extension of four and a half years to
April 2017. At the same time, the Great Western operator, First, has
been given an extension of two and a half years to September 2015. In
total, that is 77 months’ worth of
extensions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111245000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111245000012">The
Government justify prioritising East Coast by referring to the Brown
review, which was carried out after the problems with the west coast
main line. They are restating their belief that competition in the
bidding process should drive down the level of subsidy required or
drive up the level of premium payments offered. They say that that will
push operators to be more efficient and innovative, and prompt
investment in new services. One can argue that franchise competitions
might achieve these goals, but the one thing that certainly will not
achieve those goals is franchise extensions. That is because the
Government, by setting up this particular arrangement, have no option
but to negotiate with the existing operators on other lines. The only
bargaining chip that Ministers can use is to threaten to call in East
Coast’s parent company, Directly Operated Railways, but they are
reluctant to do so, as is highlighted by their desperation to extract
DOR from the east coast main line. How are the other franchisees
threatened by Ministers saying, “If you don’t agree

Operated Railways,” when Ministers are running as fast as

Operated Railways is taken off East Coast trains—I do not know

Transport a premium of £165 million, and First Great Western
paid £110 million. Will the Minister confirm that there will not
be payments of anywhere near those sums during the extension period?
Will he also confirm that, apart from the roll-out of wi-fi on First
Great Western, which all train operators are beginning to offer, the
two extensions offer no improvements for passengers? There is less
money coming in and no improvements; the extensions need not have been

<?notus-xml column=199?>performing badly in the public sector, there might have been some
justification for what has happened—the imperative of turning

rail service in public ownership that brings money back to the

note that, like me, my hon. Friend appreciates the general reliability,
frequency, excellent customer service and value for money the service
provides to all passengers. As a state-owned operator, the ethos of
putting the customer first and ensuring the most effective and
efficient use of public resources is the company’s prime
objective. Private companies can be just as good, of course, but their
foremost loyalty is to their shareholders and any profits not
reinvested go on share dividends, often to already wealthy
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111245000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111245000024">The
difference with East Coast being a subsidiary of Directly Operated
Railways, a holding company owned by the Department for Transport, is
that its surpluses are paid back to the Exchequer. As my hon. Friend

million in infrastructure and asset improvements in that
period.</hs_Para>

also has the best punctuality on the line since the service was
privatised, and all passenger surveys and polling indicates that the
overwhelming majority of people are satisfied with East Coast and wish
it to remain in public ownership. So why are the Conservative-led

the Liberal Democrats, intent on re-privatising what is evidently a
most successful, lucrative and popular public service? Has
re-privatisation been proposed for the right financial and service
reasons, or is there another, perhaps more partisan, explanation? From
the evidence available, it is apparent that that privatisation is born
of ideology, not
necessity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111245000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111245000026">Indeed,

privatising the profit and nationalising the cost and risk of the

the next most expensive countries. A day return in the UK costs 26p per

tickets into the capital, a 24-mile commute into Paris would cost
£924 a year; a similar commute would cost £705 to Berlin
and £654 to Madrid—but for someone travelling to London
it would cost £3,268 a year. Those are huge sums, and after a

as my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Graeme Morrice) said,
instead of clearing up the mess caused by the collapse of the west

Ministers desperately try to complete East Coast’s sale before

committed £500 million to the line in the current control period

dogma and the hon. Member for Easington (Grahame M. Morris) gave
himself away when he said that he supports renationalisation of the
railways. That is what this debate is about. It is not about securing
the best deal for passengers, the railways or the east coast main line.
It is about
renationalisation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000009">The
whiff of mischief continued from the Labour Front-Bench spokesman who
was keen to point out what she believes is the benefit of
nationalisation, but failed to point out that the previous Labour
Government saw the benefits of the franchising system and
privatisation, and continued with that process throughout their
13 years in office. Moreover, I gently remind the hon. Lady
that when she starts a catalogue of failures, she might remember who
had not done enough work on the franchising process in 2007 when
National Express took it
over.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs Gillan" PimsId="3438" UID="13111250000080" xid="229" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000080">Mrs

privatisation, which has seen ridership double, could be established.

been announced back in 2011 that the intention was to publish the

Mitchell</B> (Great Grimsby) (Lab):</Member> May I say what a pleasure
it is to serve under your chairmanship for the first time ever, Mr
Bone? I want to tell the story today of the theft of a profitable
Yorkshire company by the mafia—I do not mean the criminal mafia
that we often speak of, but Britain’s dark-suited mafia,
which  in this case is represented by Lloyds bank and
PricewaterhouseCoopers, both acting in collusion and neither of them
subject to police controls, because both regulate themselves.</hs_Para>

is Premier Motor Auctions, which had a turnover of £160 million,
had 160 staff, and was profitably selling 50,000 cars a year in 2008,
which  was one of its most profitable years. It was
described  by Lloyds as a “great auction
business”. However, the company had an overdraft facility of
£1.75 million, because the chief executive, Keith Elliott, was
pushing the limits to expand the company. That included the
costs of due diligence on an aborted takeover, the purchase of a new
site in Birmingham and a proposal to establish a business in the United
States. The overdraft facility gave the bank the idea of taking it over
and it introduced Irving Warnett of PricewaterhouseCoopers to the
company as a non-executive director. He called himself, as he came in,
a critical friend, and he worked for Ian Green, who was the northern
leader of business recovery services for
PricewaterhouseCoopers.</hs_Para>

through the accounts and insisted on creating a £2 million
account for a Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency contract that the
company held. That turned out to be unnecessary—it was not even
required by the DVLA contract—but it created a hole in the
company’s finances, which Lloyds agreed to fill by increasing
the borrowing limit to £3.75 million, in return for which it
demanded vigorously and robustly that the company be sold via an
administration in which PwC would, amazingly to me, act for both
parties. That was in September 2008. It was to be sold to Lloyds
Development Capital under what was called Project Tic, which was headed
by the takeover specialist Matthew
Packham.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000029">Elliott
fought back, and he got the support of a venture capital firm called
Endless, which described Premier Motor Auctions as an excellent
business. It was prepared to refund the £2 million borrowing
that had been unnecessary, but Lloyds, in return, insisted on owning
50% of the business and proposed to put the business again into
administration. That was described by Lloyds as Project Toc, and PwC
was to handle the administration, at the end of which Lloyds was to buy
the business for £1. To ensure that that happened, Lloyds then
threatened to withdraw funding on 4 December, which was the day before
the deal was completed. It said, in internal documents, that this was
its attempt to crystallise the position and to do a deal without Keith.
PwC was proposing to act for both sides, which, again, I would have
thought was a conflict of interest on its part.</hs_Para>

to be beaten—resourceful man as he is—did a deal with
Scottish Motor Auctions, which agreed to put up £2 million and
avoid administration, which, as it pointed out, would have shattered
confidence in the business. That was a good deal from the point of 
<?notus-xml column=213?>view of Elliott and Premier Motor Auctions, but not from the
bank’s point of view, and in 24 hours, the deal, on 11 December,
had been aborted and a new deal was reached between Scottish Motor
Auctions and Lloyds, over Elliott’s head. Lloyds and Scottish
Motor Auctions would now take over the company, so the bank was still
achieving its aim, despite Keith Elliott’s resourcefulness in
getting the £2 million paid off.</hs_Para>

question, therefore, becomes who aborted the deal with Scottish Motor
Auctions. A director of Scottish Motor Auctions said that it had been
given a very clear steer that SMA’s bid would be
unacceptable—unacceptable, presumably, to the bank. I have had a
considerably long letter of explanation from the bank, and I am
grateful for that. It has given me an explanation some of which is
actually correct. The bank says that it did not abort the Scottish
Motor Auctions deal, and it points to PricewaterhouseCoopers. PwC has
refused to answer any questions on the issue, so I do not know whether
the deal was aborted by Mr Warnett or by his boss Ian Green—they
both worked in the same office and shared the same secretary—but
I do know that aborting the Scottish Motor Auctions deal made the
difference to PwC’s fees, which went from £10,000 for the
SMA deal, if it had gone through, to £500,000 for carrying out
the administration, which Lloyds wanted to do. The total cost of that
administration, including lawyers’ fees and everything, came to
£1.2 million.</hs_Para>

respects, that is the end of the story. Keith Elliott was forced out
and to get his overdraft, he had been forced to sign a warrant to the
bank, which is something banks tend to force on customers now, giving
it the option to purchase, which it now proposed to exercise, excluding
Keith Elliott entirely. That was what he was told by post earlier in
December. That means that a company that was making, that year,
£2.5 million, before interest and tax, was put into
administration by PwC and bought back by Lloyds and Scottish Motor
Auctions. It is now functioning again and generating considerable
profit for them. Elliott has been forced out, and Scottish Motor
Auctions, Lloyds bank, and presumably PwC, which handled the
administration, are laughing all the way to the bank, having made a
very considerable, generous profit out of the deal—out of
effectively stealing the company. Elliott is left owing
£2 million on a warrant that he signed to get the
£2 million from Lloyds in the first
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000033">In
my view, the way in which the company was taken over does not just
smell—it stinks. It is a monstrous theft of the company. The
Independent Banking Advisory Service, which Keith Elliott consulted,
has confirmed that this is happening elsewhere to other companies taken
over by banks in this fashion. IBAS says that the banks are being
protected by Government and have a “special relationship”
with them. I quote from a letter of 28 September 2012 in which IBAS
states that that special relationship</hs_Para>

smells even more and is even more worrying is the lack of redress for a
company director and company in this situation. Neither Lloyds nor PwC
has answered the specific questions—about who aborted which
deal, why and when—that I and Keith Elliott have put to them.
Lloyds has been helpful in giving its side of the story, but it still
has not answered the questions and it will not agree to an independent
investigation by a liquidator that Elliott will fund personally to
prove that he was right. It has also prevented disclosure by six
directors after he won a court order for disclosure of their internal
papers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000037">PricewaterhouseCoopers—a

a nice one. PwC has not answered my questions, either. It will not
correspond further. It has told Elliot to sue it. All of that is, to
me, as clear an admission of guilt on the part of PwC as we are going
to get. It can get away with it, because the regulation of accountancy
and insolvency is handled by the regulator, which is the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. That would better be
renamed the “society for the prevention of cruelty to the big
four accountancy houses”, which manage the institute’s
staff, provide time off for their partners to serve the institute,
dominate its proceedings and make it judge and jury in their own case.
It has not investigated Elliott’s claims. It has told him that
his redress is now by means of judicial review, which it is not, of
course, because that is out of
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000039">The

investigating the theft of a company is not in the public interest, it
beats me what
is.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000040">The
Minister and the Insolvency Service both say they have no standing in
the matter. The problem that we are talking about is the theft of a
viable, profitable company by one of the big banks, in close
co-operation—conspiracy, one might say—with
PricewaterhouseCoopers. What I am asking this morning, therefore, is,
first, that there be an official inquiry into this company theft, which
should cover the question whether this is going on with other
banks—whether other companies are being taken over by the banks,
in collusion with accountancy houses, in the same way. It is in effect
the theft of
companies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000041">I
am asking, secondly, for effective independent regulation of
accountancy, audit and insolvency. Regulation by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants, the protective body for the big four, is just
not enough, and it means that the big four are in effect their own
masters and take their own decisions. That is a totally undesirable
situation. The public and companies must have some right of redress and
right of appeal—some knowledge that there will be an independent
inquiry into abuses such as
this.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000042">I
am asking thirdly for the effective regulation of the banks to ensure
that they do their job, which is lending to support small and
medium-sized enterprises, rather than using the power they have from
granting overdrafts to take them over.</hs_Para>

as a general issue, that the enormous power of those big beasts the
banks—banks that are too big to fail and are in effect protected
by Government—and the enormous power of the big four accountancy
houses, which are too big to control and in effect regulate themselves
through the Institute of Chartered Accountants, be restrained. We need
a healthy, vigorous and open environment for business and we need
institutions such as the banks and the big accountancy houses to be
accountable and effectively regulated in the public interest.
Everywhere, great power such as exists in the hands of the banks and
the accountancy houses must be accountable, and it should be in this
instance.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_12_PT_1/1C40877251D22C7F5465E510241155B17127AE06" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="12 November 2013">Tuesday

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills (Jo Swinson):</Member></B> First, I congratulate the hon. Member
for Great Grimsby (Austin Mitchell) on securing the debate. He has been
a tenacious advocate on behalf of his constituent, Mr Elliott, and his
concerns about the administration of the companies of which he was the
managing director. I applaud the hon. Gentleman’s work on behalf
of constituents generally, which we all wish to undertake as MPs in our
own
constituencies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000045">I
hope to be able to address some of the points that the hon. Gentleman
has raised on this specific case, although he will appreciate that
there are limits to what I can say—and, indeed, do—on
this case. However, he has also raised his concern that these issues
exist more widely, so I will also touch on what the Government intend
to do to address issues in the insolvency market more
widely.</hs_Para><hs_76fChair UID="13111250000002" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000002">[<SmallCaps>Mr

concerns that the hon. Gentleman has outlined regarding this case
include the alleged conflict of interest involving the administrator,
the accountancy firm PwC and the bankers, Lloyds. Mr Elliott has made
it clear that he considers that the close relationship between PwC and
the bank enabled his companies to be sold in an inappropriate and
irregular way. The hon. Gentleman described that as, in effect, the
theft of the company. I appreciate that his constituent feels very
strongly about this issue, not least because this was his livelihood
and his company. We all understand
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000047">The
hon. Gentleman also outlined his concerns about the wider context of
the banks acting with the big four accountancy firms to sell businesses
at a profit for themselves, to the detriment of creditors and those who
had been running the companies. I recognise that people are worried
about the independence of insolvency practitioners and I will come to
those matters, but I should perhaps try to manage expectations. I may
be unable to satisfy the hon. Gentleman on the specifics of this case,
because I do not have the power to intervene in individual
insolvencies. The issue is not whether I am willing to do so; it is
simply that I am not able to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000048">The
hon. Gentleman will inevitably be more familiar with the intricate
details of the case than I am, but my understanding is that Irving
Warnett was introduced, he says, as a non-executive director and a
critical friend of Premier Motor Auctions. My understanding is also
that, whatever discussions took place, he was never actually appointed
as a non-executive director, so the legislation on directors’
responsibilities does not specifically 
<?notus-xml column=216?>apply to him. The issues about a conflict of interest have been
investigated, and I will come
to the way in which that complaint was
handled.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000049">The
hon. Gentleman also highlighted the two different deals that seemed to
be on the table in December 2008. One was much more appealing to Mr
Elliott. The other, which ultimately was the one undertaken, was
clearly not as acceptable to Mr Elliott. I understand the hon.
Gentleman’s concern about where that decision was made, but I do
not have the power to secure that information.</hs_Para>

strongly encourage any company receiving correspondence from a Member
of Parliament about  a constituency case to engage with that
Member of Parliament and answer their questions. After all, we elect
650 MPs to represent everybody up and down the country, and the office
of Member of Parliament should not be disrespected by any individual
company. It would be helpful if the relevant companies found it in
themselves to engage a little more constructively and answer some of
the questions that the hon. Gentleman understandably put to them on
behalf of his constituent.</hs_Para>

Gentleman highlighted a couple of deals, which go by the interesting
names of Project Tic and Project Toc. In August 2008, Lloyds were
apparently insisting that the company went into administration, which
he referred to as Project Tic. Project Toc involved Endless LLP and
Lloyds buying the company out of administration through a specially
created new company. It is difficult to comment on those specifics,
because the sale did not take place under either of those
projects.</hs_Para>

complained to the ICAEW, which is the insolvency regulator of the
administrator, Mr Green. As the hon. Gentleman knows, it investigated
the complaint, which involved the potential conflict of interest around
Mr Green becoming administrator when previously, it is alleged, there
was a material relationship between PWC and the companies
involved.</hs_Para>

investigation concluded that no conflict of interest arose, on the
basis that PwC was acting as investigating accountants for the bank
prior to the administration, and therefore it was not contrary to the
code of ethics with which all insolvency practitioners must comply. The
ICAEW also looked at PwC’s negotiating to sell the business in
the days before Mr Green was appointed, and stated that that likewise
did not breach the code because PwC was trying to maximise asset
realisations, which was compatible with Mr Green’s duties as
administrator.</hs_Para>

insolvency practitioner should be aware of potential conflicts of
interest. There was an investigation in this case, because there
clearly should have been awareness of that, but if an insolvency
practitioner works for a particular firm, a conflict of interest is not
automatically inevitable. The investigation found that there was no
conflict of interest in this circumstance.</hs_Para>

Mitchell:</Member></B> In fact, as the Minister pointed out earlier, Mr
Warnett was not appointed as a director, but the letter from Lloyds
specifically said that he was to be a non-executive director. On that
basis, he was received by the company and gave advice to create the
£2 million hole in the accounts.</hs_Para>

investigation was only a partial investigation of part of the
complaint. The complaint, which put three headings together, had to be
treated as a whole to show the conspiracy, but the ICAEW said that it
could 
<?notus-xml column=217?>not be treated in that fashion and that it would investigate only part
of it. That investigation was certainly far from thorough, because it
has left open the question of whether PwC could act for both the
company and the purchaser in the
administration.</hs_Para>

Swinson:</Member></B> As the hon. Gentleman is aware, Mr
Elliott was unhappy with the investigation and therefore also asked the
Insolvency Service to use its oversight role to review whether the
ICAEW had dealt with the case properly in its investigation of the
complaint. The Insolvency Service concluded that the ICAEW had adhered
to its complaints processes and that the finding of the investigation
committee was not unreasonable.</hs_Para>

seen the letter of engagement from August 2008 on the appointment of a
director, but whatever is in that letter, if somebody is to be
appointed as a director, a formal process must be undergone through
Companies House. That did not happen, so there was no status as
non-executive director, even if it was supposed to happen. The
investigation took place and was looked at by the Insolvency Service,
and that is where the powers we have get us to in this
circumstance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000059">I
am absolutely sympathetic. I understand the concerns of Mr Elliott and
the hon. Gentleman. It is important that those who deal with the
insolvency of a company are seen as independent, and I understand why
on this occasion there is not necessarily confidence that that was the
case. I stress to all insolvency practitioners that they need to look
long and hard at their position when they take on the administration of
a company, to see whether there is any potential conflict. They should
take appointments only where they feel that they are able to act with
independence.</hs_Para>

Gentleman placed the issues raised by the case in the wider context. It
is helpful to look more generally at what we are doing for companies
that find themselves in a similar situation. The Insolvency Service is
taking an increased interest in conflicts of interest. It is focusing
its oversight regulation work on the specific issue of insolvency
practitioner independence. When it goes out to monitor insolvency
regulators, it looks at how those regulators consider alleged conflict
of interest cases and whether the current code of ethics is robust
enough.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13111250000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000061">For example,
the Secretary of State recently wound up a number of introducer firms
that had inappropriate relationships with insolvency practitioners.
Creditors and complainants continue to express concerns about the
effectiveness of the regulatory regime for insolvency practitioners.
Stronger oversight powers would help to improve confidence in the
regime. We will therefore bring forward proposals, when we can find
time within the legislative programme, to strengthen the powers of the
Secretary of State as the oversight regulator.</hs_Para>

brings to mind issues more generally. Many hon. Members have expressed
significant concerns about the pre-pack process. In July, I announced
that Teresa  
<?notus-xml column=218?>Graham would be appointed to undertake an independent review of the
pre-pack procedure. The review is under way and is considering, among
other things, whether pre-packs provide value for creditors and how
confidence in the procedure can be improved. We have passed on the
concerns that Mr Elliott raised to the review team, as part of its
evidence-gathering process, so that it can look at a variety of
different cases where people have been worried about what has happened.
The review is expected to conclude by spring next year—in just a
few months’
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000063">The
Insolvency Service has also worked with the regulators to develop a
revised standard for pre-packs, known as SIP16—statement of
insolvency practice 16. It requires insolvency practitioners to provide
earlier and more detailed information to creditors about valuations,
marketing and the justification for a pre-pack.</hs_Para>

where there is evidence of abuse by an insolvency practitioner,
creditors can now use a new single complaints gateway. It is a single
point of access for complainants and therefore much easier to use,
given the fragmented regulatory regime with different regulators. It
will also make it easier for the Insolvency Service to oversee the
progress of complaints. Common sanctions guidelines have been
introduced by the majority of insolvency regulators, to create more
consistency in disciplinary
standards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000065">In
conclusion, I shall turn to the role of banks. Banks will undertake
reviews to assess the viability of a company for continued or enhanced
financial support. As a fundamental feature of our financial and
insolvency law, lenders that have valid security must be able to
appoint an agent, such as an investigating accountant, to protect the
value of that security. Banks also need to act responsibly and consider
the implications of any decision they ultimately take.</hs_Para>

Government recognise the problems there have been in the banking
sector, which have done a considerable amount to undermine
people’s faith in the banking system. We recently responded to
the report from the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards,
which marks the next step in the Government’s plan to improve
confidence and build a banking sector that upholds high standards of
ethics and professionalism. We will continue to strengthen standards in
banking, by working with the regulators to strengthen corporate
governance and ensure that firms have good systems in place to maintain
standards on ethics and culture. Such issues are
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111250000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111250000067">I

issues and are taking action.</hs_Para>

nuclear weapons programme poses the greatest threat to global security
that we face. Surprisingly, the issue is not being taken seriously
enough in Parliament, or indeed by the international community. All
eyes seem to be focused on Syria, Afghanistan or Somalia, when actually
the greatest risk of a global conflagration comes from Iran. Iran
simply cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. There are elements
within the regime who are mad and bad enough to use it, and their
target could be Israel, Saudi Arabia or any number of other countries
in the region or further afield. I contend that we must take the issue
far more seriously, and that the longer it goes unresolved, the greater
the risk that Iran will get a nuclear weapon or weapons and develop the
ballistic technology to project the weapon not only in the region but
further afield.</hs_Para>

state of Israel. He and I and others can agree or disagree about that
history, but the fact is that half the present world’s Jewish

safe in the world throughout the history of the Jewish

absolute horror. Ever since 1945, with a brief interruption for the
Cuban missile crisis, the assumption has been that nuclear weapons are
so horrible that they will never be used, but I think we could envisage
a situation in which Iran, if it had a nuclear warhead, might well use

religious divides than most of us in the House. In many respects, the
split between Protestants and Roman Catholics is similar to that
between Shi’as and Sunnis. The divides between Shi’a Iran
and Sunni Saudi Arabia date back centuries. If Saudi Arabia feels that

hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that the situation is not
just about Israel versus Iran; it is about Iran versus, frankly, the
rest of the world. That is yet another reason why the international
community simply cannot allow Iran to have nuclear weapons, because the
likelihood of its wanting to use them in future is simply too great.
That comes back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for New
Forest East (Dr Lewis). Iran’s horrible regime is far removed
from any process of democracy, and we can easily envisage circumstances
in the near, medium or distant future in which someone in authority in
the country might decide, “We have got a nuclear weapon. Let us
use it.” That is a frightening prospect, which puts our worries
about places such as Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia into the shade. It
is the big issue on which the international community must
concentrate.</hs_Para>

an expert on nuclear technology, but I have read enough to be convinced
that Iran does not want to develop nuclear technology simply to provide
power for its own people. It is hellbent on developing a nuclear
weapons programme. The Foreign Secretary confirmed to me on the Floor
of the House that the UK Government are convinced that Iran has
enriched uranium to at least 20%. That is way beyond the 3.5% needed
for civilian nuclear use, which suggests that the country is trying to
develop a military capability. My understanding is that uranium for use
in a nuclear warhead must be enriched beyond 90%, and although the gap
between 90% and 20% might seem large, in nuclear physics terms it is
actually quite small. Uranium enriched to 20% is more than half way to
weapons-grade uranium. One of the worries about the potential deal now
supposedly being negotiated in Geneva is that Iran might be left with a
stockpile of uranium enriched to 20%, which it could bank and use to
develop a nuclear warhead in the future. Any interim agreement that
allows the Iranians to hang on to their nuclear stockpile is not worth
having.</hs_Para>

if I am right—I hope I am not—and the Iranians want to
develop a nuclear warhead, such an agreement might give the Iranians
time to develop enough enriched uranium to make a nuclear warhead. An
interim agreement might, effectively, give the regime diplomatic cover

university and knows this country well, but he is not a pleasant
individual at all. It is not as though he has recently emerged with an
unblemished record; he has been deeply involved in the unpleasant
Iranian regime for quite some time. He was involved in the Islamic
revolution when it started in 1978, and he helped Ayatollah Khomeini
found the regime. Between August 2003 and October 2005, the now

Hollobone:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman speaks a great deal of sense
and makes some extremely pertinent points. I hope the Foreign Office
has taken note of his intervention. I suspect that, going back to the
1930s, the default position of the Foreign Office and the Ministry of
Defence is to try to arrive at an agreement to solve our problems
through international accord. Of course, all of us see a lot of sense
in that, but it must be stated in this case that no deal is probably
far better than a bad deal. A bad deal will not solve anything. In
fact, a bad deal will allow the Iranians under their present
leadership, with all the other people behind the scenes, to cross that
nuclear finish line. Once Iran has a nuclear weapon, the negotiating
stance of the Foreign Office and the international community will be
blown out of the water. This is our best chance to stop nuclear
proliferation in the middle
east.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111261000038"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Dodds" PimsId="2983" UID="13111261000274" xid="171" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111261000274">Mr
Dodds:</Member></B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that whatever the
merits of the argument about an interim deal giving Iran the time to
develop nuclear weapons, the issue is about Iran being allowed to
retain the capacity to do so? That is crucial, as is the easing of
sanctions. Surely one of the greatest issues for the Iranian regime is
the crippling effect of sanctions, and one of its main desires is to
ease that situation. It is estimated—I would be grateful if he
gave us more information about this—that the easing of sanctions
might be worth up to $20 billion to the Iranian regime, which is a
major motivating factor and a good one. Iran’s retention of the
capacity to develop nuclear weapons, rather than its willingness to do
so or its actually doing so, is the key
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111261000039"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Hollobone" PimsId="4744" UID="13111261000275" xid="858" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111261000275">Mr
Hollobone:</Member></B> The right hon. Gentleman’s powerful
intervention is absolutely right. I hope the Foreign Office is better
informed than I am and can give us the statistics. I am not sure,
however, whether sanctions have brought the Iranians to the table; I do
not know. It might well be that that is nothing to do with sanctions,
but is all a ruse for Iran to buy diplomatic cover. What do I mean by
that? If Iran can be seen to engage with the P5+1, it makes it much
more difficult for the Israelis to take out Iran’s nuclear
programme with military strikes. That is the point of the
rapprochement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111261000040">The
right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that any agreement, interim or
full, that allows the Iranians to retain their capability to make a
weapon—perhaps not now, but in the future—would be a bad
deal that was not worth having. From the perspective of Israel and
Saudi Arabia, and I hope ours, any capability left in Iran that enables
the regime or a future one to develop nuclear warheads should be
completely
unacceptable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111261000041">Iran

about which we should be very worried. In the next six months or so, we

say at the outset that I do not want the continuation of any wars in
the region of Iran. I want a process that will bring about disarmament,
so I approach the debate from that standpoint. I also approach it from
the standpoint of a representative of an inner-London constituency, in
which many Iranian refugees live. They form almost a timeline of the
political changes in Iran: there are refugees from the Shah’s
period, the Islamic revolution period and all the later regimes. The
human rights abuses of Persian Iranians as well as of Kurdish people
and others are very real to me and to the people in my constituency. I
am not unaware of Iran’s appalling human rights record and the
continuing executions that go on. Any pressure brought to bear on Iran
must be as much about a dialogue about human rights as anything
else.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111261000049">I
am acutely aware of the history and deep ignorance of Iran in the rest
of the world. Many think that Iran is part of the Arab world, which it
clearly is not, and 
<?notus-xml column=226?>many are simply unaware of the sense of anger there is at how Iran has
been treated by the west ever since the end of the first world
war.</hs_Para>

been the exploitation of Iranian oil by the Anglo-Iranian Oil
Corporation, which later became British Petroleum. Britain has made a
huge amount of money out of Iran over the decades. Likewise, the
coup—a UK and CIA operation—organised against the
Mossadegh Government in 1952 is remembered, and people are angry about
it. The support that we gave to the Shah, and that the Shah gave to BP,
resulted in a loss of national well-being.</hs_Para>

history of which we should not be unaware, and we must think about
those things. The Islamic revolution of 1979 was a product of an awful
lot of those issues and that pressure, including the appalling
behaviour of the SAVAK secret police under the Shah, which paralleled
the behaviour of the secret police under the Ayatollah after the
revolution. At the time, though, they were seen to be a step
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111261000052">Then
there was the Iran-Iraq war after the break with the USA, in which the
west supported Iraq against Iran. That terrible conflict cost the lives
of hundreds of thousands of people—possibly 500,000 people. It
was an utterly useless and ghastly war. I recall visiting the border
area between Iran and Iraq some years later and was taken to a
glorified scrap metal yard, which was in fact heaps of old planes,
tanks and armoured personnel carriers that bore the markings of every
arms manufacturer in the world bar none. The people of Iran and Iraq
have suffered a great deal.</hs_Para>

to the wish of Iran to develop its own nuclear power facilities. I do
not think that Iran or any other country should develop nuclear power
because it is an intrinsically dangerous form of power generation. I am
probably in a minority in the Chamber in having that position, but that
is my view. However, in law, Iran is certainly entitled to develop
nuclear power for peaceful use, although it is certainly not entitled
to develop nuclear weapons.</hs_Para>

on to the issue of whether Iran has nuclear weapons or the capability
or intention of having them. Along with the hon. Member for Wyre and
Preston North (Mr Wallace) and two others, I had an interesting
discussion with the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy
Authority in Vienna on behalf of the Iran group. It was a fascinating
experience. The inspectors confirmed that as of that time, Iran did not
possess nuclear weapons and was not in a position to make nuclear
weapons. It is important to make that clear.</hs_Para>

fatwa against nuclear weapons, imposed by the Grand Ayatollah, who said
that it would be un-Islamic to develop nuclear weapons or weapons of
mass destruction. Clearly then, there are many people in Iran who are
strongly opposed to the country having nuclear weapons. That is not to
say that there are not people there who support them; I am sure that
there
are.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111261000056">Iran
is, and has been for a very long time, a signatory to the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty. It is therefore open to inspection—not
necessarily under the voluntary or supplementary protocols, but
certainly within the terms of the mandatory part of the NPT. Every
other country in the region is a signatory to it except Israel, which
is the only one that possesses nuclear weapons; 
<?notus-xml column=227?>apparently, despite the Foreign Secretary’s unwillingness to
answer this question yesterday, it has 200 nuclear warheads, which is
rather more than Britain and France.</hs_Para>

non-proliferation treaty review conference envisaged a nuclear
weapons-free middle east and tasked Finland with setting up a
conference to bring that about. That conference did not take place,
and, at last year’s preparatory conference for NPT review in
Geneva, which I attended, we heard speeches from all the countries of
the region. There was universal anger that this nuclear weapons-free
middle east proposal had not been taken further forward.</hs_Para>

delegation—this was before the coup in Egypt—made it
clear that Egypt was extremely angry about that, and peremptorily
withdrew from the conference. As yet it has not completely withdrawn
from the non-proliferation treaty system. Other countries made it clear
that they were also extremely angry. It is quite obvious that unless
progress is made on a nuclear weapons-free middle east, which obviously
must include Iran and Israel, then clearly Saudi Arabia, Egypt and
others could start to develop nuclear weapons. If anyone has nuclear
power, it is not impossible for them to extend that into getting
nuclear weapons. We must be well aware of
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111261000059">Since
the election of President Rouhani, there has been a narrative that he
is a huge reformer and a liberal compared with everything that has gone
before. He is certainly different from previous Presidents; he has a
wish for a relationship and an understanding with the west, and I
suspect that he is feeding into the wishes of an awful lot of ordinary
Iranian people who also want to have a better relationship with the
rest of the world. I am no less aware than anyone else here of the
human rights abuses that have happened and continue to happen in Iran.
However, such considerations do not restrict British negotiations or
friendly relations with Bahrain, Saudi Arabia or many other places that
have totally appalling human rights records. We should be condemnatory
of human rights abuses wherever they occur across the whole
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0001.htm#13111261000060">The
non-intervention in Syria by Britain and the United States has had some
interesting effects. One is that within a few days of the decision
there were conferences with Lavrov and John Kerry. There was a serious
discussion about removing chemical weapons from Syria—and that
is now happening, which is good. There have been much more serious
discussions about getting a Geneva II process under way, which clearly
must involve Iran if it is to mean anything.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13111261000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000061">Surely we
should be saying to Iran that we do not want anyone to develop nuclear
weapons in the region, that we will push really hard on getting a
nuclear weapons-free zone conference to ensure that there is no
requirement on anybody to have nuclear weapons and that we will include
Iran fully in Geneva II. The rather strange insistence on the
acceptance by Iran of everything to do with Geneva I—it is not
clear what it does and does not agree with on that—should not be
used as an obstacle to getting the country involved. Clearly, if there
is to be a ceasefire and a long-term peace in Syria, it has to come
about with the involvement of Iran as well as of Russia, all the forces
in Syria, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and everybody else, otherwise the
implications of 
<?notus-xml column=228?>massive flows of refugees and the carnage in Syria just continue. The
danger then moves on to the possibility of a war with
Iran.</hs_Para>

negotiate with Iran. We must respect it and its culture, build a
relationship with it and recognise that it is still a signatory to the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The danger would be if it walked away
from that treaty and chose to develop nuclear weapons, because Saudi
Arabia would do the same and there would then be an arms race within
the region. Some rather zany commentators in the US think that Iran
should get nuclear weapons on the basis that it would create
a regional balance and then we would move on. Balancing nuclear weapons
terror is not a way to bring about peace.</hs_Para>

about, for instance, Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium being
among the considerations the negotiators must take on

news that the Foreign Secretary brought to the House yesterday about
progress in the negotiations, or the talks about talks, and about
Foreign Minister Zarif proving to be someone whom western powers could
do business with, was very welcome. We should reflect for a minute on
how far we have come in a year and a half. I was looking back on some
notes from May last year, and we were talking then about the risk of
strikes on Iran and of a regional war being sparked by preventive
strikes against Iran by the United States or by conflict breaking out
over the strait of Hormuz. The situation now is not quite
unrecognisable, but it has moved a considerable distance.</hs_Para>

change is the election in the summer of President Rouhani. We may think
that the electoral process was flawed, and we may think that the
constitution of Iran is flawed and still gives too much power to the
theocracy, but the election was undoubtedly genuinely contested, and it
has undoubtedly changed the political landscape. We must therefore be a
little wary of doing a reverse of the Whig interpretation of history:
nobody naively believes that things will always get better, but we must
never fall into the trap of thinking things can never get better. We
must take advantage of the situation when someone such as President
Rouhani is elected, because he is at least saying many of the right
things, and he appears to be acting in many of the right
ways.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13111261000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000068">In its
statements over the past six months on President Rouhani and the
situation in Iran, the Foreign Office has been very cautious and
guarded, and it has talked 
<?notus-xml column=229?>about actions speaking louder than words. I have sometimes found that a
little frustrating, and we could have seen a bit more enthusiasm for
the reforming faction in Iran. However, if I am criticising the Foreign

applaud the diplomatic efforts that have been made by British,
international and, in this case, European Union diplomats. I was struck
by the Foreign Secretary’s praise of Baroness Ashton in the

British tradition of diplomacy, but the potential for the European
Union to play a positive role in world diplomacy, not displacing, but
complementing, national diplomacy. That is very positive.</hs_Para>

three points I would like to make. The first builds on my point about
seeing the positive potential, rather than always accentuating the
negative. I would ask the Foreign Office to be robust not only in
pursuing the positive avenue of negotiations, but in standing up to
anyone we traditionally think of as an ally who might try to stall the
negotiations or prevent them from making too much progress.</hs_Para>

countries I am particularly concerned about. One is Saudi Arabia. The
Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, made an interesting
comment last month. He said that following Washington’s failure
to strike Syria and its entering into nuclear talks with Iran, there
would be a major shift in Saudi Arabia’s relations with it. I
would be interested to hear the Minister’s perspective on
American-Saudi relations and on our own relationships with Saudi
Arabia, in the context of the Iranian nuclear talks. I hope we will not
allow Saudi Arabia to stall our progress in this area.</hs_Para>

channel of this debate, I would tell the Saudi Government that if they
look back to the 1990s, to the presidencies of Presidents Rafsanjani
and Khatami in Iran, they will see that there were much more cordial
relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia. It has been only since the
election of Ahmadinejad in 2005 and then the coming to power of King
Abdullah that the two countries have got into a regional cold war and
have almost been fighting proxy battles as rival regional powers from
Bahrain to Syria to other places across the middle east. That is
regrettable, and they should perhaps realise that the presidency of
President Rouhani offers a path back to more constructive
engagement.</hs_Para>

point relates to what the hon. Gentleman has just said: this has to be
a regional process. I would therefore like to ask the Minister what the
status is of the proposed plan to move towards talks on a nuclear-free
middle east. That plan should include Israel as well as Iran. It could
be revived in the new, more constructive atmosphere that is emerging.
It might also connect with other disputes in the region. That plan was

Foreign Office thinks the talks now lie.</hs_Para>

final point relates to the non-proliferation treaty. It is something of
a rich irony that the E3 plus 3 could also be described as the N5 plus
1. Here we have six countries lecturing Iran on nuclear proliferation,
but five of them hold nuclear weapons themselves—only Germany
does not. It would send a positive signal if we discussed our own
willingness to look at the nuclear threshold. There are countries
around the world that have stopped short of it, even though, as in
Japan’s case, they probably have the technological capacity to
step over it. We are asking Iran to stop at the nuclear threshold or,
ideally, to step well back from it, so perhaps we should be
constructive in looking at whether we can step down the nuclear ladder;
indeed, it is technically our obligation as a signatory of the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty to look at progress towards disarmament. I
will not get sidetracked into a debate on Trident like-for-like
replacement, but the Liberal Democrat position is clearly that we could
make a constructive contribution in that regard. I do not expect
Ministers immediately to leap up to support that, but they should
perhaps reflect on what we can do as part of a global
process.</hs_Para>

the hon. Member for Kettering that the talks must be robust and real,
and that there must be a real negotiation that puts real demands on
Iran. However, at the same time, we should reflect on the fact that all
nuclear weapons are dangerous, and there are probably people in every
country who are mad or bad enough to use them. The ideal President
Obama has set out of a world free from nuclear weapons and of a global
nuclear disarmament process actually getting under way in the 21st
century is one we in this country should do everything 
<?notus-xml column=231?>we can to support through our fast-improving relations with Iran and

international community getting it all wrong, and have all the leaders

that the Iranian regime is determined to have nuclear weapons. We

not have them, that regime has demonstrated beyond peradventure its
aggressive intent in the region and throughout the world, through
the

Lebanon and Syria; through its involvement in propping up the Syrian

stage, and have not even concluded an interim agreement. Let
us not rush to say that there is agreement before it happens. We need

the Government can reach an agreement that leaves Iran nowhere near the
threshold of holding nuclear weapons, that rolls back the Iranian
nuclear programme and that creates a framework in which peace can be
achieved in the region, they deserve to be encouraged. They must have
high expectations and I encourage them to be rigorous and, if
necessary, cynical about the regime. In the past it has played for
time, stalled and tried to reach a certain level. Iran must go back to

weekend we honoured the dead of two world wars. It was the horror of
the first world war that led to a huge desire for peace and disarmament
in the decades that followed. During the 1920s and 1930s there were
disarmament conferences and complex negotiations leading to impressive
disarmament treaties, such as the Washington naval treaties. What
happened afterwards was instructive. The democracies observed the
treaties. The British Navy, for example, redesigned battleships such as
the Nelson and the Rodney in strange configurations, to stay within the
limits of the Washington naval treaties. The Germans had a much more
practical approach to the matter. They simply lied about the tonnage of
their battle cruisers, the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau, claiming to
stay within the treaty terms, but actually breaching them.</hs_Para>

therefore understand that, in disarmament negotiations and military
confrontations, what matters is less the weapons systems than the
nature of the Governments who possess them. An example of that is our
attitude to the nuclear weapons that Russia holds today, compared with
our attitude to nuclear weapons held by the Soviet Union. We were
desperately concerned about its nuclear arsenal, because the Soviet
Union was governed by a system with an aggressive ideology and a
ruthless approach to what it regarded as the inevitable confrontation
between communism and capitalism. Once the Soviet Union collapsed and
Russia turned, however hesitantly, in a more democratic direction, we
ceased to be anything like as concerned about its nuclear weapons
systems. We became concerned about whether such systems would leach out
of Russia into the hands of other totalitarian-inspired groups. We did
not mind so much what arsenal Russia possessed—and continues to
possess—provided that it remained in safe hands and not
extremist hands.</hs_Para>

the comparisons between Iran’s possession of a nuclear weapon
and Israel’s possession of a nuclear weapon are, frankly,
unfounded. As I said in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member
for Kettering (Mr Hollobone), whom I congratulate both on
securing the debate and on the way that he introduced it, we would be
concerned today about Israel’s nuclear arsenal if Israel were
governed by an extremist religious clique, and we would not be worried
about Iran having nuclear weapons to anything like the extent that we
are if Iran were as democratic as Israel is at present.</hs_Para>

all that, we have to operate within the boundaries of what is or is not
practicable. The reality is that if Iran chooses to acquire nuclear
weapons, unless some state or alliance of states seeks to intervene in
some military way physically to prevent it from doing so, Iran cannot
be stopped from acquiring nuclear weapons if it wants them enough. As
has been pointed out, Iran is signed up to the non-proliferation
treaty. I quickly conferred with my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre and
Preston North (Mr Wallace) and I think that we both agree that
ultimately if Iran chose to leave the NPT, frankly there would be
nothing that could be legitimately done to prevent it from acquiring
nuclear weapons, any more than anything could have been done to prevent
Pakistan from acquiring nuclear weapons in the way that it
did.</hs_Para>

refer to him as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington North (Jeremy
Corbyn), although we are on opposite sides of the argument. In his
contribution, I believe that he was trying to suggest that Israel
perhaps ought to give up its nuclear weapons and that that might
improve the situation, and he ended his speech by saying that he did
not believe that the balance of power, or the balance of terror, was
the right way to keep the peace in the middle east. I am afraid that I
disagree with him on both counts. I think that Israel giving up its
nuclear weapons—and Israel is not party to the NPT—would
actually encourage other countries to commit aggression against it. I
believe, however, that the possibility of the balance of terror may, in
the end, come to be our only resource against Iran, because—as I
said before —if Iran is determined to have nuclear weapons and
if it is more important to Iran to have nuclear weapons 
<?notus-xml column=234?>than, for example, to have the sanctions against it removed, Iran will
have nuclear weapons, unless somebody wants to launch a military strike
against it.</hs_Para>

conclusion, we lived through—what was it?—70
years or more of confrontation with the Soviet Union, and we survived
that period of intense confrontation through a policy of containment.
The containment policy meant that we neutralised the weapons systems of
the power that could potentially attack us, and we allowed the slow
development of internal political forces until that country’s
system of government changed. If ever there were a country that ought
to be subject to a policy of containment, it is Iran. Sometimes I get
the impression that the leaders of Iran are almost being deliberately
provocative, so as to incite some sort of military strike against it in
order to bolster their position with the population at home. I have no
doubt that if Iran can be contained for long enough, democracy will
emerge in the country and, as I said at the beginning, when democracy
emerges the question of what weapons systems a country has or does not
have becomes almost completely
irrelevant.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_12_PT_1/2755CB692A9815251251889F475F5BCBB89AC129" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="12 November 2013">Tuesday

start my remarks by saying, briefly, that there is a real certainty in
the debate that there is a nuclear weapons programme in Iran. However,
that certainty is not shared by the United States Government. The US
national intelligence estimate of 2007 said that Iran had halted the
programme, and in 2010 the US national intelligence estimate yet again
confirmed that Iran was not on the verge of breakout. These national
intelligence estimates are significant bodies of work, drawing on
intelligence from around the world and on the work of different
agencies, so we should not just brush them aside.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13111261000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000099">Secondly, a
country does not just jump from 20% to a nuclear weapon. The uranium
has to be weaponised, the grade of the uranium has to be increased and
the weapon must be tested, which would usually leave a very significant
footprint and take some time. If we take those facts in conjunction
with the US national intelligence estimate—and, indeed, with
some of the reports from the International Atomic Energy
Agency—we see that there is not such an urgency. Iran is not
suddenly going to produce a nuclear weapon. In addition, there is the
supreme leader’s fatwa that nuclear weapons are un-Islamic. I
have visited Iran and if anyone wants to understand the country they
have to understand its supreme leader. When the supreme leader says
that about nuclear weapons, he means it. It is absolutely imperative
that people follow that ruling.</hs_Para>

mean that there are not people in Iran who want a nuclear weapon; I
suspect that there are plenty of people there who wish to have one, for
the purposes of deterrence. If a sane-minded Iranian who represented
New Forest East was living in downtown Tehran, I suspect that he would
believe in the principle of deterrence, given that his neighbours are
Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. Those are sworn enemies of
Iran, ideologically different and religiously opposed—there are
all sorts of issues that we could say we faced in the cold war in the
late 1940s. Those differences are often brought home to Iran by the
terrorist attacks across its border. We should certainly remember that
the supreme leader—for now—has made that ruling, and that
it is not something to sniff
at.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000101">I
totally agree that the nature of the regime goes hand in hand with the
issue of nuclear weapons. Obviously, Iran’s record on human
rights is abhorrent. It has engaged in the persecution of the
Baha’is, the suppression of women’s rights and the
persecution of lawyers and of people who lead strikes, including bus
drivers who lead strikes and have their rights under the constitution
denied. It is very important that we do something to put pressure on
Iran about those issues and ensure that they are
resolved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000102">Let
us remember that the only democracy in the whole region, other than
Israel, is Iran. Iran’s democracy may not be one that we think
perfect, but it is a democracy that operates at all sorts of
levels—the guardian council, local councils and the mayor of
Tehran are all elected. Iran has an active democracy. There is no
democracy in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Syria or others of our
allies to whom we sell weapons systems around the world.</hs_Para>

democracy and a constitution in Iran. One of the reasons for the green
movement in 2009 was the desire among the Iranian people to follow the
rule of law. If someone reads the Iranian constitution, they will see
it is quite good, even though it was authored by a Belgian. One of the
reasons for the green movement was the demand that the denial of rights
to people should stop. Label someone a “terrorist” or a
“Zionist spy” and they do not have those rights. Well, we
live in a democracy that labels someone a “terrorist” and
they are then locked up for 90 days, without the same rights that they
would have if they were labelled a “criminal”. Iran is
certainly more extreme, but let us not forget that the temptation to
deny people their rights for all sorts of reasons is not just confined
to Iran.</hs_Para>

about security guarantees. It is a rough neighbourhood down
there—a very rough neighbourhood, with Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia. No one has mentioned the recent discovery that in Saudi Arabia
there is a ballistic missile launch-pad facility with two aiming marks:
one to Tel Aviv and one to Tehran. It is a rough neighbourhood and I
think that if I were there, I, too, might like to look out for
myself.</hs_Para>

of all this is trust, rhetoric and history. Let us not forget that
Iranians distrust the west as much as we distrust Iran. That is at the
heart of this process. Remember that we distrusted Gorbachev, but we
did not say that because he was from the Soviet regime—the
regime that was pulling people’s toenails out and torturing
them—we could not do business with him and we could not find a
solution. We did not write him off. I was involved with the peace
process in Northern Ireland in 
<?notus-xml column=236?>1994 with the right hon. Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds), who would
have been appalled by the people I had to meet in the course of trying

of Iran, the great game, the fact that the BBC World Service was used
in 1953 to trigger the coup against Iran’s only democratic prime
minister—if we were Iranian, we might be a bit suspicious of
western media, although now I think that would be wrong. Then there was
the grand bargain offered up in 2003, which was the demilitarisation of
Hezbollah, the offer to suspend enrichment of uranium and even a
movement to a Saudi recognition of Israel, which was dismissed out of
hand by the United States Administration.</hs_Para>

business, with this peace process and the process at Geneva, of trying
to build trust. We cannot indulge in rhetoric and history to rule that
out. We have to give it a chance. We are not stupid and we have all
been here before. No one has rose-tinted spectacles when it comes to
dealing with Iran; it is a straw man argument to say that we do. We

Kevan Jones</B> (North Durham) (Lab):</Member> First, I congratulate
the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr Hollobone) on securing this debate.
There have been five speeches in the debate, which is topical because
of the past week’s events in Geneva. My hon. Friend the Member
for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)—although we disagree on
nuclear weapons, I respect his position—made a thoughtful speech
that put the present situation in its historical context. The hon.
Member for Wyre and Preston North (Mr Wallace) recognised that much of
the suspicion in Iran is down to the history that our country and
others have in the region. That is important when we are looking at a
possible solution to nuclear weapons in the ongoing
talks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000109">The
hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) rightly raised the
possibility of proliferation throughout the region. He mentioned Saudi
Arabia and other nations that might wish to acquire nuclear weapons if
the Iranians were to develop their capability. I agree with much of
what the hon. Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis) said on nuclear
deterrents vis-à-vis this country, but I do not agree that if
Iran developed a nuclear weapons capability, it would somehow
offer  a balance of terror with Israel. The clear way forward
is to stop Iran developing that capability in the first
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000110">The
hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr Clappison) warned the Government not to
look at this process through rose-tinted spectacles, and I agree. No
one should look at the history or the actions of the present regime in
Iran and think that we are dealing with people who have not committed
atrocities on their own people or have not exported terror to other
parts of the middle east. When I was a Minister in the Ministry of
Defence, I was aware of the involvement of Iran in attacks on our
troops in southern Iraq and its support for insurgents against those
forces.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000111">We
on the Opposition Benches see Iran as a threat—if it acquires
nuclear weapons—not only to security in the middle east, but to
global security. A nuclear-armed Iran would not only change the balance
of power 
<?notus-xml column=237?>within the region, but, as the hon. Member for Cheltenham argued, it
would also lead to other nations wishing to acquire a nuclear
capability. Many of those nations have the funds to do that.</hs_Para>

gained a nuclear capability, that would be a blow to the United Nations
goal of a nuclear-free middle east. It would also be a step away and
against the goal that we all share of ensuring that new countries do
not acquire nuclear weapons. We in the UK and on the Opposition
Benches—well, some of us, anyway—are committed to the
retention of our nuclear deterrent, but it is important that we
encourage others and ourselves to reduce our nuclear weapon stockpiles.
Allowing the Iranians to have a nuclear weapons capability would be a
severe blow to that non-proliferation position, which I think all
parties in this country would want to protect.</hs_Para>

Opposition agree with the Government’s twin-track approach to
Iran, with the imposition of strict sanctions and the encouragement
through diplomatic channels to ensure that we can get an agreement that
ensures that Iran does not acquire a nuclear capability. Much has been
said this afternoon about the election of President Rouhani. I accept
the points that hon. Members have raised about him and some of the
atrocities that have been carried out by the Iranian regime. He stood
on a platform of reform, and the sanctions imposed by the international
community on Iran are having an effect on the Iranian community and the
Iranian people. It is important that we continue our diplomatic
efforts.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Islington North discussed the UK’s
diplomatic relations with Iran. I welcome the appointment of the
chargés d’affaires and hopefully we will see the embassy
in Tehran opening to commence that dialogue in the not-too-distant
future. That dialogue will be so important in steering the Iranians
away from developing nuclear weapons and in raising some of the points
about human rights and their support for terrorist
activities—both in the region and more widely—that have
rightly been
mentioned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000115">This
weekend’s talks were positive. It is a disappointment to us all
that the next step has not been taken, but, overall, we are moving in
the right direction and the Iranians are taking a more positive tone
and stance. I say to hon. Members, including the hon. Member for
Kettering, that there are two options. One is to allow the Iranians to
develop a nuclear capacity and take some type of military action
against them. The other is to have talks, to give Iran a chance to
disarm and to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons. Given what the
hon. Member for Wyre and Preston North said, that would be the
preferred option.</hs_Para>

is not an option. The Opposition support the continuation of strong and
tough sanctions while, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere said, not
looking at Iran through rose-tinted spectacles. We have to recognise
that the negotiations on ensuring that the Iranians give up their
capacity to develop nuclear weapons will be tough and hard. I wish the
Government and our international partners well in arriving at that
international settlement. It will make not only the middle east, but
the world, a safer
place.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_12_PT_1/EC4A20E15FF2F5D594B3D51985FB3AED50F27D07" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="12 November 2013">Tuesday

Robertson):</Member></B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for
Kettering (Mr Hollobone) on securing this debate at such an important
moment in the negotiations on the Iranian nuclear issue. I also

set the scene, it is worth saying three things. First, Iran has shown
over the course of recent months that it is genuinely taking a new
approach to negotiations. We need fully to test that and explore the
opportunity—I go no further than that at this stage—for a
deal. We believe there may well be a deal on the table that would give
us meaningful assurance on our immediate proliferation concerns and
create the space for a comprehensive
solution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000119">Secondly,
let me absolutely clear: there is no question of us seeing this issue
through rose-tinted spectacles. We approach this negotiation with our
eyes wide open. We are fully aware of Iran’s history of
concealment and its defiance of its international obligations. We will
continue to be firm in our approach to Iran on that and other issues.
Thirdly—this addresses a point raised by the hon. Member for
Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) and others—despite the fact that
progress on nuclear talks remains possible, we are not blind to
Iran’s nefarious activities in its immediate region and beyond,
or its terrible human rights record.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Kettering will take some comfort from what I
have just said. He was worried about the possibility of the talks
becoming a space in which the Iranians could continue to enrich. The
obvious point is that, without the talks, Iran will continue to enrich
anyway, so we might as well give the talks a chance. I cannot go into
the detail of the negotiations and the terms around which they revolve,
but clearly the basis of the deal is that Iran will take concrete and
verifiable action to address the international community’s
concerns about its nuclear programme, and the E3 plus 3 may consider
some measure of sanctions relief to offer in return. There will not be
a deal unless Iran ceases its enrichment
programme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000121">The
hon. Member for Islington North made the obvious point that human
rights in Iran remain in a terrible state, and we agree with him. The
negotiations in Geneva are purely about the nuclear file, and the hope
is that the twin-track approach of exchanging non-resident charges
d’affaires, and so on, will create preconditions that enable
progress to be made in other
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000122">The
hon. Gentleman asked the Foreign Secretary yesterday about the middle
east weapons of mass destruction-free zone, for which we argued during
the non-proliferation treaty review in 2010. There has been a small
amount of progress on that recently, and we hope to be in a position to
make an announcement in the near
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000123">The
hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) made three clear points.
The first was on the international relations dynamic. Tempting though
it is, it is not my position to comment on Saudi relations with the
United States. Perhaps it would be helpful if he considered that in the
context of Iran’s history of negative involvement across the
Gulf. There are many states beyond ours that 
<?notus-xml column=239?>are extremely suspicious of Iranian activities, and justifiably so.
There is concern across the wider Gulf—the concern in Israel is
often mentioned—about many of the worries raised this afternoon.
We already keep all our key allies in the Gulf fully briefed on where
we
are.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000124">I
hope I have answered the hon. Gentleman’s question on the
nuclear-free zone in the middle east. He mentioned disarmament here in
the United Kingdom, and I can do no better than repeat the comments of
the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones) by saying that we have a
slightly different view on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000125">My
hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr Clappison) talked
about our approach to the talks, and I hope I have reassured him on
that. The phrase “rose-tinted spectacles” has come up on
a number of occasions this afternoon, and there are no rose-tinted
spectacles in the Geneva talks. Everyone knows exactly what is
involved, the difficulties of what we are dealing with and the backdrop
against which we are trying to do this. On the other hand—one
only has to talk to the Foreign Secretary, who has met the regime on a
number of occasions in New York and Geneva, to get a feel for
this—there is a new feel to the talks. It is important that we
test that to see what can be achieved. If we are able to get over the
line, I doubt there is anyone anywhere in this Chamber who would not
agree that that is a good thing. The question is, to test Iran’s
resolve and to see what is achievable, but we must do so with our eyes

hon. Friend the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis) made a
good and thoughtful speech, as he always does, and he is absolutely

point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000127">My
hon. Friend the Member for Wyre and Preston North (Mr Wallace), the
co-chair of the all-party group on Iran, talked
about the importance of trust, which is a key component that he
compared to Northern Ireland. I remember someone saying to me some
years ago that, in relation to Northern Ireland,
the Government of the day were in about the right place if everyone was
marginally unhappy with them. I suspect that might be a principle that
applies here, too. He is absolutely right about the importance of
gaining trust. The hope is that, if trust builds during the
negotiations, it could translate into other affairs. He has the
Government’s approach in a nutshell—it is important to
take the opportunity seriously but to be realistic about what can be
achieved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000128">Finally,

most people know, the Foreign Secretary returned on Sunday from the E3
plus 3 negotiations in Geneva, which were the third round of talks
since President Rouhani’s election in June. The talks were
detailed and 
<?notus-xml column=240?>complex. They covered every aspect of Iran’s extensive nuclear
programme, and the Iranian negotiators were, as has been reported and
as the Foreign Secretary mentioned yesterday, tough but constructive.
The focus of the negotiations was to reach agreement on a first
step—this was the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for
New Forest East—that would create confidence and space to
negotiate a comprehensive settlement that resolves the Iranian nuclear
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000131">Talks
ended without that interim agreement because some key differences
remained between the parties. Disappointing though that was on one
level, it might comfort people to know that we are not running into the
talks with rose-tinted spectacles. The negotiations are tough and have
a long history, but the gaps are narrowing. At the conclusion of the
weekend, the E3 plus 3 Foreign Ministers presented a united position,

the conditions can be met, the Government are in favour of reaching an
interim agreement. As the Foreign Secretary told the House yesterday,
the agreement being discussed would have real benefits for global
security, but it needs to be detailed, clear and concrete. The
agreement also needs to assure all countries that the threat of nuclear
proliferation in Iran is being addressed and, therefore, it is crucial
that the agreement cover all aspects of Iran’s nuclear
programme. We believe that such a deal is on the table and is within
reach.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000133">Sanctions
have undoubtedly played an indispensable part in creating the new
opening. Sanctions are putting the Iranian leadership and the Iranian
economy under serious pressure. We think that the sanctions are costing
the Iranian economy at least $4 billion a month or $48
billion a year. There is no question of our relaxing the sanctions
pressure before we have taken action to address the proliferation
concerns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000134">It
is worth noting in passing that, while the talks are going
on—this goes to the centre of what my hon. Friend the Member for
Kettering said in his opening remarks—the Iranian nuclear
programme continues to advance. The most recent International Atomic
Energy Agency report of 28 August noted that Iran’s stockpile of
near-20% enriched uranium continues to grow. Iran has installed more
than 1,000 advanced centrifuges, which are capable of enriching at a
significantly faster rate, and there is also the heavy water research
reactor at Arak. All that represents a breach of the United Nations
Security Council and IAEA board resolutions and shows why, in the
interest of international security, we want the talks to
succeed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000135">Because
of the time, I will finish by saying that this afternoon’s
debate has revolved around two dynamics. There is a new opportunity to
do something, and I think everyone in the Chamber would agree that, if
that opportunity exists, we should take it. Rest assured that we are
going into the talks with our eyes wide open. We know what we are
dealing with. I do not think anyone is in any doubt that a deal will be
difficult to achieve, but such a deal would be in the interest of the
international

Henderson</B> (Sittingbourne and Sheppey) (Con):</Member> It is a
delight, Mr Sheridan, to serve under your chairmanship. Two years ago,
I took part in a general Westminster Hall debate and used it not only
to highlight some of the positive business developments that were
taking place in my constituency, but to set out a number of problems
with the local roads that needed to be solved if we were to attract
even more investment to the area. Those problems have not gone away,
and in some cases have got worse. I want to use my time today to repeat
some of my concerns about the road infrastructure in my
constituency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000139">In
many ways, the problem has been brought about by the success of
business in our area, which is ironic because the other side of the
same coin is that the very same problem could hold back future
investment. Sheppey has a major port that is used for the import and
export of thousands of cars every year, and we have the largest prison
population in the whole country. Eurolink in north Sittingbourne will,
when its current expansion plans are realised, be the largest
industrial and business park in the south-east. Morrison’s
regional distribution centre is also situated in Sittingbourne, and
next door is the largest paper mill in the United Kingdom. The thriving
Kent science park is in south Sittingbourne and is at the cutting edge
of life
sciences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000140">Those
success stories generate valuable employment, but also an increasing
amount of traffic that is threatening to overwhelm our local roads.
When I listen to BBC Radio Kent in the mornings to hear what traffic
problems I will face on my drive into London, the same motorways are
almost always mentioned: the M25, the M20, and the M2, as well as the
Dartford crossing. On the A roads, there is occasionally a
problem on the A2, the A20 and the A21, but one Kent road is mentioned
every morning without fail: the A249, which happens to be the main road
into Sittingbourne and Sheppey from the
M2.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000141">Anyone
who witnessed the horrendous multi-car pile-up on the Sheppey bridge a
few weeks back will appreciate the number of vehicles that use the A249
every day. Not only is it the only road off the Isle of Sheppey, it is
also the road used by the thousands of people who commute from
Sittingbourne. Traffic from the Eurolink industrial park, the
Morrison’s regional warehouse and the paper mill also feeds on
to the A249. That has created at least two major pinch points: one at
the roundabout at the junction between the A249 and the northern relief
road—I will come to that project in a moment—and the
other at the roundabout where the A249 meets junction 5 of
the M2. The latter is a particular problem because the congestion
created at the roundabout affects not only the slip roads from the M2,
but local roads.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13111261000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000142">The Kent
science park also creates congestion on local roads in south
Sittingbourne, which is another problem that needs to be resolved. The
owners of the park, with Swale borough council and Kent county council,
have plans for a link from the M2 at what would become junction 5A, but
they have been stymied by current Highways Agency restrictions on spur
roads from motorways. I wrote to the Minister’s predecessor
about the problem and received an assurance that his 
<?notus-xml column=243?>Department was reviewing that restriction. Is there any update on that?
I am keen to see that spur built because not only would it help to
relieve congestion on a number of roads in south Sittingbourne; it
could form part of what we hope will eventually become the southern
relief road.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13111261000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000143">That leads me
back to the northern relief road, which links the A249 to both Eurolink
and Great Easthall, which is a housing development north of the A2. The
problem is that the northern relief road has never been completed, so
it is not much of a relief to anyone. Obviously, local businesses on
Eurolink and the residents of Great Easthall want the final link to be
built as soon as possible, but many other people feel that finishing
the northern relief road without first building a southern relief road
would be a mistake because it would simply increase congestion on the
A2 and the number of vehicles using rural roads in villages such as
Bapchild, Bredgar, Rodmersham and Tunstall as rat runs to the
M20.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000144">I
have some sympathy with the latter view, which is one reason why I have
long held the view that a southern relief road is critical to
Sittingbourne’s long-term future. Not only would it open the way
to completion of the northern relief road, while protecting the
southern villages; it would help to reduce congestion on both the A2
and the
A249.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000145">Another
pinch point on the A249 is where it joins the A250 on the Isle of
Sheppey. Until it hits that junction, the A249 is a dual carriageway,
but thereafter it goes into a single lane all the way to Sheerness.
That part of the A249 is also the main road into Sheerness docks and we
desperately need the dual carriageway to be extended at least as far as
the eastern boundary of the docks to allow easier access. That would
allow a major expansion of the docks, thereby creating additional
employment in one of the most socially deprived parts of my
constituency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000146">There
is also a problem on Sheppey with the newly created A2500, which is the
main road link between the A249 and the eastern part of Sheppey. The
A2500 feeds into Minster, which is the largest community on Sheppey and
has seen the largest expansion of housing. Sadly, the junction at the
A2500 and Barton Hill drive, which is the main route into Minster, is
simply not fit for purpose and is seriously congested daily, all year
round. The A2500 is also the main road to the three prisons on Sheppey,
and ironically also feeds the main holiday camps on the island, so the
congestion increases still further during the
summer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111261000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/halltext/131112h0002.htm#13111261000147">The
Minister has kindly agreed to come to my constituency next year to open
a new logistics hub that, ironically, is being built
alongside the A249 and will no doubt add to the current traffic
problems at the Morrison’s roundabout. I wonder whether he would
agree to meet representatives from Swale borough council, and my local
business community on the same day to hear at first hand their concerns
about our local road
infrastructure.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_12_PT_1/B191FD5A7158853A273C7B2E469D743DBE4D24AF" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="12 November 2013">Tuesday

investment planning across the network and see greater collaboration
with local stakeholders to determine the nature, need and timing of
future investment that might be required on the network. We will

progress so far. The Highways Agency and the Department will use the

route-based strategies therefore provide an opportunity for
stakeholders to provide evidence about problems on the A249 trunk road

will certainly take my hon. Friend’s speech as part of that

such new infrastructure is essential for the delivery of the strategic
planned growth. I understand that Swale borough council may be bringing

development constitutes strategic planned growth, or whether a new

is also essential for economic growth. Nearly all journeys will start

Transport role, I visited Kent county council to see some of the
innovative technology it was using to identify how best to use that

to that funding, the Government have recently announced plans to create
a local growth fund from 2015-16 onwards. That fund, among other
things, will allow localities to prioritise infrastructure schemes that
are deemed essential for economic growth. Those schemes are expected to
include major road improvements on the local road network, such as the
type of relief road my hon. Friend referred to. That LGF pot will be
worth at least £2 billion a year until 2021. The fund will be
devolved to local enterprise partnerships across England, and Kent is
part of the South East local enterprise partnership. It is for the
South East LEP to identify its priority schemes for funding as part of
its strategic economic plan. I am sure my hon. Friend will want to make
the same representations he has made today to his local LEP to ensure

was called the “triangle of death” or “murder
triangle”, ended up being a network, able to source members in
the UDR or serving in the RUC—particularly in the part-time
reserve—at the time of its involvement in the paramilitary
activities. It was also able to source a lot of its weaponry in raids
in UDR armouries, one of which was a joint UDR-Territorial and Army

members can be regarded as dangerous extremists. One important (but
unspoken) function of the UDR is to channel into a constructive and

remembered that some convictions were obtained for all 11 subsequent
murders committed with that submachine gun, unlike many of the other
murders committed by the Glenanne gang. Those convicted included a

officer. That UDR weapon’s 10 other victims included Peter and
Jenny McKearney, an elderly couple shot dead at their farmhouse near
Moy on 23 October that year; Michael Donnelly, 14, Patsy Donnelly, 23,

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Anna
Soubry):</Member></B> It is a pleasure, as ever, to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr Sheridan. I congratulate the hon. Member for Foyle
(Mark Durkan) on securing the debate. He raised a serious
issue that has been the subject of much comment over a considerable
period of time. In recent weeks, the allegations that members of the
security forces were part of a murderous gang that killed more than 100
people in the 1970s have been given further currency in the recently
published book to which the hon. Gentleman has referred.</hs_Para>

doubt that the hon. Gentleman has raised some points that I will not be
able to address in my speech. I apologise for that, but I assure him
that I will write to him with responses to as many as possible of those
questions. The hon. Member for Belfast South (Dr McDonnell) mentioned
the records at Kew, and I am told that those records have been made
available to researchers and feature heavily in the book “Lethal
Allies”.</hs_Para>

Member for Foyle will be aware that such serious allegations should
properly be dealt with by the police, so I can say little about them.
It is right and proper for me to condemn all sectarian attacks, by
whomsoever they may have been carried out, but I cannot comment on the
accuracy or otherwise of the allegations, and it is not for the
Ministry of Defence to usurp the function of the police by seeking to
carry out investigations about those who may have been involved. As I
understand it, the historical enquiries team have investigated several
cases associated with the Glenanne gang, but I am not aware that those
investigations have led to any fresh allegations of specific criminal
activity by soldiers that are to be investigated further. Of course, 
<?notus-xml column=253?>if such evidence were found and given to the police, it would be for
them to decide whether any further inquiries should be made. If they
decided to pursue the matter, my Department would provide every
assistance to any subsequent
investigation.</hs_Para>

to me, as it will be to most Members here today, that during the long
period that we refer to as the troubles, terrible crimes and atrocities
were perpetrated by extremists on both sides of the community. The
account by the hon. Member for Foyle of a number of terrible murders
and killings brought back to me large chunks of my childhood. It is
easy to forget that 40 years ago, such events were almost a
feature of life. Here  we are, 40 years on, enjoying a period
of peace that we could not foresee within our own lifetimes. There were
incidents of great tragedy when members of the community were
innocently and accidentally caught up in events that led to serious
injury or death.</hs_Para>

allegations have been made about the armed forces’ role in
various cases involving violent deaths during the troubles, which
remain unsolved. As I have said, such allegations must be investigated.
At the same time, however, it is only right for me to make the point
that some of these allegations may well be untrue. The truth can be
uncovered only by painstaking and professional investigation. Although
I am aware of the criticisms that have been made of the historical
enquiries team of the Police Service of Northern Ireland—that is
not a matter for me, of course—I pay tribute to the work they
have done in carrying out this necessary task over a period of several
years.</hs_Para>

Durkan:</Member></B> The Minister has made the point that some of the
allegations against individuals may be untrue, but does she accept that
the documentation shows that the Ministry of Defence knew one thing in
private but told an entirely different story in public? Does she accept
that the evidence points to the fact that the MOD dismissed the
concerns that were being legitimately expressed by Members of this

Governments?</hs_Para>

Soubry:</Member></B> I am in danger of repeating myself, but those are
matters for the police to investigate. It would not be appropriate for
me to comment. Those matters should be investigated thoroughly,
honestly and vigorously by the police. It is not my Department’s
intention to shy away from acknowledging or apologising when genuine
mistakes or errors have been made, or where, as a Department, we have
failed in our obligation properly to manage our activities in Northern
Ireland. We know from the conclusions reached by Sir Desmond de Silva
in his review of the circumstances leading to the murder of Pat
Finucane that the Ministry of Defence made important failures in
managing important aspects of our intelligence operations during the
mid to late 1980s. Some reports have suggested that that situation may
have prevailed for several years. We know, for example, that some
members of the security forces bore responsibility for the leaking of
some sensitive intelligence information to loyalist organisations.
Indeed, there have been convictions as a result, and rightly so. We
also know that Army weapons, as the hon. Member for Foyle has
described, have been stolen from military establishments and used in
terrorist attacks by loyalist gangs.</hs_Para>

were totally unacceptable and should never have occurred. Equally,
however, attempts to claim that such practices were endemic throughout
the security forces serving in Northern Ireland are, in our view, quite
unsubstantiated. Sir Desmond goes into great detail on the matter in
his report, which was based on unhindered access to the archives of the
police, the Army, and the Security Service. He shows, to my mind
incontrovertibly, that the actions of the security forces frustrate
loyalist terrorists and significantly reduced their operational
capacity in Northern
Ireland.</hs_Para>

Durkan:</Member></B> I want to assure the Minister and anyone else who
may be concerned that in pointing to the seriousness of the allegations
and the fact that they are supported by MOD documentation, I do not
want in any way to traduce or hurt the memory of many other members of
the security forces, including those of the Ulster Defence Regiment,
who served with honourable motives and who believed that they were
serving their community. They were let down every bit as much as the

Soubry:</Member></B> I absolutely agree that we must pay tribute to the
majority of those individuals who served in the way that the hon.
Gentleman has described. As the Minister with responsibility for
veterans, I feel strongly that we owe the security forces who served in
Northern Ireland a great deal of gratitude. The vast majority served
with courage, fortitude, integrity and dignity, risking their lives to
bring about the conditions that eventually enabled a process to take
place that allowed the people of Northern Ireland to lead peaceful
lives without fear for themselves or their families. Northern Ireland

breach rate of 58% for antisocial behaviour orders shows that
enforcement alone is not effective at stopping antisocial behaviour.
Importantly, the new injunction will give the court powers to include
positive requirements to address the underlying issues that may be
driving an individual's behaviour. That notwithstanding, the injunction
will have serious penalties on breach—including imprisonment for
adults and, as a last resort, for
under-18s.</hs_Para><TableWrapper Columns="1" Size="8"><table tabstyle="headft"><tgroup cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="25*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="25*"></colspec><colspec colname="3" colwidth="25*"></colspec><colspec colname="4" colwidth="25*"></colspec><thead><row><entry nameend="4" namest="1" rowsep="1"><hs_TableTitle Justify="centre"><I>Total

countries in Africa and the middle east have prohibited FGM/C by law or
constitutional decree. Two of them—South Africa and
Zambia—are not among the 29 countries where the practice is
concentrated. With the exception of Guinea and the Central African
Republic, where bans on FGM/C were instituted, in the mid-1960s, the
process of enacting legislation or revising the criminal code to outlaw
the practice only began to take hold in Africa quite recently.
Legislation prohibiting FGM/C has also been adopted in 33 countries on

the psychological effect created by Air Power, it is sometimes possible
to deter potential adversaries and avoid bloodshed altogether. No
specific study has been conducted by the Ministry of Defence into the
psychological effects of using RPAS and indeed, it would be difficult
to measure such effects quantitatively. However, empirical evidence
based on observation and post-operational reporting suggests that the
presence of an aircraft (manned or remotely piloted) modifies the
behaviour of insurgents such as the Taliban. When aircraft are present,
notable reductions in insurgent activities (such as the emplacement of
improvised explosive devices) are observed with a consequent reduction
in the threat to both military personnel and civilians.

Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 as amended, which sets the
conditions under which the lamps may be used. Modern vehicles are
designed to help prevent drivers inadvertently leaving the rear fog
lamps illuminated; such as automatically switching off when all other
lamps are extinguished and then to remain off until deliberately
switched on again. Alternatively an audible warning may be given if the
driver leaves the vehicle with the rear fog lamps
illuminated.</hs_Para>

health had the strongest association with all the measures of personal

contentment with their current situation also seem to be related to
their levels of personal well-being. For example, it is not just about
having a job that matters to personal well-being, but also being
content with that job. Permanent employees who wanted a different or
additional job had lower levels of life satisfaction, feelings that
things were 
<?notus-xml column=601?>worthwhile, ratings of happiness and increased levels of anxiety on
average than those that didn't want a different or additional job.

Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) through quarterly
performance meetings with its chair and chief executive. Performance
has been improving steadily over recent years, for example 99.8% of
live cases nationally now has an allocated guardian, up from 93.1% in
2009/10. CAFCASS is also meeting all its key performance indicators
(KPI).</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111282001271" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/text/131112w0003.htm#13111282001271">It
is important to maintain the drive towards improvement, and I have

the behaviour and safety of pupils. Within the leadership assessment,

life in modern democratic Britain and a global society, as well as the
effectiveness of safeguarding arrangements at the school. In assessing

Laws:</Member></B> The Secretary of State for Education, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), has overruled the
Schools Playing Fields Advisory Panel only once since September 2012.
This was an application by Warwickshire county council to dispose of
land at the former Griff Special School, Nuneaton, Warwickshire. The
panel did not object to the actual loss of this unused playing field,
but highlighted specifically that any potential proceeds of sale would
be lost to sport or educational investment, as the land was to be
'peppercorn' leased to a charitable housing association to provide
housing for senior citizens. Acting directly upon the advice of the
panel, the Secretary of State made this disposal conditional on
Warwickshire county council investing a sum equal to the value of the
land into education or sport, from funds not ring-fenced for education.
The former school has been closed for eight years and the playing field
land has not been used by a local school or the wider community in this
time. Sport England did not object to the council's planning
application and at consultation there were no objections to the loss of
the unused playing field. Details of this decision were published on
the Department's website in
July.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13111282000136" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/text/131112w0004.htm#13111282000136">Sick

A FCE is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one
consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against
the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of
different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care
within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same
year.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>2. Number of episodes with a main
or secondary procedure: The number of episodes where the procedure (or
intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 procedure fields in a HES
record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the
procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record.
Note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or
secondary procedure. For example, patients undergoing a
“cataract operation” would tend to have at least two
procedures—removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new
one—counted in a single
episode.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>3. Patients resident in

indicates one of the last diagnoses that a particular patient was being

Ellison:</Member></B> The policy of this Government is that the
configuration of health services across England, including critical
care and non-specialist paediatric services, is driven by the local
national health service. Local commissioners and clinicians are best
placed to ensure that services meet the needs of their local
population, and to consider where changes might be necessary in order
to best meet those needs now and in the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13111283002326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131112/text/131112w0005.htm#13111283002326">All
proposals for change are subject to proper and public scrutiny by local
authorities, whose health and overview scrutiny committees should work
closely with the local NHS throughout the process. These scrutiny
committees also have the ability to refer an NHS proposal for change to
the Secretary of State for Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for
South West Surrey (Mr Hunt), for a final

Stafford, Trust Special Administrators have been appointed to Mid
Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust to develop a plan for the continued
provision of services. It is expected that the administrators' final
report will recommend changes to the way in which services are
provided. The special administration regime is intended to provide a
time limited framework for resolving problems at a significantly
challenged rust. However the process also ensures that there is
appropriate input from local stakeholders and the public as service
proposals are developed.</hs_Para>
